As the world becomes more interconnected through digital means, a potential \"fifth domain\" for conflict has emerged in the cyber realm (Murphy 2010), inviting scholars to debate the nature of cyber attacks, cyber espionage, and disinformation campaigns as \"cyber warfare\" (Rid 2012). With the emergence of cyberwar as a key buzzword in political and academic spheres, the question of how to resolve cyber conflicts shifts the focus to negotiation theory.\n\nAnalysis of cyber conflict presents a challenge to the prevailing negotiation concept, ripeness theory. Ripeness theory posits that the timing of a negotiation stems from the conflicting parties' perception of a \"mutually hurting stalemate\" (MHS) and \"a way out\" of conflict through dialogue (Zartman 2000). While this theory has shown merit for negotiations related to conventional warfare or economic disputes, there are gaps in its applicability for resolving cyber conflict. Specifically, the concept of a \"hurting stalemate\" has little to no presence in cyber disputes, rendering MHS incompatible with pure cyber negotiations. As such, redefining mutually hurting stalemate for cyber conflict is paramount to address this discrepancy.\n\nThis analysis attempts to adapt prevailing negotiation theory for conflicts in the cyber domain. First, an overview of what constitutes cyber conflict is provided, the state of its norms and regulations, and the uncertain nature of cyberspace. Second, an analysis of ripeness theory in conventional and cyber conflict highlights the current gaps in negotiation literature when applied to an evolving form of conflict. Third, redefining the idea of MHS by suggesting an alternative, \"mutually harming standoff,\" offers an examination into the timing discrepancy surrounding cyberspace agreements. Lastly, examining the 2015 bilateral US-China Cybersecurity Agreement provides context for applying this hypothesis and demonstrates how accepted negotiation theory may be applied to cyber conflict.\n\n# Defining Cyber Conflict: Terms, Norms, and the Rise of Uncertainty\n\nThe definitions of \"cyber conflict\" or \"cyberwarfare\" are a source of contention throughout the international community. There is a lack of shared understanding for terms related to cyberspace, with some scholars arguing that the preoccupation with cyber warfare has little merit. While some governments, academics, and media outlets overemphasize the threat of a \"cyber Pearl Harbor,\" these warnings are more speculative and extreme than reality would suggest (Singer &amp; Friedman 2014: 68).

Offensive cyber exchanges in the digital realm have exacerbated international tensions between technological powerhouses such as the United States, Russia, and China, and developing consensus on the broader idea of “cyber conflict” is pertinent to establishing a new approach to diplomacy on the issue of cyberspace. For this article, we will adopt a broad definition of “cyber conflict” to include information operations between two or more entities that intentionally undermine the economic, political, social, or security systems of states, businesses, and organizations. This definition incorporates such concepts as “cyber espionage,” “disinformation campaigns,” “cyber sabotage,” and “cyberterrorism,” representing tactics initiated or sponsored by states (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015).\n\nExamples of cyber conflict include the continuous use of cyber operations or the means through which states conduct cyber attacks against the same entity over time. These conflicts are reciprocal, characterized by tit-for-tat cyber exchanges between countries, and may also employ non-cyber means in an effort to deter future attacks, such as sanctions or public condemnation. Cyber conflict includes the use of advanced persistent threats (APTs) to spy on corporate activities or the development and deployment of malicious software to cause physical damage to infrastructure. Cyber operations may use an array of cyber weapons, from the application of botnets in distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks that shut down government websites to the creation of Trojans and backdoors, which infiltrate and sabotage computer networks (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 34). These parameters highlight the scope of the issues and features that shape cyber conflicts and the ambiguities surrounding their nature.\n\nConversely, this definition does not include small-scale “cybercrime,” which tends to be a for-profit enterprise that does not center on ideology or political gain (Singer &amp; Friedman 2014: 145–155). It also does not include attacks perpetrated by individuals or non-state-sponsored criminal organizations since these efforts more often constitute “cybercrime” and are one-off rogue actions intended to cause chaos or malice rather than achieve policy goals (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 33). Lastly, the article focuses on “pure” cyber conflict, thus dismissing incidences of cyber attacks as part of larger military campaigns or hybrid warfare. While negotiations on conventional conflicts may address concerns relating to cyberspace, kinetic wars are characterized differently from cyber conflicts, as discussed later in the article.\n\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8–36",

            "markdown": "RIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\n\n# Cyber Norms and Consensus\n\nDisagreements over what constitutes cyber conflict impact the establishment of international norms for addressing cyber operations. Numerous arrangements have attempted to codify norms for regulating cyberspace and expanding international law to include the digital domain. The Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare is one effort to establish consensus on cyber conflict. This document, first published in 2013, attempts to apply existing international law to cyber conflicts while defining \"cyber attacks\" and \"cyber self-defense\" (Schmitt 2017). However, the Tallinn Manual has no legal standing, and many countries have rejected the arguments it presents (Singer &amp; Friedman 2014: 206). As a result, binding consensus on how states should govern and regulate cyberspace remains indefinite and allows for multiple interpretations of what justifies an attack.\n\nOther efforts to establish norms in cyberspace involve international processes to develop standards of conduct in the cyber realm. Since 1998, motions to formulate cyber arms control treaties and propagate agreements on cyber governance have shaped international agendas (Ruhl et al. 2020). From intergovernmental institutions like the UN to think tank-led working groups, numerous negotiations and dialogues have been under way to improve the stability and security of cyberspace. These initiatives include ongoing fora such as the UN Group of Governmental Experts (UN GGE) and the UN Open-Ended Working Group (UN OEWG), both aimed at developing interstate cyber norms and applying international law to cyberspace (Ruhl et al. 2020). Other efforts include the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace, a coalition of cybersecurity experts that promotes specific cyber norms, and the Paris Call, a \"multistakeholder initiative led by the French government and supported by Microsoft,\" which seeks to mainstream cyber norms outside of interstate dialogues (Ruhl et al. 2020: 11).\n\nThe credibility of their participants legitimizes these formats, whether it is the legitimacy of the UN process or the inclusivity of multiple stakeholders, such as businesses, think tanks, and non-profits, in building standards for cyberspace (Ruhl et al. 2020). However, Ruhl et al. note that these efforts are constrained due to four factors. For one, the evolving nature of cyberspace impedes the development of sustainable norms, and the presence of multiple actors with varying interests inhibits the regulation of norm adherence in cyberspace. Second, states' cyber activities are often secretive and unknown, thus obstructing the implementation of international standards for cyberspace. Third, disagreement between great powers on cyberspace norms can frustrate agreements. For example, Russian and Chinese demands for greater state sovereignty in cyberspace are countered by the US' assertion for free and\n\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36",

In contrast, \"states with significant cyber capabilities seem ready and willing to employ them to advance their interests,\" presenting an incentive for states to dismiss norms or limit their scope of adherence (Ruhl et al. 2020:17). Therefore, the multilateral fora for establishing cyberspace norms currently faces significant limitations in their effectiveness, generating a high level of uncertainty in the domain of cyberspace.\n\n## Uncertainty in the Digital Realm\n\nThe uncertain nature of cyberspace and norms creates difficulties for dispute resolution. Unlike conventional conflict, where risks, calculations, and capacities are known in an exercise of \"control power,\" cyber conflict occurs in a realm of uncertainty, potentiality, and improvisation (Katzenstein &amp; Seybert, 2018). The \"fog of uncertainty\" (Katzenstein &amp; Seybert 2018: 36) limits states' abilities to know how cyberspace will evolve, who the actors are, and what their capabilities may entail, thus preventing states from assessing the long-term ramifications of a cyber attack's impact. The nebulousness of cyberspace results not in deterrence but in restraint, which Valeriano and Maness (2015: 54) describe as a \"policy outcome but not necessarily a process\" for states' limited use of cyber tools. Therefore, this restraint is a consequence of the ambiguity and insecurity characterizing cyberspace, suggesting that certainties regarding states' intentions and cyber capabilities are unattainable, thereby reducing the risk of escalation in cyber conflict.\n\nEscalation represents an \"increase in the intensity of a conflict and in the severity of the tactics used in pursuing it\" (Maiese 2003) and is crucial to the perception of ripeness in conflict. However, states' restraint in using cyber tools impedes the prominence of both escalation and ripeness in cyber conflict, a discrepancy which will be addressed in the next section. The uncertainty of cyberspace and the limitations of cyber norms results in weak perceptions of states' digital activities. The vagueness of cyberspace is an impediment to determining what should be negotiated, let alone when negotiations should be conducted. Analyzing the concept of \"ripeness\" in cyber conflict will answer the question of when states should negotiate on matters of cyberspace.\n\n## Overview of Ripeness Theory\n\nAs previously stated, Zartman's \"ripeness theory\" presents a condition for the timing and beginning of negotiation (2001). Ripeness is a perceptual event that\n\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36",

Zartman defines MHS as the moment when \"parties find themselves locked in a conflict from which they cannot escalate to victory and this deadlock is painful to both of them\" (2008). This deadlock may be depicted as a plateau, a stalemate where the costs of continuing the violence outweigh the benefits, with both parties suffering from the ongoing conflict. Similarly, a catastrophic event, or a precipice, may threaten or have influenced perceptions of the conflict and impart a stalemate. To quote Zartman (2001: 8), \"the catastrophe provides a deadline or a lesson indicating that pain can be sharply increased if something is not done about it now.\" Upon the perception of an MHS, both parties recognize that the probability of unilaterally winning the conflict is decreased, making the stalemate more foreboding.\n\nIn response to the perception of a stalemate, the conflicting parties may attempt to seize the moment by pursuing a \"way out\" of the conflict, sustained by an MEO (Zartman 2008), through negotiation. Zartman's theory is displayed in Figure 1, which demonstrates the push and pull factors that lead to the decision and commitment to negotiate.\n\nIt should be noted that ripeness is merely a condition for encouraging states to negotiate an end to the conflict, one that is \"necessary, but not sufficient\" (Zartman 2001: 9). As such, the propensity for success in cyber negotiation is not guaranteed in seizing the ripe moment for dialogue. Analysis of ripeness theory's application in conventional and cyber conflict demonstrates how the concept of a stalemate leads (or does not lead) to the perception that the timing is suitable for negotiation as an alternative to continued fighting.\n\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\nFIGURE 1 Elements of conventional ripeness theory and the process of negotiation ADAPTED FROM ZARTMAN (2000: 230, 242)\n\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36",

            "markdown": "POLK\n\n# Ripeness and Conventional Conflict\n\nIn kinetic warfare, ripeness theory holds merit. Conventional conflict may be escalated and then plateaued, as defined by an MHS, thus presenting an opportunity for seeking a way out through negotiation. Zartman (2008) illustrates this by stating that \"to ripen a conflict one must raise the level of conflict until the stalemate is reached and then further until it begins to hurt – and even then, work toward a perception of an impending catastrophe as well.\" This captures the idea behind MHS – a perceived stalemate must be generated for both sides, with the parties incurring unsustainable or unbearable costs in the long run even when there is no prospect for further escalation. Brahm illustrates the role of MHS as a tipping point or push-factor towards negotiation by depicting conventional conflict as a cresting wave (see Figure 2). After the emergence of the conflict, continuous escalation of hostilities leads to or threatens an impending catastrophe, the precipice of the wave at which point an MHS has occurred (Brahm 2003). If the MHS is perceived, it may push the parties towards de-escalation and negotiation, and confidence-building measures and the perception of an MEO can pull the parties closer toward an agreement and the end of the conflict (Brahm 2003).\n\nIn conventional conflict, weaponry and strategic maneuvers are useful in this pursuit of a stalemate since conventional weaponry varies in scale, targeting, and scope of damage. For example, during the Bosnian War, NATO's use of cruise missiles and stealth planes in \"Operation Deliberate Force\" destroyed 338 Serbian targets. The Bosnian Serbs perceived the use of US Navy Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles (TLAMs) and F-117 bombers as a major escalation by\n\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)\nFIGURE 2 Stages of conflict\nADAPTED FROM BRAHM (2003)\n\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36",

By employing weaponry or strategy, practitioners in conventional conflict are able to achieve a stalemate by escalating the hostilities on the ground. Therefore, the role of escalation is integral to achieving MHS since it results in perceptions “that there has been a significant qualitative change in the conflict as a result of the new development” (Morgan et al. 2008: 9). When both parties escalate to unattainable levels, the conventional conflict plateaus while the sides experience mutual hurt.\n\nThese conflicts are then considered ripe for negotiation, and the moment may be seized to initiate negotiations and resolve the conflict. Examples of ripeness theory in kinetic conflict have been perceived in the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah War, the Yugoslav Wars in the 1990s, and the Angolan Civil War (Schrodt, Yilmaz &amp; Gerner 2003; Touval 2002: 167; Zartman 2000). In these cases, military escalation of conflict or mediator-induced perceptions of MHS pushed parties to commit to dialogue processes (Touval 2002; Zartman 2000). As such, ripeness theory has strong applicability in cases of conventional conflict.\n\n## Ripeness and Cyber Conflict\n\nIn contrast, cyber conflicts do not have the same characteristics as conventional warfare. Cyber operations are not inherently escalatory, and using cyber means to intensify a cyber conflict to the point of ripeness is improbable. For one, states view cyber operations as de facto “escalatory offramps,” or alternatives to costly kinetic conflict that still signal state displeasure or aim to influence rivals’ behavior (Jensen &amp; Valeriano 2019: 2). As such, decision-makers are often inclined to use cyber operations as an extension of foreign policy because they are not escalatory. If faced with increased tensions with rival governments, states have displayed a preference for choosing cyber responses as a form of “sub-crisis maneuvering” or exit from heightened conflict (Jensen &amp; Valeriano 2019: 4).\n\nA 2019 survey of US, Russian, and Israeli civilians further demonstrates this perspective that cyber conflict is non-escalatory. In this study, respondents in all three countries showed a general preference for non-escalatory responses to cyber attacks in scenarios where the victim state had the capacity to respond with an in-kind cyber weapon (Jensen &amp; Valeriano 2019: 6). Respondents from Russia voted in favor of de-escalatory responses to cyber attacks, while citizens from the US and Israel most often favored proportional responses to the initial attack (Jensen &amp; Valeriano 2019: 7). All three countries had low responses expressing a preference for escalation against a cyber attack. These findings express a tendency to view cyber conflict as a non-escalatory domain (Jensen\n\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36",

The real-world examples of the 2015 and 2016 attacks on Ukrainian power grids capture this. In these events, the BlackEnergy 3 and Crashoverride malware, respectively, targeted energy companies or transmission substations resulting in the disruption of electricity supply to nearby consumers. These attacks had limited impact, lasting between one to six hours before restoring full operations (Todros 2018), reflecting the low-intensity, high-manageability of the attack. Yet, the most notable feature of these attacks concerns Ukraine's response. First, Ukraine and allied countries largely attributed both attacks to a hacking group connected to Russian intelligence services (Greenberg 2017), but this has not been proven. This demonstrates an attribution problem that highlights the uncertainty typical of cyber attacks and prevents rapid, escalatory responses of any form. In other words, given the lack of certainty regarding the perpetrator of the cyber attack, decision-makers were impeded in their ability to execute timely and sufficient responses akin to escalation through either digital or kinetic means. Second, even when members of the Ukrainian government condemned Russia for the act, no offensive response, either kinetic or in-kind, was taken (Greenberg 2017). These cases show that even cyber attacks impacting critical infrastructure have low-escalatory potential, a trait that is especially unique when linked to the ongoing geopolitical tensions that shape Russian-Ukrainian relations outside the digital realm. As such, cyber conflicts cannot easily demonstrate escalatory potential using digital means.\n\nFurthermore, Borghard and Lonergan (2019; 125-138) argue that cyber operations are \"poor tools of escalation\" for four reasons: they are time-consuming to develop, they have a limited impact on the victim state, states have countervailing tradeoffs in using cyber tools, and there are few appropriate cross-domain responses to cyber attacks. First, developing retaliatory cyber tools is time-consuming (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 125). In the event of a cyber attack, a state or institution may not have immediate access to the digital tools required to launch a counteroffensive. According to Borghard and Lonergan (2019: 125), \"offensive cyber operations deliver effects against targets through exploiting a vulnerability to gain access (through an attack vector) to a target's network or system.\" This backdoor access would need to be pre-installed and ready to act on for a timely counterattack to work; without this preset, any response would be time-consuming and miss the opportunity to escalate the conflict. If a conflicting entity did have access to these digital means for a cyber\n\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36",

While kinetic conflicts have a clear direction and source of an attack, cyber conflicts are not always evident (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 30).\n\nThis leads to the second issue: the effects of cyber operations are limited (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 131). If a state responds to a cyber attack with a cyber offensive of its own, the nature of the response would likely be limited in its impact and only supply a temporary nuisance or network disruption (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 123). In extreme cases, cyber offensives may attack critical infrastructure or influence economics by disrupting trust in governments and corporations. Yet even in these instances, the effects of the initial and responding cyber attacks would be temporary and unsustainable (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 131), thus failing to escalate the conflict.\n\nMoreover, many cyber attacks have uncertain and unintended repercussions (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 41), thus rendering hasty responses ineffective in the long run. By lacking a pronounced intensification of the cyber conflict due to limitations on impact, parties cannot escalate the conflict to a stalemate under conventional mhs. In the same vein, it is imperative to acknowledge that uncertainty permits future technological advances that may result in cyber tools with sufficient cross-domain capabilities, more destructive effects, or greater severity in impact. Whenever these tools are invented, perhaps the face of cyber conflict will change, and cyber operations will possess greater escalatory potential. Nevertheless, until that day, the current nature of cyber conflict demonstrates low-cost and low-impact effects upon the victimized state. As such, it limits the effectiveness of responding attacks at escalating a cyber conflict through digital means.\n\nThe third impediment for cyber escalation is the existence of countervailing tradeoffs for cyber operations (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 133). Many states execute cyber operations against other entities to achieve the goals of sabotage, espionage, or subversion (Rid 2012), all of which require secrecy to succeed (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 134). Since cyber tools are perceived as a more cost-effective and clandestine alternative to conventional warfare and espionage, political leaders are more likely to benefit from the continued development of cyber offense capabilities (Wohlfeld &amp; Jasper 2018). Consequently, states will be less willing to employ conspicuous, escalatory operations if it risks compromising their other large-scale operations (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 134). The risk comes from the potential that the attack is discovered since patches can be made that impede future access to the systems and data that governments aim to exploit. This reduces the likelihood that conflicting parties will perceive an incentive to escalate cyber disputes via a public response, especially if governments are pressured to justify their actions by revealing\n\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36",

As a result, states may be less likely to escalate a cyber conflict, both within and outside the domain of cyberspace (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 134).\n\nLastly, Borghard and Lonergan claim that it is unlikely that states will respond to a cyber attack through kinetic or cross-domain means (2019: 137). Unlike conventional conflict, cyber attacks do not produce the same carnage, psychological pressure, or violence as kinetic attacks. Instead, questions about the proportionality of responding to a cyber incident with cross-domain capabilities limit the feasibility of justifying kinetic responses to cyber attacks (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 137). Historically there has never been any cross-domain response to a first strike cyber attack, and there are very few instances of a kinetic response being used to answer cyber attacks in hybrid conflict. The most notable kinetic attack is Israel's 2019 airstrike against Hamas. In this instance, Israel's response to Hamas' cyber activities against the government appears to demonstrate an immediate conflict escalation. Yet, this dispute took place in the context of an ongoing and kinetic conflict, thus disqualifying its label as a pure cyber conflict (Borghard &amp; Schneider 2019). With this in mind, it is evident that there are significant limitations to a cross-domain escalation of pure cyber conflict.\n\nStill, some counterarguments stress the possibility of cross-domain escalation in cyber conflict by suggesting that a state could interpret an initial cyber attack as an act of war and employ a kinetic response. Borghard and Lonergan (2019: 138) acknowledge that the perception of some cyber attacks as low-impact or low-cost may apply to only certain states and political ideologies. Once again, uncertainty is an essential feature as much of the concern surrounding escalation in cyber conflict centers on the threats posed by ambiguity in risk analysis and escalation management (Libicki &amp; Tkacheva 2020).\n\nWhen states are not certain of their rivals' assumptions about how domains are interconnected and what constitutes an act of war, it is plausible that the result could lead to unintended escalation of the conflict into conventional warfare. In this scenario, if a state were to respond promptly to a cyber attack with a kinetic operation, then conventional understandings of MHS would have relevance; after all, at this point the conflict would have crossed a threshold into the physical realm and would follow conventional rules of engagement and escalation management. At this point, a cyber conflict-turned-conventional would no longer apply to this study since the focus is primarily on \"pure\" cyber conflict with no cross-domain aspects.\n\nHowever, what about a hypothetical in which a state first makes a threat to escalate a cyber conflict into a conventional war? In this scenario, the\n\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36",

The threat of cross-domain escalation is a form of deterrence, which has limited and ambiguous influence in cyber conflict and the digital domain. Sweijs and Zilincik (2021: 133) state that three criteria influence escalation management in cross-domain deterrence (cdd): attribution, credibility and threat proportionality, and signaling.\n\n##### Attribution\n\nAttribution of initial cyber attacks can be tedious, time-consuming, and inexact, leading to uncertainty in directing the threat at the appropriate target. This uncertainty risks international embarrassment, condemnation, or even tension if the threatening state incorrectly identifies a perpetrator or lacks evidence. As a result, the threat may not effectively escalate the conflict across domains since it may be easily dismissed. Furthermore, if a threat is directed at another state, accurately or not, the accused state would have little incentive to act upon standard mhs conceptualizations of ripeness and agree to negotiations. Once the accusation has been made, any response to a threat of kinetic escalation of a cyber conflict would require the accused to admit their cyber capabilities, thereby negating the serviceability of these digital tools and jeopardizing other cyber operations elsewhere in the world. As such, mhs would not necessarily hold relevance in scenarios where states rely on cross-domain escalation threats because uncertainty and attribution limits prevent states from utilizing effective cdd strategies.\n\n##### Credibility and threat proportionality\n\nRegarding credibility and threat proportionality, Sweijs and Zilincik (2021: 137) note that cdd is “complicated by the inherent disproportionality of responses across domains and instruments of power.” In this case, the relevance of mhs to threats of escalation is limited by the uncertain risk of how the international community and general population will perceive this intimidation. Despite the concern over states’ diverging definitions of what constitutes appropriate cross-domain escalation, there is consensus that violent responses to non-violent offensive measures will result in more immediate and severe consequences, which may receive public and international skepticism (Sweijs & Zilincik 2021: 137; Nye 2017: 51). As such, states may differ in their gauge of a threat’s credibility. This divergence weakens the case for mhs’ relevance to threats of escalation in cyber conflict since the ensuing uncertainty weakens the efficacy of the threat that domain spillover is plausible or justifiable.\n\n##### Signaling\n\nLastly, issues with signaling threats of cross-domain escalation reduce the applicability of mhs processes to cyber conflicts that could turn conventional. In the cyber domain, cross-domain signaling may be misinterpreted, with signals conducted through military means risking greater ambiguity about the signaler’s intentions to the target.

The risk of ambiguity in cross-domain signaling impedes MHS principles' efficacy in escalating the conflict since the action may appear detached from or external to the cyber conflict.\n\nWithout the capacity to escalate ongoing digital disputes, cyber conflicts present a challenge to conventional ripeness theory and do not offer states an incentive to seek a negotiated agreement. Parties' perceptions of a mutually hurting stalemate are more difficult to achieve because the long-term intensifying effects of cyber operations are often imperceptible, reiterating the dilemma of uncertainty in characterizing cyber conflict. Similarly, if a state were to threaten cross-domain spillover, the likelihood that the threat of escalation would serve as a sufficient push-factor towards negotiation is impeded by factors of uncertainty. As such, current ideas about timing and ripeness in cyber conflict remain elusive for cyberspace negotiations and require a reexamination of MHS to address this deviation.\n\n## Re-defining Mutually Hurting Stalemate\n\nAddressing the discrepancy between ripeness theory and cyber conflict requires a closer examination of the concept of mutually hurting stalemate. The perception of a stalemate is clearly critical in pushing conflicting parties towards negotiation. However, existing scholarship emphasizes that perception is built on mutual hurt and the threat (or existence) of unsustainable escalation. Since cyber weapons are not reliable tools of escalation and cyber operations present enticing tradeoffs for their continued use, mutual hurt and the threat of intensification are not attainable. As such, redefining the idea of a stalemate provides an alteration of ripeness theory for cyber conflicts.\n\nThis new definition addresses the main component of MHS: the hurting stalemate. The mutuality of MHS is not called into question since it is an essential aspect of any conflict. The reciprocal nature of conflict is inherent to the disagreement: all parties must be targets and initiators of cyber attacks for the cyber conflict to exist. Even where attribution issues exist, the mutual perception of a cyber attack from a rival is sufficient for the conflict to persist. Consequently, tit-for-tat cyber attacks are crucial in both the conflict and\n\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36",

The hurting stalemate is a painful deadlock characterized by a plateau, \"a flat and unending terrain without relief\" (Zartman 2000: 228), unbearable to both parties. This concept is not wholly accurate for cyber conflict due to the limits of inflicting pain through cyber means and the low-intensity nature of cyber operations. For one, cyber tools, like conventional weaponry, are a means for achieving political objectives. In cyber conflict, each cyber operation, analyzed individually, aims (and often achieves) short-term goals such as gaining trade and military secrets, displaying cyber capabilities, or deterring activity. When combined to characterize cyber conflict, the long-term goals reveal themselves. The long-term objectives in cyber conflict show how the mutuality of hurt is limited since the operations themselves are limited in scope and impact. In fact, it is challenging to conceptualize cyber conflict as \"winnable,\" given that the impact of cyber operations is constrained and unlikely to debilitate the target. According to Valeriano and Maness (2015: 61), cyber operations are often innocuous and used primarily \"as methods of signaling displeasure or discord to a rival,\" a demonstration of the restraint used by states when engaging in cyberspace. Cyber weapons have limited applicability in their \"hurting\" capability even in more destructive incidences, such as the Stuxnet worm that destroyed Iranian nuclear centrifuges in Operation Olympic Games. Though intending to deter or delay Iran's nuclear weapons development, Operation Olympic Games ultimately bolstered Tehran's determination to restore and expand its nuclear research in Natanz (Sanger 2018: 42).\n\nWith this limitation in mind, it is important to note that hurt from cyber conflict still exists. Targeted countries may experience damages or disruptions to their institutions and networks, impacting daily operations or economic mobility. Similarly, non-cyber responses to cyber operations, such as sanctions, condemnation, or other negative foreign policy measures, may inflict damages on the perceived initiator of an attack. Therefore, hurt is present in cyber conflict. However, there is a critical distinction between kinetic and cyber hurt: the hurt is not exhaustive in cyber conflict. Since cyber conflict is non-escalatory and used as a first-response or low-intensity method of engagement (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015), the hurt it inflicts on the target is not equal to the painful deadlock prescribed by conventional MHS. Instead, this hurt is perpetually sustainable, akin to Zartman's idea of \"the soft, stable, and self-serving stalemate\" (S5).\n\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36",

The S5 typically describes intractable conflicts in the kinetic domain, explaining the absence of ripeness in pushing the conflicting parties towards a negotiated solution (Zartman 2005a). In conventional analysis, factors of protracted conflict, zero-sum identities, the profitability of continued fighting, mutually exclusive solutions, and deficient perceptions of ripeness contribute to intractability in kinetic conflict (Zartman 2005a: 59–60). However, these features are not all representative of cyber conflict.\n\nCyber operations are both the means and ends to accomplishing short-term goals, disrupting issues of protraction even if the conflict itself is perpetual. Furthermore, cyber conflicts often do not involve zero-sum identities unique to the dispute, although the cyber conflict may exacerbate pre-existing conflicts between states. Nevertheless, the issues of profitability, solution saliency, and ripeness are typical of cyber conflicts, which are defined by countervailing tradeoffs encouraging the perpetuation of the conflict (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 133), and diverging norms and interests hampering cyber agreements. As such, cyber conflicts share some features of intractable disputes, which are emblematic of S5. However, S5 is still insufficient for characterizing cyber conflict due to the uncertainty surrounding cyberspace and the unique nature of intractability in the digital realm.\n\nWith these limitations in mind, the standard perception of a hurting stalemate is improbable in cyber conflict, and a conventional ripe moment for negotiation would not be perceived. Instead, adjusting the criteria for a hurting stalemate reshapes the conditions for ripeness in cyber conflict. This new condition focuses on a \"mutually harming standoff,\" a condition on the spectrum between Zartman's theories of S5 and MHS that permits the lack of a hurting stalemate in cyber conflict.\n\n## Mutually Harming Standoff, Ripeness, and Cyber Negotiations\n\nA mutually harming standoff (which will be referred to as MHS2) is distinct from a mutually hurting stalemate (hereafter referred to as MHS1) since it emphasizes the perfunctory character of the pain and reciprocity in cyber conflict. The \"harm\" inflicted by cyber operations may have a negative impact on the targeted state, but it is not so unbearable that the state is incapable of persisting without a way out. In other words, the state is not pressed into seeking an alternative to the cyber conflict since the harm it experiences is not exhaustive. Furthermore, a \"standoff\" provides a better image than a stalemate. While the hurting stalemate represents unwinnable deadlocks that are\n\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8–36",

This captures the nature of cyber conflict and adapts a critical component of ripeness theory.\n\nIf MHS2 characterizes long-term cyber conflict, when and how can it be perceived? More importantly, how can negotiators operationalize MHS2 to encourage cyber negotiations if a ripe moment is improbable in cyber conflict? Both questions are linked to another component of ripeness theory: mutually enticing opportunity (MEO). In Zartman's ripeness theory, perceptions of MHS1 are necessary, if insufficient, for encouraging parties to engage in dialogue as a way out of conventional conflict. This may be supplemented by perceptions of an MEO, which acts as the pull-factor for parties to engage in and continue negotiations (Zartman 2000: 241-242). Zartman acknowledges that few cases of conventional conflict demonstrate the opening of negotiations due to perceptions of an MEO alone. However, these perceptions help encourage parties to commit to negotiations once they commence (Zartman 2000: 241-242). Still, since conventional MHS1 does not exist in cyber conflict, realizing an MHS2 coupled with perceptions of an MEO can push rival cyber parties toward negotiations.\n\nFigure 3 presents an adaptation of the standard stages of the conflict arc for cyber disputes. In this depiction, MHS2 represents the state of the conflict from the time of emergence.

To disrupt this, the perception of an MEO is necessary to act as the new push-factor for parties to enter and commit to negotiations.\n\nIn cyber conflict, the MEO can manifest in several ways. These incentives may appear at different thresholds of pain throughout the dispute and encourage states to consider negotiations under various circumstances. Like MHS1, MHS2 pain thresholds are perceptual, and thus MEO S will be subjective from case to case (Zartman 2005b). Analyzing an array of MEO S showcases potential push-factor attributes unique to the nature of cyberspace that could encourage cyber conflict negotiation.\n\nNorms development collaboration. Like conventional conflicts, both parties may inherently view alternatives to victory that do not include tit-for-tat cyber exchanges. This may have limitations pending each party's goals in conducting cyber operations, but the opportunity to collaborate may displace the benefits of using digital tools against rivals. This collaboration leads to an impactful and enticing opportunity for negotiation: norms development. Given the standard of uncertainty in the cyber realm, states can attempt to shape the digital world in their image by collaborating to bilaterally develop and diffuse norms that meet their interests on a global scale. In other words, by leveraging the perception that normative interests are more far-reaching and achievable through bilateral collaboration, negotiators may be more successful in pushing conflicting parties to the table to coordinate on broader issues that both address and extend beyond the ongoing conflict.\n\nThe MEO for norms development collaboration is especially pertinent in cyber conflicts where the targets are primarily private and government non-military infrastructure. This represents one threshold for pain on the lattice of MHS2 ripeness; when attacks are apparent and far-reaching in their impact on the public, states are more likely to respond negatively (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 125). This is because many states view public interference in cyberspace as \"crossing a line\" in the digital realm, despite the lack of norms or agreements dictating this taboo (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015). Conversely, in cyber conflicts where attacks primarily target political and military networks, \"victim\" states are less likely to react with a negative or conflict-prone response (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 123-124). This suggests that cyber conflicts which focus on traditional government-to-government attacks, including infiltrations and intrusions through Trojans and APTs, are likely to present the norm for cyber conflict (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015). On the other hand, DDoS attacks are more obvious in their display of aggression since they interfere with public websites and systems, and states are more likely to respond negatively to the attack due to pressure from the public impacted by the incident.\n\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36",

For example, suppose the cyber conflict is characterized by long-run DDoS attacks or infiltrations targeting non-military private and government networks. In that case, participants may use these perceived violations as an opportunity to collaborate and bilaterally promote norms in cyber conflict that benefit both parties. In other words, while perpetuating the tit-for-tat cycle of the cyber conflict is a non-escalatory option, continued DDoS attacks may present reasonable grounds for decision-makers to examine alternatives to the conflict, thereby seeking innovative solutions for a way out of MHS2. Furthermore, considering the absence of concrete norms in cyberspace, parties may view the chance to negotiate and act as norm-makers as a mutually enticing opportunity.\n\nProtean power. In addition to norms development collaboration, the opportunity for states to demonstrate \"protean power\" is an enticing opportunity for decision-makers to choose negotiation in cyber conflict. This form of power, coined by Katzenstein and Seybert in 2018, counters the aforementioned \"control power\" and acknowledges the importance of creativity and innovation in decision-making when facing increasingly uncertain international dynamics. Due to the uncertain nature of cyberspace, successful navigation and utility of the digital realm require states to remain innovative, flexible, and agile in responding to rapid changes in technology or when dealing with crises where assurances in risk analyses are limited. As such, the negotiating table is the ideal medium for states to gain and exhibit protean power since the choice to negotiate in cyber conflict is a strategic, albeit inventive and pioneering option that may result in relative gains for both states.\n\nMoreover, states will likely view the display of protean power as a complement or, in some cases, substitute to other conventional understandings of power dynamics, such as hard power. As Katzenstein and Seybert (2018: 25) put it, \"the world is well stocked with low-probability events such as the sudden appearance of terrorist organizations operating on a global scale and waves of large-scale human migration.\" Therefore, displaying creative prowess in the face of ambiguity, instability, and uncertainty is vital for actors \"to derive relative advantage from unexpected challenges\" (Katzenstein &amp; Seybert 2018: 25). In cyber conflict, states that choose to negotiate over a continuation of tit-for-tat exchanges that prolong the status quo of MHS2 are more likely to be perceived as adaptable and inventive in responding to uncertainty surrounding the nature of cyberspace and geopolitics in this domain. Consequently, states that choose negotiation in cyber conflict have a stronger capacity for protean power, making them more durable and influential in handling increasingly complex dynamics in world politics.\n\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36",

Similarly, small states may be uniquely positioned to act on a push-factor MEO in cyber conflict since the newness of the domain presents opportunities for gaining leverage in the international arena. Following the benefits of protean power, the opportunity to demonstrate influence over rival states through innovation and improvisation in cyber conflict management incentivizes smaller states to push for negotiation as a means of alleviating tensions. This then acts as a push-factor MEO for smaller states seeking greater power in the international arena at large, especially since the democratic layout of cyberspace allows for ease of entry to new actors. In turn, larger states may be incentivized to negotiate in cyber conflict to further extend their influence in the digital realm, as well as the physical one.\n\nCross-conflict negotiation leverage. Finally, rival states with ongoing non-cyber tensions may be incentivized to negotiate as an avenue for leverage in other conflict domains. In other words, states with ongoing geopolitical tensions, such as the US and Russia, Japan and South Korea, or India and Pakistan, may be able to bargain agreements made in cyberspace with concessions in other negotiations or settlements. This also presents another scenario in which pain thresholds may be achieved in MHS2. Cyber conflicts that persist alongside other tensions or conflicts will prompt heightened sensitivities and feelings of annoyance between rivals. Yet, the digital realm remains the ideal medium for achieving cooperation or relative gains between rivals despite this distrust. The cyber domain provides an opportunity for norms development, an exhibition of power, and leverage in other conflict settlements. Thus, cyber conflicts between historic rival states are likely to perceive the status quo as a threshold of pain that makes an MEO for cooperation in the digital world appealing. Moreover, if the rivals perceive an opportunity to achieve non-cyber gains through cyber conflict negotiations, the parties already in conflict may consider this a push-factor MEO in cyberspace.\n\nThis MEO is well-suited for states engaged in regional conflict, a feature that Valeriano and Maness (2105: 81) note as being one of the most common fora for cyber conflict. For example, Japan and South Korea have deep-seated hostilities, ranging from disagreements over maritime control to enmities founded on the Korean peninsula's history of Japanese occupation. Many cyber-attacks between the two countries reflect these tensions, with both countries engaging in tit-for-tat exchanges between 2001 and 2011 (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 88). Interestingly, Japanese decision-makers often choose \"more cooperative interactions with their regional rivals\" despite ongoing cyber conflicts, suggesting a desire not to escalate tensions with nearby states (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 123). It follows, then, that regional rivals may have an MEO to use cyberspace as a platform for negotiation to influence overall tensions since the alternative is maintaining the status quo and perpetuating ongoing hostilities.\n\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36",

Again, Japan and South Korea exemplify this. Since both states are closely aligned with US interests (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 216), agreements between the two, especially those that impact both the cyber and physical domains, may strengthen their standing with the US and against larger rivals like China. As such, this opportunity for both mutual and relative gains acts as a push-factor for entrenched rival states to pursue cyber conflict negotiation.\n\nIn sum, conventional ripeness theory is limited in cyber conflict since mutually hurting stalemates (MHS1) are unattainable in cyberspace. Instead, a mutually harming standoff (MHS2) is more characteristic of the state of tit-for-tat cyber conflicts, where parties experience adverse effects from reciprocal attacks, but not at an unsustainable level. When long-term cyber conflict is recognized as an MHS2, specific attributes of the attacks may be operationalized to enact a push-factor MEO that encourages the parties to negotiate. These MEOs may hinge on the opportunity for cyber combatants to act as norm-makers by pursuing bilateral agreements that resolve the conflict and improve conduct in cyberspace or may focus on displays of protean power as small states or historic rivals. To represent this process, Figure 4 illustrates an adaptation of Zartman's conventional ripeness theory and negotiation progression to denote the push and pull aspects of MHS2 in cyber conflict. Here, MHS2 is presented\n\nFIGURE 4 Elements of Mutually Harming Standoff (MHS2) and the process of negotiation\n![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)\nADAPTED FROM ZARTMAN (2000: 230, 242)\n\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36",

Only after this perception is operationalized will the parties pursue negotiation as a way out of cyber conflict.\n\n## 2015 US-China Cybersecurity Agreement\n\nThe 2015 US-China Cybersecurity Agreement illustrates how MHS2 and MEO push-factors adapt the concept of timing in cyber conflict negotiations. These negotiations produced a cybersecurity agreement that established a precedent for defining economically motivated cyber espionage (EMCE) (Harold, Libicki, &amp; Stuth Cevallos 2016: 46). This demonstrates that norm-making is an attractive prospect for cyber negotiations following an MHS2, especially due to the uncertain and nebulous environment which characterizes cyberspace. The US-China agreement also showcases the limitations of applying current ripeness theory models to a bilateral cyber conflict. An overview of the US-China cyber conflict and its corresponding negotiations demonstrates how ripeness theory can be adjusted in cyber conflict to determine the timing of cyber negotiations.\n\n## Background: US-China Cyber Conflict\n\nThe US-China cyber conflict roughly began in 2003 and has predominately consisted of cyber espionage operations between the two countries (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 91–92). This characterization is key to the perpetuity of the conflict, and it is essential to examine both countries' stances on cyberspace and the rulebook by which they operate. First, the United States extends its values regarding individual freedoms and independence to the cyber realm (Brown &amp; Yung 2017a). The US government emphasizes online freedom of expression, liberal information flows, and data privacy in its national cybersecurity policies, and uses these values as the basis for which it evaluates foreign attacks on US networks (Brown &amp; Yung 2017a; Segal 2015). This is especially true for cyber espionage. According to Brown and Yung (2017a), the US makes distinctions between forms of espionage based on their objective, stating that \"in the US view, as long as such operations collect information about economic and financial matters for the purpose of benefiting national security, they are routine intelligence work.\" In this case, corporate espionage for the economic benefit of private companies is considered off-limits.\n\nChina also applies its political ideologies to cyberspace operations, and these values contradict the United States. At the forefront of China's cybersecurity strategy is the idea of Internet sovereignty, a norm shared by other\n\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36",

The Chinese government advocates for states to set their own rules regarding cyberspace and pursues digital independence from the US, which owns most of the world's IP addresses and has been heavy-handed in Internet governance (Brown &amp; Yung 2017b; Singer &amp; Friedman 2014: 140; Levite &amp; Jinghua 2019). Furthermore, China rejects the militarization of cyberspace, accusing the US of securitizing the digital domain and aggressively developing \"cyber arms\" in response to activities by perceived rivals like Russia and China (Brown &amp; Yung 2017b).\n\nIt is this argument that is crucial to China's cyber operations. In China's view, the US' aggressive pursuit of offensive cyber capabilities necessitates China's cyber development (Brown &amp; Yung 2017a; Singer &amp; Friedman 2014: 140). Additionally, China's stance on cyber espionage makes no distinction between operations pursuing an economic advantage versus a national security advantage (Sanger 2018: 70). Instead, China \"views economic competition as a way to achieve peer status with the US and sees cyberspace as an asymmetric instrument which it can successfully use to compete with the United States\" (Brown &amp; Yung 2017a). Thus, the Chinese agenda pursues cyber espionage for economic advantage as \"a quasi-legitimate way to achieve a North-South redistribution of wealth\" (Inkster 2017: 72). China's cyber policies aim to level the imbalance between the West and China and promote norms of self-determination in cyberspace.\n\nIn the US-China cyber conflict, various cyber weapons were used. Between 2003 and 2006, the Titan Rain attack employed Trojans, or unauthorized software that permits access to a system or program, to infiltrate US government and contracting networks such as the State Department and Lockheed Martin (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 34; Rid 2012: 20). This attack was attributed to the Chinese government, as was the 2006 intrusion by the APT \"Shady RAT,\" which stole secret information related to negotiation strategies, manufacturing design plans, and US national security policies (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 91; Singer &amp; Friedman 2014: 92). The international hack by GhostNet, which lasted from 2007 to 2009, utilized phishing scams to acquire access to computer microphones and cameras, allowing hackers to record conversations by State Department and Pentagon officials (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 131). This, along with other long-run intrusions and thefts, was again attributed to the Chinese government.\n\nIn response, US agencies retaliated against Chinese institutions by employing defensive cyber attacks. Operation Cisco Raider lasted from 2006 to 2010 and attempted to counter the distribution of counterfeit Cisco technology stolen in a Chinese hack (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 91). Another operation,\n\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36",

Finally, the long-term operation, Shotgiant, aimed to link the Chinese telecommunications firm, Huawei, to the People's Liberation Army (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 91; Sanger &amp; Perlroth 2014; Sanger 2018). This operation also endeavored to \"exploit Huawei's technology so that when the company sold equipment to other countries ... the NSA could roam through their computer and telephone networks to conduct surveillance and, if ordered by the president, offensive cyberoperations\" (Sanger &amp; Perlroth 2014). As such, the US-China cyber conflict included exchanges of offensive and retaliatory operations between the two nations to combat diverging normative values regarding espionage.\n\n## Cyber Negotiations\n\nThroughout the cyber conflict, US-China tensions never escalated to kinetic force. Instead, the conflict remained tit-for-tat, with both governments suffering from espionage that notably affected both military and non-military private and government entities. Due to the dispute's long-term, low intensity, and restrained nature, the US-China cyber conflict gradually developed into an MHS2.\n\nThe MHS2 permitted both governments to continue with their cyber attacks. However, in 2009 they began to engage in Track Two diplomatic talks between the US think-tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) and China's Institute of Contemporary International Relations (CICIR) (Segal 2015). What pushed the countries towards informal dialogue? According to one Chinese official, dialogue is a better alternative to perpetual conflict because both countries are capable of continued operations but would be better served by negotiating to settle their disagreements (Singer &amp; Friedman 2014). This represents the push-factor MEO, which promotes dialogue for norms establishment between two cyber rivals.\n\nThe Track Two talks further reflect the impact of MEOs for norm diffusion, with the first of these informal dialogues beginning in December 2009. Early dialogues focused on addressing both states' concerns about cyber sovereignty, cyberspace norms, multilateralism in addressing cybercrime, and confidence-building in cyberspace (CSIS 2009). These informal dialogues continued in addition to Track 1.5 discussions and alternated between Washington, DC and Beijing throughout the process. Eventually, discussions regarding cyber espionage and what it constitutes emerged alongside the issues of cyber sovereignty, governance, and US primacy in cyberspace (Harold, Libicki &amp; Stuth Cevallos 2016). It should be noted that these dialogues were \"were marked more by continuity than change,\" with participants on both sides maintaining their stances\n\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36",

Yet the governments' willingness to meet to discuss their stances in the cyber conflict signals an interesting push for a resolution in cyber conflict, without the need of a hurting stalemate.\n\nThese dialogues continued in a Track Two and Track 1.5 capacity, and by 2013, Track One negotiations commenced. However, these talks were interrupted in 2014 after the US indicted five People's Liberation Army officials with cyber espionage charges (Harold, Libicki &amp; Stuth Cevallos 2016; Brown &amp; Yung 2017a). The indictment asserted that members of the Chinese military stole trade secrets from US industries to bolster China's competitiveness in the international market. In response, the Chinese government walked away from the negotiations and asserted that the US accusations were hypocritical in light of the 2013 NSA leaks (Brown &amp; Yung 2017a). However, the talks resumed the following summer, and in September 2015, US President Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping released a statement on a new Cybersecurity Agreement (Harold, Libicki &amp; Stuth Cevallos 2016). The two governments agreed to improve coordination in investigating and preventing cybercrime, not conduct or support cyber intellectual property theft, and improve cooperation in promoting international norms in cyberspace (Obama 2015).\n\nThe 2015 Agreement achieved both mixed results and mixed reactions. Though some scholars believe that China's agreement on the existence of economically motivated cyber espionage (EMCE) is an incremental step in reducing cyber intellectual property theft, few believe it has since decreased (Brown &amp; Yung 2017c). There has been continued concern about the quality of the agreement and China's adherence to the terms (Brown &amp; Yung 2017c). While the negotiators were able to successfully agree on cyber-specific definitions of EMCE, a significant achievement in cyber norm development, gaps in the agreement have allowed both countries to exploit technicalities in the agreement. For example, though reports suggest a decrease in Chinese economic espionage, it appears that \"Chinese operators are going after technologies that are dual-use [such as telecommunications industries], and so might not be covered by the agreements\" (Segal 2017). Similarly, the US espionage operations against Huawei have persisted, with non-cyber sanctions and indictments attacking company leadership due to the recent dispute over 5G, surveillance, and data privacy (Whalen 2020).\n\n## Analysis\n\nDespite the weaknesses of the US-China Cybersecurity Agreement, the existence of the cyber negotiations sets a unique precedent regarding the timing of bilateral dialogues in cyber conflict.

Reviewing the conditions of ripeness in the US-China cyber conflict helps capture the applicability of mhs2 and meo in cyber conflict.\n\nThroughout the US-China cyber dispute, long-term operations and attacks generated an entrenched and enduring conflict between two cyber rivals. The use of intrusive cyber weapons to conduct espionage on non-military targets prompted the exchange of attacks, and the diverging perspectives on cyber and espionage norms deepened the tensions between the two countries. In this case, the conflict's perpetuity embodied an mhs2, with both countries receiving damages in their economic and political security due to cyber and non-cyber retaliations. Even so, both countries were caught in a standoff rather than a stalemate since these damages were not exhaustive, permanent, or fatigue-inducing. In fact, both countries focused on long-term cyber weaponry, like apts and Trojans, to conduct lengthy operations that were sustainable regardless of the harm dealt to each government in response.\n\nWith this perpetual-while-manageable standoff reached, both countries continued to conduct their cyber operations against one another. Nevertheless, the opportunity to collaborate on norms development was the meo that pushed both governments towards negotiation. This was first captured and operationalized at the informal level. Through the Track Two dialogues, the US and Chinese think tanks provided a platform for sharing and understanding each other's values and perspectives of cyberspace and security. This informal communication linked the two governments, regardless of the conflict's perpetuity, and provided the opportunity for cooperation in norm-making and diffusion. This was especially enticing considering that the UN Group of Governmental Experts (UN gge) on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace has convened multiple times throughout the US-China conflict to establish international norms in cyberspace (gip Digital Watch Observatory 2021). If the US and China could bilaterally collaborate on cyberspace norms, their influence in international norm-making would be especially prominent and allow both countries to demonstrate their protean power in a new and uncertain domain.\n\nTrack 1.5 and Track One dialogues between the two governments further demonstrate this dedication to coordination in resolving the cyber conflict while establishing rules for conduct in cyberspace. Though the ultimate agreement may have failed in effectively instituting these norms, the fact that understanding was reached on the definition of emce is significant. The US and China's commitment to establishing norms in cyberspace to resolve the cyber conflict is therefore an important example of cyber negotiations. Future",

Cyber conflict, regardless of its potential to supplant conventional warfare, has surfaced as a new source of tension between states, one that is ill-defined and difficult to regulate. As such, developing capacities for resolving cyber conflict requires new approaches to negotiation and mediation, and revisiting ripeness theory allows scholars and practitioners to adapt prevailing negotiation strategies to new realms of conflict.\n\nDue to the nature of cyber conflict, conventional ideas of ripeness theory are inadequate for deciding when to begin cyber negotiations. Limitations in escalation, the perception of cyber operations as \"escalatory offramps,\" countervailing tradeoffs in the use of cyber tools, and the first-use character of cyber weapons prevent states from perceiving mutually hurting stalemates in tit-for-tat cyber conflict. Therefore, modifying the definition of a hurting stalemate better captures the nature of cyber conflict and offers an alternative for timing negotiations. \"Mutually harming standoff\" is more emblematic of the plateau in cyber conflict since both states may feel the consequences of the conflict, but to a manageable and sustainable degree. When long-term cyber conflict is reached, an MHS2 has taken effect, and combining it with the component of mutually enticing opportunity will push actors towards cyber negotiations.\n\nThe MEO, while operating as a pull-factor in kinetic conflict, serves a more significant role in propelling conflicting parties toward negotiations because cyberspace provides incentives for collaboration over conflict. Though vested with the capacity for continued cyber conflict, rival states may perceive the opportunities to collaborate on norms development, exercise protean power, or gain leverage in external conflicts as ideal for promoting their agendas on cyberspace bilaterally. This is captured by the case of the US-China Cybersecurity Agreement.\n\nIn this instance, the reciprocal cyber conflict between the US and China was characterized by an MHS2. Nonetheless, the governments seized the opportunity to engage in norm-making through dialogue instead of unilaterally trying to \"win\" in cyber conflict. These negotiations evolved from informal Track Two discussions to Track One negotiation and agreement between American and\n\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36",

In addition, the MEO is a stronger and more necessary (if insufficient) component for achieving ripeness in cyber conflict.\n\nFuture research on the negotiation or mediation process may provide greater clarity on achieving more successful cyber agreements in the future. Likewise, examining the strategies of multilateral cyber negotiations and their impact on norms development would impact the nature of state-to-state cyber conflict. Such evolutions will necessitate further research as new capabilities and dynamics emerge. In the meantime, exploring other cyber conflicts, such as those between long-term rivals like the US-Russia, India-Pakistan, and North Korea-South Korea, may provide a prescriptive application of the adapted ripeness theory.\n\nThe application of ripeness theory, like conflict itself, is continually evolving. New technologies and conflict domains shape peace efforts and strategies in practical and academic application. In cyber conflict, adjusting the components of ripeness theory to include mutually harming standoffs and MEOs demonstrates how negotiation practices can shift to address emerging threats and realms of uncertainty that characterize new domains of conflict. Without this adjustment, cyber conflicts and other new realms for war, remain out of reach for resolution.\n\n# References\n\nBorghard, E. D. and J.

As the world becomes more interconnected through digital means, a potential \"fifth domain\" for conflict has emerged in the cyber realm (Murphy 2010), inviting scholars to debate the nature of cyber attacks, cyber espionage, and disinformation campaigns as \"cyber warfare\" (Rid 2012). With the emergence of cyberwar as a key buzzword in political and academic spheres, the question of how to resolve cyber conflicts shifts the focus to negotiation theory.\nAnalysis of cyber conflict presents a challenge to the prevailing negotiation concept, ripeness theory. Ripeness theory posits that the timing of a negotiation stems from the conflicting parties' perception of a \"mutually hurting stalemate\" (MHS) and \"a way out\" of conflict through dialogue (Zartman 2000). While this theory has shown merit for negotiations related to conventional warfare or economic disputes, there are gaps in its applicability for resolving cyber conflict. Specifically, the concept of a \"hurting stalemate\" has little to no presence in cyber disputes, rendering MHS incompatible with pure cyber negotiations. As such, redefining mutually hurting stalemate for cyber conflict is paramount to address this discrepancy.\nThis analysis attempts to adapt prevailing negotiation theory for conflicts in the cyber domain. First, an overview of what constitutes cyber conflict is provided, the state of its norms and regulations, and the uncertain nature of cyberspace. Second, an analysis of ripeness theory in conventional and cyber conflict highlights the current gaps in negotiation literature when applied to an evolving form of conflict. Third, redefining the idea of MHS by suggesting an alternative, \"mutually harming standoff,\" offers an examination into the timing discrepancy surrounding cyberspace agreements. Lastly, examining the 2015 bilateral US-China Cybersecurity Agreement provides context for applying this hypothesis and demonstrates how accepted negotiation theory may be applied to cyber conflict.\n# Defining Cyber Conflict: Terms, Norms, and the Rise of Uncertainty\nThe definitions of \"cyber conflict\" or \"cyberwarfare\" are a source of contention throughout the international community. There is a lack of shared understanding for terms related to cyberspace, with some scholars arguing that the preoccupation with cyber warfare has little merit. While some governments, academics, and media outlets overemphasize the threat of a \"cyber Pearl Harbor,\" these warnings are more speculative and extreme than reality would suggest (Singer &amp; Friedman 2014: 68). If applying a Clausewitzian understanding of war, which emphasizes its violence, instrumental character, and political\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nPOLK\nnature, it appears that cyberwar has yet to occur, as no cyber attack has met these three criteria (Rid 2012: 7–10).\nRegardless of the debate on the reality of cyber warfare, the fact remains that cyberspace activities continue to shape and threaten geopolitical relations. Offensive cyber exchanges in the digital realm have exacerbated international tensions between technological powerhouses such as the United States, Russia, and China, and developing consensus on the broader idea of “cyber conflict” is pertinent to establishing a new approach to diplomacy on the issue of cyberspace. For this article, we will adopt a broad definition of “cyber conflict” to include information operations between two or more entities that intentionally undermine the economic, political, social, or security systems of states, businesses, and organizations. This definition incorporates such concepts as “cyber espionage,” “disinformation campaigns,” “cyber sabotage,” and “cyberterrorism,” representing tactics initiated or sponsored by states (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015).\nExamples of cyber conflict include the continuous use of cyber operations or the means through which states conduct cyber attacks against the same entity over time. These conflicts are reciprocal, characterized by tit-for-tat cyber exchanges between countries, and may also employ non-cyber means in an effort to deter future attacks, such as sanctions or public condemnation. Cyber conflict includes the use of advanced persistent threats (APTs) to spy on corporate activities or the development and deployment of malicious software to cause physical damage to infrastructure. Cyber operations may use an array of cyber weapons, from the application of botnets in distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks that shut down government websites to the creation of Trojans and backdoors, which infiltrate and sabotage computer networks (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 34). These parameters highlight the scope of the issues and features that shape cyber conflicts and the ambiguities surrounding their nature.\nConversely, this definition does not include small-scale “cybercrime,” which tends to be a for-profit enterprise that does not center on ideology or political gain (Singer &amp; Friedman 2014: 145–155). It also does not include attacks perpetrated by individuals or non-state-sponsored criminal organizations since these efforts more often constitute “cybercrime” and are one-off rogue actions intended to cause chaos or malice rather than achieve policy goals (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 33). Lastly, the article focuses on “pure” cyber conflict, thus dismissing incidences of cyber attacks as part of larger military campaigns or hybrid warfare. While negotiations on conventional conflicts may address concerns relating to cyberspace, kinetic wars are characterized differently from cyber conflicts, as discussed later in the article.\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8–36\nRIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\n# Cyber Norms and Consensus\nDisagreements over what constitutes cyber conflict impact the establishment of international norms for addressing cyber operations. Numerous arrangements have attempted to codify norms for regulating cyberspace and expanding international law to include the digital domain. The Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare is one effort to establish consensus on cyber conflict. This document, first published in 2013, attempts to apply existing international law to cyber conflicts while defining \"cyber attacks\" and \"cyber self-defense\" (Schmitt 2017). However, the Tallinn Manual has no legal standing, and many countries have rejected the arguments it presents (Singer &amp; Friedman 2014: 206). As a result, binding consensus on how states should govern and regulate cyberspace remains indefinite and allows for multiple interpretations of what justifies an attack.\nOther efforts to establish norms in cyberspace involve international processes to develop standards of conduct in the cyber realm. Since 1998, motions to formulate cyber arms control treaties and propagate agreements on cyber governance have shaped international agendas (Ruhl et al. 2020). From intergovernmental institutions like the UN to think tank-led working groups, numerous negotiations and dialogues have been under way to improve the stability and security of cyberspace. These initiatives include ongoing fora such as the UN Group of Governmental Experts (UN GGE) and the UN Open-Ended Working Group (UN OEWG), both aimed at developing interstate cyber norms and applying international law to cyberspace (Ruhl et al. 2020). Other efforts include the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace, a coalition of cybersecurity experts that promotes specific cyber norms, and the Paris Call, a \"multistakeholder initiative led by the French government and supported by Microsoft,\" which seeks to mainstream cyber norms outside of interstate dialogues (Ruhl et al. 2020: 11).\nThe credibility of their participants legitimizes these formats, whether it is the legitimacy of the UN process or the inclusivity of multiple stakeholders, such as businesses, think tanks, and non-profits, in building standards for cyberspace (Ruhl et al. 2020). However, Ruhl et al. note that these efforts are constrained due to four factors. For one, the evolving nature of cyberspace impedes the development of sustainable norms, and the presence of multiple actors with varying interests inhibits the regulation of norm adherence in cyberspace. Second, states' cyber activities are often secretive and unknown, thus obstructing the implementation of international standards for cyberspace. Third, disagreement between great powers on cyberspace norms can frustrate agreements. For example, Russian and Chinese demands for greater state sovereignty in cyberspace are countered by the US' assertion for free and\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nPOLK\nindependent Internet access. Fourth, weak incentives to adhere to cyberspace norms can reduce the impact and sustainability of international agreements. In contrast, \"states with significant cyber capabilities seem ready and willing to employ them to advance their interests,\" presenting an incentive for states to dismiss norms or limit their scope of adherence (Ruhl et al. 2020:17). Therefore, the multilateral fora for establishing cyberspace norms currently faces significant limitations in their effectiveness, generating a high level of uncertainty in the domain of cyberspace.\n## Uncertainty in the Digital Realm\nThe uncertain nature of cyberspace and norms creates difficulties for dispute resolution. Unlike conventional conflict, where risks, calculations, and capacities are known in an exercise of \"control power,\" cyber conflict occurs in a realm of uncertainty, potentiality, and improvisation (Katzenstein &amp; Seybert, 2018). The \"fog of uncertainty\" (Katzenstein &amp; Seybert 2018: 36) limits states' abilities to know how cyberspace will evolve, who the actors are, and what their capabilities may entail, thus preventing states from assessing the long-term ramifications of a cyber attack's impact. The nebulousness of cyberspace results not in deterrence but in restraint, which Valeriano and Maness (2015: 54) describe as a \"policy outcome but not necessarily a process\" for states' limited use of cyber tools. Therefore, this restraint is a consequence of the ambiguity and insecurity characterizing cyberspace, suggesting that certainties regarding states' intentions and cyber capabilities are unattainable, thereby reducing the risk of escalation in cyber conflict.\nEscalation represents an \"increase in the intensity of a conflict and in the severity of the tactics used in pursuing it\" (Maiese 2003) and is crucial to the perception of ripeness in conflict. However, states' restraint in using cyber tools impedes the prominence of both escalation and ripeness in cyber conflict, a discrepancy which will be addressed in the next section. The uncertainty of cyberspace and the limitations of cyber norms results in weak perceptions of states' digital activities. The vagueness of cyberspace is an impediment to determining what should be negotiated, let alone when negotiations should be conducted. Analyzing the concept of \"ripeness\" in cyber conflict will answer the question of when states should negotiate on matters of cyberspace.\n## Overview of Ripeness Theory\nAs previously stated, Zartman's \"ripeness theory\" presents a condition for the timing and beginning of negotiation (2001). Ripeness is a perceptual event that\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nRIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nstems from the belief in a Mutually Hurting Stalemate (MHS) or a Mutually Enticing Opportunity (MEO) (Zartman 2000). Zartman defines MHS as the moment when \"parties find themselves locked in a conflict from which they cannot escalate to victory and this deadlock is painful to both of them\" (2008). This deadlock may be depicted as a plateau, a stalemate where the costs of continuing the violence outweigh the benefits, with both parties suffering from the ongoing conflict. Similarly, a catastrophic event, or a precipice, may threaten or have influenced perceptions of the conflict and impart a stalemate. To quote Zartman (2001: 8), \"the catastrophe provides a deadline or a lesson indicating that pain can be sharply increased if something is not done about it now.\" Upon the perception of an MHS, both parties recognize that the probability of unilaterally winning the conflict is decreased, making the stalemate more foreboding.\nIn response to the perception of a stalemate, the conflicting parties may attempt to seize the moment by pursuing a \"way out\" of the conflict, sustained by an MEO (Zartman 2008), through negotiation. Zartman's theory is displayed in Figure 1, which demonstrates the push and pull factors that lead to the decision and commitment to negotiate.\nIt should be noted that ripeness is merely a condition for encouraging states to negotiate an end to the conflict, one that is \"necessary, but not sufficient\" (Zartman 2001: 9). As such, the propensity for success in cyber negotiation is not guaranteed in seizing the ripe moment for dialogue. Analysis of ripeness theory's application in conventional and cyber conflict demonstrates how the concept of a stalemate leads (or does not lead) to the perception that the timing is suitable for negotiation as an alternative to continued fighting.\nFIGURE 1 Elements of conventional ripeness theory and the process of negotiation ADAPTED FROM ZARTMAN (2000: 230, 242)\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nPOLK\n# Ripeness and Conventional Conflict\nIn kinetic warfare, ripeness theory holds merit. Conventional conflict may be escalated and then plateaued, as defined by an MHS, thus presenting an opportunity for seeking a way out through negotiation. Zartman (2008) illustrates this by stating that \"to ripen a conflict one must raise the level of conflict until the stalemate is reached and then further until it begins to hurt – and even then, work toward a perception of an impending catastrophe as well.\" This captures the idea behind MHS – a perceived stalemate must be generated for both sides, with the parties incurring unsustainable or unbearable costs in the long run even when there is no prospect for further escalation. Brahm illustrates the role of MHS as a tipping point or push-factor towards negotiation by depicting conventional conflict as a cresting wave (see Figure 2). After the emergence of the conflict, continuous escalation of hostilities leads to or threatens an impending catastrophe, the precipice of the wave at which point an MHS has occurred (Brahm 2003). If the MHS is perceived, it may push the parties towards de-escalation and negotiation, and confidence-building measures and the perception of an MEO can pull the parties closer toward an agreement and the end of the conflict (Brahm 2003).\nIn conventional conflict, weaponry and strategic maneuvers are useful in this pursuit of a stalemate since conventional weaponry varies in scale, targeting, and scope of damage. For example, during the Bosnian War, NATO's use of cruise missiles and stealth planes in \"Operation Deliberate Force\" destroyed 338 Serbian targets. The Bosnian Serbs perceived the use of US Navy Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles (TLAMs) and F-117 bombers as a major escalation by\nFIGURE 2 Stages of conflict\nADAPTED FROM BRAHM (2003)\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nRIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nNATO (Morgan et al. 2008: 13), and this campaign helped to push the Serbs to return to the Dayton Accords in late 1995 (Hartwell 2019: 450). By employing weaponry or strategy, practitioners in conventional conflict are able to achieve a stalemate by escalating the hostilities on the ground. Therefore, the role of escalation is integral to achieving MHS since it results in perceptions “that there has been a significant qualitative change in the conflict as a result of the new development” (Morgan et al. 2008: 9). When both parties escalate to unattainable levels, the conventional conflict plateaus while the sides experience mutual hurt.\nThese conflicts are then considered ripe for negotiation, and the moment may be seized to initiate negotiations and resolve the conflict. Examples of ripeness theory in kinetic conflict have been perceived in the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah War, the Yugoslav Wars in the 1990s, and the Angolan Civil War (Schrodt, Yilmaz &amp; Gerner 2003; Touval 2002: 167; Zartman 2000). In these cases, military escalation of conflict or mediator-induced perceptions of MHS pushed parties to commit to dialogue processes (Touval 2002; Zartman 2000). As such, ripeness theory has strong applicability in cases of conventional conflict.\n## Ripeness and Cyber Conflict\nIn contrast, cyber conflicts do not have the same characteristics as conventional warfare. Cyber operations are not inherently escalatory, and using cyber means to intensify a cyber conflict to the point of ripeness is improbable. For one, states view cyber operations as de facto “escalatory offramps,” or alternatives to costly kinetic conflict that still signal state displeasure or aim to influence rivals’ behavior (Jensen &amp; Valeriano 2019: 2). As such, decision-makers are often inclined to use cyber operations as an extension of foreign policy because they are not escalatory. If faced with increased tensions with rival governments, states have displayed a preference for choosing cyber responses as a form of “sub-crisis maneuvering” or exit from heightened conflict (Jensen &amp; Valeriano 2019: 4).\nA 2019 survey of US, Russian, and Israeli civilians further demonstrates this perspective that cyber conflict is non-escalatory. In this study, respondents in all three countries showed a general preference for non-escalatory responses to cyber attacks in scenarios where the victim state had the capacity to respond with an in-kind cyber weapon (Jensen &amp; Valeriano 2019: 6). Respondents from Russia voted in favor of de-escalatory responses to cyber attacks, while citizens from the US and Israel most often favored proportional responses to the initial attack (Jensen &amp; Valeriano 2019: 7). All three countries had low responses expressing a preference for escalation against a cyber attack. These findings express a tendency to view cyber conflict as a non-escalatory domain (Jensen\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nPOLK\n&amp; Valeriano 2019), thereby casting doubt on the notion that responses to cyber operations could result in an escalation between two parties.\nEven in the most severe cases of cyber attacks, such as disruptions of critical infrastructure, victim states have exhibited a preference for non-escalatory response rather than escalatory action. The real-world examples of the 2015 and 2016 attacks on Ukrainian power grids capture this. In these events, the BlackEnergy 3 and Crashoverride malware, respectively, targeted energy companies or transmission substations resulting in the disruption of electricity supply to nearby consumers. These attacks had limited impact, lasting between one to six hours before restoring full operations (Todros 2018), reflecting the low-intensity, high-manageability of the attack. Yet, the most notable feature of these attacks concerns Ukraine's response. First, Ukraine and allied countries largely attributed both attacks to a hacking group connected to Russian intelligence services (Greenberg 2017), but this has not been proven. This demonstrates an attribution problem that highlights the uncertainty typical of cyber attacks and prevents rapid, escalatory responses of any form. In other words, given the lack of certainty regarding the perpetrator of the cyber attack, decision-makers were impeded in their ability to execute timely and sufficient responses akin to escalation through either digital or kinetic means. Second, even when members of the Ukrainian government condemned Russia for the act, no offensive response, either kinetic or in-kind, was taken (Greenberg 2017). These cases show that even cyber attacks impacting critical infrastructure have low-escalatory potential, a trait that is especially unique when linked to the ongoing geopolitical tensions that shape Russian-Ukrainian relations outside the digital realm. As such, cyber conflicts cannot easily demonstrate escalatory potential using digital means.\nFurthermore, Borghard and Lonergan (2019; 125-138) argue that cyber operations are \"poor tools of escalation\" for four reasons: they are time-consuming to develop, they have a limited impact on the victim state, states have countervailing tradeoffs in using cyber tools, and there are few appropriate cross-domain responses to cyber attacks. First, developing retaliatory cyber tools is time-consuming (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 125). In the event of a cyber attack, a state or institution may not have immediate access to the digital tools required to launch a counteroffensive. According to Borghard and Lonergan (2019: 125), \"offensive cyber operations deliver effects against targets through exploiting a vulnerability to gain access (through an attack vector) to a target's network or system.\" This backdoor access would need to be pre-installed and ready to act on for a timely counterattack to work; without this preset, any response would be time-consuming and miss the opportunity to escalate the conflict. If a conflicting entity did have access to these digital means for a cyber\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nRIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\noffensive, it would have to reconcile with concerns of attribution (Wohlfeld &amp; Jasper 2018). While kinetic conflicts have a clear direction and source of an attack, cyber conflicts are not always evident (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 30).\nThis leads to the second issue: the effects of cyber operations are limited (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 131). If a state responds to a cyber attack with a cyber offensive of its own, the nature of the response would likely be limited in its impact and only supply a temporary nuisance or network disruption (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 123). In extreme cases, cyber offensives may attack critical infrastructure or influence economics by disrupting trust in governments and corporations. Yet even in these instances, the effects of the initial and responding cyber attacks would be temporary and unsustainable (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 131), thus failing to escalate the conflict.\nMoreover, many cyber attacks have uncertain and unintended repercussions (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 41), thus rendering hasty responses ineffective in the long run. By lacking a pronounced intensification of the cyber conflict due to limitations on impact, parties cannot escalate the conflict to a stalemate under conventional mhs. In the same vein, it is imperative to acknowledge that uncertainty permits future technological advances that may result in cyber tools with sufficient cross-domain capabilities, more destructive effects, or greater severity in impact. Whenever these tools are invented, perhaps the face of cyber conflict will change, and cyber operations will possess greater escalatory potential. Nevertheless, until that day, the current nature of cyber conflict demonstrates low-cost and low-impact effects upon the victimized state. As such, it limits the effectiveness of responding attacks at escalating a cyber conflict through digital means.\nThe third impediment for cyber escalation is the existence of countervailing tradeoffs for cyber operations (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 133). Many states execute cyber operations against other entities to achieve the goals of sabotage, espionage, or subversion (Rid 2012), all of which require secrecy to succeed (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 134). Since cyber tools are perceived as a more cost-effective and clandestine alternative to conventional warfare and espionage, political leaders are more likely to benefit from the continued development of cyber offense capabilities (Wohlfeld &amp; Jasper 2018). Consequently, states will be less willing to employ conspicuous, escalatory operations if it risks compromising their other large-scale operations (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 134). The risk comes from the potential that the attack is discovered since patches can be made that impede future access to the systems and data that governments aim to exploit. This reduces the likelihood that conflicting parties will perceive an incentive to escalate cyber disputes via a public response, especially if governments are pressured to justify their actions by revealing\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nPOLK\nthat the initial attack occurred. In doing so, states risk exposing their vulnerabilities or threatening their international standing. As a result, states may be less likely to escalate a cyber conflict, both within and outside the domain of cyberspace (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 134).\nLastly, Borghard and Lonergan claim that it is unlikely that states will respond to a cyber attack through kinetic or cross-domain means (2019: 137). Unlike conventional conflict, cyber attacks do not produce the same carnage, psychological pressure, or violence as kinetic attacks. Instead, questions about the proportionality of responding to a cyber incident with cross-domain capabilities limit the feasibility of justifying kinetic responses to cyber attacks (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 137). Historically there has never been any cross-domain response to a first strike cyber attack, and there are very few instances of a kinetic response being used to answer cyber attacks in hybrid conflict. The most notable kinetic attack is Israel's 2019 airstrike against Hamas. In this instance, Israel's response to Hamas' cyber activities against the government appears to demonstrate an immediate conflict escalation. Yet, this dispute took place in the context of an ongoing and kinetic conflict, thus disqualifying its label as a pure cyber conflict (Borghard &amp; Schneider 2019). With this in mind, it is evident that there are significant limitations to a cross-domain escalation of pure cyber conflict.\nStill, some counterarguments stress the possibility of cross-domain escalation in cyber conflict by suggesting that a state could interpret an initial cyber attack as an act of war and employ a kinetic response. Borghard and Lonergan (2019: 138) acknowledge that the perception of some cyber attacks as low-impact or low-cost may apply to only certain states and political ideologies. Once again, uncertainty is an essential feature as much of the concern surrounding escalation in cyber conflict centers on the threats posed by ambiguity in risk analysis and escalation management (Libicki &amp; Tkacheva 2020).\nWhen states are not certain of their rivals' assumptions about how domains are interconnected and what constitutes an act of war, it is plausible that the result could lead to unintended escalation of the conflict into conventional warfare. In this scenario, if a state were to respond promptly to a cyber attack with a kinetic operation, then conventional understandings of MHS would have relevance; after all, at this point the conflict would have crossed a threshold into the physical realm and would follow conventional rules of engagement and escalation management. At this point, a cyber conflict-turned-conventional would no longer apply to this study since the focus is primarily on \"pure\" cyber conflict with no cross-domain aspects.\nHowever, what about a hypothetical in which a state first makes a threat to escalate a cyber conflict into a conventional war? In this scenario, the\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nuncertainty aspect of cyberspace suggests that mhs might not necessarily hold relevance. The threat of cross-domain escalation is a form of deterrence, which has limited and ambiguous influence in cyber conflict and the digital domain. Sweijs and Zilincik (2021: 133) state that three criteria influence escalation management in cross-domain deterrence (cdd): attribution, credibility and threat proportionality, and signaling.\n##### Attribution\nAttribution of initial cyber attacks can be tedious, time-consuming, and inexact, leading to uncertainty in directing the threat at the appropriate target. This uncertainty risks international embarrassment, condemnation, or even tension if the threatening state incorrectly identifies a perpetrator or lacks evidence. As a result, the threat may not effectively escalate the conflict across domains since it may be easily dismissed. Furthermore, if a threat is directed at another state, accurately or not, the accused state would have little incentive to act upon standard mhs conceptualizations of ripeness and agree to negotiations. Once the accusation has been made, any response to a threat of kinetic escalation of a cyber conflict would require the accused to admit their cyber capabilities, thereby negating the serviceability of these digital tools and jeopardizing other cyber operations elsewhere in the world. As such, mhs would not necessarily hold relevance in scenarios where states rely on cross-domain escalation threats because uncertainty and attribution limits prevent states from utilizing effective cdd strategies.\n##### Credibility and threat proportionality\nRegarding credibility and threat proportionality, Sweijs and Zilincik (2021: 137) note that cdd is “complicated by the inherent disproportionality of responses across domains and instruments of power.” In this case, the relevance of mhs to threats of escalation is limited by the uncertain risk of how the international community and general population will perceive this intimidation. Despite the concern over states’ diverging definitions of what constitutes appropriate cross-domain escalation, there is consensus that violent responses to non-violent offensive measures will result in more immediate and severe consequences, which may receive public and international skepticism (Sweijs & Zilincik 2021: 137; Nye 2017: 51). As such, states may differ in their gauge of a threat’s credibility. This divergence weakens the case for mhs’ relevance to threats of escalation in cyber conflict since the ensuing uncertainty weakens the efficacy of the threat that domain spillover is plausible or justifiable.\n##### Signaling\nLastly, issues with signaling threats of cross-domain escalation reduce the applicability of mhs processes to cyber conflicts that could turn conventional. In the cyber domain, cross-domain signaling may be misinterpreted, with signals conducted through military means risking greater ambiguity about the signaler’s intentions to the target. As Sweijs and Zilincik (2021: 140)\nPOLK\nnote, \"a signal of resolve to respond to cyberattacks by moving platforms for the launch of conventional or nuclear weapons may be easily interpreted as a preparation for hostilities rather than as an adjustment of the deterrence posture.\" As a result, the target of the threat may view the cross-domain action as separate from the cyber conflict or as a general increase in tension outside of the digital realm. The risk of ambiguity in cross-domain signaling impedes MHS principles' efficacy in escalating the conflict since the action may appear detached from or external to the cyber conflict.\nWithout the capacity to escalate ongoing digital disputes, cyber conflicts present a challenge to conventional ripeness theory and do not offer states an incentive to seek a negotiated agreement. Parties' perceptions of a mutually hurting stalemate are more difficult to achieve because the long-term intensifying effects of cyber operations are often imperceptible, reiterating the dilemma of uncertainty in characterizing cyber conflict. Similarly, if a state were to threaten cross-domain spillover, the likelihood that the threat of escalation would serve as a sufficient push-factor towards negotiation is impeded by factors of uncertainty. As such, current ideas about timing and ripeness in cyber conflict remain elusive for cyberspace negotiations and require a reexamination of MHS to address this deviation.\n## Re-defining Mutually Hurting Stalemate\nAddressing the discrepancy between ripeness theory and cyber conflict requires a closer examination of the concept of mutually hurting stalemate. The perception of a stalemate is clearly critical in pushing conflicting parties towards negotiation. However, existing scholarship emphasizes that perception is built on mutual hurt and the threat (or existence) of unsustainable escalation. Since cyber weapons are not reliable tools of escalation and cyber operations present enticing tradeoffs for their continued use, mutual hurt and the threat of intensification are not attainable. As such, redefining the idea of a stalemate provides an alteration of ripeness theory for cyber conflicts.\nThis new definition addresses the main component of MHS: the hurting stalemate. The mutuality of MHS is not called into question since it is an essential aspect of any conflict. The reciprocal nature of conflict is inherent to the disagreement: all parties must be targets and initiators of cyber attacks for the cyber conflict to exist. Even where attribution issues exist, the mutual perception of a cyber attack from a rival is sufficient for the conflict to persist. Consequently, tit-for-tat cyber attacks are crucial in both the conflict and\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nRIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nnegotiation stages, and mutuality remains integral to encouraging parties to approach negotiation as a way out of cyber conflict.\nWhile the hurting stalemate is crucial to perceptions of ripe moments in conventional conflict, the phrase itself is incomplete in characterizing cyber conflict. The hurting stalemate is a painful deadlock characterized by a plateau, \"a flat and unending terrain without relief\" (Zartman 2000: 228), unbearable to both parties. This concept is not wholly accurate for cyber conflict due to the limits of inflicting pain through cyber means and the low-intensity nature of cyber operations. For one, cyber tools, like conventional weaponry, are a means for achieving political objectives. In cyber conflict, each cyber operation, analyzed individually, aims (and often achieves) short-term goals such as gaining trade and military secrets, displaying cyber capabilities, or deterring activity. When combined to characterize cyber conflict, the long-term goals reveal themselves. The long-term objectives in cyber conflict show how the mutuality of hurt is limited since the operations themselves are limited in scope and impact. In fact, it is challenging to conceptualize cyber conflict as \"winnable,\" given that the impact of cyber operations is constrained and unlikely to debilitate the target. According to Valeriano and Maness (2015: 61), cyber operations are often innocuous and used primarily \"as methods of signaling displeasure or discord to a rival,\" a demonstration of the restraint used by states when engaging in cyberspace. Cyber weapons have limited applicability in their \"hurting\" capability even in more destructive incidences, such as the Stuxnet worm that destroyed Iranian nuclear centrifuges in Operation Olympic Games. Though intending to deter or delay Iran's nuclear weapons development, Operation Olympic Games ultimately bolstered Tehran's determination to restore and expand its nuclear research in Natanz (Sanger 2018: 42).\nWith this limitation in mind, it is important to note that hurt from cyber conflict still exists. Targeted countries may experience damages or disruptions to their institutions and networks, impacting daily operations or economic mobility. Similarly, non-cyber responses to cyber operations, such as sanctions, condemnation, or other negative foreign policy measures, may inflict damages on the perceived initiator of an attack. Therefore, hurt is present in cyber conflict. However, there is a critical distinction between kinetic and cyber hurt: the hurt is not exhaustive in cyber conflict. Since cyber conflict is non-escalatory and used as a first-response or low-intensity method of engagement (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015), the hurt it inflicts on the target is not equal to the painful deadlock prescribed by conventional MHS. Instead, this hurt is perpetually sustainable, akin to Zartman's idea of \"the soft, stable, and self-serving stalemate\" (S5).\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nPOLK\nAccording to Zartman, the S5 is \"a low-level conflict, even when punctuated by occasional blips of violence\" that \"leaves each of the parties ... able to claim that it has not been defeated, which is a victory of sorts\" (2005a: 52). The S5 typically describes intractable conflicts in the kinetic domain, explaining the absence of ripeness in pushing the conflicting parties towards a negotiated solution (Zartman 2005a). In conventional analysis, factors of protracted conflict, zero-sum identities, the profitability of continued fighting, mutually exclusive solutions, and deficient perceptions of ripeness contribute to intractability in kinetic conflict (Zartman 2005a: 59–60). However, these features are not all representative of cyber conflict.\nCyber operations are both the means and ends to accomplishing short-term goals, disrupting issues of protraction even if the conflict itself is perpetual. Furthermore, cyber conflicts often do not involve zero-sum identities unique to the dispute, although the cyber conflict may exacerbate pre-existing conflicts between states. Nevertheless, the issues of profitability, solution saliency, and ripeness are typical of cyber conflicts, which are defined by countervailing tradeoffs encouraging the perpetuation of the conflict (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 133), and diverging norms and interests hampering cyber agreements. As such, cyber conflicts share some features of intractable disputes, which are emblematic of S5. However, S5 is still insufficient for characterizing cyber conflict due to the uncertainty surrounding cyberspace and the unique nature of intractability in the digital realm.\nWith these limitations in mind, the standard perception of a hurting stalemate is improbable in cyber conflict, and a conventional ripe moment for negotiation would not be perceived. Instead, adjusting the criteria for a hurting stalemate reshapes the conditions for ripeness in cyber conflict. This new condition focuses on a \"mutually harming standoff,\" a condition on the spectrum between Zartman's theories of S5 and MHS that permits the lack of a hurting stalemate in cyber conflict.\n## Mutually Harming Standoff, Ripeness, and Cyber Negotiations\nA mutually harming standoff (which will be referred to as MHS2) is distinct from a mutually hurting stalemate (hereafter referred to as MHS1) since it emphasizes the perfunctory character of the pain and reciprocity in cyber conflict. The \"harm\" inflicted by cyber operations may have a negative impact on the targeted state, but it is not so unbearable that the state is incapable of persisting without a way out. In other words, the state is not pressed into seeking an alternative to the cyber conflict since the harm it experiences is not exhaustive. Furthermore, a \"standoff\" provides a better image than a stalemate. While the hurting stalemate represents unwinnable deadlocks that are\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8–36\nRIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\npainful to all parties (Zartman, 2000), the standoff is more akin to an effectively manageable, if not perpetual and harmful, dispute with high reciprocity and low escalation capacity (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 129). This captures the nature of cyber conflict and adapts a critical component of ripeness theory.\nIf MHS2 characterizes long-term cyber conflict, when and how can it be perceived? More importantly, how can negotiators operationalize MHS2 to encourage cyber negotiations if a ripe moment is improbable in cyber conflict? Both questions are linked to another component of ripeness theory: mutually enticing opportunity (MEO). In Zartman's ripeness theory, perceptions of MHS1 are necessary, if insufficient, for encouraging parties to engage in dialogue as a way out of conventional conflict. This may be supplemented by perceptions of an MEO, which acts as the pull-factor for parties to engage in and continue negotiations (Zartman 2000: 241-242). Zartman acknowledges that few cases of conventional conflict demonstrate the opening of negotiations due to perceptions of an MEO alone. However, these perceptions help encourage parties to commit to negotiations once they commence (Zartman 2000: 241-242). Still, since conventional MHS1 does not exist in cyber conflict, realizing an MHS2 coupled with perceptions of an MEO can push rival cyber parties toward negotiations.\nFigure 3 presents an adaptation of the standard stages of the conflict arc for cyber disputes. In this depiction, MHS2 represents the state of the conflict from the time of emergence. This shows that without escalatory capacities, cyber conflicts are inherently defined by the perpetual reciprocity of cyber\nFIGURE 3 Stages of cyber conflict\nADAPTED FROM BRAHM (2003)\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nPOLK\nattacks between states, continuing the plateau indefinitely as conflict persists in a low intensity and restrained manner. To disrupt this, the perception of an MEO is necessary to act as the new push-factor for parties to enter and commit to negotiations.\nIn cyber conflict, the MEO can manifest in several ways. These incentives may appear at different thresholds of pain throughout the dispute and encourage states to consider negotiations under various circumstances. Like MHS1, MHS2 pain thresholds are perceptual, and thus MEO S will be subjective from case to case (Zartman 2005b). Analyzing an array of MEO S showcases potential push-factor attributes unique to the nature of cyberspace that could encourage cyber conflict negotiation.\nNorms development collaboration. Like conventional conflicts, both parties may inherently view alternatives to victory that do not include tit-for-tat cyber exchanges. This may have limitations pending each party's goals in conducting cyber operations, but the opportunity to collaborate may displace the benefits of using digital tools against rivals. This collaboration leads to an impactful and enticing opportunity for negotiation: norms development. Given the standard of uncertainty in the cyber realm, states can attempt to shape the digital world in their image by collaborating to bilaterally develop and diffuse norms that meet their interests on a global scale. In other words, by leveraging the perception that normative interests are more far-reaching and achievable through bilateral collaboration, negotiators may be more successful in pushing conflicting parties to the table to coordinate on broader issues that both address and extend beyond the ongoing conflict.\nThe MEO for norms development collaboration is especially pertinent in cyber conflicts where the targets are primarily private and government non-military infrastructure. This represents one threshold for pain on the lattice of MHS2 ripeness; when attacks are apparent and far-reaching in their impact on the public, states are more likely to respond negatively (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 125). This is because many states view public interference in cyberspace as \"crossing a line\" in the digital realm, despite the lack of norms or agreements dictating this taboo (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015). Conversely, in cyber conflicts where attacks primarily target political and military networks, \"victim\" states are less likely to react with a negative or conflict-prone response (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 123-124). This suggests that cyber conflicts which focus on traditional government-to-government attacks, including infiltrations and intrusions through Trojans and APTs, are likely to present the norm for cyber conflict (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015). On the other hand, DDoS attacks are more obvious in their display of aggression since they interfere with public websites and systems, and states are more likely to respond negatively to the attack due to pressure from the public impacted by the incident.\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nRIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nCyber conflicts that reach MHS2 thresholds, in which public infrastructure is the primary target, can present an MEO for parties to meet to recalibrate norms for cyberspace conduct. For example, suppose the cyber conflict is characterized by long-run DDoS attacks or infiltrations targeting non-military private and government networks. In that case, participants may use these perceived violations as an opportunity to collaborate and bilaterally promote norms in cyber conflict that benefit both parties. In other words, while perpetuating the tit-for-tat cycle of the cyber conflict is a non-escalatory option, continued DDoS attacks may present reasonable grounds for decision-makers to examine alternatives to the conflict, thereby seeking innovative solutions for a way out of MHS2. Furthermore, considering the absence of concrete norms in cyberspace, parties may view the chance to negotiate and act as norm-makers as a mutually enticing opportunity.\nProtean power. In addition to norms development collaboration, the opportunity for states to demonstrate \"protean power\" is an enticing opportunity for decision-makers to choose negotiation in cyber conflict. This form of power, coined by Katzenstein and Seybert in 2018, counters the aforementioned \"control power\" and acknowledges the importance of creativity and innovation in decision-making when facing increasingly uncertain international dynamics. Due to the uncertain nature of cyberspace, successful navigation and utility of the digital realm require states to remain innovative, flexible, and agile in responding to rapid changes in technology or when dealing with crises where assurances in risk analyses are limited. As such, the negotiating table is the ideal medium for states to gain and exhibit protean power since the choice to negotiate in cyber conflict is a strategic, albeit inventive and pioneering option that may result in relative gains for both states.\nMoreover, states will likely view the display of protean power as a complement or, in some cases, substitute to other conventional understandings of power dynamics, such as hard power. As Katzenstein and Seybert (2018: 25) put it, \"the world is well stocked with low-probability events such as the sudden appearance of terrorist organizations operating on a global scale and waves of large-scale human migration.\" Therefore, displaying creative prowess in the face of ambiguity, instability, and uncertainty is vital for actors \"to derive relative advantage from unexpected challenges\" (Katzenstein &amp; Seybert 2018: 25). In cyber conflict, states that choose to negotiate over a continuation of tit-for-tat exchanges that prolong the status quo of MHS2 are more likely to be perceived as adaptable and inventive in responding to uncertainty surrounding the nature of cyberspace and geopolitics in this domain. Consequently, states that choose negotiation in cyber conflict have a stronger capacity for protean power, making them more durable and influential in handling increasingly complex dynamics in world politics.\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nPOLK\nSmall state influence. Similarly, small states may be uniquely positioned to act on a push-factor MEO in cyber conflict since the newness of the domain presents opportunities for gaining leverage in the international arena. Following the benefits of protean power, the opportunity to demonstrate influence over rival states through innovation and improvisation in cyber conflict management incentivizes smaller states to push for negotiation as a means of alleviating tensions. This then acts as a push-factor MEO for smaller states seeking greater power in the international arena at large, especially since the democratic layout of cyberspace allows for ease of entry to new actors. In turn, larger states may be incentivized to negotiate in cyber conflict to further extend their influence in the digital realm, as well as the physical one.\nCross-conflict negotiation leverage. Finally, rival states with ongoing non-cyber tensions may be incentivized to negotiate as an avenue for leverage in other conflict domains. In other words, states with ongoing geopolitical tensions, such as the US and Russia, Japan and South Korea, or India and Pakistan, may be able to bargain agreements made in cyberspace with concessions in other negotiations or settlements. This also presents another scenario in which pain thresholds may be achieved in MHS2. Cyber conflicts that persist alongside other tensions or conflicts will prompt heightened sensitivities and feelings of annoyance between rivals. Yet, the digital realm remains the ideal medium for achieving cooperation or relative gains between rivals despite this distrust. The cyber domain provides an opportunity for norms development, an exhibition of power, and leverage in other conflict settlements. Thus, cyber conflicts between historic rival states are likely to perceive the status quo as a threshold of pain that makes an MEO for cooperation in the digital world appealing. Moreover, if the rivals perceive an opportunity to achieve non-cyber gains through cyber conflict negotiations, the parties already in conflict may consider this a push-factor MEO in cyberspace.\nThis MEO is well-suited for states engaged in regional conflict, a feature that Valeriano and Maness (2105: 81) note as being one of the most common fora for cyber conflict. For example, Japan and South Korea have deep-seated hostilities, ranging from disagreements over maritime control to enmities founded on the Korean peninsula's history of Japanese occupation. Many cyber-attacks between the two countries reflect these tensions, with both countries engaging in tit-for-tat exchanges between 2001 and 2011 (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 88). Interestingly, Japanese decision-makers often choose \"more cooperative interactions with their regional rivals\" despite ongoing cyber conflicts, suggesting a desire not to escalate tensions with nearby states (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 123). It follows, then, that regional rivals may have an MEO to use cyberspace as a platform for negotiation to influence overall tensions since the alternative is maintaining the status quo and perpetuating ongoing hostilities.\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nRIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nLastly, rivals may be incentivized to negotiate cyber conflict since they could gain greater international influence where their interests align. Again, Japan and South Korea exemplify this. Since both states are closely aligned with US interests (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 216), agreements between the two, especially those that impact both the cyber and physical domains, may strengthen their standing with the US and against larger rivals like China. As such, this opportunity for both mutual and relative gains acts as a push-factor for entrenched rival states to pursue cyber conflict negotiation.\nIn sum, conventional ripeness theory is limited in cyber conflict since mutually hurting stalemates (MHS1) are unattainable in cyberspace. Instead, a mutually harming standoff (MHS2) is more characteristic of the state of tit-for-tat cyber conflicts, where parties experience adverse effects from reciprocal attacks, but not at an unsustainable level. When long-term cyber conflict is recognized as an MHS2, specific attributes of the attacks may be operationalized to enact a push-factor MEO that encourages the parties to negotiate. These MEOs may hinge on the opportunity for cyber combatants to act as norm-makers by pursuing bilateral agreements that resolve the conflict and improve conduct in cyberspace or may focus on displays of protean power as small states or historic rivals. To represent this process, Figure 4 illustrates an adaptation of Zartman's conventional ripeness theory and negotiation progression to denote the push and pull aspects of MHS2 in cyber conflict. Here, MHS2 is presented\nFIGURE 4 Elements of Mutually Harming Standoff (MHS2) and the process of negotiation\nADAPTED FROM ZARTMAN (2000: 230, 242)\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nPOLK\nas the state of the conflict, while the push-factor MEO is a dependent variable requiring both parties' perception. Only after this perception is operationalized will the parties pursue negotiation as a way out of cyber conflict.\n## 2015 US-China Cybersecurity Agreement\nThe 2015 US-China Cybersecurity Agreement illustrates how MHS2 and MEO push-factors adapt the concept of timing in cyber conflict negotiations. These negotiations produced a cybersecurity agreement that established a precedent for defining economically motivated cyber espionage (EMCE) (Harold, Libicki, &amp; Stuth Cevallos 2016: 46). This demonstrates that norm-making is an attractive prospect for cyber negotiations following an MHS2, especially due to the uncertain and nebulous environment which characterizes cyberspace. The US-China agreement also showcases the limitations of applying current ripeness theory models to a bilateral cyber conflict. An overview of the US-China cyber conflict and its corresponding negotiations demonstrates how ripeness theory can be adjusted in cyber conflict to determine the timing of cyber negotiations.\n## Background: US-China Cyber Conflict\nThe US-China cyber conflict roughly began in 2003 and has predominately consisted of cyber espionage operations between the two countries (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 91–92). This characterization is key to the perpetuity of the conflict, and it is essential to examine both countries' stances on cyberspace and the rulebook by which they operate. First, the United States extends its values regarding individual freedoms and independence to the cyber realm (Brown &amp; Yung 2017a). The US government emphasizes online freedom of expression, liberal information flows, and data privacy in its national cybersecurity policies, and uses these values as the basis for which it evaluates foreign attacks on US networks (Brown &amp; Yung 2017a; Segal 2015). This is especially true for cyber espionage. According to Brown and Yung (2017a), the US makes distinctions between forms of espionage based on their objective, stating that \"in the US view, as long as such operations collect information about economic and financial matters for the purpose of benefiting national security, they are routine intelligence work.\" In this case, corporate espionage for the economic benefit of private companies is considered off-limits.\nChina also applies its political ideologies to cyberspace operations, and these values contradict the United States. At the forefront of China's cybersecurity strategy is the idea of Internet sovereignty, a norm shared by other\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nRIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\ngovernments to promote state control over networks within their territory (Brown &amp; Yung 2017b). The Chinese government advocates for states to set their own rules regarding cyberspace and pursues digital independence from the US, which owns most of the world's IP addresses and has been heavy-handed in Internet governance (Brown &amp; Yung 2017b; Singer &amp; Friedman 2014: 140; Levite &amp; Jinghua 2019). Furthermore, China rejects the militarization of cyberspace, accusing the US of securitizing the digital domain and aggressively developing \"cyber arms\" in response to activities by perceived rivals like Russia and China (Brown &amp; Yung 2017b).\nIt is this argument that is crucial to China's cyber operations. In China's view, the US' aggressive pursuit of offensive cyber capabilities necessitates China's cyber development (Brown &amp; Yung 2017a; Singer &amp; Friedman 2014: 140). Additionally, China's stance on cyber espionage makes no distinction between operations pursuing an economic advantage versus a national security advantage (Sanger 2018: 70). Instead, China \"views economic competition as a way to achieve peer status with the US and sees cyberspace as an asymmetric instrument which it can successfully use to compete with the United States\" (Brown &amp; Yung 2017a). Thus, the Chinese agenda pursues cyber espionage for economic advantage as \"a quasi-legitimate way to achieve a North-South redistribution of wealth\" (Inkster 2017: 72). China's cyber policies aim to level the imbalance between the West and China and promote norms of self-determination in cyberspace.\nIn the US-China cyber conflict, various cyber weapons were used. Between 2003 and 2006, the Titan Rain attack employed Trojans, or unauthorized software that permits access to a system or program, to infiltrate US government and contracting networks such as the State Department and Lockheed Martin (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 34; Rid 2012: 20). This attack was attributed to the Chinese government, as was the 2006 intrusion by the APT \"Shady RAT,\" which stole secret information related to negotiation strategies, manufacturing design plans, and US national security policies (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 91; Singer &amp; Friedman 2014: 92). The international hack by GhostNet, which lasted from 2007 to 2009, utilized phishing scams to acquire access to computer microphones and cameras, allowing hackers to record conversations by State Department and Pentagon officials (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 131). This, along with other long-run intrusions and thefts, was again attributed to the Chinese government.\nIn response, US agencies retaliated against Chinese institutions by employing defensive cyber attacks. Operation Cisco Raider lasted from 2006 to 2010 and attempted to counter the distribution of counterfeit Cisco technology stolen in a Chinese hack (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 91). Another operation,\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nPOLK\nBuckshot Yankee, responded against a hack of US defense networks (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 91). Finally, the long-term operation, Shotgiant, aimed to link the Chinese telecommunications firm, Huawei, to the People's Liberation Army (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 91; Sanger &amp; Perlroth 2014; Sanger 2018). This operation also endeavored to \"exploit Huawei's technology so that when the company sold equipment to other countries ... the NSA could roam through their computer and telephone networks to conduct surveillance and, if ordered by the president, offensive cyberoperations\" (Sanger &amp; Perlroth 2014). As such, the US-China cyber conflict included exchanges of offensive and retaliatory operations between the two nations to combat diverging normative values regarding espionage.\n## Cyber Negotiations\nThroughout the cyber conflict, US-China tensions never escalated to kinetic force. Instead, the conflict remained tit-for-tat, with both governments suffering from espionage that notably affected both military and non-military private and government entities. Due to the dispute's long-term, low intensity, and restrained nature, the US-China cyber conflict gradually developed into an MHS2.\nThe MHS2 permitted both governments to continue with their cyber attacks. However, in 2009 they began to engage in Track Two diplomatic talks between the US think-tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) and China's Institute of Contemporary International Relations (CICIR) (Segal 2015). What pushed the countries towards informal dialogue? According to one Chinese official, dialogue is a better alternative to perpetual conflict because both countries are capable of continued operations but would be better served by negotiating to settle their disagreements (Singer &amp; Friedman 2014). This represents the push-factor MEO, which promotes dialogue for norms establishment between two cyber rivals.\nThe Track Two talks further reflect the impact of MEOs for norm diffusion, with the first of these informal dialogues beginning in December 2009. Early dialogues focused on addressing both states' concerns about cyber sovereignty, cyberspace norms, multilateralism in addressing cybercrime, and confidence-building in cyberspace (CSIS 2009). These informal dialogues continued in addition to Track 1.5 discussions and alternated between Washington, DC and Beijing throughout the process. Eventually, discussions regarding cyber espionage and what it constitutes emerged alongside the issues of cyber sovereignty, governance, and US primacy in cyberspace (Harold, Libicki &amp; Stuth Cevallos 2016). It should be noted that these dialogues were \"were marked more by continuity than change,\" with participants on both sides maintaining their stances\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nRIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\non definitions of terms and values (Harold, Libicki &amp; Stuth Cevallos 2016: 49). Yet the governments' willingness to meet to discuss their stances in the cyber conflict signals an interesting push for a resolution in cyber conflict, without the need of a hurting stalemate.\nThese dialogues continued in a Track Two and Track 1.5 capacity, and by 2013, Track One negotiations commenced. However, these talks were interrupted in 2014 after the US indicted five People's Liberation Army officials with cyber espionage charges (Harold, Libicki &amp; Stuth Cevallos 2016; Brown &amp; Yung 2017a). The indictment asserted that members of the Chinese military stole trade secrets from US industries to bolster China's competitiveness in the international market. In response, the Chinese government walked away from the negotiations and asserted that the US accusations were hypocritical in light of the 2013 NSA leaks (Brown &amp; Yung 2017a). However, the talks resumed the following summer, and in September 2015, US President Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping released a statement on a new Cybersecurity Agreement (Harold, Libicki &amp; Stuth Cevallos 2016). The two governments agreed to improve coordination in investigating and preventing cybercrime, not conduct or support cyber intellectual property theft, and improve cooperation in promoting international norms in cyberspace (Obama 2015).\nThe 2015 Agreement achieved both mixed results and mixed reactions. Though some scholars believe that China's agreement on the existence of economically motivated cyber espionage (EMCE) is an incremental step in reducing cyber intellectual property theft, few believe it has since decreased (Brown &amp; Yung 2017c). There has been continued concern about the quality of the agreement and China's adherence to the terms (Brown &amp; Yung 2017c). While the negotiators were able to successfully agree on cyber-specific definitions of EMCE, a significant achievement in cyber norm development, gaps in the agreement have allowed both countries to exploit technicalities in the agreement. For example, though reports suggest a decrease in Chinese economic espionage, it appears that \"Chinese operators are going after technologies that are dual-use [such as telecommunications industries], and so might not be covered by the agreements\" (Segal 2017). Similarly, the US espionage operations against Huawei have persisted, with non-cyber sanctions and indictments attacking company leadership due to the recent dispute over 5G, surveillance, and data privacy (Whalen 2020).\n## Analysis\nDespite the weaknesses of the US-China Cybersecurity Agreement, the existence of the cyber negotiations sets a unique precedent regarding the timing of bilateral dialogues in cyber conflict. The concepts of MHS2 and push-factor\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nmeo demonstrate how ripeness can be determined within cyber disputes, thus adapting Zartman's original theory to a new domain of conflict. Reviewing the conditions of ripeness in the US-China cyber conflict helps capture the applicability of mhs2 and meo in cyber conflict.\nThroughout the US-China cyber dispute, long-term operations and attacks generated an entrenched and enduring conflict between two cyber rivals. The use of intrusive cyber weapons to conduct espionage on non-military targets prompted the exchange of attacks, and the diverging perspectives on cyber and espionage norms deepened the tensions between the two countries. In this case, the conflict's perpetuity embodied an mhs2, with both countries receiving damages in their economic and political security due to cyber and non-cyber retaliations. Even so, both countries were caught in a standoff rather than a stalemate since these damages were not exhaustive, permanent, or fatigue-inducing. In fact, both countries focused on long-term cyber weaponry, like apts and Trojans, to conduct lengthy operations that were sustainable regardless of the harm dealt to each government in response.\nWith this perpetual-while-manageable standoff reached, both countries continued to conduct their cyber operations against one another. Nevertheless, the opportunity to collaborate on norms development was the meo that pushed both governments towards negotiation. This was first captured and operationalized at the informal level. Through the Track Two dialogues, the US and Chinese think tanks provided a platform for sharing and understanding each other's values and perspectives of cyberspace and security. This informal communication linked the two governments, regardless of the conflict's perpetuity, and provided the opportunity for cooperation in norm-making and diffusion. This was especially enticing considering that the UN Group of Governmental Experts (UN gge) on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace has convened multiple times throughout the US-China conflict to establish international norms in cyberspace (gip Digital Watch Observatory 2021). If the US and China could bilaterally collaborate on cyberspace norms, their influence in international norm-making would be especially prominent and allow both countries to demonstrate their protean power in a new and uncertain domain.\nTrack 1.5 and Track One dialogues between the two governments further demonstrate this dedication to coordination in resolving the cyber conflict while establishing rules for conduct in cyberspace. Though the ultimate agreement may have failed in effectively instituting these norms, the fact that understanding was reached on the definition of emce is significant. The US and China's commitment to establishing norms in cyberspace to resolve the cyber conflict is therefore an important example of cyber negotiations. Future\nRIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\n33\ndialogues may rely on this achievement as evidence for the norm developing capacity of cyber negotiations and explore the use of bilateral fora as a means for innovating, developing, and diffusing norms in cyber conflict.\n# Conclusion\nThe emergence of new technologies undoubtedly impacts geopolitical conduct between states and influences rivalries old and new as a domain for conflict. Cyber conflict, regardless of its potential to supplant conventional warfare, has surfaced as a new source of tension between states, one that is ill-defined and difficult to regulate. As such, developing capacities for resolving cyber conflict requires new approaches to negotiation and mediation, and revisiting ripeness theory allows scholars and practitioners to adapt prevailing negotiation strategies to new realms of conflict.\nDue to the nature of cyber conflict, conventional ideas of ripeness theory are inadequate for deciding when to begin cyber negotiations. Limitations in escalation, the perception of cyber operations as \"escalatory offramps,\" countervailing tradeoffs in the use of cyber tools, and the first-use character of cyber weapons prevent states from perceiving mutually hurting stalemates in tit-for-tat cyber conflict. Therefore, modifying the definition of a hurting stalemate better captures the nature of cyber conflict and offers an alternative for timing negotiations. \"Mutually harming standoff\" is more emblematic of the plateau in cyber conflict since both states may feel the consequences of the conflict, but to a manageable and sustainable degree. When long-term cyber conflict is reached, an MHS2 has taken effect, and combining it with the component of mutually enticing opportunity will push actors towards cyber negotiations.\nThe MEO, while operating as a pull-factor in kinetic conflict, serves a more significant role in propelling conflicting parties toward negotiations because cyberspace provides incentives for collaboration over conflict. Though vested with the capacity for continued cyber conflict, rival states may perceive the opportunities to collaborate on norms development, exercise protean power, or gain leverage in external conflicts as ideal for promoting their agendas on cyberspace bilaterally. This is captured by the case of the US-China Cybersecurity Agreement.\nIn this instance, the reciprocal cyber conflict between the US and China was characterized by an MHS2. Nonetheless, the governments seized the opportunity to engage in norm-making through dialogue instead of unilaterally trying to \"win\" in cyber conflict. These negotiations evolved from informal Track Two discussions to Track One negotiation and agreement between American and\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nPOLK\nChinese leadership, thus providing precedent for a bilateral negotiation to a pure \"cyber conflict.\" Though the agreement itself has flaws, the timing of the negotiation signals that MHS1 is not necessary and is better characterized by an MHS2. In addition, the MEO is a stronger and more necessary (if insufficient) component for achieving ripeness in cyber conflict.\nFuture research on the negotiation or mediation process may provide greater clarity on achieving more successful cyber agreements in the future. Likewise, examining the strategies of multilateral cyber negotiations and their impact on norms development would impact the nature of state-to-state cyber conflict. Such evolutions will necessitate further research as new capabilities and dynamics emerge. In the meantime, exploring other cyber conflicts, such as those between long-term rivals like the US-Russia, India-Pakistan, and North Korea-South Korea, may provide a prescriptive application of the adapted ripeness theory.\nThe application of ripeness theory, like conflict itself, is continually evolving. New technologies and conflict domains shape peace efforts and strategies in practical and academic application. In cyber conflict, adjusting the components of ripeness theory to include mutually harming standoffs and MEOs demonstrates how negotiation practices can shift to address emerging threats and realms of uncertainty that characterize new domains of conflict. Without this adjustment, cyber conflicts and other new realms for war, remain out of reach for resolution.",

As the world becomes more interconnected through digital means, a potential \"fifth domain\" for conflict has emerged in the cyber realm , inviting scholars to debate the nature of cyber attacks, cyber espionage, and disinformation campaigns as \"cyber warfare\" . With the emergence of cyberwar as a key buzzword in political and academic spheres, the question of how to resolve cyber conflicts shifts the focus to negotiation theory.\nAnalysis of cyber conflict presents a challenge to the prevailing negotiation concept, ripeness theory. Ripeness theory posits that the timing of a negotiation stems from the conflicting parties' perception of a \"mutually hurting stalemate\" (MHS) and \"a way out\" of conflict through dialogue . While this theory has shown merit for negotiations related to conventional warfare or economic disputes, there are gaps in its applicability for resolving cyber conflict. Specifically, the concept of a \"hurting stalemate\" has little to no presence in cyber disputes, rendering MHS incompatible with pure cyber negotiations. As such, redefining mutually hurting stalemate for cyber conflict is paramount to address this discrepancy.\nThis analysis attempts to adapt prevailing negotiation theory for conflicts in the cyber domain. First, an overview of what constitutes cyber conflict is provided, the state of its norms and regulations, and the uncertain nature of cyberspace. Second, an analysis of ripeness theory in conventional and cyber conflict highlights the current gaps in negotiation literature when applied to an evolving form of conflict. Third, redefining the idea of MHS by suggesting an alternative, \"mutually harming standoff,\" offers an examination into the timing discrepancy surrounding cyberspace agreements. Lastly, examining the 2015 bilateral US-China Cybersecurity Agreement provides context for applying this hypothesis and demonstrates how accepted negotiation theory may be applied to cyber conflict.\n# Defining Cyber Conflict: Terms, Norms, and the Rise of Uncertainty\nThe definitions of \"cyber conflict\" or \"cyberwarfare\" are a source of contention throughout the international community. There is a lack of shared understanding for terms related to cyberspace, with some scholars arguing that the preoccupation with cyber warfare has little merit. While some governments, academics, and media outlets overemphasize the threat of a \"cyber Pearl Harbor,\" these warnings are more speculative and extreme than reality would suggest (Singer &amp; Friedman 2014: 68). If applying a Clausewitzian understanding of war, which emphasizes its violence, instrumental character, and political\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nPOLK\nnature, it appears that cyberwar has yet to occur, as no cyber attack has met these three criteria .\nRegardless of the debate on the reality of cyber warfare, the fact remains that cyberspace activities continue to shape and threaten geopolitical relations. Offensive cyber exchanges in the digital realm have exacerbated international tensions between technological powerhouses such as the United States, Russia, and China, and developing consensus on the broader idea of “cyber conflict” is pertinent to establishing a new approach to diplomacy on the issue of cyberspace. For this article, we will adopt a broad definition of “cyber conflict” to include information operations between two or more entities that intentionally undermine the economic, political, social, or security systems of states, businesses, and organizations. This definition incorporates such concepts as “cyber espionage,” “disinformation campaigns,” “cyber sabotage,” and “cyberterrorism,” representing tactics initiated or sponsored by states (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015).\nExamples of cyber conflict include the continuous use of cyber operations or the means through which states conduct cyber attacks against the same entity over time. These conflicts are reciprocal, characterized by tit-for-tat cyber exchanges between countries, and may also employ non-cyber means in an effort to deter future attacks, such as sanctions or public condemnation. Cyber conflict includes the use of advanced persistent threats (APTs) to spy on corporate activities or the development and deployment of malicious software to cause physical damage to infrastructure. Cyber operations may use an array of cyber weapons, from the application of botnets in distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks that shut down government websites to the creation of Trojans and backdoors, which infiltrate and sabotage computer networks (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 34). These parameters highlight the scope of the issues and features that shape cyber conflicts and the ambiguities surrounding their nature.\nConversely, this definition does not include small-scale “cybercrime,” which tends to be a for-profit enterprise that does not center on ideology or political gain (Singer &amp; Friedman 2014: 145–155). It also does not include attacks perpetrated by individuals or non-state-sponsored criminal organizations since these efforts more often constitute “cybercrime” and are one-off rogue actions intended to cause chaos or malice rather than achieve policy goals (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 33). Lastly, the article focuses on “pure” cyber conflict, thus dismissing incidences of cyber attacks as part of larger military campaigns or hybrid warfare. While negotiations on conventional conflicts may address concerns relating to cyberspace, kinetic wars are characterized differently from cyber conflicts, as discussed later in the article.\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8–36\nRIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\n# Cyber Norms and Consensus\nDisagreements over what constitutes cyber conflict impact the establishment of international norms for addressing cyber operations. Numerous arrangements have attempted to codify norms for regulating cyberspace and expanding international law to include the digital domain. The Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare is one effort to establish consensus on cyber conflict. This document, first published in 2013, attempts to apply existing international law to cyber conflicts while defining \"cyber attacks\" and \"cyber self-defense\" . However, the Tallinn Manual has no legal standing, and many countries have rejected the arguments it presents (Singer &amp; Friedman 2014: 206). As a result, binding consensus on how states should govern and regulate cyberspace remains indefinite and allows for multiple interpretations of what justifies an attack.\nOther efforts to establish norms in cyberspace involve international processes to develop standards of conduct in the cyber realm. Since 1998, motions to formulate cyber arms control treaties and propagate agreements on cyber governance have shaped international agendas . From intergovernmental institutions like the UN to think tank-led working groups, numerous negotiations and dialogues have been under way to improve the stability and security of cyberspace. These initiatives include ongoing fora such as the UN Group of Governmental Experts (UN GGE) and the UN Open-Ended Working Group (UN OEWG), both aimed at developing interstate cyber norms and applying international law to cyberspace . Other efforts include the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace, a coalition of cybersecurity experts that promotes specific cyber norms, and the Paris Call, a \"multistakeholder initiative led by the French government and supported by Microsoft,\" which seeks to mainstream cyber norms outside of interstate dialogues .\nThe credibility of their participants legitimizes these formats, whether it is the legitimacy of the UN process or the inclusivity of multiple stakeholders, such as businesses, think tanks, and non-profits, in building standards for cyberspace . However, Ruhl et al. note that these efforts are constrained due to four factors. For one, the evolving nature of cyberspace impedes the development of sustainable norms, and the presence of multiple actors with varying interests inhibits the regulation of norm adherence in cyberspace. Second, states' cyber activities are often secretive and unknown, thus obstructing the implementation of international standards for cyberspace. Third, disagreement between great powers on cyberspace norms can frustrate agreements. For example, Russian and Chinese demands for greater state sovereignty in cyberspace are countered by the US' assertion for free and\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nPOLK\nindependent Internet access. Fourth, weak incentives to adhere to cyberspace norms can reduce the impact and sustainability of international agreements. In contrast, \"states with significant cyber capabilities seem ready and willing to employ them to advance their interests,\" presenting an incentive for states to dismiss norms or limit their scope of adherence . Therefore, the multilateral fora for establishing cyberspace norms currently faces significant limitations in their effectiveness, generating a high level of uncertainty in the domain of cyberspace.\n## Uncertainty in the Digital Realm\nThe uncertain nature of cyberspace and norms creates difficulties for dispute resolution. Unlike conventional conflict, where risks, calculations, and capacities are known in an exercise of \"control power,\" cyber conflict occurs in a realm of uncertainty, potentiality, and improvisation (Katzenstein &amp; Seybert, 2018). The \"fog of uncertainty\" (Katzenstein &amp; Seybert 2018: 36) limits states' abilities to know how cyberspace will evolve, who the actors are, and what their capabilities may entail, thus preventing states from assessing the long-term ramifications of a cyber attack's impact. The nebulousness of cyberspace results not in deterrence but in restraint, which Valeriano and Maness (2015: 54) describe as a \"policy outcome but not necessarily a process\" for states' limited use of cyber tools. Therefore, this restraint is a consequence of the ambiguity and insecurity characterizing cyberspace, suggesting that certainties regarding states' intentions and cyber capabilities are unattainable, thereby reducing the risk of escalation in cyber conflict.\nEscalation represents an \"increase in the intensity of a conflict and in the severity of the tactics used in pursuing it\"  and is crucial to the perception of ripeness in conflict. However, states' restraint in using cyber tools impedes the prominence of both escalation and ripeness in cyber conflict, a discrepancy which will be addressed in the next section. The uncertainty of cyberspace and the limitations of cyber norms results in weak perceptions of states' digital activities. The vagueness of cyberspace is an impediment to determining what should be negotiated, let alone when negotiations should be conducted. Analyzing the concept of \"ripeness\" in cyber conflict will answer the question of when states should negotiate on matters of cyberspace.\n## Overview of Ripeness Theory\nAs previously stated, Zartman's \"ripeness theory\" presents a condition for the timing and beginning of negotiation (2001). Ripeness is a perceptual event that\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nRIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nstems from the belief in a Mutually Hurting Stalemate (MHS) or a Mutually Enticing Opportunity (MEO) . Zartman defines MHS as the moment when \"parties find themselves locked in a conflict from which they cannot escalate to victory and this deadlock is painful to both of them\" (2008). This deadlock may be depicted as a plateau, a stalemate where the costs of continuing the violence outweigh the benefits, with both parties suffering from the ongoing conflict. Similarly, a catastrophic event, or a precipice, may threaten or have influenced perceptions of the conflict and impart a stalemate. To quote Zartman (2001: 8), \"the catastrophe provides a deadline or a lesson indicating that pain can be sharply increased if something is not done about it now.\" Upon the perception of an MHS, both parties recognize that the probability of unilaterally winning the conflict is decreased, making the stalemate more foreboding.\nIn response to the perception of a stalemate, the conflicting parties may attempt to seize the moment by pursuing a \"way out\" of the conflict, sustained by an MEO , through negotiation. Zartman's theory is displayed in Figure 1, which demonstrates the push and pull factors that lead to the decision and commitment to negotiate.\nIt should be noted that ripeness is merely a condition for encouraging states to negotiate an end to the conflict, one that is \"necessary, but not sufficient\" . As such, the propensity for success in cyber negotiation is not guaranteed in seizing the ripe moment for dialogue. Analysis of ripeness theory's application in conventional and cyber conflict demonstrates how the concept of a stalemate leads (or does not lead) to the perception that the timing is suitable for negotiation as an alternative to continued fighting.\nFIGURE 1 Elements of conventional ripeness theory and the process of negotiation ADAPTED FROM ZARTMAN (2000: 230, 242)\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nPOLK\n# Ripeness and Conventional Conflict\nIn kinetic warfare, ripeness theory holds merit. Conventional conflict may be escalated and then plateaued, as defined by an MHS, thus presenting an opportunity for seeking a way out through negotiation. Zartman (2008) illustrates this by stating that \"to ripen a conflict one must raise the level of conflict until the stalemate is reached and then further until it begins to hurt – and even then, work toward a perception of an impending catastrophe as well.\" This captures the idea behind MHS – a perceived stalemate must be generated for both sides, with the parties incurring unsustainable or unbearable costs in the long run even when there is no prospect for further escalation. Brahm illustrates the role of MHS as a tipping point or push-factor towards negotiation by depicting conventional conflict as a cresting wave (see Figure 2). After the emergence of the conflict, continuous escalation of hostilities leads to or threatens an impending catastrophe, the precipice of the wave at which point an MHS has occurred . If the MHS is perceived, it may push the parties towards de-escalation and negotiation, and confidence-building measures and the perception of an MEO can pull the parties closer toward an agreement and the end of the conflict .\nIn conventional conflict, weaponry and strategic maneuvers are useful in this pursuit of a stalemate since conventional weaponry varies in scale, targeting, and scope of damage. For example, during the Bosnian War, NATO's use of cruise missiles and stealth planes in \"Operation Deliberate Force\" destroyed 338 Serbian targets. The Bosnian Serbs perceived the use of US Navy Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles (TLAMs) and F-117 bombers as a major escalation by\nFIGURE 2 Stages of conflict\nADAPTED FROM BRAHM (2003)\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nRIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nNATO , and this campaign helped to push the Serbs to return to the Dayton Accords in late 1995 . By employing weaponry or strategy, practitioners in conventional conflict are able to achieve a stalemate by escalating the hostilities on the ground. Therefore, the role of escalation is integral to achieving MHS since it results in perceptions “that there has been a significant qualitative change in the conflict as a result of the new development” . When both parties escalate to unattainable levels, the conventional conflict plateaus while the sides experience mutual hurt.\nThese conflicts are then considered ripe for negotiation, and the moment may be seized to initiate negotiations and resolve the conflict. Examples of ripeness theory in kinetic conflict have been perceived in the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah War, the Yugoslav Wars in the 1990s, and the Angolan Civil War (Schrodt, Yilmaz &amp; Gerner 2003; Touval 2002: 167; Zartman 2000). In these cases, military escalation of conflict or mediator-induced perceptions of MHS pushed parties to commit to dialogue processes . As such, ripeness theory has strong applicability in cases of conventional conflict.\n## Ripeness and Cyber Conflict\nIn contrast, cyber conflicts do not have the same characteristics as conventional warfare. Cyber operations are not inherently escalatory, and using cyber means to intensify a cyber conflict to the point of ripeness is improbable. For one, states view cyber operations as de facto “escalatory offramps,” or alternatives to costly kinetic conflict that still signal state displeasure or aim to influence rivals’ behavior (Jensen &amp; Valeriano 2019: 2). As such, decision-makers are often inclined to use cyber operations as an extension of foreign policy because they are not escalatory. If faced with increased tensions with rival governments, states have displayed a preference for choosing cyber responses as a form of “sub-crisis maneuvering” or exit from heightened conflict (Jensen &amp; Valeriano 2019: 4).\nA 2019 survey of US, Russian, and Israeli civilians further demonstrates this perspective that cyber conflict is non-escalatory. In this study, respondents in all three countries showed a general preference for non-escalatory responses to cyber attacks in scenarios where the victim state had the capacity to respond with an in-kind cyber weapon (Jensen &amp; Valeriano 2019: 6). Respondents from Russia voted in favor of de-escalatory responses to cyber attacks, while citizens from the US and Israel most often favored proportional responses to the initial attack (Jensen &amp; Valeriano 2019: 7). All three countries had low responses expressing a preference for escalation against a cyber attack. These findings express a tendency to view cyber conflict as a non-escalatory domain (Jensen\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nPOLK\n&amp; Valeriano 2019), thereby casting doubt on the notion that responses to cyber operations could result in an escalation between two parties.\nEven in the most severe cases of cyber attacks, such as disruptions of critical infrastructure, victim states have exhibited a preference for non-escalatory response rather than escalatory action. The real-world examples of the 2015 and 2016 attacks on Ukrainian power grids capture this. In these events, the BlackEnergy 3 and Crashoverride malware, respectively, targeted energy companies or transmission substations resulting in the disruption of electricity supply to nearby consumers. These attacks had limited impact, lasting between one to six hours before restoring full operations , reflecting the low-intensity, high-manageability of the attack. Yet, the most notable feature of these attacks concerns Ukraine's response. First, Ukraine and allied countries largely attributed both attacks to a hacking group connected to Russian intelligence services , but this has not been proven. This demonstrates an attribution problem that highlights the uncertainty typical of cyber attacks and prevents rapid, escalatory responses of any form. In other words, given the lack of certainty regarding the perpetrator of the cyber attack, decision-makers were impeded in their ability to execute timely and sufficient responses akin to escalation through either digital or kinetic means. Second, even when members of the Ukrainian government condemned Russia for the act, no offensive response, either kinetic or in-kind, was taken . These cases show that even cyber attacks impacting critical infrastructure have low-escalatory potential, a trait that is especially unique when linked to the ongoing geopolitical tensions that shape Russian-Ukrainian relations outside the digital realm. As such, cyber conflicts cannot easily demonstrate escalatory potential using digital means.\nFurthermore, Borghard and Lonergan (2019; 125-138) argue that cyber operations are \"poor tools of escalation\" for four reasons: they are time-consuming to develop, they have a limited impact on the victim state, states have countervailing tradeoffs in using cyber tools, and there are few appropriate cross-domain responses to cyber attacks. First, developing retaliatory cyber tools is time-consuming (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 125). In the event of a cyber attack, a state or institution may not have immediate access to the digital tools required to launch a counteroffensive. According to Borghard and Lonergan (2019: 125), \"offensive cyber operations deliver effects against targets through exploiting a vulnerability to gain access (through an attack vector) to a target's network or system.\" This backdoor access would need to be pre-installed and ready to act on for a timely counterattack to work; without this preset, any response would be time-consuming and miss the opportunity to escalate the conflict. If a conflicting entity did have access to these digital means for a cyber\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nRIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\noffensive, it would have to reconcile with concerns of attribution (Wohlfeld &amp; Jasper 2018). While kinetic conflicts have a clear direction and source of an attack, cyber conflicts are not always evident (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 30).\nThis leads to the second issue: the effects of cyber operations are limited (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 131). If a state responds to a cyber attack with a cyber offensive of its own, the nature of the response would likely be limited in its impact and only supply a temporary nuisance or network disruption (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 123). In extreme cases, cyber offensives may attack critical infrastructure or influence economics by disrupting trust in governments and corporations. Yet even in these instances, the effects of the initial and responding cyber attacks would be temporary and unsustainable (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 131), thus failing to escalate the conflict.\nMoreover, many cyber attacks have uncertain and unintended repercussions (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 41), thus rendering hasty responses ineffective in the long run. By lacking a pronounced intensification of the cyber conflict due to limitations on impact, parties cannot escalate the conflict to a stalemate under conventional mhs. In the same vein, it is imperative to acknowledge that uncertainty permits future technological advances that may result in cyber tools with sufficient cross-domain capabilities, more destructive effects, or greater severity in impact. Whenever these tools are invented, perhaps the face of cyber conflict will change, and cyber operations will possess greater escalatory potential. Nevertheless, until that day, the current nature of cyber conflict demonstrates low-cost and low-impact effects upon the victimized state. As such, it limits the effectiveness of responding attacks at escalating a cyber conflict through digital means.\nThe third impediment for cyber escalation is the existence of countervailing tradeoffs for cyber operations (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 133). Many states execute cyber operations against other entities to achieve the goals of sabotage, espionage, or subversion , all of which require secrecy to succeed (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 134). Since cyber tools are perceived as a more cost-effective and clandestine alternative to conventional warfare and espionage, political leaders are more likely to benefit from the continued development of cyber offense capabilities (Wohlfeld &amp; Jasper 2018). Consequently, states will be less willing to employ conspicuous, escalatory operations if it risks compromising their other large-scale operations (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 134). The risk comes from the potential that the attack is discovered since patches can be made that impede future access to the systems and data that governments aim to exploit. This reduces the likelihood that conflicting parties will perceive an incentive to escalate cyber disputes via a public response, especially if governments are pressured to justify their actions by revealing\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nPOLK\nthat the initial attack occurred. In doing so, states risk exposing their vulnerabilities or threatening their international standing. As a result, states may be less likely to escalate a cyber conflict, both within and outside the domain of cyberspace (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 134).\nLastly, Borghard and Lonergan claim that it is unlikely that states will respond to a cyber attack through kinetic or cross-domain means (2019: 137). Unlike conventional conflict, cyber attacks do not produce the same carnage, psychological pressure, or violence as kinetic attacks. Instead, questions about the proportionality of responding to a cyber incident with cross-domain capabilities limit the feasibility of justifying kinetic responses to cyber attacks (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 137). Historically there has never been any cross-domain response to a first strike cyber attack, and there are very few instances of a kinetic response being used to answer cyber attacks in hybrid conflict. The most notable kinetic attack is Israel's 2019 airstrike against Hamas. In this instance, Israel's response to Hamas' cyber activities against the government appears to demonstrate an immediate conflict escalation. Yet, this dispute took place in the context of an ongoing and kinetic conflict, thus disqualifying its label as a pure cyber conflict (Borghard &amp; Schneider 2019). With this in mind, it is evident that there are significant limitations to a cross-domain escalation of pure cyber conflict.\nStill, some counterarguments stress the possibility of cross-domain escalation in cyber conflict by suggesting that a state could interpret an initial cyber attack as an act of war and employ a kinetic response. Borghard and Lonergan (2019: 138) acknowledge that the perception of some cyber attacks as low-impact or low-cost may apply to only certain states and political ideologies. Once again, uncertainty is an essential feature as much of the concern surrounding escalation in cyber conflict centers on the threats posed by ambiguity in risk analysis and escalation management (Libicki &amp; Tkacheva 2020).\nWhen states are not certain of their rivals' assumptions about how domains are interconnected and what constitutes an act of war, it is plausible that the result could lead to unintended escalation of the conflict into conventional warfare. In this scenario, if a state were to respond promptly to a cyber attack with a kinetic operation, then conventional understandings of MHS would have relevance; after all, at this point the conflict would have crossed a threshold into the physical realm and would follow conventional rules of engagement and escalation management. At this point, a cyber conflict-turned-conventional would no longer apply to this study since the focus is primarily on \"pure\" cyber conflict with no cross-domain aspects.\nHowever, what about a hypothetical in which a state first makes a threat to escalate a cyber conflict into a conventional war? In this scenario, the\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nuncertainty aspect of cyberspace suggests that mhs might not necessarily hold relevance. The threat of cross-domain escalation is a form of deterrence, which has limited and ambiguous influence in cyber conflict and the digital domain. Sweijs and Zilincik (2021: 133) state that three criteria influence escalation management in cross-domain deterrence (cdd): attribution, credibility and threat proportionality, and signaling.\n##### Attribution\nAttribution of initial cyber attacks can be tedious, time-consuming, and inexact, leading to uncertainty in directing the threat at the appropriate target. This uncertainty risks international embarrassment, condemnation, or even tension if the threatening state incorrectly identifies a perpetrator or lacks evidence. As a result, the threat may not effectively escalate the conflict across domains since it may be easily dismissed. Furthermore, if a threat is directed at another state, accurately or not, the accused state would have little incentive to act upon standard mhs conceptualizations of ripeness and agree to negotiations. Once the accusation has been made, any response to a threat of kinetic escalation of a cyber conflict would require the accused to admit their cyber capabilities, thereby negating the serviceability of these digital tools and jeopardizing other cyber operations elsewhere in the world. As such, mhs would not necessarily hold relevance in scenarios where states rely on cross-domain escalation threats because uncertainty and attribution limits prevent states from utilizing effective cdd strategies.\n##### Credibility and threat proportionality\nRegarding credibility and threat proportionality, Sweijs and Zilincik (2021: 137) note that cdd is “complicated by the inherent disproportionality of responses across domains and instruments of power.” In this case, the relevance of mhs to threats of escalation is limited by the uncertain risk of how the international community and general population will perceive this intimidation. Despite the concern over states’ diverging definitions of what constitutes appropriate cross-domain escalation, there is consensus that violent responses to non-violent offensive measures will result in more immediate and severe consequences, which may receive public and international skepticism . As such, states may differ in their gauge of a threat’s credibility. This divergence weakens the case for mhs’ relevance to threats of escalation in cyber conflict since the ensuing uncertainty weakens the efficacy of the threat that domain spillover is plausible or justifiable.\n##### Signaling\nLastly, issues with signaling threats of cross-domain escalation reduce the applicability of mhs processes to cyber conflicts that could turn conventional. In the cyber domain, cross-domain signaling may be misinterpreted, with signals conducted through military means risking greater ambiguity about the signaler’s intentions to the target. As Sweijs and Zilincik (2021: 140)\nPOLK\nnote, \"a signal of resolve to respond to cyberattacks by moving platforms for the launch of conventional or nuclear weapons may be easily interpreted as a preparation for hostilities rather than as an adjustment of the deterrence posture.\" As a result, the target of the threat may view the cross-domain action as separate from the cyber conflict or as a general increase in tension outside of the digital realm. The risk of ambiguity in cross-domain signaling impedes MHS principles' efficacy in escalating the conflict since the action may appear detached from or external to the cyber conflict.\nWithout the capacity to escalate ongoing digital disputes, cyber conflicts present a challenge to conventional ripeness theory and do not offer states an incentive to seek a negotiated agreement. Parties' perceptions of a mutually hurting stalemate are more difficult to achieve because the long-term intensifying effects of cyber operations are often imperceptible, reiterating the dilemma of uncertainty in characterizing cyber conflict. Similarly, if a state were to threaten cross-domain spillover, the likelihood that the threat of escalation would serve as a sufficient push-factor towards negotiation is impeded by factors of uncertainty. As such, current ideas about timing and ripeness in cyber conflict remain elusive for cyberspace negotiations and require a reexamination of MHS to address this deviation.\n## Re-defining Mutually Hurting Stalemate\nAddressing the discrepancy between ripeness theory and cyber conflict requires a closer examination of the concept of mutually hurting stalemate. The perception of a stalemate is clearly critical in pushing conflicting parties towards negotiation. However, existing scholarship emphasizes that perception is built on mutual hurt and the threat (or existence) of unsustainable escalation. Since cyber weapons are not reliable tools of escalation and cyber operations present enticing tradeoffs for their continued use, mutual hurt and the threat of intensification are not attainable. As such, redefining the idea of a stalemate provides an alteration of ripeness theory for cyber conflicts.\nThis new definition addresses the main component of MHS: the hurting stalemate. The mutuality of MHS is not called into question since it is an essential aspect of any conflict. The reciprocal nature of conflict is inherent to the disagreement: all parties must be targets and initiators of cyber attacks for the cyber conflict to exist. Even where attribution issues exist, the mutual perception of a cyber attack from a rival is sufficient for the conflict to persist. Consequently, tit-for-tat cyber attacks are crucial in both the conflict and\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nRIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nnegotiation stages, and mutuality remains integral to encouraging parties to approach negotiation as a way out of cyber conflict.\nWhile the hurting stalemate is crucial to perceptions of ripe moments in conventional conflict, the phrase itself is incomplete in characterizing cyber conflict. The hurting stalemate is a painful deadlock characterized by a plateau, \"a flat and unending terrain without relief\" , unbearable to both parties. This concept is not wholly accurate for cyber conflict due to the limits of inflicting pain through cyber means and the low-intensity nature of cyber operations. For one, cyber tools, like conventional weaponry, are a means for achieving political objectives. In cyber conflict, each cyber operation, analyzed individually, aims (and often achieves) short-term goals such as gaining trade and military secrets, displaying cyber capabilities, or deterring activity. When combined to characterize cyber conflict, the long-term goals reveal themselves. The long-term objectives in cyber conflict show how the mutuality of hurt is limited since the operations themselves are limited in scope and impact. In fact, it is challenging to conceptualize cyber conflict as \"winnable,\" given that the impact of cyber operations is constrained and unlikely to debilitate the target. According to Valeriano and Maness (2015: 61), cyber operations are often innocuous and used primarily \"as methods of signaling displeasure or discord to a rival,\" a demonstration of the restraint used by states when engaging in cyberspace. Cyber weapons have limited applicability in their \"hurting\" capability even in more destructive incidences, such as the Stuxnet worm that destroyed Iranian nuclear centrifuges in Operation Olympic Games. Though intending to deter or delay Iran's nuclear weapons development, Operation Olympic Games ultimately bolstered Tehran's determination to restore and expand its nuclear research in Natanz .\nWith this limitation in mind, it is important to note that hurt from cyber conflict still exists. Targeted countries may experience damages or disruptions to their institutions and networks, impacting daily operations or economic mobility. Similarly, non-cyber responses to cyber operations, such as sanctions, condemnation, or other negative foreign policy measures, may inflict damages on the perceived initiator of an attack. Therefore, hurt is present in cyber conflict. However, there is a critical distinction between kinetic and cyber hurt: the hurt is not exhaustive in cyber conflict. Since cyber conflict is non-escalatory and used as a first-response or low-intensity method of engagement (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015), the hurt it inflicts on the target is not equal to the painful deadlock prescribed by conventional MHS. Instead, this hurt is perpetually sustainable, akin to Zartman's idea of \"the soft, stable, and self-serving stalemate\" (S5).\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nPOLK\nAccording to Zartman, the S5 is \"a low-level conflict, even when punctuated by occasional blips of violence\" that \"leaves each of the parties ... able to claim that it has not been defeated, which is a victory of sorts\" (2005a: 52). The S5 typically describes intractable conflicts in the kinetic domain, explaining the absence of ripeness in pushing the conflicting parties towards a negotiated solution . In conventional analysis, factors of protracted conflict, zero-sum identities, the profitability of continued fighting, mutually exclusive solutions, and deficient perceptions of ripeness contribute to intractability in kinetic conflict . However, these features are not all representative of cyber conflict.\nCyber operations are both the means and ends to accomplishing short-term goals, disrupting issues of protraction even if the conflict itself is perpetual. Furthermore, cyber conflicts often do not involve zero-sum identities unique to the dispute, although the cyber conflict may exacerbate pre-existing conflicts between states. Nevertheless, the issues of profitability, solution saliency, and ripeness are typical of cyber conflicts, which are defined by countervailing tradeoffs encouraging the perpetuation of the conflict (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 133), and diverging norms and interests hampering cyber agreements. As such, cyber conflicts share some features of intractable disputes, which are emblematic of S5. However, S5 is still insufficient for characterizing cyber conflict due to the uncertainty surrounding cyberspace and the unique nature of intractability in the digital realm.\nWith these limitations in mind, the standard perception of a hurting stalemate is improbable in cyber conflict, and a conventional ripe moment for negotiation would not be perceived. Instead, adjusting the criteria for a hurting stalemate reshapes the conditions for ripeness in cyber conflict. This new condition focuses on a \"mutually harming standoff,\" a condition on the spectrum between Zartman's theories of S5 and MHS that permits the lack of a hurting stalemate in cyber conflict.\n## Mutually Harming Standoff, Ripeness, and Cyber Negotiations\nA mutually harming standoff (which will be referred to as MHS2) is distinct from a mutually hurting stalemate (hereafter referred to as MHS1) since it emphasizes the perfunctory character of the pain and reciprocity in cyber conflict. The \"harm\" inflicted by cyber operations may have a negative impact on the targeted state, but it is not so unbearable that the state is incapable of persisting without a way out. In other words, the state is not pressed into seeking an alternative to the cyber conflict since the harm it experiences is not exhaustive. Furthermore, a \"standoff\" provides a better image than a stalemate. While the hurting stalemate represents unwinnable deadlocks that are\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8–36\nRIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\npainful to all parties , the standoff is more akin to an effectively manageable, if not perpetual and harmful, dispute with high reciprocity and low escalation capacity (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 129). This captures the nature of cyber conflict and adapts a critical component of ripeness theory.\nIf MHS2 characterizes long-term cyber conflict, when and how can it be perceived? More importantly, how can negotiators operationalize MHS2 to encourage cyber negotiations if a ripe moment is improbable in cyber conflict? Both questions are linked to another component of ripeness theory: mutually enticing opportunity (MEO). In Zartman's ripeness theory, perceptions of MHS1 are necessary, if insufficient, for encouraging parties to engage in dialogue as a way out of conventional conflict. This may be supplemented by perceptions of an MEO, which acts as the pull-factor for parties to engage in and continue negotiations . Zartman acknowledges that few cases of conventional conflict demonstrate the opening of negotiations due to perceptions of an MEO alone. However, these perceptions help encourage parties to commit to negotiations once they commence . Still, since conventional MHS1 does not exist in cyber conflict, realizing an MHS2 coupled with perceptions of an MEO can push rival cyber parties toward negotiations.\nFigure 3 presents an adaptation of the standard stages of the conflict arc for cyber disputes. In this depiction, MHS2 represents the state of the conflict from the time of emergence. This shows that without escalatory capacities, cyber conflicts are inherently defined by the perpetual reciprocity of cyber\nFIGURE 3 Stages of cyber conflict\nADAPTED FROM BRAHM (2003)\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nPOLK\nattacks between states, continuing the plateau indefinitely as conflict persists in a low intensity and restrained manner. To disrupt this, the perception of an MEO is necessary to act as the new push-factor for parties to enter and commit to negotiations.\nIn cyber conflict, the MEO can manifest in several ways. These incentives may appear at different thresholds of pain throughout the dispute and encourage states to consider negotiations under various circumstances. Like MHS1, MHS2 pain thresholds are perceptual, and thus MEO S will be subjective from case to case . Analyzing an array of MEO S showcases potential push-factor attributes unique to the nature of cyberspace that could encourage cyber conflict negotiation.\nNorms development collaboration. Like conventional conflicts, both parties may inherently view alternatives to victory that do not include tit-for-tat cyber exchanges. This may have limitations pending each party's goals in conducting cyber operations, but the opportunity to collaborate may displace the benefits of using digital tools against rivals. This collaboration leads to an impactful and enticing opportunity for negotiation: norms development. Given the standard of uncertainty in the cyber realm, states can attempt to shape the digital world in their image by collaborating to bilaterally develop and diffuse norms that meet their interests on a global scale. In other words, by leveraging the perception that normative interests are more far-reaching and achievable through bilateral collaboration, negotiators may be more successful in pushing conflicting parties to the table to coordinate on broader issues that both address and extend beyond the ongoing conflict.\nThe MEO for norms development collaboration is especially pertinent in cyber conflicts where the targets are primarily private and government non-military infrastructure. This represents one threshold for pain on the lattice of MHS2 ripeness; when attacks are apparent and far-reaching in their impact on the public, states are more likely to respond negatively (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 125). This is because many states view public interference in cyberspace as \"crossing a line\" in the digital realm, despite the lack of norms or agreements dictating this taboo (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015). Conversely, in cyber conflicts where attacks primarily target political and military networks, \"victim\" states are less likely to react with a negative or conflict-prone response (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 123-124). This suggests that cyber conflicts which focus on traditional government-to-government attacks, including infiltrations and intrusions through Trojans and APTs, are likely to present the norm for cyber conflict (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015). On the other hand, DDoS attacks are more obvious in their display of aggression since they interfere with public websites and systems, and states are more likely to respond negatively to the attack due to pressure from the public impacted by the incident.\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nRIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nCyber conflicts that reach MHS2 thresholds, in which public infrastructure is the primary target, can present an MEO for parties to meet to recalibrate norms for cyberspace conduct. For example, suppose the cyber conflict is characterized by long-run DDoS attacks or infiltrations targeting non-military private and government networks. In that case, participants may use these perceived violations as an opportunity to collaborate and bilaterally promote norms in cyber conflict that benefit both parties. In other words, while perpetuating the tit-for-tat cycle of the cyber conflict is a non-escalatory option, continued DDoS attacks may present reasonable grounds for decision-makers to examine alternatives to the conflict, thereby seeking innovative solutions for a way out of MHS2. Furthermore, considering the absence of concrete norms in cyberspace, parties may view the chance to negotiate and act as norm-makers as a mutually enticing opportunity.\nProtean power. In addition to norms development collaboration, the opportunity for states to demonstrate \"protean power\" is an enticing opportunity for decision-makers to choose negotiation in cyber conflict. This form of power, coined by Katzenstein and Seybert in 2018, counters the aforementioned \"control power\" and acknowledges the importance of creativity and innovation in decision-making when facing increasingly uncertain international dynamics. Due to the uncertain nature of cyberspace, successful navigation and utility of the digital realm require states to remain innovative, flexible, and agile in responding to rapid changes in technology or when dealing with crises where assurances in risk analyses are limited. As such, the negotiating table is the ideal medium for states to gain and exhibit protean power since the choice to negotiate in cyber conflict is a strategic, albeit inventive and pioneering option that may result in relative gains for both states.\nMoreover, states will likely view the display of protean power as a complement or, in some cases, substitute to other conventional understandings of power dynamics, such as hard power. As Katzenstein and Seybert (2018: 25) put it, \"the world is well stocked with low-probability events such as the sudden appearance of terrorist organizations operating on a global scale and waves of large-scale human migration.\" Therefore, displaying creative prowess in the face of ambiguity, instability, and uncertainty is vital for actors \"to derive relative advantage from unexpected challenges\" (Katzenstein &amp; Seybert 2018: 25). In cyber conflict, states that choose to negotiate over a continuation of tit-for-tat exchanges that prolong the status quo of MHS2 are more likely to be perceived as adaptable and inventive in responding to uncertainty surrounding the nature of cyberspace and geopolitics in this domain. Consequently, states that choose negotiation in cyber conflict have a stronger capacity for protean power, making them more durable and influential in handling increasingly complex dynamics in world politics.\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nPOLK\nSmall state influence. Similarly, small states may be uniquely positioned to act on a push-factor MEO in cyber conflict since the newness of the domain presents opportunities for gaining leverage in the international arena. Following the benefits of protean power, the opportunity to demonstrate influence over rival states through innovation and improvisation in cyber conflict management incentivizes smaller states to push for negotiation as a means of alleviating tensions. This then acts as a push-factor MEO for smaller states seeking greater power in the international arena at large, especially since the democratic layout of cyberspace allows for ease of entry to new actors. In turn, larger states may be incentivized to negotiate in cyber conflict to further extend their influence in the digital realm, as well as the physical one.\nCross-conflict negotiation leverage. Finally, rival states with ongoing non-cyber tensions may be incentivized to negotiate as an avenue for leverage in other conflict domains. In other words, states with ongoing geopolitical tensions, such as the US and Russia, Japan and South Korea, or India and Pakistan, may be able to bargain agreements made in cyberspace with concessions in other negotiations or settlements. This also presents another scenario in which pain thresholds may be achieved in MHS2. Cyber conflicts that persist alongside other tensions or conflicts will prompt heightened sensitivities and feelings of annoyance between rivals. Yet, the digital realm remains the ideal medium for achieving cooperation or relative gains between rivals despite this distrust. The cyber domain provides an opportunity for norms development, an exhibition of power, and leverage in other conflict settlements. Thus, cyber conflicts between historic rival states are likely to perceive the status quo as a threshold of pain that makes an MEO for cooperation in the digital world appealing. Moreover, if the rivals perceive an opportunity to achieve non-cyber gains through cyber conflict negotiations, the parties already in conflict may consider this a push-factor MEO in cyberspace.\nThis MEO is well-suited for states engaged in regional conflict, a feature that Valeriano and Maness (2105: 81) note as being one of the most common fora for cyber conflict. For example, Japan and South Korea have deep-seated hostilities, ranging from disagreements over maritime control to enmities founded on the Korean peninsula's history of Japanese occupation. Many cyber-attacks between the two countries reflect these tensions, with both countries engaging in tit-for-tat exchanges between 2001 and 2011 (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 88). Interestingly, Japanese decision-makers often choose \"more cooperative interactions with their regional rivals\" despite ongoing cyber conflicts, suggesting a desire not to escalate tensions with nearby states (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 123). It follows, then, that regional rivals may have an MEO to use cyberspace as a platform for negotiation to influence overall tensions since the alternative is maintaining the status quo and perpetuating ongoing hostilities.\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nRIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nLastly, rivals may be incentivized to negotiate cyber conflict since they could gain greater international influence where their interests align. Again, Japan and South Korea exemplify this. Since both states are closely aligned with US interests (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 216), agreements between the two, especially those that impact both the cyber and physical domains, may strengthen their standing with the US and against larger rivals like China. As such, this opportunity for both mutual and relative gains acts as a push-factor for entrenched rival states to pursue cyber conflict negotiation.\nIn sum, conventional ripeness theory is limited in cyber conflict since mutually hurting stalemates (MHS1) are unattainable in cyberspace. Instead, a mutually harming standoff (MHS2) is more characteristic of the state of tit-for-tat cyber conflicts, where parties experience adverse effects from reciprocal attacks, but not at an unsustainable level. When long-term cyber conflict is recognized as an MHS2, specific attributes of the attacks may be operationalized to enact a push-factor MEO that encourages the parties to negotiate. These MEOs may hinge on the opportunity for cyber combatants to act as norm-makers by pursuing bilateral agreements that resolve the conflict and improve conduct in cyberspace or may focus on displays of protean power as small states or historic rivals. To represent this process, Figure 4 illustrates an adaptation of Zartman's conventional ripeness theory and negotiation progression to denote the push and pull aspects of MHS2 in cyber conflict. Here, MHS2 is presented\nFIGURE 4 Elements of Mutually Harming Standoff (MHS2) and the process of negotiation\nADAPTED FROM ZARTMAN (2000: 230, 242)\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nPOLK\nas the state of the conflict, while the push-factor MEO is a dependent variable requiring both parties' perception. Only after this perception is operationalized will the parties pursue negotiation as a way out of cyber conflict.\n## 2015 US-China Cybersecurity Agreement\nThe 2015 US-China Cybersecurity Agreement illustrates how MHS2 and MEO push-factors adapt the concept of timing in cyber conflict negotiations. These negotiations produced a cybersecurity agreement that established a precedent for defining economically motivated cyber espionage (EMCE) (Harold, Libicki, &amp; Stuth Cevallos 2016: 46). This demonstrates that norm-making is an attractive prospect for cyber negotiations following an MHS2, especially due to the uncertain and nebulous environment which characterizes cyberspace. The US-China agreement also showcases the limitations of applying current ripeness theory models to a bilateral cyber conflict. An overview of the US-China cyber conflict and its corresponding negotiations demonstrates how ripeness theory can be adjusted in cyber conflict to determine the timing of cyber negotiations.\n## Background: US-China Cyber Conflict\nThe US-China cyber conflict roughly began in 2003 and has predominately consisted of cyber espionage operations between the two countries (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 91–92). This characterization is key to the perpetuity of the conflict, and it is essential to examine both countries' stances on cyberspace and the rulebook by which they operate. First, the United States extends its values regarding individual freedoms and independence to the cyber realm (Brown &amp; Yung 2017a). The US government emphasizes online freedom of expression, liberal information flows, and data privacy in its national cybersecurity policies, and uses these values as the basis for which it evaluates foreign attacks on US networks (Brown &amp; Yung 2017a; Segal 2015). This is especially true for cyber espionage. According to Brown and Yung (2017a), the US makes distinctions between forms of espionage based on their objective, stating that \"in the US view, as long as such operations collect information about economic and financial matters for the purpose of benefiting national security, they are routine intelligence work.\" In this case, corporate espionage for the economic benefit of private companies is considered off-limits.\nChina also applies its political ideologies to cyberspace operations, and these values contradict the United States. At the forefront of China's cybersecurity strategy is the idea of Internet sovereignty, a norm shared by other\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nRIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\ngovernments to promote state control over networks within their territory (Brown &amp; Yung 2017b). The Chinese government advocates for states to set their own rules regarding cyberspace and pursues digital independence from the US, which owns most of the world's IP addresses and has been heavy-handed in Internet governance (Brown &amp; Yung 2017b; Singer &amp; Friedman 2014: 140; Levite &amp; Jinghua 2019). Furthermore, China rejects the militarization of cyberspace, accusing the US of securitizing the digital domain and aggressively developing \"cyber arms\" in response to activities by perceived rivals like Russia and China (Brown &amp; Yung 2017b).\nIt is this argument that is crucial to China's cyber operations. In China's view, the US' aggressive pursuit of offensive cyber capabilities necessitates China's cyber development (Brown &amp; Yung 2017a; Singer &amp; Friedman 2014: 140). Additionally, China's stance on cyber espionage makes no distinction between operations pursuing an economic advantage versus a national security advantage . Instead, China \"views economic competition as a way to achieve peer status with the US and sees cyberspace as an asymmetric instrument which it can successfully use to compete with the United States\" (Brown &amp; Yung 2017a). Thus, the Chinese agenda pursues cyber espionage for economic advantage as \"a quasi-legitimate way to achieve a North-South redistribution of wealth\" . China's cyber policies aim to level the imbalance between the West and China and promote norms of self-determination in cyberspace.\nIn the US-China cyber conflict, various cyber weapons were used. Between 2003 and 2006, the Titan Rain attack employed Trojans, or unauthorized software that permits access to a system or program, to infiltrate US government and contracting networks such as the State Department and Lockheed Martin (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 34; Rid 2012: 20). This attack was attributed to the Chinese government, as was the 2006 intrusion by the APT \"Shady RAT,\" which stole secret information related to negotiation strategies, manufacturing design plans, and US national security policies (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 91; Singer &amp; Friedman 2014: 92). The international hack by GhostNet, which lasted from 2007 to 2009, utilized phishing scams to acquire access to computer microphones and cameras, allowing hackers to record conversations by State Department and Pentagon officials (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 131). This, along with other long-run intrusions and thefts, was again attributed to the Chinese government.\nIn response, US agencies retaliated against Chinese institutions by employing defensive cyber attacks. Operation Cisco Raider lasted from 2006 to 2010 and attempted to counter the distribution of counterfeit Cisco technology stolen in a Chinese hack (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 91). Another operation,\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nPOLK\nBuckshot Yankee, responded against a hack of US defense networks (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 91). Finally, the long-term operation, Shotgiant, aimed to link the Chinese telecommunications firm, Huawei, to the People's Liberation Army (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 91; Sanger &amp; Perlroth 2014; Sanger 2018). This operation also endeavored to \"exploit Huawei's technology so that when the company sold equipment to other countries ... the NSA could roam through their computer and telephone networks to conduct surveillance and, if ordered by the president, offensive cyberoperations\" (Sanger &amp; Perlroth 2014). As such, the US-China cyber conflict included exchanges of offensive and retaliatory operations between the two nations to combat diverging normative values regarding espionage.\n## Cyber Negotiations\nThroughout the cyber conflict, US-China tensions never escalated to kinetic force. Instead, the conflict remained tit-for-tat, with both governments suffering from espionage that notably affected both military and non-military private and government entities. Due to the dispute's long-term, low intensity, and restrained nature, the US-China cyber conflict gradually developed into an MHS2.\nThe MHS2 permitted both governments to continue with their cyber attacks. However, in 2009 they began to engage in Track Two diplomatic talks between the US think-tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) and China's Institute of Contemporary International Relations (CICIR) . What pushed the countries towards informal dialogue? According to one Chinese official, dialogue is a better alternative to perpetual conflict because both countries are capable of continued operations but would be better served by negotiating to settle their disagreements (Singer &amp; Friedman 2014). This represents the push-factor MEO, which promotes dialogue for norms establishment between two cyber rivals.\nThe Track Two talks further reflect the impact of MEOs for norm diffusion, with the first of these informal dialogues beginning in December 2009. Early dialogues focused on addressing both states' concerns about cyber sovereignty, cyberspace norms, multilateralism in addressing cybercrime, and confidence-building in cyberspace . These informal dialogues continued in addition to Track 1.5 discussions and alternated between Washington, DC and Beijing throughout the process. Eventually, discussions regarding cyber espionage and what it constitutes emerged alongside the issues of cyber sovereignty, governance, and US primacy in cyberspace (Harold, Libicki &amp; Stuth Cevallos 2016). It should be noted that these dialogues were \"were marked more by continuity than change,\" with participants on both sides maintaining their stances\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nRIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\non definitions of terms and values (Harold, Libicki &amp; Stuth Cevallos 2016: 49). Yet the governments' willingness to meet to discuss their stances in the cyber conflict signals an interesting push for a resolution in cyber conflict, without the need of a hurting stalemate.\nThese dialogues continued in a Track Two and Track 1.5 capacity, and by 2013, Track One negotiations commenced. However, these talks were interrupted in 2014 after the US indicted five People's Liberation Army officials with cyber espionage charges (Harold, Libicki &amp; Stuth Cevallos 2016; Brown &amp; Yung 2017a). The indictment asserted that members of the Chinese military stole trade secrets from US industries to bolster China's competitiveness in the international market. In response, the Chinese government walked away from the negotiations and asserted that the US accusations were hypocritical in light of the 2013 NSA leaks (Brown &amp; Yung 2017a). However, the talks resumed the following summer, and in September 2015, US President Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping released a statement on a new Cybersecurity Agreement (Harold, Libicki &amp; Stuth Cevallos 2016). The two governments agreed to improve coordination in investigating and preventing cybercrime, not conduct or support cyber intellectual property theft, and improve cooperation in promoting international norms in cyberspace .\nThe 2015 Agreement achieved both mixed results and mixed reactions. Though some scholars believe that China's agreement on the existence of economically motivated cyber espionage (EMCE) is an incremental step in reducing cyber intellectual property theft, few believe it has since decreased (Brown &amp; Yung 2017c). There has been continued concern about the quality of the agreement and China's adherence to the terms (Brown &amp; Yung 2017c). While the negotiators were able to successfully agree on cyber-specific definitions of EMCE, a significant achievement in cyber norm development, gaps in the agreement have allowed both countries to exploit technicalities in the agreement. For example, though reports suggest a decrease in Chinese economic espionage, it appears that \"Chinese operators are going after technologies that are dual-use [such as telecommunications industries], and so might not be covered by the agreements\" . Similarly, the US espionage operations against Huawei have persisted, with non-cyber sanctions and indictments attacking company leadership due to the recent dispute over 5G, surveillance, and data privacy .\n## Analysis\nDespite the weaknesses of the US-China Cybersecurity Agreement, the existence of the cyber negotiations sets a unique precedent regarding the timing of bilateral dialogues in cyber conflict. The concepts of MHS2 and push-factor\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nmeo demonstrate how ripeness can be determined within cyber disputes, thus adapting Zartman's original theory to a new domain of conflict. Reviewing the conditions of ripeness in the US-China cyber conflict helps capture the applicability of mhs2 and meo in cyber conflict.\nThroughout the US-China cyber dispute, long-term operations and attacks generated an entrenched and enduring conflict between two cyber rivals. The use of intrusive cyber weapons to conduct espionage on non-military targets prompted the exchange of attacks, and the diverging perspectives on cyber and espionage norms deepened the tensions between the two countries. In this case, the conflict's perpetuity embodied an mhs2, with both countries receiving damages in their economic and political security due to cyber and non-cyber retaliations. Even so, both countries were caught in a standoff rather than a stalemate since these damages were not exhaustive, permanent, or fatigue-inducing. In fact, both countries focused on long-term cyber weaponry, like apts and Trojans, to conduct lengthy operations that were sustainable regardless of the harm dealt to each government in response.\nWith this perpetual-while-manageable standoff reached, both countries continued to conduct their cyber operations against one another. Nevertheless, the opportunity to collaborate on norms development was the meo that pushed both governments towards negotiation. This was first captured and operationalized at the informal level. Through the Track Two dialogues, the US and Chinese think tanks provided a platform for sharing and understanding each other's values and perspectives of cyberspace and security. This informal communication linked the two governments, regardless of the conflict's perpetuity, and provided the opportunity for cooperation in norm-making and diffusion. This was especially enticing considering that the UN Group of Governmental Experts (UN gge) on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace has convened multiple times throughout the US-China conflict to establish international norms in cyberspace (gip Digital Watch Observatory 2021). If the US and China could bilaterally collaborate on cyberspace norms, their influence in international norm-making would be especially prominent and allow both countries to demonstrate their protean power in a new and uncertain domain.\nTrack 1.5 and Track One dialogues between the two governments further demonstrate this dedication to coordination in resolving the cyber conflict while establishing rules for conduct in cyberspace. Though the ultimate agreement may have failed in effectively instituting these norms, the fact that understanding was reached on the definition of emce is significant. The US and China's commitment to establishing norms in cyberspace to resolve the cyber conflict is therefore an important example of cyber negotiations. Future\nRIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\n\n# Conclusion\nThe emergence of new technologies undoubtedly impacts geopolitical conduct between states and influences rivalries old and new as a domain for conflict. Cyber conflict, regardless of its potential to supplant conventional warfare, has surfaced as a new source of tension between states, one that is ill-defined and difficult to regulate. As such, developing capacities for resolving cyber conflict requires new approaches to negotiation and mediation, and revisiting ripeness theory allows scholars and practitioners to adapt prevailing negotiation strategies to new realms of conflict.\nDue to the nature of cyber conflict, conventional ideas of ripeness theory are inadequate for deciding when to begin cyber negotiations. Limitations in escalation, the perception of cyber operations as \"escalatory offramps,\" countervailing tradeoffs in the use of cyber tools, and the first-use character of cyber weapons prevent states from perceiving mutually hurting stalemates in tit-for-tat cyber conflict. Therefore, modifying the definition of a hurting stalemate better captures the nature of cyber conflict and offers an alternative for timing negotiations. \"Mutually harming standoff\" is more emblematic of the plateau in cyber conflict since both states may feel the consequences of the conflict, but to a manageable and sustainable degree. When long-term cyber conflict is reached, an MHS2 has taken effect, and combining it with the component of mutually enticing opportunity will push actors towards cyber negotiations.\nThe MEO, while operating as a pull-factor in kinetic conflict, serves a more significant role in propelling conflicting parties toward negotiations because cyberspace provides incentives for collaboration over conflict. Though vested with the capacity for continued cyber conflict, rival states may perceive the opportunities to collaborate on norms development, exercise protean power, or gain leverage in external conflicts as ideal for promoting their agendas on cyberspace bilaterally. This is captured by the case of the US-China Cybersecurity Agreement.\nIn this instance, the reciprocal cyber conflict between the US and China was characterized by an MHS2. Nonetheless, the governments seized the opportunity to engage in norm-making through dialogue instead of unilaterally trying to \"win\" in cyber conflict. These negotiations evolved from informal Track Two discussions to Track One negotiation and agreement between American and\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nPOLK\nChinese leadership, thus providing precedent for a bilateral negotiation to a pure \"cyber conflict.\" Though the agreement itself has flaws, the timing of the negotiation signals that MHS1 is not necessary and is better characterized by an MHS2. In addition, the MEO is a stronger and more necessary (if insufficient) component for achieving ripeness in cyber conflict.\nFuture research on the negotiation or mediation process may provide greater clarity on achieving more successful cyber agreements in the future. Likewise, examining the strategies of multilateral cyber negotiations and their impact on norms development would impact the nature of state-to-state cyber conflict. Such evolutions will necessitate further research as new capabilities and dynamics emerge. In the meantime, exploring other cyber conflicts, such as those between long-term rivals like the US-Russia, India-Pakistan, and North Korea-South Korea, may provide a prescriptive application of the adapted ripeness theory.\nThe application of ripeness theory, like conflict itself, is continually evolving. New technologies and conflict domains shape peace efforts and strategies in practical and academic application. In cyber conflict, adjusting the components of ripeness theory to include mutually harming standoffs and MEOs demonstrates how negotiation practices can shift to address emerging threats and realms of uncertainty that characterize new domains of conflict. Without this adjustment, cyber conflicts and other new realms for war, remain out of reach for resolution.",

As the world becomes more interconnected through digital means, a potential \"fifth domain\" for conflict has emerged in the cyber realm , inviting scholars to debate the nature of cyber attacks, cyber espionage, and disinformation campaigns as \"cyber warfare\" . With the emergence of cyberwar as a key buzzword in political and academic spheres, the question of how to resolve cyber conflicts shifts the focus to negotiation theory.\nAnalysis of cyber conflict presents a challenge to the prevailing negotiation concept, ripeness theory. Ripeness theory posits that the timing of a negotiation stems from the conflicting parties' perception of a \"mutually hurting stalemate\" (MHS) and \"a way out\" of conflict through dialogue . While this theory has shown merit for negotiations related to conventional warfare or economic disputes, there are gaps in its applicability for resolving cyber conflict. Specifically, the concept of a \"hurting stalemate\" has little to no presence in cyber disputes, rendering MHS incompatible with pure cyber negotiations. As such, redefining mutually hurting stalemate for cyber conflict is paramount to address this discrepancy.\nThis analysis attempts to adapt prevailing negotiation theory for conflicts in the cyber domain. First, an overview of what constitutes cyber conflict is provided, the state of its norms and regulations, and the uncertain nature of cyberspace. Second, an analysis of ripeness theory in conventional and cyber conflict highlights the current gaps in negotiation literature when applied to an evolving form of conflict. Third, redefining the idea of MHS by suggesting an alternative, \"mutually harming standoff,\" offers an examination into the timing discrepancy surrounding cyberspace agreements. Lastly, examining the 2015 bilateral US-China Cybersecurity Agreement provides context for applying this hypothesis and demonstrates how accepted negotiation theory may be applied to cyber conflict.\n# Defining Cyber Conflict: Terms, Norms, and the Rise of Uncertainty\nThe definitions of \"cyber conflict\" or \"cyberwarfare\" are a source of contention throughout the international community. There is a lack of shared understanding for terms related to cyberspace, with some scholars arguing that the preoccupation with cyber warfare has little merit. While some governments, academics, and media outlets overemphasize the threat of a \"cyber Pearl Harbor,\" these warnings are more speculative and extreme than reality would suggest (Singer &amp; Friedman 2014: 68). If applying a Clausewitzian understanding of war, which emphasizes its violence, instrumental character, and political\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nPOLK\nnature, it appears that cyberwar has yet to occur, as no cyber attack has met these three criteria .\nRegardless of the debate on the reality of cyber warfare, the fact remains that cyberspace activities continue to shape and threaten geopolitical relations. Offensive cyber exchanges in the digital realm have exacerbated international tensions between technological powerhouses such as the United States, Russia, and China, and developing consensus on the broader idea of “cyber conflict” is pertinent to establishing a new approach to diplomacy on the issue of cyberspace. For this article, we will adopt a broad definition of “cyber conflict” to include information operations between two or more entities that intentionally undermine the economic, political, social, or security systems of states, businesses, and organizations. This definition incorporates such concepts as “cyber espionage,” “disinformation campaigns,” “cyber sabotage,” and “cyberterrorism,” representing tactics initiated or sponsored by states (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015).\nExamples of cyber conflict include the continuous use of cyber operations or the means through which states conduct cyber attacks against the same entity over time. These conflicts are reciprocal, characterized by tit-for-tat cyber exchanges between countries, and may also employ non-cyber means in an effort to deter future attacks, such as sanctions or public condemnation. Cyber conflict includes the use of advanced persistent threats (APTs) to spy on corporate activities or the development and deployment of malicious software to cause physical damage to infrastructure. Cyber operations may use an array of cyber weapons, from the application of botnets in distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks that shut down government websites to the creation of Trojans and backdoors, which infiltrate and sabotage computer networks (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 34). These parameters highlight the scope of the issues and features that shape cyber conflicts and the ambiguities surrounding their nature.\nConversely, this definition does not include small-scale “cybercrime,” which tends to be a for-profit enterprise that does not center on ideology or political gain (Singer &amp; Friedman 2014: 145–155). It also does not include attacks perpetrated by individuals or non-state-sponsored criminal organizations since these efforts more often constitute “cybercrime” and are one-off rogue actions intended to cause chaos or malice rather than achieve policy goals (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 33). Lastly, the article focuses on “pure” cyber conflict, thus dismissing incidences of cyber attacks as part of larger military campaigns or hybrid warfare. While negotiations on conventional conflicts may address concerns relating to cyberspace, kinetic wars are characterized differently from cyber conflicts, as discussed later in the article.\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8–36\nRIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\n# Cyber Norms and Consensus\nDisagreements over what constitutes cyber conflict impact the establishment of international norms for addressing cyber operations. Numerous arrangements have attempted to codify norms for regulating cyberspace and expanding international law to include the digital domain. The Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare is one effort to establish consensus on cyber conflict. This document, first published in 2013, attempts to apply existing international law to cyber conflicts while defining \"cyber attacks\" and \"cyber self-defense\" . However, the Tallinn Manual has no legal standing, and many countries have rejected the arguments it presents (Singer &amp; Friedman 2014: 206). As a result, binding consensus on how states should govern and regulate cyberspace remains indefinite and allows for multiple interpretations of what justifies an attack.\nOther efforts to establish norms in cyberspace involve international processes to develop standards of conduct in the cyber realm. Since 1998, motions to formulate cyber arms control treaties and propagate agreements on cyber governance have shaped international agendas . From intergovernmental institutions like the UN to think tank-led working groups, numerous negotiations and dialogues have been under way to improve the stability and security of cyberspace. These initiatives include ongoing fora such as the UN Group of Governmental Experts (UN GGE) and the UN Open-Ended Working Group (UN OEWG), both aimed at developing interstate cyber norms and applying international law to cyberspace . Other efforts include the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace, a coalition of cybersecurity experts that promotes specific cyber norms, and the Paris Call, a \"multistakeholder initiative led by the French government and supported by Microsoft,\" which seeks to mainstream cyber norms outside of interstate dialogues .\nThe credibility of their participants legitimizes these formats, whether it is the legitimacy of the UN process or the inclusivity of multiple stakeholders, such as businesses, think tanks, and non-profits, in building standards for cyberspace . However, Ruhl et al. note that these efforts are constrained due to four factors. For one, the evolving nature of cyberspace impedes the development of sustainable norms, and the presence of multiple actors with varying interests inhibits the regulation of norm adherence in cyberspace. Second, states' cyber activities are often secretive and unknown, thus obstructing the implementation of international standards for cyberspace. Third, disagreement between great powers on cyberspace norms can frustrate agreements. For example, Russian and Chinese demands for greater state sovereignty in cyberspace are countered by the US' assertion for free and\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nPOLK\nindependent Internet access. Fourth, weak incentives to adhere to cyberspace norms can reduce the impact and sustainability of international agreements. In contrast, \"states with significant cyber capabilities seem ready and willing to employ them to advance their interests,\" presenting an incentive for states to dismiss norms or limit their scope of adherence . Therefore, the multilateral fora for establishing cyberspace norms currently faces significant limitations in their effectiveness, generating a high level of uncertainty in the domain of cyberspace.\n## Uncertainty in the Digital Realm\nThe uncertain nature of cyberspace and norms creates difficulties for dispute resolution. Unlike conventional conflict, where risks, calculations, and capacities are known in an exercise of \"control power,\" cyber conflict occurs in a realm of uncertainty, potentiality, and improvisation (Katzenstein &amp; Seybert, 2018). The \"fog of uncertainty\" (Katzenstein &amp; Seybert 2018: 36) limits states' abilities to know how cyberspace will evolve, who the actors are, and what their capabilities may entail, thus preventing states from assessing the long-term ramifications of a cyber attack's impact. The nebulousness of cyberspace results not in deterrence but in restraint, which Valeriano and Maness (2015: 54) describe as a \"policy outcome but not necessarily a process\" for states' limited use of cyber tools. Therefore, this restraint is a consequence of the ambiguity and insecurity characterizing cyberspace, suggesting that certainties regarding states' intentions and cyber capabilities are unattainable, thereby reducing the risk of escalation in cyber conflict.\nEscalation represents an \"increase in the intensity of a conflict and in the severity of the tactics used in pursuing it\"  and is crucial to the perception of ripeness in conflict. However, states' restraint in using cyber tools impedes the prominence of both escalation and ripeness in cyber conflict, a discrepancy which will be addressed in the next section. The uncertainty of cyberspace and the limitations of cyber norms results in weak perceptions of states' digital activities. The vagueness of cyberspace is an impediment to determining what should be negotiated, let alone when negotiations should be conducted. Analyzing the concept of \"ripeness\" in cyber conflict will answer the question of when states should negotiate on matters of cyberspace.\n## Overview of Ripeness Theory\nAs previously stated, Zartman's \"ripeness theory\" presents a condition for the timing and beginning of negotiation (2001). Ripeness is a perceptual event that\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nRIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nstems from the belief in a Mutually Hurting Stalemate (MHS) or a Mutually Enticing Opportunity (MEO) . Zartman defines MHS as the moment when \"parties find themselves locked in a conflict from which they cannot escalate to victory and this deadlock is painful to both of them\" (2008). This deadlock may be depicted as a plateau, a stalemate where the costs of continuing the violence outweigh the benefits, with both parties suffering from the ongoing conflict. Similarly, a catastrophic event, or a precipice, may threaten or have influenced perceptions of the conflict and impart a stalemate. To quote Zartman (2001: 8), \"the catastrophe provides a deadline or a lesson indicating that pain can be sharply increased if something is not done about it now.\" Upon the perception of an MHS, both parties recognize that the probability of unilaterally winning the conflict is decreased, making the stalemate more foreboding.\nIn response to the perception of a stalemate, the conflicting parties may attempt to seize the moment by pursuing a \"way out\" of the conflict, sustained by an MEO , through negotiation. Zartman's theory is displayed in Figure 1, which demonstrates the push and pull factors that lead to the decision and commitment to negotiate.\nIt should be noted that ripeness is merely a condition for encouraging states to negotiate an end to the conflict, one that is \"necessary, but not sufficient\" . As such, the propensity for success in cyber negotiation is not guaranteed in seizing the ripe moment for dialogue. Analysis of ripeness theory's application in conventional and cyber conflict demonstrates how the concept of a stalemate leads (or does not lead) to the perception that the timing is suitable for negotiation as an alternative to continued fighting.\nFIGURE 1 Elements of conventional ripeness theory and the process of negotiation ADAPTED FROM ZARTMAN (2000: 230, 242)\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nPOLK\n# Ripeness and Conventional Conflict\nIn kinetic warfare, ripeness theory holds merit. Conventional conflict may be escalated and then plateaued, as defined by an MHS, thus presenting an opportunity for seeking a way out through negotiation. Zartman (2008) illustrates this by stating that \"to ripen a conflict one must raise the level of conflict until the stalemate is reached and then further until it begins to hurt – and even then, work toward a perception of an impending catastrophe as well.\" This captures the idea behind MHS – a perceived stalemate must be generated for both sides, with the parties incurring unsustainable or unbearable costs in the long run even when there is no prospect for further escalation. Brahm illustrates the role of MHS as a tipping point or push-factor towards negotiation by depicting conventional conflict as a cresting wave (see Figure 2). After the emergence of the conflict, continuous escalation of hostilities leads to or threatens an impending catastrophe, the precipice of the wave at which point an MHS has occurred . If the MHS is perceived, it may push the parties towards de-escalation and negotiation, and confidence-building measures and the perception of an MEO can pull the parties closer toward an agreement and the end of the conflict .\nIn conventional conflict, weaponry and strategic maneuvers are useful in this pursuit of a stalemate since conventional weaponry varies in scale, targeting, and scope of damage. For example, during the Bosnian War, NATO's use of cruise missiles and stealth planes in \"Operation Deliberate Force\" destroyed 338 Serbian targets. The Bosnian Serbs perceived the use of US Navy Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles (TLAMs) and F-117 bombers as a major escalation by\nFIGURE 2 Stages of conflict\nADAPTED FROM BRAHM (2003)\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nRIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nNATO , and this campaign helped to push the Serbs to return to the Dayton Accords in late 1995 . By employing weaponry or strategy, practitioners in conventional conflict are able to achieve a stalemate by escalating the hostilities on the ground. Therefore, the role of escalation is integral to achieving MHS since it results in perceptions “that there has been a significant qualitative change in the conflict as a result of the new development” . When both parties escalate to unattainable levels, the conventional conflict plateaus while the sides experience mutual hurt.\nThese conflicts are then considered ripe for negotiation, and the moment may be seized to initiate negotiations and resolve the conflict. Examples of ripeness theory in kinetic conflict have been perceived in the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah War, the Yugoslav Wars in the 1990s, and the Angolan Civil War (Schrodt, Yilmaz &amp; Gerner 2003; Touval 2002: 167; Zartman 2000). In these cases, military escalation of conflict or mediator-induced perceptions of MHS pushed parties to commit to dialogue processes . As such, ripeness theory has strong applicability in cases of conventional conflict.\n## Ripeness and Cyber Conflict\nIn contrast, cyber conflicts do not have the same characteristics as conventional warfare. Cyber operations are not inherently escalatory, and using cyber means to intensify a cyber conflict to the point of ripeness is improbable. For one, states view cyber operations as de facto “escalatory offramps,” or alternatives to costly kinetic conflict that still signal state displeasure or aim to influence rivals’ behavior (Jensen &amp; Valeriano 2019: 2). As such, decision-makers are often inclined to use cyber operations as an extension of foreign policy because they are not escalatory. If faced with increased tensions with rival governments, states have displayed a preference for choosing cyber responses as a form of “sub-crisis maneuvering” or exit from heightened conflict (Jensen &amp; Valeriano 2019: 4).\nA 2019 survey of US, Russian, and Israeli civilians further demonstrates this perspective that cyber conflict is non-escalatory. In this study, respondents in all three countries showed a general preference for non-escalatory responses to cyber attacks in scenarios where the victim state had the capacity to respond with an in-kind cyber weapon (Jensen &amp; Valeriano 2019: 6). Respondents from Russia voted in favor of de-escalatory responses to cyber attacks, while citizens from the US and Israel most often favored proportional responses to the initial attack (Jensen &amp; Valeriano 2019: 7). All three countries had low responses expressing a preference for escalation against a cyber attack. These findings express a tendency to view cyber conflict as a non-escalatory domain (Jensen\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nPOLK\n&amp; Valeriano 2019), thereby casting doubt on the notion that responses to cyber operations could result in an escalation between two parties.\nEven in the most severe cases of cyber attacks, such as disruptions of critical infrastructure, victim states have exhibited a preference for non-escalatory response rather than escalatory action. The real-world examples of the 2015 and 2016 attacks on Ukrainian power grids capture this. In these events, the BlackEnergy 3 and Crashoverride malware, respectively, targeted energy companies or transmission substations resulting in the disruption of electricity supply to nearby consumers. These attacks had limited impact, lasting between one to six hours before restoring full operations , reflecting the low-intensity, high-manageability of the attack. Yet, the most notable feature of these attacks concerns Ukraine's response. First, Ukraine and allied countries largely attributed both attacks to a hacking group connected to Russian intelligence services , but this has not been proven. This demonstrates an attribution problem that highlights the uncertainty typical of cyber attacks and prevents rapid, escalatory responses of any form. In other words, given the lack of certainty regarding the perpetrator of the cyber attack, decision-makers were impeded in their ability to execute timely and sufficient responses akin to escalation through either digital or kinetic means. Second, even when members of the Ukrainian government condemned Russia for the act, no offensive response, either kinetic or in-kind, was taken . These cases show that even cyber attacks impacting critical infrastructure have low-escalatory potential, a trait that is especially unique when linked to the ongoing geopolitical tensions that shape Russian-Ukrainian relations outside the digital realm. As such, cyber conflicts cannot easily demonstrate escalatory potential using digital means.\nFurthermore, Borghard and Lonergan (2019; 125-138) argue that cyber operations are \"poor tools of escalation\" for four reasons: they are time-consuming to develop, they have a limited impact on the victim state, states have countervailing tradeoffs in using cyber tools, and there are few appropriate cross-domain responses to cyber attacks. First, developing retaliatory cyber tools is time-consuming (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 125). In the event of a cyber attack, a state or institution may not have immediate access to the digital tools required to launch a counteroffensive. According to Borghard and Lonergan (2019: 125), \"offensive cyber operations deliver effects against targets through exploiting a vulnerability to gain access (through an attack vector) to a target's network or system.\" This backdoor access would need to be pre-installed and ready to act on for a timely counterattack to work; without this preset, any response would be time-consuming and miss the opportunity to escalate the conflict. If a conflicting entity did have access to these digital means for a cyber\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nRIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\noffensive, it would have to reconcile with concerns of attribution (Wohlfeld &amp; Jasper 2018). While kinetic conflicts have a clear direction and source of an attack, cyber conflicts are not always evident (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 30).\nThis leads to the second issue: the effects of cyber operations are limited (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 131). If a state responds to a cyber attack with a cyber offensive of its own, the nature of the response would likely be limited in its impact and only supply a temporary nuisance or network disruption (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 123). In extreme cases, cyber offensives may attack critical infrastructure or influence economics by disrupting trust in governments and corporations. Yet even in these instances, the effects of the initial and responding cyber attacks would be temporary and unsustainable (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 131), thus failing to escalate the conflict.\nMoreover, many cyber attacks have uncertain and unintended repercussions (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 41), thus rendering hasty responses ineffective in the long run. By lacking a pronounced intensification of the cyber conflict due to limitations on impact, parties cannot escalate the conflict to a stalemate under conventional mhs. In the same vein, it is imperative to acknowledge that uncertainty permits future technological advances that may result in cyber tools with sufficient cross-domain capabilities, more destructive effects, or greater severity in impact. Whenever these tools are invented, perhaps the face of cyber conflict will change, and cyber operations will possess greater escalatory potential. Nevertheless, until that day, the current nature of cyber conflict demonstrates low-cost and low-impact effects upon the victimized state. As such, it limits the effectiveness of responding attacks at escalating a cyber conflict through digital means.\nThe third impediment for cyber escalation is the existence of countervailing tradeoffs for cyber operations (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 133). Many states execute cyber operations against other entities to achieve the goals of sabotage, espionage, or subversion , all of which require secrecy to succeed (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 134). Since cyber tools are perceived as a more cost-effective and clandestine alternative to conventional warfare and espionage, political leaders are more likely to benefit from the continued development of cyber offense capabilities (Wohlfeld &amp; Jasper 2018). Consequently, states will be less willing to employ conspicuous, escalatory operations if it risks compromising their other large-scale operations (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 134). The risk comes from the potential that the attack is discovered since patches can be made that impede future access to the systems and data that governments aim to exploit. This reduces the likelihood that conflicting parties will perceive an incentive to escalate cyber disputes via a public response, especially if governments are pressured to justify their actions by revealing\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nPOLK\nthat the initial attack occurred. In doing so, states risk exposing their vulnerabilities or threatening their international standing. As a result, states may be less likely to escalate a cyber conflict, both within and outside the domain of cyberspace (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 134).\nLastly, Borghard and Lonergan claim that it is unlikely that states will respond to a cyber attack through kinetic or cross-domain means (2019: 137). Unlike conventional conflict, cyber attacks do not produce the same carnage, psychological pressure, or violence as kinetic attacks. Instead, questions about the proportionality of responding to a cyber incident with cross-domain capabilities limit the feasibility of justifying kinetic responses to cyber attacks (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 137). Historically there has never been any cross-domain response to a first strike cyber attack, and there are very few instances of a kinetic response being used to answer cyber attacks in hybrid conflict. The most notable kinetic attack is Israel's 2019 airstrike against Hamas. In this instance, Israel's response to Hamas' cyber activities against the government appears to demonstrate an immediate conflict escalation. Yet, this dispute took place in the context of an ongoing and kinetic conflict, thus disqualifying its label as a pure cyber conflict (Borghard &amp; Schneider 2019). With this in mind, it is evident that there are significant limitations to a cross-domain escalation of pure cyber conflict.\nStill, some counterarguments stress the possibility of cross-domain escalation in cyber conflict by suggesting that a state could interpret an initial cyber attack as an act of war and employ a kinetic response. Borghard and Lonergan (2019: 138) acknowledge that the perception of some cyber attacks as low-impact or low-cost may apply to only certain states and political ideologies. Once again, uncertainty is an essential feature as much of the concern surrounding escalation in cyber conflict centers on the threats posed by ambiguity in risk analysis and escalation management (Libicki &amp; Tkacheva 2020).\nWhen states are not certain of their rivals' assumptions about how domains are interconnected and what constitutes an act of war, it is plausible that the result could lead to unintended escalation of the conflict into conventional warfare. In this scenario, if a state were to respond promptly to a cyber attack with a kinetic operation, then conventional understandings of MHS would have relevance; after all, at this point the conflict would have crossed a threshold into the physical realm and would follow conventional rules of engagement and escalation management. At this point, a cyber conflict-turned-conventional would no longer apply to this study since the focus is primarily on \"pure\" cyber conflict with no cross-domain aspects.\nHowever, what about a hypothetical in which a state first makes a threat to escalate a cyber conflict into a conventional war? In this scenario, the\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nuncertainty aspect of cyberspace suggests that mhs might not necessarily hold relevance. The threat of cross-domain escalation is a form of deterrence, which has limited and ambiguous influence in cyber conflict and the digital domain. Sweijs and Zilincik (2021: 133) state that three criteria influence escalation management in cross-domain deterrence (cdd): attribution, credibility and threat proportionality, and signaling.\n##### Attribution\nAttribution of initial cyber attacks can be tedious, time-consuming, and inexact, leading to uncertainty in directing the threat at the appropriate target. This uncertainty risks international embarrassment, condemnation, or even tension if the threatening state incorrectly identifies a perpetrator or lacks evidence. As a result, the threat may not effectively escalate the conflict across domains since it may be easily dismissed. Furthermore, if a threat is directed at another state, accurately or not, the accused state would have little incentive to act upon standard mhs conceptualizations of ripeness and agree to negotiations. Once the accusation has been made, any response to a threat of kinetic escalation of a cyber conflict would require the accused to admit their cyber capabilities, thereby negating the serviceability of these digital tools and jeopardizing other cyber operations elsewhere in the world. As such, mhs would not necessarily hold relevance in scenarios where states rely on cross-domain escalation threats because uncertainty and attribution limits prevent states from utilizing effective cdd strategies.\n##### Credibility and threat proportionality\nRegarding credibility and threat proportionality, Sweijs and Zilincik (2021: 137) note that cdd is “complicated by the inherent disproportionality of responses across domains and instruments of power.” In this case, the relevance of mhs to threats of escalation is limited by the uncertain risk of how the international community and general population will perceive this intimidation. Despite the concern over states’ diverging definitions of what constitutes appropriate cross-domain escalation, there is consensus that violent responses to non-violent offensive measures will result in more immediate and severe consequences, which may receive public and international skepticism . As such, states may differ in their gauge of a threat’s credibility. This divergence weakens the case for mhs’ relevance to threats of escalation in cyber conflict since the ensuing uncertainty weakens the efficacy of the threat that domain spillover is plausible or justifiable.\n##### Signaling\nLastly, issues with signaling threats of cross-domain escalation reduce the applicability of mhs processes to cyber conflicts that could turn conventional. In the cyber domain, cross-domain signaling may be misinterpreted, with signals conducted through military means risking greater ambiguity about the signaler’s intentions to the target. As Sweijs and Zilincik (2021: 140)\nPOLK\nnote, \"a signal of resolve to respond to cyberattacks by moving platforms for the launch of conventional or nuclear weapons may be easily interpreted as a preparation for hostilities rather than as an adjustment of the deterrence posture.\" As a result, the target of the threat may view the cross-domain action as separate from the cyber conflict or as a general increase in tension outside of the digital realm. The risk of ambiguity in cross-domain signaling impedes MHS principles' efficacy in escalating the conflict since the action may appear detached from or external to the cyber conflict.\nWithout the capacity to escalate ongoing digital disputes, cyber conflicts present a challenge to conventional ripeness theory and do not offer states an incentive to seek a negotiated agreement. Parties' perceptions of a mutually hurting stalemate are more difficult to achieve because the long-term intensifying effects of cyber operations are often imperceptible, reiterating the dilemma of uncertainty in characterizing cyber conflict. Similarly, if a state were to threaten cross-domain spillover, the likelihood that the threat of escalation would serve as a sufficient push-factor towards negotiation is impeded by factors of uncertainty. As such, current ideas about timing and ripeness in cyber conflict remain elusive for cyberspace negotiations and require a reexamination of MHS to address this deviation.\n## Re-defining Mutually Hurting Stalemate\nAddressing the discrepancy between ripeness theory and cyber conflict requires a closer examination of the concept of mutually hurting stalemate. The perception of a stalemate is clearly critical in pushing conflicting parties towards negotiation. However, existing scholarship emphasizes that perception is built on mutual hurt and the threat (or existence) of unsustainable escalation. Since cyber weapons are not reliable tools of escalation and cyber operations present enticing tradeoffs for their continued use, mutual hurt and the threat of intensification are not attainable. As such, redefining the idea of a stalemate provides an alteration of ripeness theory for cyber conflicts.\nThis new definition addresses the main component of MHS: the hurting stalemate. The mutuality of MHS is not called into question since it is an essential aspect of any conflict. The reciprocal nature of conflict is inherent to the disagreement: all parties must be targets and initiators of cyber attacks for the cyber conflict to exist. Even where attribution issues exist, the mutual perception of a cyber attack from a rival is sufficient for the conflict to persist. Consequently, tit-for-tat cyber attacks are crucial in both the conflict and\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nRIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nnegotiation stages, and mutuality remains integral to encouraging parties to approach negotiation as a way out of cyber conflict.\nWhile the hurting stalemate is crucial to perceptions of ripe moments in conventional conflict, the phrase itself is incomplete in characterizing cyber conflict. The hurting stalemate is a painful deadlock characterized by a plateau, \"a flat and unending terrain without relief\" , unbearable to both parties. This concept is not wholly accurate for cyber conflict due to the limits of inflicting pain through cyber means and the low-intensity nature of cyber operations. For one, cyber tools, like conventional weaponry, are a means for achieving political objectives. In cyber conflict, each cyber operation, analyzed individually, aims (and often achieves) short-term goals such as gaining trade and military secrets, displaying cyber capabilities, or deterring activity. When combined to characterize cyber conflict, the long-term goals reveal themselves. The long-term objectives in cyber conflict show how the mutuality of hurt is limited since the operations themselves are limited in scope and impact. In fact, it is challenging to conceptualize cyber conflict as \"winnable,\" given that the impact of cyber operations is constrained and unlikely to debilitate the target. According to Valeriano and Maness (2015: 61), cyber operations are often innocuous and used primarily \"as methods of signaling displeasure or discord to a rival,\" a demonstration of the restraint used by states when engaging in cyberspace. Cyber weapons have limited applicability in their \"hurting\" capability even in more destructive incidences, such as the Stuxnet worm that destroyed Iranian nuclear centrifuges in Operation Olympic Games. Though intending to deter or delay Iran's nuclear weapons development, Operation Olympic Games ultimately bolstered Tehran's determination to restore and expand its nuclear research in Natanz .\nWith this limitation in mind, it is important to note that hurt from cyber conflict still exists. Targeted countries may experience damages or disruptions to their institutions and networks, impacting daily operations or economic mobility. Similarly, non-cyber responses to cyber operations, such as sanctions, condemnation, or other negative foreign policy measures, may inflict damages on the perceived initiator of an attack. Therefore, hurt is present in cyber conflict. However, there is a critical distinction between kinetic and cyber hurt: the hurt is not exhaustive in cyber conflict. Since cyber conflict is non-escalatory and used as a first-response or low-intensity method of engagement (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015), the hurt it inflicts on the target is not equal to the painful deadlock prescribed by conventional MHS. Instead, this hurt is perpetually sustainable, akin to Zartman's idea of \"the soft, stable, and self-serving stalemate\" (S5).\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nPOLK\nAccording to Zartman, the S5 is \"a low-level conflict, even when punctuated by occasional blips of violence\" that \"leaves each of the parties ... able to claim that it has not been defeated, which is a victory of sorts\" (2005a: 52). The S5 typically describes intractable conflicts in the kinetic domain, explaining the absence of ripeness in pushing the conflicting parties towards a negotiated solution . In conventional analysis, factors of protracted conflict, zero-sum identities, the profitability of continued fighting, mutually exclusive solutions, and deficient perceptions of ripeness contribute to intractability in kinetic conflict . However, these features are not all representative of cyber conflict.\nCyber operations are both the means and ends to accomplishing short-term goals, disrupting issues of protraction even if the conflict itself is perpetual. Furthermore, cyber conflicts often do not involve zero-sum identities unique to the dispute, although the cyber conflict may exacerbate pre-existing conflicts between states. Nevertheless, the issues of profitability, solution saliency, and ripeness are typical of cyber conflicts, which are defined by countervailing tradeoffs encouraging the perpetuation of the conflict (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 133), and diverging norms and interests hampering cyber agreements. As such, cyber conflicts share some features of intractable disputes, which are emblematic of S5. However, S5 is still insufficient for characterizing cyber conflict due to the uncertainty surrounding cyberspace and the unique nature of intractability in the digital realm.\nWith these limitations in mind, the standard perception of a hurting stalemate is improbable in cyber conflict, and a conventional ripe moment for negotiation would not be perceived. Instead, adjusting the criteria for a hurting stalemate reshapes the conditions for ripeness in cyber conflict. This new condition focuses on a \"mutually harming standoff,\" a condition on the spectrum between Zartman's theories of S5 and MHS that permits the lack of a hurting stalemate in cyber conflict.\n## Mutually Harming Standoff, Ripeness, and Cyber Negotiations\nA mutually harming standoff (which will be referred to as MHS2) is distinct from a mutually hurting stalemate (hereafter referred to as MHS1) since it emphasizes the perfunctory character of the pain and reciprocity in cyber conflict. The \"harm\" inflicted by cyber operations may have a negative impact on the targeted state, but it is not so unbearable that the state is incapable of persisting without a way out. In other words, the state is not pressed into seeking an alternative to the cyber conflict since the harm it experiences is not exhaustive. Furthermore, a \"standoff\" provides a better image than a stalemate. While the hurting stalemate represents unwinnable deadlocks that are\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8–36\nRIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\npainful to all parties , the standoff is more akin to an effectively manageable, if not perpetual and harmful, dispute with high reciprocity and low escalation capacity (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 129). This captures the nature of cyber conflict and adapts a critical component of ripeness theory.\nIf MHS2 characterizes long-term cyber conflict, when and how can it be perceived? More importantly, how can negotiators operationalize MHS2 to encourage cyber negotiations if a ripe moment is improbable in cyber conflict? Both questions are linked to another component of ripeness theory: mutually enticing opportunity (MEO). In Zartman's ripeness theory, perceptions of MHS1 are necessary, if insufficient, for encouraging parties to engage in dialogue as a way out of conventional conflict. This may be supplemented by perceptions of an MEO, which acts as the pull-factor for parties to engage in and continue negotiations . Zartman acknowledges that few cases of conventional conflict demonstrate the opening of negotiations due to perceptions of an MEO alone. However, these perceptions help encourage parties to commit to negotiations once they commence . Still, since conventional MHS1 does not exist in cyber conflict, realizing an MHS2 coupled with perceptions of an MEO can push rival cyber parties toward negotiations.\nFigure 3 presents an adaptation of the standard stages of the conflict arc for cyber disputes. In this depiction, MHS2 represents the state of the conflict from the time of emergence. This shows that without escalatory capacities, cyber conflicts are inherently defined by the perpetual reciprocity of cyber\nFIGURE 3 Stages of cyber conflict\nADAPTED FROM BRAHM (2003)\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nPOLK\nattacks between states, continuing the plateau indefinitely as conflict persists in a low intensity and restrained manner. To disrupt this, the perception of an MEO is necessary to act as the new push-factor for parties to enter and commit to negotiations.\nIn cyber conflict, the MEO can manifest in several ways. These incentives may appear at different thresholds of pain throughout the dispute and encourage states to consider negotiations under various circumstances. Like MHS1, MHS2 pain thresholds are perceptual, and thus MEO S will be subjective from case to case . Analyzing an array of MEO S showcases potential push-factor attributes unique to the nature of cyberspace that could encourage cyber conflict negotiation.\nNorms development collaboration. Like conventional conflicts, both parties may inherently view alternatives to victory that do not include tit-for-tat cyber exchanges. This may have limitations pending each party's goals in conducting cyber operations, but the opportunity to collaborate may displace the benefits of using digital tools against rivals. This collaboration leads to an impactful and enticing opportunity for negotiation: norms development. Given the standard of uncertainty in the cyber realm, states can attempt to shape the digital world in their image by collaborating to bilaterally develop and diffuse norms that meet their interests on a global scale. In other words, by leveraging the perception that normative interests are more far-reaching and achievable through bilateral collaboration, negotiators may be more successful in pushing conflicting parties to the table to coordinate on broader issues that both address and extend beyond the ongoing conflict.\nThe MEO for norms development collaboration is especially pertinent in cyber conflicts where the targets are primarily private and government non-military infrastructure. This represents one threshold for pain on the lattice of MHS2 ripeness; when attacks are apparent and far-reaching in their impact on the public, states are more likely to respond negatively (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 125). This is because many states view public interference in cyberspace as \"crossing a line\" in the digital realm, despite the lack of norms or agreements dictating this taboo (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015). Conversely, in cyber conflicts where attacks primarily target political and military networks, \"victim\" states are less likely to react with a negative or conflict-prone response (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 123-124). This suggests that cyber conflicts which focus on traditional government-to-government attacks, including infiltrations and intrusions through Trojans and APTs, are likely to present the norm for cyber conflict (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015). On the other hand, DDoS attacks are more obvious in their display of aggression since they interfere with public websites and systems, and states are more likely to respond negatively to the attack due to pressure from the public impacted by the incident.\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nRIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nCyber conflicts that reach MHS2 thresholds, in which public infrastructure is the primary target, can present an MEO for parties to meet to recalibrate norms for cyberspace conduct. For example, suppose the cyber conflict is characterized by long-run DDoS attacks or infiltrations targeting non-military private and government networks. In that case, participants may use these perceived violations as an opportunity to collaborate and bilaterally promote norms in cyber conflict that benefit both parties. In other words, while perpetuating the tit-for-tat cycle of the cyber conflict is a non-escalatory option, continued DDoS attacks may present reasonable grounds for decision-makers to examine alternatives to the conflict, thereby seeking innovative solutions for a way out of MHS2. Furthermore, considering the absence of concrete norms in cyberspace, parties may view the chance to negotiate and act as norm-makers as a mutually enticing opportunity.\nProtean power. In addition to norms development collaboration, the opportunity for states to demonstrate \"protean power\" is an enticing opportunity for decision-makers to choose negotiation in cyber conflict. This form of power, coined by Katzenstein and Seybert in 2018, counters the aforementioned \"control power\" and acknowledges the importance of creativity and innovation in decision-making when facing increasingly uncertain international dynamics. Due to the uncertain nature of cyberspace, successful navigation and utility of the digital realm require states to remain innovative, flexible, and agile in responding to rapid changes in technology or when dealing with crises where assurances in risk analyses are limited. As such, the negotiating table is the ideal medium for states to gain and exhibit protean power since the choice to negotiate in cyber conflict is a strategic, albeit inventive and pioneering option that may result in relative gains for both states.\nMoreover, states will likely view the display of protean power as a complement or, in some cases, substitute to other conventional understandings of power dynamics, such as hard power. As Katzenstein and Seybert (2018: 25) put it, \"the world is well stocked with low-probability events such as the sudden appearance of terrorist organizations operating on a global scale and waves of large-scale human migration.\" Therefore, displaying creative prowess in the face of ambiguity, instability, and uncertainty is vital for actors \"to derive relative advantage from unexpected challenges\" (Katzenstein &amp; Seybert 2018: 25). In cyber conflict, states that choose to negotiate over a continuation of tit-for-tat exchanges that prolong the status quo of MHS2 are more likely to be perceived as adaptable and inventive in responding to uncertainty surrounding the nature of cyberspace and geopolitics in this domain. Consequently, states that choose negotiation in cyber conflict have a stronger capacity for protean power, making them more durable and influential in handling increasingly complex dynamics in world politics.\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nPOLK\nSmall state influence. Similarly, small states may be uniquely positioned to act on a push-factor MEO in cyber conflict since the newness of the domain presents opportunities for gaining leverage in the international arena. Following the benefits of protean power, the opportunity to demonstrate influence over rival states through innovation and improvisation in cyber conflict management incentivizes smaller states to push for negotiation as a means of alleviating tensions. This then acts as a push-factor MEO for smaller states seeking greater power in the international arena at large, especially since the democratic layout of cyberspace allows for ease of entry to new actors. In turn, larger states may be incentivized to negotiate in cyber conflict to further extend their influence in the digital realm, as well as the physical one.\nCross-conflict negotiation leverage. Finally, rival states with ongoing non-cyber tensions may be incentivized to negotiate as an avenue for leverage in other conflict domains. In other words, states with ongoing geopolitical tensions, such as the US and Russia, Japan and South Korea, or India and Pakistan, may be able to bargain agreements made in cyberspace with concessions in other negotiations or settlements. This also presents another scenario in which pain thresholds may be achieved in MHS2. Cyber conflicts that persist alongside other tensions or conflicts will prompt heightened sensitivities and feelings of annoyance between rivals. Yet, the digital realm remains the ideal medium for achieving cooperation or relative gains between rivals despite this distrust. The cyber domain provides an opportunity for norms development, an exhibition of power, and leverage in other conflict settlements. Thus, cyber conflicts between historic rival states are likely to perceive the status quo as a threshold of pain that makes an MEO for cooperation in the digital world appealing. Moreover, if the rivals perceive an opportunity to achieve non-cyber gains through cyber conflict negotiations, the parties already in conflict may consider this a push-factor MEO in cyberspace.\nThis MEO is well-suited for states engaged in regional conflict, a feature that Valeriano and Maness (2105: 81) note as being one of the most common fora for cyber conflict. For example, Japan and South Korea have deep-seated hostilities, ranging from disagreements over maritime control to enmities founded on the Korean peninsula's history of Japanese occupation. Many cyber-attacks between the two countries reflect these tensions, with both countries engaging in tit-for-tat exchanges between 2001 and 2011 (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 88). Interestingly, Japanese decision-makers often choose \"more cooperative interactions with their regional rivals\" despite ongoing cyber conflicts, suggesting a desire not to escalate tensions with nearby states (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 123). It follows, then, that regional rivals may have an MEO to use cyberspace as a platform for negotiation to influence overall tensions since the alternative is maintaining the status quo and perpetuating ongoing hostilities.\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nRIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nLastly, rivals may be incentivized to negotiate cyber conflict since they could gain greater international influence where their interests align. Again, Japan and South Korea exemplify this. Since both states are closely aligned with US interests (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 216), agreements between the two, especially those that impact both the cyber and physical domains, may strengthen their standing with the US and against larger rivals like China. As such, this opportunity for both mutual and relative gains acts as a push-factor for entrenched rival states to pursue cyber conflict negotiation.\nIn sum, conventional ripeness theory is limited in cyber conflict since mutually hurting stalemates (MHS1) are unattainable in cyberspace. Instead, a mutually harming standoff (MHS2) is more characteristic of the state of tit-for-tat cyber conflicts, where parties experience adverse effects from reciprocal attacks, but not at an unsustainable level. When long-term cyber conflict is recognized as an MHS2, specific attributes of the attacks may be operationalized to enact a push-factor MEO that encourages the parties to negotiate. These MEOs may hinge on the opportunity for cyber combatants to act as norm-makers by pursuing bilateral agreements that resolve the conflict and improve conduct in cyberspace or may focus on displays of protean power as small states or historic rivals. To represent this process, Figure 4 illustrates an adaptation of Zartman's conventional ripeness theory and negotiation progression to denote the push and pull aspects of MHS2 in cyber conflict. Here, MHS2 is presented\nFIGURE 4 Elements of Mutually Harming Standoff (MHS2) and the process of negotiation\nADAPTED FROM ZARTMAN (2000: 230, 242)\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nPOLK\nas the state of the conflict, while the push-factor MEO is a dependent variable requiring both parties' perception. Only after this perception is operationalized will the parties pursue negotiation as a way out of cyber conflict.\n## 2015 US-China Cybersecurity Agreement\nThe 2015 US-China Cybersecurity Agreement illustrates how MHS2 and MEO push-factors adapt the concept of timing in cyber conflict negotiations. These negotiations produced a cybersecurity agreement that established a precedent for defining economically motivated cyber espionage (EMCE) (Harold, Libicki, &amp; Stuth Cevallos 2016: 46). This demonstrates that norm-making is an attractive prospect for cyber negotiations following an MHS2, especially due to the uncertain and nebulous environment which characterizes cyberspace. The US-China agreement also showcases the limitations of applying current ripeness theory models to a bilateral cyber conflict. An overview of the US-China cyber conflict and its corresponding negotiations demonstrates how ripeness theory can be adjusted in cyber conflict to determine the timing of cyber negotiations.\n## Background: US-China Cyber Conflict\nThe US-China cyber conflict roughly began in 2003 and has predominately consisted of cyber espionage operations between the two countries (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 91–92). This characterization is key to the perpetuity of the conflict, and it is essential to examine both countries' stances on cyberspace and the rulebook by which they operate. First, the United States extends its values regarding individual freedoms and independence to the cyber realm (Brown &amp; Yung 2017a). The US government emphasizes online freedom of expression, liberal information flows, and data privacy in its national cybersecurity policies, and uses these values as the basis for which it evaluates foreign attacks on US networks (Brown &amp; Yung 2017a; Segal 2015). This is especially true for cyber espionage. According to Brown and Yung (2017a), the US makes distinctions between forms of espionage based on their objective, stating that \"in the US view, as long as such operations collect information about economic and financial matters for the purpose of benefiting national security, they are routine intelligence work.\" In this case, corporate espionage for the economic benefit of private companies is considered off-limits.\nChina also applies its political ideologies to cyberspace operations, and these values contradict the United States. At the forefront of China's cybersecurity strategy is the idea of Internet sovereignty, a norm shared by other\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nRIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\ngovernments to promote state control over networks within their territory (Brown &amp; Yung 2017b). The Chinese government advocates for states to set their own rules regarding cyberspace and pursues digital independence from the US, which owns most of the world's IP addresses and has been heavy-handed in Internet governance (Brown &amp; Yung 2017b; Singer &amp; Friedman 2014: 140; Levite &amp; Jinghua 2019). Furthermore, China rejects the militarization of cyberspace, accusing the US of securitizing the digital domain and aggressively developing \"cyber arms\" in response to activities by perceived rivals like Russia and China (Brown &amp; Yung 2017b).\nIt is this argument that is crucial to China's cyber operations. In China's view, the US' aggressive pursuit of offensive cyber capabilities necessitates China's cyber development (Brown &amp; Yung 2017a; Singer &amp; Friedman 2014: 140). Additionally, China's stance on cyber espionage makes no distinction between operations pursuing an economic advantage versus a national security advantage . Instead, China \"views economic competition as a way to achieve peer status with the US and sees cyberspace as an asymmetric instrument which it can successfully use to compete with the United States\" (Brown &amp; Yung 2017a). Thus, the Chinese agenda pursues cyber espionage for economic advantage as \"a quasi-legitimate way to achieve a North-South redistribution of wealth\" . China's cyber policies aim to level the imbalance between the West and China and promote norms of self-determination in cyberspace.\nIn the US-China cyber conflict, various cyber weapons were used. Between 2003 and 2006, the Titan Rain attack employed Trojans, or unauthorized software that permits access to a system or program, to infiltrate US government and contracting networks such as the State Department and Lockheed Martin (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 34; Rid 2012: 20). This attack was attributed to the Chinese government, as was the 2006 intrusion by the APT \"Shady RAT,\" which stole secret information related to negotiation strategies, manufacturing design plans, and US national security policies (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 91; Singer &amp; Friedman 2014: 92). The international hack by GhostNet, which lasted from 2007 to 2009, utilized phishing scams to acquire access to computer microphones and cameras, allowing hackers to record conversations by State Department and Pentagon officials (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 131). This, along with other long-run intrusions and thefts, was again attributed to the Chinese government.\nIn response, US agencies retaliated against Chinese institutions by employing defensive cyber attacks. Operation Cisco Raider lasted from 2006 to 2010 and attempted to counter the distribution of counterfeit Cisco technology stolen in a Chinese hack (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 91). Another operation,\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nPOLK\nBuckshot Yankee, responded against a hack of US defense networks (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 91). Finally, the long-term operation, Shotgiant, aimed to link the Chinese telecommunications firm, Huawei, to the People's Liberation Army (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 91; Sanger &amp; Perlroth 2014; Sanger 2018). This operation also endeavored to \"exploit Huawei's technology so that when the company sold equipment to other countries ... the NSA could roam through their computer and telephone networks to conduct surveillance and, if ordered by the president, offensive cyberoperations\" (Sanger &amp; Perlroth 2014). As such, the US-China cyber conflict included exchanges of offensive and retaliatory operations between the two nations to combat diverging normative values regarding espionage.\n## Cyber Negotiations\nThroughout the cyber conflict, US-China tensions never escalated to kinetic force. Instead, the conflict remained tit-for-tat, with both governments suffering from espionage that notably affected both military and non-military private and government entities. Due to the dispute's long-term, low intensity, and restrained nature, the US-China cyber conflict gradually developed into an MHS2.\nThe MHS2 permitted both governments to continue with their cyber attacks. However, in 2009 they began to engage in Track Two diplomatic talks between the US think-tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) and China's Institute of Contemporary International Relations (CICIR) . What pushed the countries towards informal dialogue? According to one Chinese official, dialogue is a better alternative to perpetual conflict because both countries are capable of continued operations but would be better served by negotiating to settle their disagreements (Singer &amp; Friedman 2014). This represents the push-factor MEO, which promotes dialogue for norms establishment between two cyber rivals.\nThe Track Two talks further reflect the impact of MEOs for norm diffusion, with the first of these informal dialogues beginning in December 2009. Early dialogues focused on addressing both states' concerns about cyber sovereignty, cyberspace norms, multilateralism in addressing cybercrime, and confidence-building in cyberspace . These informal dialogues continued in addition to Track 1.5 discussions and alternated between Washington, DC and Beijing throughout the process. Eventually, discussions regarding cyber espionage and what it constitutes emerged alongside the issues of cyber sovereignty, governance, and US primacy in cyberspace (Harold, Libicki &amp; Stuth Cevallos 2016). It should be noted that these dialogues were \"were marked more by continuity than change,\" with participants on both sides maintaining their stances\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nRIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\non definitions of terms and values (Harold, Libicki &amp; Stuth Cevallos 2016: 49). Yet the governments' willingness to meet to discuss their stances in the cyber conflict signals an interesting push for a resolution in cyber conflict, without the need of a hurting stalemate.\nThese dialogues continued in a Track Two and Track 1.5 capacity, and by 2013, Track One negotiations commenced. However, these talks were interrupted in 2014 after the US indicted five People's Liberation Army officials with cyber espionage charges (Harold, Libicki &amp; Stuth Cevallos 2016; Brown &amp; Yung 2017a). The indictment asserted that members of the Chinese military stole trade secrets from US industries to bolster China's competitiveness in the international market. In response, the Chinese government walked away from the negotiations and asserted that the US accusations were hypocritical in light of the 2013 NSA leaks (Brown &amp; Yung 2017a). However, the talks resumed the following summer, and in September 2015, US President Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping released a statement on a new Cybersecurity Agreement (Harold, Libicki &amp; Stuth Cevallos 2016). The two governments agreed to improve coordination in investigating and preventing cybercrime, not conduct or support cyber intellectual property theft, and improve cooperation in promoting international norms in cyberspace .\nThe 2015 Agreement achieved both mixed results and mixed reactions. Though some scholars believe that China's agreement on the existence of economically motivated cyber espionage (EMCE) is an incremental step in reducing cyber intellectual property theft, few believe it has since decreased (Brown &amp; Yung 2017c). There has been continued concern about the quality of the agreement and China's adherence to the terms (Brown &amp; Yung 2017c). While the negotiators were able to successfully agree on cyber-specific definitions of EMCE, a significant achievement in cyber norm development, gaps in the agreement have allowed both countries to exploit technicalities in the agreement. For example, though reports suggest a decrease in Chinese economic espionage, it appears that \"Chinese operators are going after technologies that are dual-use [such as telecommunications industries], and so might not be covered by the agreements\" . Similarly, the US espionage operations against Huawei have persisted, with non-cyber sanctions and indictments attacking company leadership due to the recent dispute over 5G, surveillance, and data privacy .\n## Analysis\nDespite the weaknesses of the US-China Cybersecurity Agreement, the existence of the cyber negotiations sets a unique precedent regarding the timing of bilateral dialogues in cyber conflict. The concepts of MHS2 and push-factor\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nmeo demonstrate how ripeness can be determined within cyber disputes, thus adapting Zartman's original theory to a new domain of conflict. Reviewing the conditions of ripeness in the US-China cyber conflict helps capture the applicability of mhs2 and meo in cyber conflict.\nThroughout the US-China cyber dispute, long-term operations and attacks generated an entrenched and enduring conflict between two cyber rivals. The use of intrusive cyber weapons to conduct espionage on non-military targets prompted the exchange of attacks, and the diverging perspectives on cyber and espionage norms deepened the tensions between the two countries. In this case, the conflict's perpetuity embodied an mhs2, with both countries receiving damages in their economic and political security due to cyber and non-cyber retaliations. Even so, both countries were caught in a standoff rather than a stalemate since these damages were not exhaustive, permanent, or fatigue-inducing. In fact, both countries focused on long-term cyber weaponry, like apts and Trojans, to conduct lengthy operations that were sustainable regardless of the harm dealt to each government in response.\nWith this perpetual-while-manageable standoff reached, both countries continued to conduct their cyber operations against one another. Nevertheless, the opportunity to collaborate on norms development was the meo that pushed both governments towards negotiation. This was first captured and operationalized at the informal level. Through the Track Two dialogues, the US and Chinese think tanks provided a platform for sharing and understanding each other's values and perspectives of cyberspace and security. This informal communication linked the two governments, regardless of the conflict's perpetuity, and provided the opportunity for cooperation in norm-making and diffusion. This was especially enticing considering that the UN Group of Governmental Experts (UN gge) on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace has convened multiple times throughout the US-China conflict to establish international norms in cyberspace (gip Digital Watch Observatory 2021). If the US and China could bilaterally collaborate on cyberspace norms, their influence in international norm-making would be especially prominent and allow both countries to demonstrate their protean power in a new and uncertain domain.\nTrack 1.5 and Track One dialogues between the two governments further demonstrate this dedication to coordination in resolving the cyber conflict while establishing rules for conduct in cyberspace. Though the ultimate agreement may have failed in effectively instituting these norms, the fact that understanding was reached on the definition of emce is significant. The US and China's commitment to establishing norms in cyberspace to resolve the cyber conflict is therefore an important example of cyber negotiations. Future\nRIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\n\n# Conclusion\nThe emergence of new technologies undoubtedly impacts geopolitical conduct between states and influences rivalries old and new as a domain for conflict. Cyber conflict, regardless of its potential to supplant conventional warfare, has surfaced as a new source of tension between states, one that is ill-defined and difficult to regulate. As such, developing capacities for resolving cyber conflict requires new approaches to negotiation and mediation, and revisiting ripeness theory allows scholars and practitioners to adapt prevailing negotiation strategies to new realms of conflict.\nDue to the nature of cyber conflict, conventional ideas of ripeness theory are inadequate for deciding when to begin cyber negotiations. Limitations in escalation, the perception of cyber operations as \"escalatory offramps,\" countervailing tradeoffs in the use of cyber tools, and the first-use character of cyber weapons prevent states from perceiving mutually hurting stalemates in tit-for-tat cyber conflict. Therefore, modifying the definition of a hurting stalemate better captures the nature of cyber conflict and offers an alternative for timing negotiations. \"Mutually harming standoff\" is more emblematic of the plateau in cyber conflict since both states may feel the consequences of the conflict, but to a manageable and sustainable degree. When long-term cyber conflict is reached, an MHS2 has taken effect, and combining it with the component of mutually enticing opportunity will push actors towards cyber negotiations.\nThe MEO, while operating as a pull-factor in kinetic conflict, serves a more significant role in propelling conflicting parties toward negotiations because cyberspace provides incentives for collaboration over conflict. Though vested with the capacity for continued cyber conflict, rival states may perceive the opportunities to collaborate on norms development, exercise protean power, or gain leverage in external conflicts as ideal for promoting their agendas on cyberspace bilaterally. This is captured by the case of the US-China Cybersecurity Agreement.\nIn this instance, the reciprocal cyber conflict between the US and China was characterized by an MHS2. Nonetheless, the governments seized the opportunity to engage in norm-making through dialogue instead of unilaterally trying to \"win\" in cyber conflict. These negotiations evolved from informal Track Two discussions to Track One negotiation and agreement between American and\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nPOLK\nChinese leadership, thus providing precedent for a bilateral negotiation to a pure \"cyber conflict.\" Though the agreement itself has flaws, the timing of the negotiation signals that MHS1 is not necessary and is better characterized by an MHS2. In addition, the MEO is a stronger and more necessary (if insufficient) component for achieving ripeness in cyber conflict.\nFuture research on the negotiation or mediation process may provide greater clarity on achieving more successful cyber agreements in the future. Likewise, examining the strategies of multilateral cyber negotiations and their impact on norms development would impact the nature of state-to-state cyber conflict. Such evolutions will necessitate further research as new capabilities and dynamics emerge. In the meantime, exploring other cyber conflicts, such as those between long-term rivals like the US-Russia, India-Pakistan, and North Korea-South Korea, may provide a prescriptive application of the adapted ripeness theory.\nThe application of ripeness theory, like conflict itself, is continually evolving. New technologies and conflict domains shape peace efforts and strategies in practical and academic application. In cyber conflict, adjusting the components of ripeness theory to include mutually harming standoffs and MEOs demonstrates how negotiation practices can shift to address emerging threats and realms of uncertainty that characterize new domains of conflict. Without this adjustment, cyber conflicts and other new realms for war, remain out of reach for resolution.",

As the world becomes more interconnected through digital means, a potential \"fifth domain\" for conflict has emerged in the cyber realm (Murphy 2010), inviting scholars to debate the nature of cyber attacks, cyber espionage, and disinformation campaigns as \"cyber warfare\" (Rid 2012). With the emergence of cyberwar as a key buzzword in political and academic spheres, the question of how to resolve cyber conflicts shifts the focus to negotiation theory.\nAnalysis of cyber conflict presents a challenge to the prevailing negotiation concept, ripeness theory. Ripeness theory posits that the timing of a negotiation stems from the conflicting parties' perception of a \"mutually hurting stalemate\" (MHS) and \"a way out\" of conflict through dialogue (Zartman 2000). While this theory has shown merit for negotiations related to conventional warfare or economic disputes, there are gaps in its applicability for resolving cyber conflict. Specifically, the concept of a \"hurting stalemate\" has little to no presence in cyber disputes, rendering MHS incompatible with pure cyber negotiations. As such, redefining mutually hurting stalemate for cyber conflict is paramount to address this discrepancy.\nThis analysis attempts to adapt prevailing negotiation theory for conflicts in the cyber domain. First, an overview of what constitutes cyber conflict is provided, the state of its norms and regulations, and the uncertain nature of cyberspace. Second, an analysis of ripeness theory in conventional and cyber conflict highlights the current gaps in negotiation literature when applied to an evolving form of conflict. Third, redefining the idea of MHS by suggesting an alternative, \"mutually harming standoff,\" offers an examination into the timing discrepancy surrounding cyberspace agreements. Lastly, examining the 2015 bilateral US-China Cybersecurity Agreement provides context for applying this hypothesis and demonstrates how accepted negotiation theory may be applied to cyber conflict.\n# Defining Cyber Conflict: Terms, Norms, and the Rise of Uncertainty\nThe definitions of \"cyber conflict\" or \"cyberwarfare\" are a source of contention throughout the international community. There is a lack of shared understanding for terms related to cyberspace, with some scholars arguing that the preoccupation with cyber warfare has little merit. While some governments, academics, and media outlets overemphasize the threat of a \"cyber Pearl Harbor,\" these warnings are more speculative and extreme than reality would suggest (Singer &amp; Friedman 2014: 68). If applying a Clausewitzian understanding of war, which emphasizes its violence, instrumental character, and political\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nPOLK\nnature, it appears that cyberwar has yet to occur, as no cyber attack has met these three criteria (Rid 2012: 7–10).\nRegardless of the debate on the reality of cyber warfare, the fact remains that cyberspace activities continue to shape and threaten geopolitical relations. Offensive cyber exchanges in the digital realm have exacerbated international tensions between technological powerhouses such as the United States, Russia, and China, and developing consensus on the broader idea of “cyber conflict” is pertinent to establishing a new approach to diplomacy on the issue of cyberspace. For this article, we will adopt a broad definition of “cyber conflict” to include information operations between two or more entities that intentionally undermine the economic, political, social, or security systems of states, businesses, and organizations. This definition incorporates such concepts as “cyber espionage,” “disinformation campaigns,” “cyber sabotage,” and “cyberterrorism,” representing tactics initiated or sponsored by states (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015).\nExamples of cyber conflict include the continuous use of cyber operations or the means through which states conduct cyber attacks against the same entity over time. These conflicts are reciprocal, characterized by tit-for-tat cyber exchanges between countries, and may also employ non-cyber means in an effort to deter future attacks, such as sanctions or public condemnation. Cyber conflict includes the use of advanced persistent threats (APTs) to spy on corporate activities or the development and deployment of malicious software to cause physical damage to infrastructure. Cyber operations may use an array of cyber weapons, from the application of botnets in distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks that shut down government websites to the creation of Trojans and backdoors, which infiltrate and sabotage computer networks (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 34). These parameters highlight the scope of the issues and features that shape cyber conflicts and the ambiguities surrounding their nature.\nConversely, this definition does not include small-scale “cybercrime,” which tends to be a for-profit enterprise that does not center on ideology or political gain (Singer &amp; Friedman 2014: 145–155). It also does not include attacks perpetrated by individuals or non-state-sponsored criminal organizations since these efforts more often constitute “cybercrime” and are one-off rogue actions intended to cause chaos or malice rather than achieve policy goals (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 33). Lastly, the article focuses on “pure” cyber conflict, thus dismissing incidences of cyber attacks as part of larger military campaigns or hybrid warfare. While negotiations on conventional conflicts may address concerns relating to cyberspace, kinetic wars are characterized differently from cyber conflicts, as discussed later in the article.\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8–36\nRIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\n# Cyber Norms and Consensus\nDisagreements over what constitutes cyber conflict impact the establishment of international norms for addressing cyber operations. Numerous arrangements have attempted to codify norms for regulating cyberspace and expanding international law to include the digital domain. The Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare is one effort to establish consensus on cyber conflict. This document, first published in 2013, attempts to apply existing international law to cyber conflicts while defining \"cyber attacks\" and \"cyber self-defense\" (Schmitt 2017). However, the Tallinn Manual has no legal standing, and many countries have rejected the arguments it presents (Singer &amp; Friedman 2014: 206). As a result, binding consensus on how states should govern and regulate cyberspace remains indefinite and allows for multiple interpretations of what justifies an attack.\nOther efforts to establish norms in cyberspace involve international processes to develop standards of conduct in the cyber realm. Since 1998, motions to formulate cyber arms control treaties and propagate agreements on cyber governance have shaped international agendas (Ruhl et al. 2020). From intergovernmental institutions like the UN to think tank-led working groups, numerous negotiations and dialogues have been under way to improve the stability and security of cyberspace. These initiatives include ongoing fora such as the UN Group of Governmental Experts (UN GGE) and the UN Open-Ended Working Group (UN OEWG), both aimed at developing interstate cyber norms and applying international law to cyberspace (Ruhl et al. 2020). Other efforts include the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace, a coalition of cybersecurity experts that promotes specific cyber norms, and the Paris Call, a \"multistakeholder initiative led by the French government and supported by Microsoft,\" which seeks to mainstream cyber norms outside of interstate dialogues (Ruhl et al. 2020: 11).\nThe credibility of their participants legitimizes these formats, whether it is the legitimacy of the UN process or the inclusivity of multiple stakeholders, such as businesses, think tanks, and non-profits, in building standards for cyberspace (Ruhl et al. 2020). However, Ruhl et al. note that these efforts are constrained due to four factors. For one, the evolving nature of cyberspace impedes the development of sustainable norms, and the presence of multiple actors with varying interests inhibits the regulation of norm adherence in cyberspace. Second, states' cyber activities are often secretive and unknown, thus obstructing the implementation of international standards for cyberspace. Third, disagreement between great powers on cyberspace norms can frustrate agreements. For example, Russian and Chinese demands for greater state sovereignty in cyberspace are countered by the US' assertion for free and\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nPOLK\nindependent Internet access. Fourth, weak incentives to adhere to cyberspace norms can reduce the impact and sustainability of international agreements. In contrast, \"states with significant cyber capabilities seem ready and willing to employ them to advance their interests,\" presenting an incentive for states to dismiss norms or limit their scope of adherence (Ruhl et al. 2020:17). Therefore, the multilateral fora for establishing cyberspace norms currently faces significant limitations in their effectiveness, generating a high level of uncertainty in the domain of cyberspace.\n## Uncertainty in the Digital Realm\nThe uncertain nature of cyberspace and norms creates difficulties for dispute resolution. Unlike conventional conflict, where risks, calculations, and capacities are known in an exercise of \"control power,\" cyber conflict occurs in a realm of uncertainty, potentiality, and improvisation (Katzenstein &amp; Seybert, 2018). The \"fog of uncertainty\" (Katzenstein &amp; Seybert 2018: 36) limits states' abilities to know how cyberspace will evolve, who the actors are, and what their capabilities may entail, thus preventing states from assessing the long-term ramifications of a cyber attack's impact. The nebulousness of cyberspace results not in deterrence but in restraint, which Valeriano and Maness (2015: 54) describe as a \"policy outcome but not necessarily a process\" for states' limited use of cyber tools. Therefore, this restraint is a consequence of the ambiguity and insecurity characterizing cyberspace, suggesting that certainties regarding states' intentions and cyber capabilities are unattainable, thereby reducing the risk of escalation in cyber conflict.\nEscalation represents an \"increase in the intensity of a conflict and in the severity of the tactics used in pursuing it\" (Maiese 2003) and is crucial to the perception of ripeness in conflict. However, states' restraint in using cyber tools impedes the prominence of both escalation and ripeness in cyber conflict, a discrepancy which will be addressed in the next section. The uncertainty of cyberspace and the limitations of cyber norms results in weak perceptions of states' digital activities. The vagueness of cyberspace is an impediment to determining what should be negotiated, let alone when negotiations should be conducted. Analyzing the concept of \"ripeness\" in cyber conflict will answer the question of when states should negotiate on matters of cyberspace.\n## Overview of Ripeness Theory\nAs previously stated, Zartman's \"ripeness theory\" presents a condition for the timing and beginning of negotiation (2001). Ripeness is a perceptual event that\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nRIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nstems from the belief in a Mutually Hurting Stalemate (MHS) or a Mutually Enticing Opportunity (MEO) (Zartman 2000). Zartman defines MHS as the moment when \"parties find themselves locked in a conflict from which they cannot escalate to victory and this deadlock is painful to both of them\" (2008). This deadlock may be depicted as a plateau, a stalemate where the costs of continuing the violence outweigh the benefits, with both parties suffering from the ongoing conflict. Similarly, a catastrophic event, or a precipice, may threaten or have influenced perceptions of the conflict and impart a stalemate. To quote Zartman (2001: 8), \"the catastrophe provides a deadline or a lesson indicating that pain can be sharply increased if something is not done about it now.\" Upon the perception of an MHS, both parties recognize that the probability of unilaterally winning the conflict is decreased, making the stalemate more foreboding.\nIn response to the perception of a stalemate, the conflicting parties may attempt to seize the moment by pursuing a \"way out\" of the conflict, sustained by an MEO (Zartman 2008), through negotiation. Zartman's theory is displayed in Figure 1, which demonstrates the push and pull factors that lead to the decision and commitment to negotiate.\nIt should be noted that ripeness is merely a condition for encouraging states to negotiate an end to the conflict, one that is \"necessary, but not sufficient\" (Zartman 2001: 9). As such, the propensity for success in cyber negotiation is not guaranteed in seizing the ripe moment for dialogue. Analysis of ripeness theory's application in conventional and cyber conflict demonstrates how the concept of a stalemate leads (or does not lead) to the perception that the timing is suitable for negotiation as an alternative to continued fighting.\nFIGURE 1 Elements of conventional ripeness theory and the process of negotiation ADAPTED FROM ZARTMAN (2000: 230, 242)\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nPOLK\n# Ripeness and Conventional Conflict\nIn kinetic warfare, ripeness theory holds merit. Conventional conflict may be escalated and then plateaued, as defined by an MHS, thus presenting an opportunity for seeking a way out through negotiation. Zartman (2008) illustrates this by stating that \"to ripen a conflict one must raise the level of conflict until the stalemate is reached and then further until it begins to hurt – and even then, work toward a perception of an impending catastrophe as well.\" This captures the idea behind MHS – a perceived stalemate must be generated for both sides, with the parties incurring unsustainable or unbearable costs in the long run even when there is no prospect for further escalation. Brahm illustrates the role of MHS as a tipping point or push-factor towards negotiation by depicting conventional conflict as a cresting wave (see Figure 2). After the emergence of the conflict, continuous escalation of hostilities leads to or threatens an impending catastrophe, the precipice of the wave at which point an MHS has occurred (Brahm 2003). If the MHS is perceived, it may push the parties towards de-escalation and negotiation, and confidence-building measures and the perception of an MEO can pull the parties closer toward an agreement and the end of the conflict (Brahm 2003).\nIn conventional conflict, weaponry and strategic maneuvers are useful in this pursuit of a stalemate since conventional weaponry varies in scale, targeting, and scope of damage. For example, during the Bosnian War, NATO's use of cruise missiles and stealth planes in \"Operation Deliberate Force\" destroyed 338 Serbian targets. The Bosnian Serbs perceived the use of US Navy Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles (TLAMs) and F-117 bombers as a major escalation by\nFIGURE 2 Stages of conflict\nADAPTED FROM BRAHM (2003)\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nRIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nNATO (Morgan et al. 2008: 13), and this campaign helped to push the Serbs to return to the Dayton Accords in late 1995 (Hartwell 2019: 450). By employing weaponry or strategy, practitioners in conventional conflict are able to achieve a stalemate by escalating the hostilities on the ground. Therefore, the role of escalation is integral to achieving MHS since it results in perceptions “that there has been a significant qualitative change in the conflict as a result of the new development” (Morgan et al. 2008: 9). When both parties escalate to unattainable levels, the conventional conflict plateaus while the sides experience mutual hurt.\nThese conflicts are then considered ripe for negotiation, and the moment may be seized to initiate negotiations and resolve the conflict. Examples of ripeness theory in kinetic conflict have been perceived in the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah War, the Yugoslav Wars in the 1990s, and the Angolan Civil War (Schrodt, Yilmaz &amp; Gerner 2003; Touval 2002: 167; Zartman 2000). In these cases, military escalation of conflict or mediator-induced perceptions of MHS pushed parties to commit to dialogue processes (Touval 2002; Zartman 2000). As such, ripeness theory has strong applicability in cases of conventional conflict.\n## Ripeness and Cyber Conflict\nIn contrast, cyber conflicts do not have the same characteristics as conventional warfare. Cyber operations are not inherently escalatory, and using cyber means to intensify a cyber conflict to the point of ripeness is improbable. For one, states view cyber operations as de facto “escalatory offramps,” or alternatives to costly kinetic conflict that still signal state displeasure or aim to influence rivals’ behavior (Jensen &amp; Valeriano 2019: 2). As such, decision-makers are often inclined to use cyber operations as an extension of foreign policy because they are not escalatory. If faced with increased tensions with rival governments, states have displayed a preference for choosing cyber responses as a form of “sub-crisis maneuvering” or exit from heightened conflict (Jensen &amp; Valeriano 2019: 4).\nA 2019 survey of US, Russian, and Israeli civilians further demonstrates this perspective that cyber conflict is non-escalatory. In this study, respondents in all three countries showed a general preference for non-escalatory responses to cyber attacks in scenarios where the victim state had the capacity to respond with an in-kind cyber weapon (Jensen &amp; Valeriano 2019: 6). Respondents from Russia voted in favor of de-escalatory responses to cyber attacks, while citizens from the US and Israel most often favored proportional responses to the initial attack (Jensen &amp; Valeriano 2019: 7). All three countries had low responses expressing a preference for escalation against a cyber attack. These findings express a tendency to view cyber conflict as a non-escalatory domain (Jensen\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nPOLK\n&amp; Valeriano 2019), thereby casting doubt on the notion that responses to cyber operations could result in an escalation between two parties.\nEven in the most severe cases of cyber attacks, such as disruptions of critical infrastructure, victim states have exhibited a preference for non-escalatory response rather than escalatory action. The real-world examples of the 2015 and 2016 attacks on Ukrainian power grids capture this. In these events, the BlackEnergy 3 and Crashoverride malware, respectively, targeted energy companies or transmission substations resulting in the disruption of electricity supply to nearby consumers. These attacks had limited impact, lasting between one to six hours before restoring full operations (Todros 2018), reflecting the low-intensity, high-manageability of the attack. Yet, the most notable feature of these attacks concerns Ukraine's response. First, Ukraine and allied countries largely attributed both attacks to a hacking group connected to Russian intelligence services (Greenberg 2017), but this has not been proven. This demonstrates an attribution problem that highlights the uncertainty typical of cyber attacks and prevents rapid, escalatory responses of any form. In other words, given the lack of certainty regarding the perpetrator of the cyber attack, decision-makers were impeded in their ability to execute timely and sufficient responses akin to escalation through either digital or kinetic means. Second, even when members of the Ukrainian government condemned Russia for the act, no offensive response, either kinetic or in-kind, was taken (Greenberg 2017). These cases show that even cyber attacks impacting critical infrastructure have low-escalatory potential, a trait that is especially unique when linked to the ongoing geopolitical tensions that shape Russian-Ukrainian relations outside the digital realm. As such, cyber conflicts cannot easily demonstrate escalatory potential using digital means.\nFurthermore, Borghard and Lonergan (2019; 125-138) argue that cyber operations are \"poor tools of escalation\" for four reasons: they are time-consuming to develop, they have a limited impact on the victim state, states have countervailing tradeoffs in using cyber tools, and there are few appropriate cross-domain responses to cyber attacks. First, developing retaliatory cyber tools is time-consuming (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 125). In the event of a cyber attack, a state or institution may not have immediate access to the digital tools required to launch a counteroffensive. According to Borghard and Lonergan (2019: 125), \"offensive cyber operations deliver effects against targets through exploiting a vulnerability to gain access (through an attack vector) to a target's network or system.\" This backdoor access would need to be pre-installed and ready to act on for a timely counterattack to work; without this preset, any response would be time-consuming and miss the opportunity to escalate the conflict. If a conflicting entity did have access to these digital means for a cyber\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nRIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\noffensive, it would have to reconcile with concerns of attribution (Wohlfeld &amp; Jasper 2018). While kinetic conflicts have a clear direction and source of an attack, cyber conflicts are not always evident (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 30).\nThis leads to the second issue: the effects of cyber operations are limited (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 131). If a state responds to a cyber attack with a cyber offensive of its own, the nature of the response would likely be limited in its impact and only supply a temporary nuisance or network disruption (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 123). In extreme cases, cyber offensives may attack critical infrastructure or influence economics by disrupting trust in governments and corporations. Yet even in these instances, the effects of the initial and responding cyber attacks would be temporary and unsustainable (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 131), thus failing to escalate the conflict.\nMoreover, many cyber attacks have uncertain and unintended repercussions (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 41), thus rendering hasty responses ineffective in the long run. By lacking a pronounced intensification of the cyber conflict due to limitations on impact, parties cannot escalate the conflict to a stalemate under conventional mhs. In the same vein, it is imperative to acknowledge that uncertainty permits future technological advances that may result in cyber tools with sufficient cross-domain capabilities, more destructive effects, or greater severity in impact. Whenever these tools are invented, perhaps the face of cyber conflict will change, and cyber operations will possess greater escalatory potential. Nevertheless, until that day, the current nature of cyber conflict demonstrates low-cost and low-impact effects upon the victimized state. As such, it limits the effectiveness of responding attacks at escalating a cyber conflict through digital means.\nThe third impediment for cyber escalation is the existence of countervailing tradeoffs for cyber operations (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 133). Many states execute cyber operations against other entities to achieve the goals of sabotage, espionage, or subversion (Rid 2012), all of which require secrecy to succeed (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 134). Since cyber tools are perceived as a more cost-effective and clandestine alternative to conventional warfare and espionage, political leaders are more likely to benefit from the continued development of cyber offense capabilities (Wohlfeld &amp; Jasper 2018). Consequently, states will be less willing to employ conspicuous, escalatory operations if it risks compromising their other large-scale operations (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 134). The risk comes from the potential that the attack is discovered since patches can be made that impede future access to the systems and data that governments aim to exploit. This reduces the likelihood that conflicting parties will perceive an incentive to escalate cyber disputes via a public response, especially if governments are pressured to justify their actions by revealing\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nPOLK\nthat the initial attack occurred. In doing so, states risk exposing their vulnerabilities or threatening their international standing. As a result, states may be less likely to escalate a cyber conflict, both within and outside the domain of cyberspace (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 134).\nLastly, Borghard and Lonergan claim that it is unlikely that states will respond to a cyber attack through kinetic or cross-domain means (2019: 137). Unlike conventional conflict, cyber attacks do not produce the same carnage, psychological pressure, or violence as kinetic attacks. Instead, questions about the proportionality of responding to a cyber incident with cross-domain capabilities limit the feasibility of justifying kinetic responses to cyber attacks (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 137). Historically there has never been any cross-domain response to a first strike cyber attack, and there are very few instances of a kinetic response being used to answer cyber attacks in hybrid conflict. The most notable kinetic attack is Israel's 2019 airstrike against Hamas. In this instance, Israel's response to Hamas' cyber activities against the government appears to demonstrate an immediate conflict escalation. Yet, this dispute took place in the context of an ongoing and kinetic conflict, thus disqualifying its label as a pure cyber conflict (Borghard &amp; Schneider 2019). With this in mind, it is evident that there are significant limitations to a cross-domain escalation of pure cyber conflict.\nStill, some counterarguments stress the possibility of cross-domain escalation in cyber conflict by suggesting that a state could interpret an initial cyber attack as an act of war and employ a kinetic response. Borghard and Lonergan (2019: 138) acknowledge that the perception of some cyber attacks as low-impact or low-cost may apply to only certain states and political ideologies. Once again, uncertainty is an essential feature as much of the concern surrounding escalation in cyber conflict centers on the threats posed by ambiguity in risk analysis and escalation management (Libicki &amp; Tkacheva 2020).\nWhen states are not certain of their rivals' assumptions about how domains are interconnected and what constitutes an act of war, it is plausible that the result could lead to unintended escalation of the conflict into conventional warfare. In this scenario, if a state were to respond promptly to a cyber attack with a kinetic operation, then conventional understandings of MHS would have relevance; after all, at this point the conflict would have crossed a threshold into the physical realm and would follow conventional rules of engagement and escalation management. At this point, a cyber conflict-turned-conventional would no longer apply to this study since the focus is primarily on \"pure\" cyber conflict with no cross-domain aspects.\nHowever, what about a hypothetical in which a state first makes a threat to escalate a cyber conflict into a conventional war? In this scenario, the\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nuncertainty aspect of cyberspace suggests that mhs might not necessarily hold relevance. The threat of cross-domain escalation is a form of deterrence, which has limited and ambiguous influence in cyber conflict and the digital domain. Sweijs and Zilincik (2021: 133) state that three criteria influence escalation management in cross-domain deterrence (cdd): attribution, credibility and threat proportionality, and signaling.\n##### Attribution\nAttribution of initial cyber attacks can be tedious, time-consuming, and inexact, leading to uncertainty in directing the threat at the appropriate target. This uncertainty risks international embarrassment, condemnation, or even tension if the threatening state incorrectly identifies a perpetrator or lacks evidence. As a result, the threat may not effectively escalate the conflict across domains since it may be easily dismissed. Furthermore, if a threat is directed at another state, accurately or not, the accused state would have little incentive to act upon standard mhs conceptualizations of ripeness and agree to negotiations. Once the accusation has been made, any response to a threat of kinetic escalation of a cyber conflict would require the accused to admit their cyber capabilities, thereby negating the serviceability of these digital tools and jeopardizing other cyber operations elsewhere in the world. As such, mhs would not necessarily hold relevance in scenarios where states rely on cross-domain escalation threats because uncertainty and attribution limits prevent states from utilizing effective cdd strategies.\n##### Credibility and threat proportionality\nRegarding credibility and threat proportionality, Sweijs and Zilincik (2021: 137) note that cdd is “complicated by the inherent disproportionality of responses across domains and instruments of power.” In this case, the relevance of mhs to threats of escalation is limited by the uncertain risk of how the international community and general population will perceive this intimidation. Despite the concern over states’ diverging definitions of what constitutes appropriate cross-domain escalation, there is consensus that violent responses to non-violent offensive measures will result in more immediate and severe consequences, which may receive public and international skepticism (Sweijs & Zilincik 2021: 137; Nye 2017: 51). As such, states may differ in their gauge of a threat’s credibility. This divergence weakens the case for mhs’ relevance to threats of escalation in cyber conflict since the ensuing uncertainty weakens the efficacy of the threat that domain spillover is plausible or justifiable.\n##### Signaling\nLastly, issues with signaling threats of cross-domain escalation reduce the applicability of mhs processes to cyber conflicts that could turn conventional. In the cyber domain, cross-domain signaling may be misinterpreted, with signals conducted through military means risking greater ambiguity about the signaler’s intentions to the target. As Sweijs and Zilincik (2021: 140)\nPOLK\nnote, \"a signal of resolve to respond to cyberattacks by moving platforms for the launch of conventional or nuclear weapons may be easily interpreted as a preparation for hostilities rather than as an adjustment of the deterrence posture.\" As a result, the target of the threat may view the cross-domain action as separate from the cyber conflict or as a general increase in tension outside of the digital realm. The risk of ambiguity in cross-domain signaling impedes MHS principles' efficacy in escalating the conflict since the action may appear detached from or external to the cyber conflict.\nWithout the capacity to escalate ongoing digital disputes, cyber conflicts present a challenge to conventional ripeness theory and do not offer states an incentive to seek a negotiated agreement. Parties' perceptions of a mutually hurting stalemate are more difficult to achieve because the long-term intensifying effects of cyber operations are often imperceptible, reiterating the dilemma of uncertainty in characterizing cyber conflict. Similarly, if a state were to threaten cross-domain spillover, the likelihood that the threat of escalation would serve as a sufficient push-factor towards negotiation is impeded by factors of uncertainty. As such, current ideas about timing and ripeness in cyber conflict remain elusive for cyberspace negotiations and require a reexamination of MHS to address this deviation.\n## Re-defining Mutually Hurting Stalemate\nAddressing the discrepancy between ripeness theory and cyber conflict requires a closer examination of the concept of mutually hurting stalemate. The perception of a stalemate is clearly critical in pushing conflicting parties towards negotiation. However, existing scholarship emphasizes that perception is built on mutual hurt and the threat (or existence) of unsustainable escalation. Since cyber weapons are not reliable tools of escalation and cyber operations present enticing tradeoffs for their continued use, mutual hurt and the threat of intensification are not attainable. As such, redefining the idea of a stalemate provides an alteration of ripeness theory for cyber conflicts.\nThis new definition addresses the main component of MHS: the hurting stalemate. The mutuality of MHS is not called into question since it is an essential aspect of any conflict. The reciprocal nature of conflict is inherent to the disagreement: all parties must be targets and initiators of cyber attacks for the cyber conflict to exist. Even where attribution issues exist, the mutual perception of a cyber attack from a rival is sufficient for the conflict to persist. Consequently, tit-for-tat cyber attacks are crucial in both the conflict and\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nRIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nnegotiation stages, and mutuality remains integral to encouraging parties to approach negotiation as a way out of cyber conflict.\nWhile the hurting stalemate is crucial to perceptions of ripe moments in conventional conflict, the phrase itself is incomplete in characterizing cyber conflict. The hurting stalemate is a painful deadlock characterized by a plateau, \"a flat and unending terrain without relief\" (Zartman 2000: 228), unbearable to both parties. This concept is not wholly accurate for cyber conflict due to the limits of inflicting pain through cyber means and the low-intensity nature of cyber operations. For one, cyber tools, like conventional weaponry, are a means for achieving political objectives. In cyber conflict, each cyber operation, analyzed individually, aims (and often achieves) short-term goals such as gaining trade and military secrets, displaying cyber capabilities, or deterring activity. When combined to characterize cyber conflict, the long-term goals reveal themselves. The long-term objectives in cyber conflict show how the mutuality of hurt is limited since the operations themselves are limited in scope and impact. In fact, it is challenging to conceptualize cyber conflict as \"winnable,\" given that the impact of cyber operations is constrained and unlikely to debilitate the target. According to Valeriano and Maness (2015: 61), cyber operations are often innocuous and used primarily \"as methods of signaling displeasure or discord to a rival,\" a demonstration of the restraint used by states when engaging in cyberspace. Cyber weapons have limited applicability in their \"hurting\" capability even in more destructive incidences, such as the Stuxnet worm that destroyed Iranian nuclear centrifuges in Operation Olympic Games. Though intending to deter or delay Iran's nuclear weapons development, Operation Olympic Games ultimately bolstered Tehran's determination to restore and expand its nuclear research in Natanz (Sanger 2018: 42).\nWith this limitation in mind, it is important to note that hurt from cyber conflict still exists. Targeted countries may experience damages or disruptions to their institutions and networks, impacting daily operations or economic mobility. Similarly, non-cyber responses to cyber operations, such as sanctions, condemnation, or other negative foreign policy measures, may inflict damages on the perceived initiator of an attack. Therefore, hurt is present in cyber conflict. However, there is a critical distinction between kinetic and cyber hurt: the hurt is not exhaustive in cyber conflict. Since cyber conflict is non-escalatory and used as a first-response or low-intensity method of engagement (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015), the hurt it inflicts on the target is not equal to the painful deadlock prescribed by conventional MHS. Instead, this hurt is perpetually sustainable, akin to Zartman's idea of \"the soft, stable, and self-serving stalemate\" (S5).\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nPOLK\nAccording to Zartman, the S5 is \"a low-level conflict, even when punctuated by occasional blips of violence\" that \"leaves each of the parties ... able to claim that it has not been defeated, which is a victory of sorts\" (2005a: 52). The S5 typically describes intractable conflicts in the kinetic domain, explaining the absence of ripeness in pushing the conflicting parties towards a negotiated solution (Zartman 2005a). In conventional analysis, factors of protracted conflict, zero-sum identities, the profitability of continued fighting, mutually exclusive solutions, and deficient perceptions of ripeness contribute to intractability in kinetic conflict (Zartman 2005a: 59–60). However, these features are not all representative of cyber conflict.\nCyber operations are both the means and ends to accomplishing short-term goals, disrupting issues of protraction even if the conflict itself is perpetual. Furthermore, cyber conflicts often do not involve zero-sum identities unique to the dispute, although the cyber conflict may exacerbate pre-existing conflicts between states. Nevertheless, the issues of profitability, solution saliency, and ripeness are typical of cyber conflicts, which are defined by countervailing tradeoffs encouraging the perpetuation of the conflict (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 133), and diverging norms and interests hampering cyber agreements. As such, cyber conflicts share some features of intractable disputes, which are emblematic of S5. However, S5 is still insufficient for characterizing cyber conflict due to the uncertainty surrounding cyberspace and the unique nature of intractability in the digital realm.\nWith these limitations in mind, the standard perception of a hurting stalemate is improbable in cyber conflict, and a conventional ripe moment for negotiation would not be perceived. Instead, adjusting the criteria for a hurting stalemate reshapes the conditions for ripeness in cyber conflict. This new condition focuses on a \"mutually harming standoff,\" a condition on the spectrum between Zartman's theories of S5 and MHS that permits the lack of a hurting stalemate in cyber conflict.\n## Mutually Harming Standoff, Ripeness, and Cyber Negotiations\nA mutually harming standoff (which will be referred to as MHS2) is distinct from a mutually hurting stalemate (hereafter referred to as MHS1) since it emphasizes the perfunctory character of the pain and reciprocity in cyber conflict. The \"harm\" inflicted by cyber operations may have a negative impact on the targeted state, but it is not so unbearable that the state is incapable of persisting without a way out. In other words, the state is not pressed into seeking an alternative to the cyber conflict since the harm it experiences is not exhaustive. Furthermore, a \"standoff\" provides a better image than a stalemate. While the hurting stalemate represents unwinnable deadlocks that are\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8–36\nRIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\npainful to all parties (Zartman, 2000), the standoff is more akin to an effectively manageable, if not perpetual and harmful, dispute with high reciprocity and low escalation capacity (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 129). This captures the nature of cyber conflict and adapts a critical component of ripeness theory.\nIf MHS2 characterizes long-term cyber conflict, when and how can it be perceived? More importantly, how can negotiators operationalize MHS2 to encourage cyber negotiations if a ripe moment is improbable in cyber conflict? Both questions are linked to another component of ripeness theory: mutually enticing opportunity (MEO). In Zartman's ripeness theory, perceptions of MHS1 are necessary, if insufficient, for encouraging parties to engage in dialogue as a way out of conventional conflict. This may be supplemented by perceptions of an MEO, which acts as the pull-factor for parties to engage in and continue negotiations (Zartman 2000: 241-242). Zartman acknowledges that few cases of conventional conflict demonstrate the opening of negotiations due to perceptions of an MEO alone. However, these perceptions help encourage parties to commit to negotiations once they commence (Zartman 2000: 241-242). Still, since conventional MHS1 does not exist in cyber conflict, realizing an MHS2 coupled with perceptions of an MEO can push rival cyber parties toward negotiations.\nFigure 3 presents an adaptation of the standard stages of the conflict arc for cyber disputes. In this depiction, MHS2 represents the state of the conflict from the time of emergence. This shows that without escalatory capacities, cyber conflicts are inherently defined by the perpetual reciprocity of cyber\nFIGURE 3 Stages of cyber conflict\nADAPTED FROM BRAHM (2003)\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nPOLK\nattacks between states, continuing the plateau indefinitely as conflict persists in a low intensity and restrained manner. To disrupt this, the perception of an MEO is necessary to act as the new push-factor for parties to enter and commit to negotiations.\nIn cyber conflict, the MEO can manifest in several ways. These incentives may appear at different thresholds of pain throughout the dispute and encourage states to consider negotiations under various circumstances. Like MHS1, MHS2 pain thresholds are perceptual, and thus MEO S will be subjective from case to case (Zartman 2005b). Analyzing an array of MEO S showcases potential push-factor attributes unique to the nature of cyberspace that could encourage cyber conflict negotiation.\nNorms development collaboration. Like conventional conflicts, both parties may inherently view alternatives to victory that do not include tit-for-tat cyber exchanges. This may have limitations pending each party's goals in conducting cyber operations, but the opportunity to collaborate may displace the benefits of using digital tools against rivals. This collaboration leads to an impactful and enticing opportunity for negotiation: norms development. Given the standard of uncertainty in the cyber realm, states can attempt to shape the digital world in their image by collaborating to bilaterally develop and diffuse norms that meet their interests on a global scale. In other words, by leveraging the perception that normative interests are more far-reaching and achievable through bilateral collaboration, negotiators may be more successful in pushing conflicting parties to the table to coordinate on broader issues that both address and extend beyond the ongoing conflict.\nThe MEO for norms development collaboration is especially pertinent in cyber conflicts where the targets are primarily private and government non-military infrastructure. This represents one threshold for pain on the lattice of MHS2 ripeness; when attacks are apparent and far-reaching in their impact on the public, states are more likely to respond negatively (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 125). This is because many states view public interference in cyberspace as \"crossing a line\" in the digital realm, despite the lack of norms or agreements dictating this taboo (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015). Conversely, in cyber conflicts where attacks primarily target political and military networks, \"victim\" states are less likely to react with a negative or conflict-prone response (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 123-124). This suggests that cyber conflicts which focus on traditional government-to-government attacks, including infiltrations and intrusions through Trojans and APTs, are likely to present the norm for cyber conflict (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015). On the other hand, DDoS attacks are more obvious in their display of aggression since they interfere with public websites and systems, and states are more likely to respond negatively to the attack due to pressure from the public impacted by the incident.\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nRIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nCyber conflicts that reach MHS2 thresholds, in which public infrastructure is the primary target, can present an MEO for parties to meet to recalibrate norms for cyberspace conduct. For example, suppose the cyber conflict is characterized by long-run DDoS attacks or infiltrations targeting non-military private and government networks. In that case, participants may use these perceived violations as an opportunity to collaborate and bilaterally promote norms in cyber conflict that benefit both parties. In other words, while perpetuating the tit-for-tat cycle of the cyber conflict is a non-escalatory option, continued DDoS attacks may present reasonable grounds for decision-makers to examine alternatives to the conflict, thereby seeking innovative solutions for a way out of MHS2. Furthermore, considering the absence of concrete norms in cyberspace, parties may view the chance to negotiate and act as norm-makers as a mutually enticing opportunity.\nProtean power. In addition to norms development collaboration, the opportunity for states to demonstrate \"protean power\" is an enticing opportunity for decision-makers to choose negotiation in cyber conflict. This form of power, coined by Katzenstein and Seybert in 2018, counters the aforementioned \"control power\" and acknowledges the importance of creativity and innovation in decision-making when facing increasingly uncertain international dynamics. Due to the uncertain nature of cyberspace, successful navigation and utility of the digital realm require states to remain innovative, flexible, and agile in responding to rapid changes in technology or when dealing with crises where assurances in risk analyses are limited. As such, the negotiating table is the ideal medium for states to gain and exhibit protean power since the choice to negotiate in cyber conflict is a strategic, albeit inventive and pioneering option that may result in relative gains for both states.\nMoreover, states will likely view the display of protean power as a complement or, in some cases, substitute to other conventional understandings of power dynamics, such as hard power. As Katzenstein and Seybert (2018: 25) put it, \"the world is well stocked with low-probability events such as the sudden appearance of terrorist organizations operating on a global scale and waves of large-scale human migration.\" Therefore, displaying creative prowess in the face of ambiguity, instability, and uncertainty is vital for actors \"to derive relative advantage from unexpected challenges\" (Katzenstein &amp; Seybert 2018: 25). In cyber conflict, states that choose to negotiate over a continuation of tit-for-tat exchanges that prolong the status quo of MHS2 are more likely to be perceived as adaptable and inventive in responding to uncertainty surrounding the nature of cyberspace and geopolitics in this domain. Consequently, states that choose negotiation in cyber conflict have a stronger capacity for protean power, making them more durable and influential in handling increasingly complex dynamics in world politics.\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nPOLK\nSmall state influence. Similarly, small states may be uniquely positioned to act on a push-factor MEO in cyber conflict since the newness of the domain presents opportunities for gaining leverage in the international arena. Following the benefits of protean power, the opportunity to demonstrate influence over rival states through innovation and improvisation in cyber conflict management incentivizes smaller states to push for negotiation as a means of alleviating tensions. This then acts as a push-factor MEO for smaller states seeking greater power in the international arena at large, especially since the democratic layout of cyberspace allows for ease of entry to new actors. In turn, larger states may be incentivized to negotiate in cyber conflict to further extend their influence in the digital realm, as well as the physical one.\nCross-conflict negotiation leverage. Finally, rival states with ongoing non-cyber tensions may be incentivized to negotiate as an avenue for leverage in other conflict domains. In other words, states with ongoing geopolitical tensions, such as the US and Russia, Japan and South Korea, or India and Pakistan, may be able to bargain agreements made in cyberspace with concessions in other negotiations or settlements. This also presents another scenario in which pain thresholds may be achieved in MHS2. Cyber conflicts that persist alongside other tensions or conflicts will prompt heightened sensitivities and feelings of annoyance between rivals. Yet, the digital realm remains the ideal medium for achieving cooperation or relative gains between rivals despite this distrust. The cyber domain provides an opportunity for norms development, an exhibition of power, and leverage in other conflict settlements. Thus, cyber conflicts between historic rival states are likely to perceive the status quo as a threshold of pain that makes an MEO for cooperation in the digital world appealing. Moreover, if the rivals perceive an opportunity to achieve non-cyber gains through cyber conflict negotiations, the parties already in conflict may consider this a push-factor MEO in cyberspace.\nThis MEO is well-suited for states engaged in regional conflict, a feature that Valeriano and Maness (2105: 81) note as being one of the most common fora for cyber conflict. For example, Japan and South Korea have deep-seated hostilities, ranging from disagreements over maritime control to enmities founded on the Korean peninsula's history of Japanese occupation. Many cyber-attacks between the two countries reflect these tensions, with both countries engaging in tit-for-tat exchanges between 2001 and 2011 (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 88). Interestingly, Japanese decision-makers often choose \"more cooperative interactions with their regional rivals\" despite ongoing cyber conflicts, suggesting a desire not to escalate tensions with nearby states (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 123). It follows, then, that regional rivals may have an MEO to use cyberspace as a platform for negotiation to influence overall tensions since the alternative is maintaining the status quo and perpetuating ongoing hostilities.\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nRIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nLastly, rivals may be incentivized to negotiate cyber conflict since they could gain greater international influence where their interests align. Again, Japan and South Korea exemplify this. Since both states are closely aligned with US interests (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 216), agreements between the two, especially those that impact both the cyber and physical domains, may strengthen their standing with the US and against larger rivals like China. As such, this opportunity for both mutual and relative gains acts as a push-factor for entrenched rival states to pursue cyber conflict negotiation.\nIn sum, conventional ripeness theory is limited in cyber conflict since mutually hurting stalemates (MHS1) are unattainable in cyberspace. Instead, a mutually harming standoff (MHS2) is more characteristic of the state of tit-for-tat cyber conflicts, where parties experience adverse effects from reciprocal attacks, but not at an unsustainable level. When long-term cyber conflict is recognized as an MHS2, specific attributes of the attacks may be operationalized to enact a push-factor MEO that encourages the parties to negotiate. These MEOs may hinge on the opportunity for cyber combatants to act as norm-makers by pursuing bilateral agreements that resolve the conflict and improve conduct in cyberspace or may focus on displays of protean power as small states or historic rivals. To represent this process, Figure 4 illustrates an adaptation of Zartman's conventional ripeness theory and negotiation progression to denote the push and pull aspects of MHS2 in cyber conflict. Here, MHS2 is presented\nFIGURE 4 Elements of Mutually Harming Standoff (MHS2) and the process of negotiation\nADAPTED FROM ZARTMAN (2000: 230, 242)\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nPOLK\nas the state of the conflict, while the push-factor MEO is a dependent variable requiring both parties' perception. Only after this perception is operationalized will the parties pursue negotiation as a way out of cyber conflict.\n## 2015 US-China Cybersecurity Agreement\nThe 2015 US-China Cybersecurity Agreement illustrates how MHS2 and MEO push-factors adapt the concept of timing in cyber conflict negotiations. These negotiations produced a cybersecurity agreement that established a precedent for defining economically motivated cyber espionage (EMCE) (Harold, Libicki, &amp; Stuth Cevallos 2016: 46). This demonstrates that norm-making is an attractive prospect for cyber negotiations following an MHS2, especially due to the uncertain and nebulous environment which characterizes cyberspace. The US-China agreement also showcases the limitations of applying current ripeness theory models to a bilateral cyber conflict. An overview of the US-China cyber conflict and its corresponding negotiations demonstrates how ripeness theory can be adjusted in cyber conflict to determine the timing of cyber negotiations.\n## Background: US-China Cyber Conflict\nThe US-China cyber conflict roughly began in 2003 and has predominately consisted of cyber espionage operations between the two countries (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 91–92). This characterization is key to the perpetuity of the conflict, and it is essential to examine both countries' stances on cyberspace and the rulebook by which they operate. First, the United States extends its values regarding individual freedoms and independence to the cyber realm (Brown &amp; Yung 2017a). The US government emphasizes online freedom of expression, liberal information flows, and data privacy in its national cybersecurity policies, and uses these values as the basis for which it evaluates foreign attacks on US networks (Brown &amp; Yung 2017a; Segal 2015). This is especially true for cyber espionage. According to Brown and Yung (2017a), the US makes distinctions between forms of espionage based on their objective, stating that \"in the US view, as long as such operations collect information about economic and financial matters for the purpose of benefiting national security, they are routine intelligence work.\" In this case, corporate espionage for the economic benefit of private companies is considered off-limits.\nChina also applies its political ideologies to cyberspace operations, and these values contradict the United States. At the forefront of China's cybersecurity strategy is the idea of Internet sovereignty, a norm shared by other\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nRIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\ngovernments to promote state control over networks within their territory (Brown &amp; Yung 2017b). The Chinese government advocates for states to set their own rules regarding cyberspace and pursues digital independence from the US, which owns most of the world's IP addresses and has been heavy-handed in Internet governance (Brown &amp; Yung 2017b; Singer &amp; Friedman 2014: 140; Levite &amp; Jinghua 2019). Furthermore, China rejects the militarization of cyberspace, accusing the US of securitizing the digital domain and aggressively developing \"cyber arms\" in response to activities by perceived rivals like Russia and China (Brown &amp; Yung 2017b).\nIt is this argument that is crucial to China's cyber operations. In China's view, the US' aggressive pursuit of offensive cyber capabilities necessitates China's cyber development (Brown &amp; Yung 2017a; Singer &amp; Friedman 2014: 140). Additionally, China's stance on cyber espionage makes no distinction between operations pursuing an economic advantage versus a national security advantage (Sanger 2018: 70). Instead, China \"views economic competition as a way to achieve peer status with the US and sees cyberspace as an asymmetric instrument which it can successfully use to compete with the United States\" (Brown &amp; Yung 2017a). Thus, the Chinese agenda pursues cyber espionage for economic advantage as \"a quasi-legitimate way to achieve a North-South redistribution of wealth\" (Inkster 2017: 72). China's cyber policies aim to level the imbalance between the West and China and promote norms of self-determination in cyberspace.\nIn the US-China cyber conflict, various cyber weapons were used. Between 2003 and 2006, the Titan Rain attack employed Trojans, or unauthorized software that permits access to a system or program, to infiltrate US government and contracting networks such as the State Department and Lockheed Martin (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 34; Rid 2012: 20). This attack was attributed to the Chinese government, as was the 2006 intrusion by the APT \"Shady RAT,\" which stole secret information related to negotiation strategies, manufacturing design plans, and US national security policies (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 91; Singer &amp; Friedman 2014: 92). The international hack by GhostNet, which lasted from 2007 to 2009, utilized phishing scams to acquire access to computer microphones and cameras, allowing hackers to record conversations by State Department and Pentagon officials (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 131). This, along with other long-run intrusions and thefts, was again attributed to the Chinese government.\nIn response, US agencies retaliated against Chinese institutions by employing defensive cyber attacks. Operation Cisco Raider lasted from 2006 to 2010 and attempted to counter the distribution of counterfeit Cisco technology stolen in a Chinese hack (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 91). Another operation,\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nPOLK\nBuckshot Yankee, responded against a hack of US defense networks (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 91). Finally, the long-term operation, Shotgiant, aimed to link the Chinese telecommunications firm, Huawei, to the People's Liberation Army (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 91; Sanger &amp; Perlroth 2014; Sanger 2018). This operation also endeavored to \"exploit Huawei's technology so that when the company sold equipment to other countries ... the NSA could roam through their computer and telephone networks to conduct surveillance and, if ordered by the president, offensive cyberoperations\" (Sanger &amp; Perlroth 2014). As such, the US-China cyber conflict included exchanges of offensive and retaliatory operations between the two nations to combat diverging normative values regarding espionage.\n## Cyber Negotiations\nThroughout the cyber conflict, US-China tensions never escalated to kinetic force. Instead, the conflict remained tit-for-tat, with both governments suffering from espionage that notably affected both military and non-military private and government entities. Due to the dispute's long-term, low intensity, and restrained nature, the US-China cyber conflict gradually developed into an MHS2.\nThe MHS2 permitted both governments to continue with their cyber attacks. However, in 2009 they began to engage in Track Two diplomatic talks between the US think-tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) and China's Institute of Contemporary International Relations (CICIR) (Segal 2015). What pushed the countries towards informal dialogue? According to one Chinese official, dialogue is a better alternative to perpetual conflict because both countries are capable of continued operations but would be better served by negotiating to settle their disagreements (Singer &amp; Friedman 2014). This represents the push-factor MEO, which promotes dialogue for norms establishment between two cyber rivals.\nThe Track Two talks further reflect the impact of MEOs for norm diffusion, with the first of these informal dialogues beginning in December 2009. Early dialogues focused on addressing both states' concerns about cyber sovereignty, cyberspace norms, multilateralism in addressing cybercrime, and confidence-building in cyberspace (CSIS 2009). These informal dialogues continued in addition to Track 1.5 discussions and alternated between Washington, DC and Beijing throughout the process. Eventually, discussions regarding cyber espionage and what it constitutes emerged alongside the issues of cyber sovereignty, governance, and US primacy in cyberspace (Harold, Libicki &amp; Stuth Cevallos 2016). It should be noted that these dialogues were \"were marked more by continuity than change,\" with participants on both sides maintaining their stances\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nRIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\non definitions of terms and values (Harold, Libicki &amp; Stuth Cevallos 2016: 49). Yet the governments' willingness to meet to discuss their stances in the cyber conflict signals an interesting push for a resolution in cyber conflict, without the need of a hurting stalemate.\nThese dialogues continued in a Track Two and Track 1.5 capacity, and by 2013, Track One negotiations commenced. However, these talks were interrupted in 2014 after the US indicted five People's Liberation Army officials with cyber espionage charges (Harold, Libicki &amp; Stuth Cevallos 2016; Brown &amp; Yung 2017a). The indictment asserted that members of the Chinese military stole trade secrets from US industries to bolster China's competitiveness in the international market. In response, the Chinese government walked away from the negotiations and asserted that the US accusations were hypocritical in light of the 2013 NSA leaks (Brown &amp; Yung 2017a). However, the talks resumed the following summer, and in September 2015, US President Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping released a statement on a new Cybersecurity Agreement (Harold, Libicki &amp; Stuth Cevallos 2016). The two governments agreed to improve coordination in investigating and preventing cybercrime, not conduct or support cyber intellectual property theft, and improve cooperation in promoting international norms in cyberspace (Obama 2015).\nThe 2015 Agreement achieved both mixed results and mixed reactions. Though some scholars believe that China's agreement on the existence of economically motivated cyber espionage (EMCE) is an incremental step in reducing cyber intellectual property theft, few believe it has since decreased (Brown &amp; Yung 2017c). There has been continued concern about the quality of the agreement and China's adherence to the terms (Brown &amp; Yung 2017c). While the negotiators were able to successfully agree on cyber-specific definitions of EMCE, a significant achievement in cyber norm development, gaps in the agreement have allowed both countries to exploit technicalities in the agreement. For example, though reports suggest a decrease in Chinese economic espionage, it appears that \"Chinese operators are going after technologies that are dual-use [such as telecommunications industries], and so might not be covered by the agreements\" (Segal 2017). Similarly, the US espionage operations against Huawei have persisted, with non-cyber sanctions and indictments attacking company leadership due to the recent dispute over 5G, surveillance, and data privacy (Whalen 2020).\n## Analysis\nDespite the weaknesses of the US-China Cybersecurity Agreement, the existence of the cyber negotiations sets a unique precedent regarding the timing of bilateral dialogues in cyber conflict. The concepts of MHS2 and push-factor\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nmeo demonstrate how ripeness can be determined within cyber disputes, thus adapting Zartman's original theory to a new domain of conflict. Reviewing the conditions of ripeness in the US-China cyber conflict helps capture the applicability of mhs2 and meo in cyber conflict.\nThroughout the US-China cyber dispute, long-term operations and attacks generated an entrenched and enduring conflict between two cyber rivals. The use of intrusive cyber weapons to conduct espionage on non-military targets prompted the exchange of attacks, and the diverging perspectives on cyber and espionage norms deepened the tensions between the two countries. In this case, the conflict's perpetuity embodied an mhs2, with both countries receiving damages in their economic and political security due to cyber and non-cyber retaliations. Even so, both countries were caught in a standoff rather than a stalemate since these damages were not exhaustive, permanent, or fatigue-inducing. In fact, both countries focused on long-term cyber weaponry, like apts and Trojans, to conduct lengthy operations that were sustainable regardless of the harm dealt to each government in response.\nWith this perpetual-while-manageable standoff reached, both countries continued to conduct their cyber operations against one another. Nevertheless, the opportunity to collaborate on norms development was the meo that pushed both governments towards negotiation. This was first captured and operationalized at the informal level. Through the Track Two dialogues, the US and Chinese think tanks provided a platform for sharing and understanding each other's values and perspectives of cyberspace and security. This informal communication linked the two governments, regardless of the conflict's perpetuity, and provided the opportunity for cooperation in norm-making and diffusion. This was especially enticing considering that the UN Group of Governmental Experts (UN gge) on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace has convened multiple times throughout the US-China conflict to establish international norms in cyberspace (gip Digital Watch Observatory 2021). If the US and China could bilaterally collaborate on cyberspace norms, their influence in international norm-making would be especially prominent and allow both countries to demonstrate their protean power in a new and uncertain domain.\nTrack 1.5 and Track One dialogues between the two governments further demonstrate this dedication to coordination in resolving the cyber conflict while establishing rules for conduct in cyberspace. Though the ultimate agreement may have failed in effectively instituting these norms, the fact that understanding was reached on the definition of emce is significant. The US and China's commitment to establishing norms in cyberspace to resolve the cyber conflict is therefore an important example of cyber negotiations. Future\nRIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\n33\ndialogues may rely on this achievement as evidence for the norm developing capacity of cyber negotiations and explore the use of bilateral fora as a means for innovating, developing, and diffusing norms in cyber conflict.\n# Conclusion\nThe emergence of new technologies undoubtedly impacts geopolitical conduct between states and influences rivalries old and new as a domain for conflict. Cyber conflict, regardless of its potential to supplant conventional warfare, has surfaced as a new source of tension between states, one that is ill-defined and difficult to regulate. As such, developing capacities for resolving cyber conflict requires new approaches to negotiation and mediation, and revisiting ripeness theory allows scholars and practitioners to adapt prevailing negotiation strategies to new realms of conflict.\nDue to the nature of cyber conflict, conventional ideas of ripeness theory are inadequate for deciding when to begin cyber negotiations. Limitations in escalation, the perception of cyber operations as \"escalatory offramps,\" countervailing tradeoffs in the use of cyber tools, and the first-use character of cyber weapons prevent states from perceiving mutually hurting stalemates in tit-for-tat cyber conflict. Therefore, modifying the definition of a hurting stalemate better captures the nature of cyber conflict and offers an alternative for timing negotiations. \"Mutually harming standoff\" is more emblematic of the plateau in cyber conflict since both states may feel the consequences of the conflict, but to a manageable and sustainable degree. When long-term cyber conflict is reached, an MHS2 has taken effect, and combining it with the component of mutually enticing opportunity will push actors towards cyber negotiations.\nThe MEO, while operating as a pull-factor in kinetic conflict, serves a more significant role in propelling conflicting parties toward negotiations because cyberspace provides incentives for collaboration over conflict. Though vested with the capacity for continued cyber conflict, rival states may perceive the opportunities to collaborate on norms development, exercise protean power, or gain leverage in external conflicts as ideal for promoting their agendas on cyberspace bilaterally. This is captured by the case of the US-China Cybersecurity Agreement.\nIn this instance, the reciprocal cyber conflict between the US and China was characterized by an MHS2. Nonetheless, the governments seized the opportunity to engage in norm-making through dialogue instead of unilaterally trying to \"win\" in cyber conflict. These negotiations evolved from informal Track Two discussions to Track One negotiation and agreement between American and\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nPOLK\nChinese leadership, thus providing precedent for a bilateral negotiation to a pure \"cyber conflict.\" Though the agreement itself has flaws, the timing of the negotiation signals that MHS1 is not necessary and is better characterized by an MHS2. In addition, the MEO is a stronger and more necessary (if insufficient) component for achieving ripeness in cyber conflict.\nFuture research on the negotiation or mediation process may provide greater clarity on achieving more successful cyber agreements in the future. Likewise, examining the strategies of multilateral cyber negotiations and their impact on norms development would impact the nature of state-to-state cyber conflict. Such evolutions will necessitate further research as new capabilities and dynamics emerge. In the meantime, exploring other cyber conflicts, such as those between long-term rivals like the US-Russia, India-Pakistan, and North Korea-South Korea, may provide a prescriptive application of the adapted ripeness theory.\nThe application of ripeness theory, like conflict itself, is continually evolving. New technologies and conflict domains shape peace efforts and strategies in practical and academic application. In cyber conflict, adjusting the components of ripeness theory to include mutually harming standoffs and MEOs demonstrates how negotiation practices can shift to address emerging threats and realms of uncertainty that characterize new domains of conflict. Without this adjustment, cyber conflicts and other new realms for war, remain out of reach for resolution."

As the world becomes more interconnected through digital means, a potential \"fifth domain\" for conflict has emerged in the cyber realm (Murphy 2010), inviting scholars to debate the nature of cyber attacks, cyber espionage, and disinformation campaigns as \"cyber warfare\" (Rid 2012). With the emergence of cyberwar as a key buzzword in political and academic spheres, the question of how to resolve cyber conflicts shifts the focus to negotiation theory.\nAnalysis of cyber conflict presents a challenge to the prevailing negotiation concept, ripeness theory. Ripeness theory posits that the timing of a negotiation stems from the conflicting parties' perception of a \"mutually hurting stalemate\" (MHS) and \"a way out\" of conflict through dialogue (Zartman 2000). While this theory has shown merit for negotiations related to conventional warfare or economic disputes, there are gaps in its applicability for resolving cyber conflict. Specifically, the concept of a \"hurting stalemate\" has little to no presence in cyber disputes, rendering MHS incompatible with pure cyber negotiations. As such, redefining mutually hurting stalemate for cyber conflict is paramount to address this discrepancy.\nThis analysis attempts to adapt prevailing negotiation theory for conflicts in the cyber domain. First, an overview of what constitutes cyber conflict is provided, the state of its norms and regulations, and the uncertain nature of cyberspace. Second, an analysis of ripeness theory in conventional and cyber conflict highlights the current gaps in negotiation literature when applied to an evolving form of conflict. Third, redefining the idea of MHS by suggesting an alternative, \"mutually harming standoff,\" offers an examination into the timing discrepancy surrounding cyberspace agreements. Lastly, examining the 2015 bilateral US-China Cybersecurity Agreement provides context for applying this hypothesis and demonstrates how accepted negotiation theory may be applied to cyber conflict.\n# Defining Cyber Conflict: Terms, Norms, and the Rise of Uncertainty\nThe definitions of \"cyber conflict\" or \"cyberwarfare\" are a source of contention throughout the international community. There is a lack of shared understanding for terms related to cyberspace, with some scholars arguing that the preoccupation with cyber warfare has little merit. While some governments, academics, and media outlets overemphasize the threat of a \"cyber Pearl Harbor,\" these warnings are more speculative and extreme than reality would suggest (Singer &amp; Friedman 2014: 68). If applying a Clausewitzian understanding of war, which emphasizes its violence, instrumental character, and political\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nPOLK\nnature, it appears that cyberwar has yet to occur, as no cyber attack has met these three criteria (Rid 2012: 7–10).\nRegardless of the debate on the reality of cyber warfare, the fact remains that cyberspace activities continue to shape and threaten geopolitical relations. Offensive cyber exchanges in the digital realm have exacerbated international tensions between technological powerhouses such as the United States, Russia, and China, and developing consensus on the broader idea of “cyber conflict” is pertinent to establishing a new approach to diplomacy on the issue of cyberspace. For this article, we will adopt a broad definition of “cyber conflict” to include information operations between two or more entities that intentionally undermine the economic, political, social, or security systems of states, businesses, and organizations. This definition incorporates such concepts as “cyber espionage,” “disinformation campaigns,” “cyber sabotage,” and “cyberterrorism,” representing tactics initiated or sponsored by states (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015).\nExamples of cyber conflict include the continuous use of cyber operations or the means through which states conduct cyber attacks against the same entity over time. These conflicts are reciprocal, characterized by tit-for-tat cyber exchanges between countries, and may also employ non-cyber means in an effort to deter future attacks, such as sanctions or public condemnation. Cyber conflict includes the use of advanced persistent threats (APTs) to spy on corporate activities or the development and deployment of malicious software to cause physical damage to infrastructure. Cyber operations may use an array of cyber weapons, from the application of botnets in distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks that shut down government websites to the creation of Trojans and backdoors, which infiltrate and sabotage computer networks (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 34). These parameters highlight the scope of the issues and features that shape cyber conflicts and the ambiguities surrounding their nature.\nConversely, this definition does not include small-scale “cybercrime,” which tends to be a for-profit enterprise that does not center on ideology or political gain (Singer &amp; Friedman 2014: 145–155). It also does not include attacks perpetrated by individuals or non-state-sponsored criminal organizations since these efforts more often constitute “cybercrime” and are one-off rogue actions intended to cause chaos or malice rather than achieve policy goals (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 33). Lastly, the article focuses on “pure” cyber conflict, thus dismissing incidences of cyber attacks as part of larger military campaigns or hybrid warfare. While negotiations on conventional conflicts may address concerns relating to cyberspace, kinetic wars are characterized differently from cyber conflicts, as discussed later in the article.\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8–36\nRIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\n# Cyber Norms and Consensus\nDisagreements over what constitutes cyber conflict impact the establishment of international norms for addressing cyber operations. Numerous arrangements have attempted to codify norms for regulating cyberspace and expanding international law to include the digital domain. The Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare is one effort to establish consensus on cyber conflict. This document, first published in 2013, attempts to apply existing international law to cyber conflicts while defining \"cyber attacks\" and \"cyber self-defense\" (Schmitt 2017). However, the Tallinn Manual has no legal standing, and many countries have rejected the arguments it presents (Singer &amp; Friedman 2014: 206). As a result, binding consensus on how states should govern and regulate cyberspace remains indefinite and allows for multiple interpretations of what justifies an attack.\nOther efforts to establish norms in cyberspace involve international processes to develop standards of conduct in the cyber realm. Since 1998, motions to formulate cyber arms control treaties and propagate agreements on cyber governance have shaped international agendas (Ruhl et al. 2020). From intergovernmental institutions like the UN to think tank-led working groups, numerous negotiations and dialogues have been under way to improve the stability and security of cyberspace. These initiatives include ongoing fora such as the UN Group of Governmental Experts (UN GGE) and the UN Open-Ended Working Group (UN OEWG), both aimed at developing interstate cyber norms and applying international law to cyberspace (Ruhl et al. 2020). Other efforts include the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace, a coalition of cybersecurity experts that promotes specific cyber norms, and the Paris Call, a \"multistakeholder initiative led by the French government and supported by Microsoft,\" which seeks to mainstream cyber norms outside of interstate dialogues (Ruhl et al. 2020: 11).\nThe credibility of their participants legitimizes these formats, whether it is the legitimacy of the UN process or the inclusivity of multiple stakeholders, such as businesses, think tanks, and non-profits, in building standards for cyberspace (Ruhl et al. 2020). However, Ruhl et al. note that these efforts are constrained due to four factors. For one, the evolving nature of cyberspace impedes the development of sustainable norms, and the presence of multiple actors with varying interests inhibits the regulation of norm adherence in cyberspace. Second, states' cyber activities are often secretive and unknown, thus obstructing the implementation of international standards for cyberspace. Third, disagreement between great powers on cyberspace norms can frustrate agreements. For example, Russian and Chinese demands for greater state sovereignty in cyberspace are countered by the US' assertion for free and\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nPOLK\nindependent Internet access. Fourth, weak incentives to adhere to cyberspace norms can reduce the impact and sustainability of international agreements. In contrast, \"states with significant cyber capabilities seem ready and willing to employ them to advance their interests,\" presenting an incentive for states to dismiss norms or limit their scope of adherence (Ruhl et al. 2020:17). Therefore, the multilateral fora for establishing cyberspace norms currently faces significant limitations in their effectiveness, generating a high level of uncertainty in the domain of cyberspace.\n## Uncertainty in the Digital Realm\nThe uncertain nature of cyberspace and norms creates difficulties for dispute resolution. Unlike conventional conflict, where risks, calculations, and capacities are known in an exercise of \"control power,\" cyber conflict occurs in a realm of uncertainty, potentiality, and improvisation (Katzenstein &amp; Seybert, 2018). The \"fog of uncertainty\" (Katzenstein &amp; Seybert 2018: 36) limits states' abilities to know how cyberspace will evolve, who the actors are, and what their capabilities may entail, thus preventing states from assessing the long-term ramifications of a cyber attack's impact. The nebulousness of cyberspace results not in deterrence but in restraint, which Valeriano and Maness (2015: 54) describe as a \"policy outcome but not necessarily a process\" for states' limited use of cyber tools. Therefore, this restraint is a consequence of the ambiguity and insecurity characterizing cyberspace, suggesting that certainties regarding states' intentions and cyber capabilities are unattainable, thereby reducing the risk of escalation in cyber conflict.\nEscalation represents an \"increase in the intensity of a conflict and in the severity of the tactics used in pursuing it\" (Maiese 2003) and is crucial to the perception of ripeness in conflict. However, states' restraint in using cyber tools impedes the prominence of both escalation and ripeness in cyber conflict, a discrepancy which will be addressed in the next section. The uncertainty of cyberspace and the limitations of cyber norms results in weak perceptions of states' digital activities. The vagueness of cyberspace is an impediment to determining what should be negotiated, let alone when negotiations should be conducted. Analyzing the concept of \"ripeness\" in cyber conflict will answer the question of when states should negotiate on matters of cyberspace.\n## Overview of Ripeness Theory\nAs previously stated, Zartman's \"ripeness theory\" presents a condition for the timing and beginning of negotiation (2001). Ripeness is a perceptual event that\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nRIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nstems from the belief in a Mutually Hurting Stalemate (MHS) or a Mutually Enticing Opportunity (MEO) (Zartman 2000). Zartman defines MHS as the moment when \"parties find themselves locked in a conflict from which they cannot escalate to victory and this deadlock is painful to both of them\" (2008). This deadlock may be depicted as a plateau, a stalemate where the costs of continuing the violence outweigh the benefits, with both parties suffering from the ongoing conflict. Similarly, a catastrophic event, or a precipice, may threaten or have influenced perceptions of the conflict and impart a stalemate. To quote Zartman (2001: 8), \"the catastrophe provides a deadline or a lesson indicating that pain can be sharply increased if something is not done about it now.\" Upon the perception of an MHS, both parties recognize that the probability of unilaterally winning the conflict is decreased, making the stalemate more foreboding.\nIn response to the perception of a stalemate, the conflicting parties may attempt to seize the moment by pursuing a \"way out\" of the conflict, sustained by an MEO (Zartman 2008), through negotiation. Zartman's theory is displayed in Figure 1, which demonstrates the push and pull factors that lead to the decision and commitment to negotiate.\nIt should be noted that ripeness is merely a condition for encouraging states to negotiate an end to the conflict, one that is \"necessary, but not sufficient\" (Zartman 2001: 9). As such, the propensity for success in cyber negotiation is not guaranteed in seizing the ripe moment for dialogue. Analysis of ripeness theory's application in conventional and cyber conflict demonstrates how the concept of a stalemate leads (or does not lead) to the perception that the timing is suitable for negotiation as an alternative to continued fighting.\nFIGURE 1 Elements of conventional ripeness theory and the process of negotiation ADAPTED FROM ZARTMAN (2000: 230, 242)\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nPOLK\n# Ripeness and Conventional Conflict\nIn kinetic warfare, ripeness theory holds merit. Conventional conflict may be escalated and then plateaued, as defined by an MHS, thus presenting an opportunity for seeking a way out through negotiation. Zartman (2008) illustrates this by stating that \"to ripen a conflict one must raise the level of conflict until the stalemate is reached and then further until it begins to hurt – and even then, work toward a perception of an impending catastrophe as well.\" This captures the idea behind MHS – a perceived stalemate must be generated for both sides, with the parties incurring unsustainable or unbearable costs in the long run even when there is no prospect for further escalation. Brahm illustrates the role of MHS as a tipping point or push-factor towards negotiation by depicting conventional conflict as a cresting wave (see Figure 2). After the emergence of the conflict, continuous escalation of hostilities leads to or threatens an impending catastrophe, the precipice of the wave at which point an MHS has occurred (Brahm 2003). If the MHS is perceived, it may push the parties towards de-escalation and negotiation, and confidence-building measures and the perception of an MEO can pull the parties closer toward an agreement and the end of the conflict (Brahm 2003).\nIn conventional conflict, weaponry and strategic maneuvers are useful in this pursuit of a stalemate since conventional weaponry varies in scale, targeting, and scope of damage. For example, during the Bosnian War, NATO's use of cruise missiles and stealth planes in \"Operation Deliberate Force\" destroyed 338 Serbian targets. The Bosnian Serbs perceived the use of US Navy Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles (TLAMs) and F-117 bombers as a major escalation by\nFIGURE 2 Stages of conflict\nADAPTED FROM BRAHM (2003)\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nRIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nNATO (Morgan et al. 2008: 13), and this campaign helped to push the Serbs to return to the Dayton Accords in late 1995 (Hartwell 2019: 450). By employing weaponry or strategy, practitioners in conventional conflict are able to achieve a stalemate by escalating the hostilities on the ground. Therefore, the role of escalation is integral to achieving MHS since it results in perceptions “that there has been a significant qualitative change in the conflict as a result of the new development” (Morgan et al. 2008: 9). When both parties escalate to unattainable levels, the conventional conflict plateaus while the sides experience mutual hurt.\nThese conflicts are then considered ripe for negotiation, and the moment may be seized to initiate negotiations and resolve the conflict. Examples of ripeness theory in kinetic conflict have been perceived in the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah War, the Yugoslav Wars in the 1990s, and the Angolan Civil War (Schrodt, Yilmaz &amp; Gerner 2003; Touval 2002: 167; Zartman 2000). In these cases, military escalation of conflict or mediator-induced perceptions of MHS pushed parties to commit to dialogue processes (Touval 2002; Zartman 2000). As such, ripeness theory has strong applicability in cases of conventional conflict.\n## Ripeness and Cyber Conflict\nIn contrast, cyber conflicts do not have the same characteristics as conventional warfare. Cyber operations are not inherently escalatory, and using cyber means to intensify a cyber conflict to the point of ripeness is improbable. For one, states view cyber operations as de facto “escalatory offramps,” or alternatives to costly kinetic conflict that still signal state displeasure or aim to influence rivals’ behavior (Jensen &amp; Valeriano 2019: 2). As such, decision-makers are often inclined to use cyber operations as an extension of foreign policy because they are not escalatory. If faced with increased tensions with rival governments, states have displayed a preference for choosing cyber responses as a form of “sub-crisis maneuvering” or exit from heightened conflict (Jensen &amp; Valeriano 2019: 4).\nA 2019 survey of US, Russian, and Israeli civilians further demonstrates this perspective that cyber conflict is non-escalatory. In this study, respondents in all three countries showed a general preference for non-escalatory responses to cyber attacks in scenarios where the victim state had the capacity to respond with an in-kind cyber weapon (Jensen &amp; Valeriano 2019: 6). Respondents from Russia voted in favor of de-escalatory responses to cyber attacks, while citizens from the US and Israel most often favored proportional responses to the initial attack (Jensen &amp; Valeriano 2019: 7). All three countries had low responses expressing a preference for escalation against a cyber attack. These findings express a tendency to view cyber conflict as a non-escalatory domain (Jensen\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nPOLK\n&amp; Valeriano 2019), thereby casting doubt on the notion that responses to cyber operations could result in an escalation between two parties.\nEven in the most severe cases of cyber attacks, such as disruptions of critical infrastructure, victim states have exhibited a preference for non-escalatory response rather than escalatory action. The real-world examples of the 2015 and 2016 attacks on Ukrainian power grids capture this. In these events, the BlackEnergy 3 and Crashoverride malware, respectively, targeted energy companies or transmission substations resulting in the disruption of electricity supply to nearby consumers. These attacks had limited impact, lasting between one to six hours before restoring full operations (Todros 2018), reflecting the low-intensity, high-manageability of the attack. Yet, the most notable feature of these attacks concerns Ukraine's response. First, Ukraine and allied countries largely attributed both attacks to a hacking group connected to Russian intelligence services (Greenberg 2017), but this has not been proven. This demonstrates an attribution problem that highlights the uncertainty typical of cyber attacks and prevents rapid, escalatory responses of any form. In other words, given the lack of certainty regarding the perpetrator of the cyber attack, decision-makers were impeded in their ability to execute timely and sufficient responses akin to escalation through either digital or kinetic means. Second, even when members of the Ukrainian government condemned Russia for the act, no offensive response, either kinetic or in-kind, was taken (Greenberg 2017). These cases show that even cyber attacks impacting critical infrastructure have low-escalatory potential, a trait that is especially unique when linked to the ongoing geopolitical tensions that shape Russian-Ukrainian relations outside the digital realm. As such, cyber conflicts cannot easily demonstrate escalatory potential using digital means.\nFurthermore, Borghard and Lonergan (2019; 125-138) argue that cyber operations are \"poor tools of escalation\" for four reasons: they are time-consuming to develop, they have a limited impact on the victim state, states have countervailing tradeoffs in using cyber tools, and there are few appropriate cross-domain responses to cyber attacks. First, developing retaliatory cyber tools is time-consuming (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 125). In the event of a cyber attack, a state or institution may not have immediate access to the digital tools required to launch a counteroffensive. According to Borghard and Lonergan (2019: 125), \"offensive cyber operations deliver effects against targets through exploiting a vulnerability to gain access (through an attack vector) to a target's network or system.\" This backdoor access would need to be pre-installed and ready to act on for a timely counterattack to work; without this preset, any response would be time-consuming and miss the opportunity to escalate the conflict. If a conflicting entity did have access to these digital means for a cyber\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nRIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\noffensive, it would have to reconcile with concerns of attribution (Wohlfeld &amp; Jasper 2018). While kinetic conflicts have a clear direction and source of an attack, cyber conflicts are not always evident (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 30).\nThis leads to the second issue: the effects of cyber operations are limited (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 131). If a state responds to a cyber attack with a cyber offensive of its own, the nature of the response would likely be limited in its impact and only supply a temporary nuisance or network disruption (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 123). In extreme cases, cyber offensives may attack critical infrastructure or influence economics by disrupting trust in governments and corporations. Yet even in these instances, the effects of the initial and responding cyber attacks would be temporary and unsustainable (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 131), thus failing to escalate the conflict.\nMoreover, many cyber attacks have uncertain and unintended repercussions (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 41), thus rendering hasty responses ineffective in the long run. By lacking a pronounced intensification of the cyber conflict due to limitations on impact, parties cannot escalate the conflict to a stalemate under conventional mhs. In the same vein, it is imperative to acknowledge that uncertainty permits future technological advances that may result in cyber tools with sufficient cross-domain capabilities, more destructive effects, or greater severity in impact. Whenever these tools are invented, perhaps the face of cyber conflict will change, and cyber operations will possess greater escalatory potential. Nevertheless, until that day, the current nature of cyber conflict demonstrates low-cost and low-impact effects upon the victimized state. As such, it limits the effectiveness of responding attacks at escalating a cyber conflict through digital means.\nThe third impediment for cyber escalation is the existence of countervailing tradeoffs for cyber operations (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 133). Many states execute cyber operations against other entities to achieve the goals of sabotage, espionage, or subversion (Rid 2012), all of which require secrecy to succeed (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 134). Since cyber tools are perceived as a more cost-effective and clandestine alternative to conventional warfare and espionage, political leaders are more likely to benefit from the continued development of cyber offense capabilities (Wohlfeld &amp; Jasper 2018). Consequently, states will be less willing to employ conspicuous, escalatory operations if it risks compromising their other large-scale operations (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 134). The risk comes from the potential that the attack is discovered since patches can be made that impede future access to the systems and data that governments aim to exploit. This reduces the likelihood that conflicting parties will perceive an incentive to escalate cyber disputes via a public response, especially if governments are pressured to justify their actions by revealing\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nPOLK\nthat the initial attack occurred. In doing so, states risk exposing their vulnerabilities or threatening their international standing. As a result, states may be less likely to escalate a cyber conflict, both within and outside the domain of cyberspace (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 134).\nLastly, Borghard and Lonergan claim that it is unlikely that states will respond to a cyber attack through kinetic or cross-domain means (2019: 137). Unlike conventional conflict, cyber attacks do not produce the same carnage, psychological pressure, or violence as kinetic attacks. Instead, questions about the proportionality of responding to a cyber incident with cross-domain capabilities limit the feasibility of justifying kinetic responses to cyber attacks (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 137). Historically there has never been any cross-domain response to a first strike cyber attack, and there are very few instances of a kinetic response being used to answer cyber attacks in hybrid conflict. The most notable kinetic attack is Israel's 2019 airstrike against Hamas. In this instance, Israel's response to Hamas' cyber activities against the government appears to demonstrate an immediate conflict escalation. Yet, this dispute took place in the context of an ongoing and kinetic conflict, thus disqualifying its label as a pure cyber conflict (Borghard &amp; Schneider 2019). With this in mind, it is evident that there are significant limitations to a cross-domain escalation of pure cyber conflict.\nStill, some counterarguments stress the possibility of cross-domain escalation in cyber conflict by suggesting that a state could interpret an initial cyber attack as an act of war and employ a kinetic response. Borghard and Lonergan (2019: 138) acknowledge that the perception of some cyber attacks as low-impact or low-cost may apply to only certain states and political ideologies. Once again, uncertainty is an essential feature as much of the concern surrounding escalation in cyber conflict centers on the threats posed by ambiguity in risk analysis and escalation management (Libicki &amp; Tkacheva 2020).\nWhen states are not certain of their rivals' assumptions about how domains are interconnected and what constitutes an act of war, it is plausible that the result could lead to unintended escalation of the conflict into conventional warfare. In this scenario, if a state were to respond promptly to a cyber attack with a kinetic operation, then conventional understandings of MHS would have relevance; after all, at this point the conflict would have crossed a threshold into the physical realm and would follow conventional rules of engagement and escalation management. At this point, a cyber conflict-turned-conventional would no longer apply to this study since the focus is primarily on \"pure\" cyber conflict with no cross-domain aspects.\nHowever, what about a hypothetical in which a state first makes a threat to escalate a cyber conflict into a conventional war? In this scenario, the\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nuncertainty aspect of cyberspace suggests that mhs might not necessarily hold relevance. The threat of cross-domain escalation is a form of deterrence, which has limited and ambiguous influence in cyber conflict and the digital domain. Sweijs and Zilincik (2021: 133) state that three criteria influence escalation management in cross-domain deterrence (cdd): attribution, credibility and threat proportionality, and signaling.\n##### Attribution\nAttribution of initial cyber attacks can be tedious, time-consuming, and inexact, leading to uncertainty in directing the threat at the appropriate target. This uncertainty risks international embarrassment, condemnation, or even tension if the threatening state incorrectly identifies a perpetrator or lacks evidence. As a result, the threat may not effectively escalate the conflict across domains since it may be easily dismissed. Furthermore, if a threat is directed at another state, accurately or not, the accused state would have little incentive to act upon standard mhs conceptualizations of ripeness and agree to negotiations. Once the accusation has been made, any response to a threat of kinetic escalation of a cyber conflict would require the accused to admit their cyber capabilities, thereby negating the serviceability of these digital tools and jeopardizing other cyber operations elsewhere in the world. As such, mhs would not necessarily hold relevance in scenarios where states rely on cross-domain escalation threats because uncertainty and attribution limits prevent states from utilizing effective cdd strategies.\n##### Credibility and threat proportionality\nRegarding credibility and threat proportionality, Sweijs and Zilincik (2021: 137) note that cdd is “complicated by the inherent disproportionality of responses across domains and instruments of power.” In this case, the relevance of mhs to threats of escalation is limited by the uncertain risk of how the international community and general population will perceive this intimidation. Despite the concern over states’ diverging definitions of what constitutes appropriate cross-domain escalation, there is consensus that violent responses to non-violent offensive measures will result in more immediate and severe consequences, which may receive public and international skepticism (Sweijs & Zilincik 2021: 137; Nye 2017: 51). As such, states may differ in their gauge of a threat’s credibility. This divergence weakens the case for mhs’ relevance to threats of escalation in cyber conflict since the ensuing uncertainty weakens the efficacy of the threat that domain spillover is plausible or justifiable.\n##### Signaling\nLastly, issues with signaling threats of cross-domain escalation reduce the applicability of mhs processes to cyber conflicts that could turn conventional. In the cyber domain, cross-domain signaling may be misinterpreted, with signals conducted through military means risking greater ambiguity about the signaler’s intentions to the target. As Sweijs and Zilincik (2021: 140)\nPOLK\nnote, \"a signal of resolve to respond to cyberattacks by moving platforms for the launch of conventional or nuclear weapons may be easily interpreted as a preparation for hostilities rather than as an adjustment of the deterrence posture.\" As a result, the target of the threat may view the cross-domain action as separate from the cyber conflict or as a general increase in tension outside of the digital realm. The risk of ambiguity in cross-domain signaling impedes MHS principles' efficacy in escalating the conflict since the action may appear detached from or external to the cyber conflict.\nWithout the capacity to escalate ongoing digital disputes, cyber conflicts present a challenge to conventional ripeness theory and do not offer states an incentive to seek a negotiated agreement. Parties' perceptions of a mutually hurting stalemate are more difficult to achieve because the long-term intensifying effects of cyber operations are often imperceptible, reiterating the dilemma of uncertainty in characterizing cyber conflict. Similarly, if a state were to threaten cross-domain spillover, the likelihood that the threat of escalation would serve as a sufficient push-factor towards negotiation is impeded by factors of uncertainty. As such, current ideas about timing and ripeness in cyber conflict remain elusive for cyberspace negotiations and require a reexamination of MHS to address this deviation.\n## Re-defining Mutually Hurting Stalemate\nAddressing the discrepancy between ripeness theory and cyber conflict requires a closer examination of the concept of mutually hurting stalemate. The perception of a stalemate is clearly critical in pushing conflicting parties towards negotiation. However, existing scholarship emphasizes that perception is built on mutual hurt and the threat (or existence) of unsustainable escalation. Since cyber weapons are not reliable tools of escalation and cyber operations present enticing tradeoffs for their continued use, mutual hurt and the threat of intensification are not attainable. As such, redefining the idea of a stalemate provides an alteration of ripeness theory for cyber conflicts.\nThis new definition addresses the main component of MHS: the hurting stalemate. The mutuality of MHS is not called into question since it is an essential aspect of any conflict. The reciprocal nature of conflict is inherent to the disagreement: all parties must be targets and initiators of cyber attacks for the cyber conflict to exist. Even where attribution issues exist, the mutual perception of a cyber attack from a rival is sufficient for the conflict to persist. Consequently, tit-for-tat cyber attacks are crucial in both the conflict and\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nRIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nnegotiation stages, and mutuality remains integral to encouraging parties to approach negotiation as a way out of cyber conflict.\nWhile the hurting stalemate is crucial to perceptions of ripe moments in conventional conflict, the phrase itself is incomplete in characterizing cyber conflict. The hurting stalemate is a painful deadlock characterized by a plateau, \"a flat and unending terrain without relief\" (Zartman 2000: 228), unbearable to both parties. This concept is not wholly accurate for cyber conflict due to the limits of inflicting pain through cyber means and the low-intensity nature of cyber operations. For one, cyber tools, like conventional weaponry, are a means for achieving political objectives. In cyber conflict, each cyber operation, analyzed individually, aims (and often achieves) short-term goals such as gaining trade and military secrets, displaying cyber capabilities, or deterring activity. When combined to characterize cyber conflict, the long-term goals reveal themselves. The long-term objectives in cyber conflict show how the mutuality of hurt is limited since the operations themselves are limited in scope and impact. In fact, it is challenging to conceptualize cyber conflict as \"winnable,\" given that the impact of cyber operations is constrained and unlikely to debilitate the target. According to Valeriano and Maness (2015: 61), cyber operations are often innocuous and used primarily \"as methods of signaling displeasure or discord to a rival,\" a demonstration of the restraint used by states when engaging in cyberspace. Cyber weapons have limited applicability in their \"hurting\" capability even in more destructive incidences, such as the Stuxnet worm that destroyed Iranian nuclear centrifuges in Operation Olympic Games. Though intending to deter or delay Iran's nuclear weapons development, Operation Olympic Games ultimately bolstered Tehran's determination to restore and expand its nuclear research in Natanz (Sanger 2018: 42).\nWith this limitation in mind, it is important to note that hurt from cyber conflict still exists. Targeted countries may experience damages or disruptions to their institutions and networks, impacting daily operations or economic mobility. Similarly, non-cyber responses to cyber operations, such as sanctions, condemnation, or other negative foreign policy measures, may inflict damages on the perceived initiator of an attack. Therefore, hurt is present in cyber conflict. However, there is a critical distinction between kinetic and cyber hurt: the hurt is not exhaustive in cyber conflict. Since cyber conflict is non-escalatory and used as a first-response or low-intensity method of engagement (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015), the hurt it inflicts on the target is not equal to the painful deadlock prescribed by conventional MHS. Instead, this hurt is perpetually sustainable, akin to Zartman's idea of \"the soft, stable, and self-serving stalemate\" (S5).\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nPOLK\nAccording to Zartman, the S5 is \"a low-level conflict, even when punctuated by occasional blips of violence\" that \"leaves each of the parties ... able to claim that it has not been defeated, which is a victory of sorts\" (2005a: 52). The S5 typically describes intractable conflicts in the kinetic domain, explaining the absence of ripeness in pushing the conflicting parties towards a negotiated solution (Zartman 2005a). In conventional analysis, factors of protracted conflict, zero-sum identities, the profitability of continued fighting, mutually exclusive solutions, and deficient perceptions of ripeness contribute to intractability in kinetic conflict (Zartman 2005a: 59–60). However, these features are not all representative of cyber conflict.\nCyber operations are both the means and ends to accomplishing short-term goals, disrupting issues of protraction even if the conflict itself is perpetual. Furthermore, cyber conflicts often do not involve zero-sum identities unique to the dispute, although the cyber conflict may exacerbate pre-existing conflicts between states. Nevertheless, the issues of profitability, solution saliency, and ripeness are typical of cyber conflicts, which are defined by countervailing tradeoffs encouraging the perpetuation of the conflict (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 133), and diverging norms and interests hampering cyber agreements. As such, cyber conflicts share some features of intractable disputes, which are emblematic of S5. However, S5 is still insufficient for characterizing cyber conflict due to the uncertainty surrounding cyberspace and the unique nature of intractability in the digital realm.\nWith these limitations in mind, the standard perception of a hurting stalemate is improbable in cyber conflict, and a conventional ripe moment for negotiation would not be perceived. Instead, adjusting the criteria for a hurting stalemate reshapes the conditions for ripeness in cyber conflict. This new condition focuses on a \"mutually harming standoff,\" a condition on the spectrum between Zartman's theories of S5 and MHS that permits the lack of a hurting stalemate in cyber conflict.\n## Mutually Harming Standoff, Ripeness, and Cyber Negotiations\nA mutually harming standoff (which will be referred to as MHS2) is distinct from a mutually hurting stalemate (hereafter referred to as MHS1) since it emphasizes the perfunctory character of the pain and reciprocity in cyber conflict. The \"harm\" inflicted by cyber operations may have a negative impact on the targeted state, but it is not so unbearable that the state is incapable of persisting without a way out. In other words, the state is not pressed into seeking an alternative to the cyber conflict since the harm it experiences is not exhaustive. Furthermore, a \"standoff\" provides a better image than a stalemate. While the hurting stalemate represents unwinnable deadlocks that are\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8–36\nRIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\npainful to all parties (Zartman, 2000), the standoff is more akin to an effectively manageable, if not perpetual and harmful, dispute with high reciprocity and low escalation capacity (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 129). This captures the nature of cyber conflict and adapts a critical component of ripeness theory.\nIf MHS2 characterizes long-term cyber conflict, when and how can it be perceived? More importantly, how can negotiators operationalize MHS2 to encourage cyber negotiations if a ripe moment is improbable in cyber conflict? Both questions are linked to another component of ripeness theory: mutually enticing opportunity (MEO). In Zartman's ripeness theory, perceptions of MHS1 are necessary, if insufficient, for encouraging parties to engage in dialogue as a way out of conventional conflict. This may be supplemented by perceptions of an MEO, which acts as the pull-factor for parties to engage in and continue negotiations (Zartman 2000: 241-242). Zartman acknowledges that few cases of conventional conflict demonstrate the opening of negotiations due to perceptions of an MEO alone. However, these perceptions help encourage parties to commit to negotiations once they commence (Zartman 2000: 241-242). Still, since conventional MHS1 does not exist in cyber conflict, realizing an MHS2 coupled with perceptions of an MEO can push rival cyber parties toward negotiations.\nFigure 3 presents an adaptation of the standard stages of the conflict arc for cyber disputes. In this depiction, MHS2 represents the state of the conflict from the time of emergence. This shows that without escalatory capacities, cyber conflicts are inherently defined by the perpetual reciprocity of cyber\nFIGURE 3 Stages of cyber conflict\nADAPTED FROM BRAHM (2003)\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nPOLK\nattacks between states, continuing the plateau indefinitely as conflict persists in a low intensity and restrained manner. To disrupt this, the perception of an MEO is necessary to act as the new push-factor for parties to enter and commit to negotiations.\nIn cyber conflict, the MEO can manifest in several ways. These incentives may appear at different thresholds of pain throughout the dispute and encourage states to consider negotiations under various circumstances. Like MHS1, MHS2 pain thresholds are perceptual, and thus MEO S will be subjective from case to case (Zartman 2005b). Analyzing an array of MEO S showcases potential push-factor attributes unique to the nature of cyberspace that could encourage cyber conflict negotiation.\nNorms development collaboration. Like conventional conflicts, both parties may inherently view alternatives to victory that do not include tit-for-tat cyber exchanges. This may have limitations pending each party's goals in conducting cyber operations, but the opportunity to collaborate may displace the benefits of using digital tools against rivals. This collaboration leads to an impactful and enticing opportunity for negotiation: norms development. Given the standard of uncertainty in the cyber realm, states can attempt to shape the digital world in their image by collaborating to bilaterally develop and diffuse norms that meet their interests on a global scale. In other words, by leveraging the perception that normative interests are more far-reaching and achievable through bilateral collaboration, negotiators may be more successful in pushing conflicting parties to the table to coordinate on broader issues that both address and extend beyond the ongoing conflict.\nThe MEO for norms development collaboration is especially pertinent in cyber conflicts where the targets are primarily private and government non-military infrastructure. This represents one threshold for pain on the lattice of MHS2 ripeness; when attacks are apparent and far-reaching in their impact on the public, states are more likely to respond negatively (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 125). This is because many states view public interference in cyberspace as \"crossing a line\" in the digital realm, despite the lack of norms or agreements dictating this taboo (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015). Conversely, in cyber conflicts where attacks primarily target political and military networks, \"victim\" states are less likely to react with a negative or conflict-prone response (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 123-124). This suggests that cyber conflicts which focus on traditional government-to-government attacks, including infiltrations and intrusions through Trojans and APTs, are likely to present the norm for cyber conflict (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015). On the other hand, DDoS attacks are more obvious in their display of aggression since they interfere with public websites and systems, and states are more likely to respond negatively to the attack due to pressure from the public impacted by the incident.\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nRIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nCyber conflicts that reach MHS2 thresholds, in which public infrastructure is the primary target, can present an MEO for parties to meet to recalibrate norms for cyberspace conduct. For example, suppose the cyber conflict is characterized by long-run DDoS attacks or infiltrations targeting non-military private and government networks. In that case, participants may use these perceived violations as an opportunity to collaborate and bilaterally promote norms in cyber conflict that benefit both parties. In other words, while perpetuating the tit-for-tat cycle of the cyber conflict is a non-escalatory option, continued DDoS attacks may present reasonable grounds for decision-makers to examine alternatives to the conflict, thereby seeking innovative solutions for a way out of MHS2. Furthermore, considering the absence of concrete norms in cyberspace, parties may view the chance to negotiate and act as norm-makers as a mutually enticing opportunity.\nProtean power. In addition to norms development collaboration, the opportunity for states to demonstrate \"protean power\" is an enticing opportunity for decision-makers to choose negotiation in cyber conflict. This form of power, coined by Katzenstein and Seybert in 2018, counters the aforementioned \"control power\" and acknowledges the importance of creativity and innovation in decision-making when facing increasingly uncertain international dynamics. Due to the uncertain nature of cyberspace, successful navigation and utility of the digital realm require states to remain innovative, flexible, and agile in responding to rapid changes in technology or when dealing with crises where assurances in risk analyses are limited. As such, the negotiating table is the ideal medium for states to gain and exhibit protean power since the choice to negotiate in cyber conflict is a strategic, albeit inventive and pioneering option that may result in relative gains for both states.\nMoreover, states will likely view the display of protean power as a complement or, in some cases, substitute to other conventional understandings of power dynamics, such as hard power. As Katzenstein and Seybert (2018: 25) put it, \"the world is well stocked with low-probability events such as the sudden appearance of terrorist organizations operating on a global scale and waves of large-scale human migration.\" Therefore, displaying creative prowess in the face of ambiguity, instability, and uncertainty is vital for actors \"to derive relative advantage from unexpected challenges\" (Katzenstein &amp; Seybert 2018: 25). In cyber conflict, states that choose to negotiate over a continuation of tit-for-tat exchanges that prolong the status quo of MHS2 are more likely to be perceived as adaptable and inventive in responding to uncertainty surrounding the nature of cyberspace and geopolitics in this domain. Consequently, states that choose negotiation in cyber conflict have a stronger capacity for protean power, making them more durable and influential in handling increasingly complex dynamics in world politics.\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nPOLK\nSmall state influence. Similarly, small states may be uniquely positioned to act on a push-factor MEO in cyber conflict since the newness of the domain presents opportunities for gaining leverage in the international arena. Following the benefits of protean power, the opportunity to demonstrate influence over rival states through innovation and improvisation in cyber conflict management incentivizes smaller states to push for negotiation as a means of alleviating tensions. This then acts as a push-factor MEO for smaller states seeking greater power in the international arena at large, especially since the democratic layout of cyberspace allows for ease of entry to new actors. In turn, larger states may be incentivized to negotiate in cyber conflict to further extend their influence in the digital realm, as well as the physical one.\nCross-conflict negotiation leverage. Finally, rival states with ongoing non-cyber tensions may be incentivized to negotiate as an avenue for leverage in other conflict domains. In other words, states with ongoing geopolitical tensions, such as the US and Russia, Japan and South Korea, or India and Pakistan, may be able to bargain agreements made in cyberspace with concessions in other negotiations or settlements. This also presents another scenario in which pain thresholds may be achieved in MHS2. Cyber conflicts that persist alongside other tensions or conflicts will prompt heightened sensitivities and feelings of annoyance between rivals. Yet, the digital realm remains the ideal medium for achieving cooperation or relative gains between rivals despite this distrust. The cyber domain provides an opportunity for norms development, an exhibition of power, and leverage in other conflict settlements. Thus, cyber conflicts between historic rival states are likely to perceive the status quo as a threshold of pain that makes an MEO for cooperation in the digital world appealing. Moreover, if the rivals perceive an opportunity to achieve non-cyber gains through cyber conflict negotiations, the parties already in conflict may consider this a push-factor MEO in cyberspace.\nThis MEO is well-suited for states engaged in regional conflict, a feature that Valeriano and Maness (2105: 81) note as being one of the most common fora for cyber conflict. For example, Japan and South Korea have deep-seated hostilities, ranging from disagreements over maritime control to enmities founded on the Korean peninsula's history of Japanese occupation. Many cyber-attacks between the two countries reflect these tensions, with both countries engaging in tit-for-tat exchanges between 2001 and 2011 (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 88). Interestingly, Japanese decision-makers often choose \"more cooperative interactions with their regional rivals\" despite ongoing cyber conflicts, suggesting a desire not to escalate tensions with nearby states (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 123). It follows, then, that regional rivals may have an MEO to use cyberspace as a platform for negotiation to influence overall tensions since the alternative is maintaining the status quo and perpetuating ongoing hostilities.\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nRIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nLastly, rivals may be incentivized to negotiate cyber conflict since they could gain greater international influence where their interests align. Again, Japan and South Korea exemplify this. Since both states are closely aligned with US interests (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 216), agreements between the two, especially those that impact both the cyber and physical domains, may strengthen their standing with the US and against larger rivals like China. As such, this opportunity for both mutual and relative gains acts as a push-factor for entrenched rival states to pursue cyber conflict negotiation.\nIn sum, conventional ripeness theory is limited in cyber conflict since mutually hurting stalemates (MHS1) are unattainable in cyberspace. Instead, a mutually harming standoff (MHS2) is more characteristic of the state of tit-for-tat cyber conflicts, where parties experience adverse effects from reciprocal attacks, but not at an unsustainable level. When long-term cyber conflict is recognized as an MHS2, specific attributes of the attacks may be operationalized to enact a push-factor MEO that encourages the parties to negotiate. These MEOs may hinge on the opportunity for cyber combatants to act as norm-makers by pursuing bilateral agreements that resolve the conflict and improve conduct in cyberspace or may focus on displays of protean power as small states or historic rivals. To represent this process, Figure 4 illustrates an adaptation of Zartman's conventional ripeness theory and negotiation progression to denote the push and pull aspects of MHS2 in cyber conflict. Here, MHS2 is presented\nFIGURE 4 Elements of Mutually Harming Standoff (MHS2) and the process of negotiation\nADAPTED FROM ZARTMAN (2000: 230, 242)\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nPOLK\nas the state of the conflict, while the push-factor MEO is a dependent variable requiring both parties' perception. Only after this perception is operationalized will the parties pursue negotiation as a way out of cyber conflict.\n## 2015 US-China Cybersecurity Agreement\nThe 2015 US-China Cybersecurity Agreement illustrates how MHS2 and MEO push-factors adapt the concept of timing in cyber conflict negotiations. These negotiations produced a cybersecurity agreement that established a precedent for defining economically motivated cyber espionage (EMCE) (Harold, Libicki, &amp; Stuth Cevallos 2016: 46). This demonstrates that norm-making is an attractive prospect for cyber negotiations following an MHS2, especially due to the uncertain and nebulous environment which characterizes cyberspace. The US-China agreement also showcases the limitations of applying current ripeness theory models to a bilateral cyber conflict. An overview of the US-China cyber conflict and its corresponding negotiations demonstrates how ripeness theory can be adjusted in cyber conflict to determine the timing of cyber negotiations.\n## Background: US-China Cyber Conflict\nThe US-China cyber conflict roughly began in 2003 and has predominately consisted of cyber espionage operations between the two countries (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 91–92). This characterization is key to the perpetuity of the conflict, and it is essential to examine both countries' stances on cyberspace and the rulebook by which they operate. First, the United States extends its values regarding individual freedoms and independence to the cyber realm (Brown &amp; Yung 2017a). The US government emphasizes online freedom of expression, liberal information flows, and data privacy in its national cybersecurity policies, and uses these values as the basis for which it evaluates foreign attacks on US networks (Brown &amp; Yung 2017a; Segal 2015). This is especially true for cyber espionage. According to Brown and Yung (2017a), the US makes distinctions between forms of espionage based on their objective, stating that \"in the US view, as long as such operations collect information about economic and financial matters for the purpose of benefiting national security, they are routine intelligence work.\" In this case, corporate espionage for the economic benefit of private companies is considered off-limits.\nChina also applies its political ideologies to cyberspace operations, and these values contradict the United States. At the forefront of China's cybersecurity strategy is the idea of Internet sovereignty, a norm shared by other\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nRIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\ngovernments to promote state control over networks within their territory (Brown &amp; Yung 2017b). The Chinese government advocates for states to set their own rules regarding cyberspace and pursues digital independence from the US, which owns most of the world's IP addresses and has been heavy-handed in Internet governance (Brown &amp; Yung 2017b; Singer &amp; Friedman 2014: 140; Levite &amp; Jinghua 2019). Furthermore, China rejects the militarization of cyberspace, accusing the US of securitizing the digital domain and aggressively developing \"cyber arms\" in response to activities by perceived rivals like Russia and China (Brown &amp; Yung 2017b).\nIt is this argument that is crucial to China's cyber operations. In China's view, the US' aggressive pursuit of offensive cyber capabilities necessitates China's cyber development (Brown &amp; Yung 2017a; Singer &amp; Friedman 2014: 140). Additionally, China's stance on cyber espionage makes no distinction between operations pursuing an economic advantage versus a national security advantage (Sanger 2018: 70). Instead, China \"views economic competition as a way to achieve peer status with the US and sees cyberspace as an asymmetric instrument which it can successfully use to compete with the United States\" (Brown &amp; Yung 2017a). Thus, the Chinese agenda pursues cyber espionage for economic advantage as \"a quasi-legitimate way to achieve a North-South redistribution of wealth\" (Inkster 2017: 72). China's cyber policies aim to level the imbalance between the West and China and promote norms of self-determination in cyberspace.\nIn the US-China cyber conflict, various cyber weapons were used. Between 2003 and 2006, the Titan Rain attack employed Trojans, or unauthorized software that permits access to a system or program, to infiltrate US government and contracting networks such as the State Department and Lockheed Martin (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 34; Rid 2012: 20). This attack was attributed to the Chinese government, as was the 2006 intrusion by the APT \"Shady RAT,\" which stole secret information related to negotiation strategies, manufacturing design plans, and US national security policies (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 91; Singer &amp; Friedman 2014: 92). The international hack by GhostNet, which lasted from 2007 to 2009, utilized phishing scams to acquire access to computer microphones and cameras, allowing hackers to record conversations by State Department and Pentagon officials (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 131). This, along with other long-run intrusions and thefts, was again attributed to the Chinese government.\nIn response, US agencies retaliated against Chinese institutions by employing defensive cyber attacks. Operation Cisco Raider lasted from 2006 to 2010 and attempted to counter the distribution of counterfeit Cisco technology stolen in a Chinese hack (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 91). Another operation,\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nPOLK\nBuckshot Yankee, responded against a hack of US defense networks (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 91). Finally, the long-term operation, Shotgiant, aimed to link the Chinese telecommunications firm, Huawei, to the People's Liberation Army (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 91; Sanger &amp; Perlroth 2014; Sanger 2018). This operation also endeavored to \"exploit Huawei's technology so that when the company sold equipment to other countries ... the NSA could roam through their computer and telephone networks to conduct surveillance and, if ordered by the president, offensive cyberoperations\" (Sanger &amp; Perlroth 2014). As such, the US-China cyber conflict included exchanges of offensive and retaliatory operations between the two nations to combat diverging normative values regarding espionage.\n## Cyber Negotiations\nThroughout the cyber conflict, US-China tensions never escalated to kinetic force. Instead, the conflict remained tit-for-tat, with both governments suffering from espionage that notably affected both military and non-military private and government entities. Due to the dispute's long-term, low intensity, and restrained nature, the US-China cyber conflict gradually developed into an MHS2.\nThe MHS2 permitted both governments to continue with their cyber attacks. However, in 2009 they began to engage in Track Two diplomatic talks between the US think-tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) and China's Institute of Contemporary International Relations (CICIR) (Segal 2015). What pushed the countries towards informal dialogue? According to one Chinese official, dialogue is a better alternative to perpetual conflict because both countries are capable of continued operations but would be better served by negotiating to settle their disagreements (Singer &amp; Friedman 2014). This represents the push-factor MEO, which promotes dialogue for norms establishment between two cyber rivals.\nThe Track Two talks further reflect the impact of MEOs for norm diffusion, with the first of these informal dialogues beginning in December 2009. Early dialogues focused on addressing both states' concerns about cyber sovereignty, cyberspace norms, multilateralism in addressing cybercrime, and confidence-building in cyberspace (CSIS 2009). These informal dialogues continued in addition to Track 1.5 discussions and alternated between Washington, DC and Beijing throughout the process. Eventually, discussions regarding cyber espionage and what it constitutes emerged alongside the issues of cyber sovereignty, governance, and US primacy in cyberspace (Harold, Libicki &amp; Stuth Cevallos 2016). It should be noted that these dialogues were \"were marked more by continuity than change,\" with participants on both sides maintaining their stances\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nRIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\non definitions of terms and values (Harold, Libicki &amp; Stuth Cevallos 2016: 49). Yet the governments' willingness to meet to discuss their stances in the cyber conflict signals an interesting push for a resolution in cyber conflict, without the need of a hurting stalemate.\nThese dialogues continued in a Track Two and Track 1.5 capacity, and by 2013, Track One negotiations commenced. However, these talks were interrupted in 2014 after the US indicted five People's Liberation Army officials with cyber espionage charges (Harold, Libicki &amp; Stuth Cevallos 2016; Brown &amp; Yung 2017a). The indictment asserted that members of the Chinese military stole trade secrets from US industries to bolster China's competitiveness in the international market. In response, the Chinese government walked away from the negotiations and asserted that the US accusations were hypocritical in light of the 2013 NSA leaks (Brown &amp; Yung 2017a). However, the talks resumed the following summer, and in September 2015, US President Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping released a statement on a new Cybersecurity Agreement (Harold, Libicki &amp; Stuth Cevallos 2016). The two governments agreed to improve coordination in investigating and preventing cybercrime, not conduct or support cyber intellectual property theft, and improve cooperation in promoting international norms in cyberspace (Obama 2015).\nThe 2015 Agreement achieved both mixed results and mixed reactions. Though some scholars believe that China's agreement on the existence of economically motivated cyber espionage (EMCE) is an incremental step in reducing cyber intellectual property theft, few believe it has since decreased (Brown &amp; Yung 2017c). There has been continued concern about the quality of the agreement and China's adherence to the terms (Brown &amp; Yung 2017c). While the negotiators were able to successfully agree on cyber-specific definitions of EMCE, a significant achievement in cyber norm development, gaps in the agreement have allowed both countries to exploit technicalities in the agreement. For example, though reports suggest a decrease in Chinese economic espionage, it appears that \"Chinese operators are going after technologies that are dual-use [such as telecommunications industries], and so might not be covered by the agreements\" (Segal 2017). Similarly, the US espionage operations against Huawei have persisted, with non-cyber sanctions and indictments attacking company leadership due to the recent dispute over 5G, surveillance, and data privacy (Whalen 2020).\n## Analysis\nDespite the weaknesses of the US-China Cybersecurity Agreement, the existence of the cyber negotiations sets a unique precedent regarding the timing of bilateral dialogues in cyber conflict. The concepts of MHS2 and push-factor\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nmeo demonstrate how ripeness can be determined within cyber disputes, thus adapting Zartman's original theory to a new domain of conflict. Reviewing the conditions of ripeness in the US-China cyber conflict helps capture the applicability of mhs2 and meo in cyber conflict.\nThroughout the US-China cyber dispute, long-term operations and attacks generated an entrenched and enduring conflict between two cyber rivals. The use of intrusive cyber weapons to conduct espionage on non-military targets prompted the exchange of attacks, and the diverging perspectives on cyber and espionage norms deepened the tensions between the two countries. In this case, the conflict's perpetuity embodied an mhs2, with both countries receiving damages in their economic and political security due to cyber and non-cyber retaliations. Even so, both countries were caught in a standoff rather than a stalemate since these damages were not exhaustive, permanent, or fatigue-inducing. In fact, both countries focused on long-term cyber weaponry, like apts and Trojans, to conduct lengthy operations that were sustainable regardless of the harm dealt to each government in response.\nWith this perpetual-while-manageable standoff reached, both countries continued to conduct their cyber operations against one another. Nevertheless, the opportunity to collaborate on norms development was the meo that pushed both governments towards negotiation. This was first captured and operationalized at the informal level. Through the Track Two dialogues, the US and Chinese think tanks provided a platform for sharing and understanding each other's values and perspectives of cyberspace and security. This informal communication linked the two governments, regardless of the conflict's perpetuity, and provided the opportunity for cooperation in norm-making and diffusion. This was especially enticing considering that the UN Group of Governmental Experts (UN gge) on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace has convened multiple times throughout the US-China conflict to establish international norms in cyberspace (gip Digital Watch Observatory 2021). If the US and China could bilaterally collaborate on cyberspace norms, their influence in international norm-making would be especially prominent and allow both countries to demonstrate their protean power in a new and uncertain domain.\nTrack 1.5 and Track One dialogues between the two governments further demonstrate this dedication to coordination in resolving the cyber conflict while establishing rules for conduct in cyberspace. Though the ultimate agreement may have failed in effectively instituting these norms, the fact that understanding was reached on the definition of emce is significant. The US and China's commitment to establishing norms in cyberspace to resolve the cyber conflict is therefore an important example of cyber negotiations. Future\nRIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\n33\ndialogues may rely on this achievement as evidence for the norm developing capacity of cyber negotiations and explore the use of bilateral fora as a means for innovating, developing, and diffusing norms in cyber conflict.\n# Conclusion\nThe emergence of new technologies undoubtedly impacts geopolitical conduct between states and influences rivalries old and new as a domain for conflict. Cyber conflict, regardless of its potential to supplant conventional warfare, has surfaced as a new source of tension between states, one that is ill-defined and difficult to regulate. As such, developing capacities for resolving cyber conflict requires new approaches to negotiation and mediation, and revisiting ripeness theory allows scholars and practitioners to adapt prevailing negotiation strategies to new realms of conflict.\nDue to the nature of cyber conflict, conventional ideas of ripeness theory are inadequate for deciding when to begin cyber negotiations. Limitations in escalation, the perception of cyber operations as \"escalatory offramps,\" countervailing tradeoffs in the use of cyber tools, and the first-use character of cyber weapons prevent states from perceiving mutually hurting stalemates in tit-for-tat cyber conflict. Therefore, modifying the definition of a hurting stalemate better captures the nature of cyber conflict and offers an alternative for timing negotiations. \"Mutually harming standoff\" is more emblematic of the plateau in cyber conflict since both states may feel the consequences of the conflict, but to a manageable and sustainable degree. When long-term cyber conflict is reached, an MHS2 has taken effect, and combining it with the component of mutually enticing opportunity will push actors towards cyber negotiations.\nThe MEO, while operating as a pull-factor in kinetic conflict, serves a more significant role in propelling conflicting parties toward negotiations because cyberspace provides incentives for collaboration over conflict. Though vested with the capacity for continued cyber conflict, rival states may perceive the opportunities to collaborate on norms development, exercise protean power, or gain leverage in external conflicts as ideal for promoting their agendas on cyberspace bilaterally. This is captured by the case of the US-China Cybersecurity Agreement.\nIn this instance, the reciprocal cyber conflict between the US and China was characterized by an MHS2. Nonetheless, the governments seized the opportunity to engage in norm-making through dialogue instead of unilaterally trying to \"win\" in cyber conflict. These negotiations evolved from informal Track Two discussions to Track One negotiation and agreement between American and\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nPOLK\nChinese leadership, thus providing precedent for a bilateral negotiation to a pure \"cyber conflict.\" Though the agreement itself has flaws, the timing of the negotiation signals that MHS1 is not necessary and is better characterized by an MHS2. In addition, the MEO is a stronger and more necessary (if insufficient) component for achieving ripeness in cyber conflict.\nFuture research on the negotiation or mediation process may provide greater clarity on achieving more successful cyber agreements in the future. Likewise, examining the strategies of multilateral cyber negotiations and their impact on norms development would impact the nature of state-to-state cyber conflict. Such evolutions will necessitate further research as new capabilities and dynamics emerge. In the meantime, exploring other cyber conflicts, such as those between long-term rivals like the US-Russia, India-Pakistan, and North Korea-South Korea, may provide a prescriptive application of the adapted ripeness theory.\nThe application of ripeness theory, like conflict itself, is continually evolving. New technologies and conflict domains shape peace efforts and strategies in practical and academic application. In cyber conflict, adjusting the components of ripeness theory to include mutually harming standoffs and MEOs demonstrates how negotiation practices can shift to address emerging threats and realms of uncertainty that characterize new domains of conflict. Without this adjustment, cyber conflicts and other new realms for war, remain out of reach for resolution."

As the world becomes more interconnected through digital means, a potential \"fifth domain\" for conflict has emerged in the cyber realm , inviting scholars to debate the nature of cyber attacks, cyber espionage, and disinformation campaigns as \"cyber warfare\" . With the emergence of cyberwar as a key buzzword in political and academic spheres, the question of how to resolve cyber conflicts shifts the focus to negotiation theory.\nAnalysis of cyber conflict presents a challenge to the prevailing negotiation concept, ripeness theory. Ripeness theory posits that the timing of a negotiation stems from the conflicting parties' perception of a \"mutually hurting stalemate\" (MHS) and \"a way out\" of conflict through dialogue . While this theory has shown merit for negotiations related to conventional warfare or economic disputes, there are gaps in its applicability for resolving cyber conflict. Specifically, the concept of a \"hurting stalemate\" has little to no presence in cyber disputes, rendering MHS incompatible with pure cyber negotiations. As such, redefining mutually hurting stalemate for cyber conflict is paramount to address this discrepancy.\nThis analysis attempts to adapt prevailing negotiation theory for conflicts in the cyber domain. First, an overview of what constitutes cyber conflict is provided, the state of its norms and regulations, and the uncertain nature of cyberspace. Second, an analysis of ripeness theory in conventional and cyber conflict highlights the current gaps in negotiation literature when applied to an evolving form of conflict. Third, redefining the idea of MHS by suggesting an alternative, \"mutually harming standoff,\" offers an examination into the timing discrepancy surrounding cyberspace agreements. Lastly, examining the 2015 bilateral US-China Cybersecurity Agreement provides context for applying this hypothesis and demonstrates how accepted negotiation theory may be applied to cyber conflict.\n# Defining Cyber Conflict: Terms, Norms, and the Rise of Uncertainty\nThe definitions of \"cyber conflict\" or \"cyberwarfare\" are a source of contention throughout the international community. There is a lack of shared understanding for terms related to cyberspace, with some scholars arguing that the preoccupation with cyber warfare has little merit. While some governments, academics, and media outlets overemphasize the threat of a \"cyber Pearl Harbor,\" these warnings are more speculative and extreme than reality would suggest (Singer &amp; Friedman 2014: 68). If applying a Clausewitzian understanding of war, which emphasizes its violence, instrumental character, and political\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nPOLK\nnature, it appears that cyberwar has yet to occur, as no cyber attack has met these three criteria .\nRegardless of the debate on the reality of cyber warfare, the fact remains that cyberspace activities continue to shape and threaten geopolitical relations. Offensive cyber exchanges in the digital realm have exacerbated international tensions between technological powerhouses such as the United States, Russia, and China, and developing consensus on the broader idea of “cyber conflict” is pertinent to establishing a new approach to diplomacy on the issue of cyberspace. For this article, we will adopt a broad definition of “cyber conflict” to include information operations between two or more entities that intentionally undermine the economic, political, social, or security systems of states, businesses, and organizations. This definition incorporates such concepts as “cyber espionage,” “disinformation campaigns,” “cyber sabotage,” and “cyberterrorism,” representing tactics initiated or sponsored by states (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015).\nExamples of cyber conflict include the continuous use of cyber operations or the means through which states conduct cyber attacks against the same entity over time. These conflicts are reciprocal, characterized by tit-for-tat cyber exchanges between countries, and may also employ non-cyber means in an effort to deter future attacks, such as sanctions or public condemnation. Cyber conflict includes the use of advanced persistent threats (APTs) to spy on corporate activities or the development and deployment of malicious software to cause physical damage to infrastructure. Cyber operations may use an array of cyber weapons, from the application of botnets in distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks that shut down government websites to the creation of Trojans and backdoors, which infiltrate and sabotage computer networks (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 34). These parameters highlight the scope of the issues and features that shape cyber conflicts and the ambiguities surrounding their nature.\nConversely, this definition does not include small-scale “cybercrime,” which tends to be a for-profit enterprise that does not center on ideology or political gain (Singer &amp; Friedman 2014: 145–155). It also does not include attacks perpetrated by individuals or non-state-sponsored criminal organizations since these efforts more often constitute “cybercrime” and are one-off rogue actions intended to cause chaos or malice rather than achieve policy goals (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 33). Lastly, the article focuses on “pure” cyber conflict, thus dismissing incidences of cyber attacks as part of larger military campaigns or hybrid warfare. While negotiations on conventional conflicts may address concerns relating to cyberspace, kinetic wars are characterized differently from cyber conflicts, as discussed later in the article.\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8–36\nRIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\n# Cyber Norms and Consensus\nDisagreements over what constitutes cyber conflict impact the establishment of international norms for addressing cyber operations. Numerous arrangements have attempted to codify norms for regulating cyberspace and expanding international law to include the digital domain. The Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare is one effort to establish consensus on cyber conflict. This document, first published in 2013, attempts to apply existing international law to cyber conflicts while defining \"cyber attacks\" and \"cyber self-defense\" . However, the Tallinn Manual has no legal standing, and many countries have rejected the arguments it presents (Singer &amp; Friedman 2014: 206). As a result, binding consensus on how states should govern and regulate cyberspace remains indefinite and allows for multiple interpretations of what justifies an attack.\nOther efforts to establish norms in cyberspace involve international processes to develop standards of conduct in the cyber realm. Since 1998, motions to formulate cyber arms control treaties and propagate agreements on cyber governance have shaped international agendas . From intergovernmental institutions like the UN to think tank-led working groups, numerous negotiations and dialogues have been under way to improve the stability and security of cyberspace. These initiatives include ongoing fora such as the UN Group of Governmental Experts (UN GGE) and the UN Open-Ended Working Group (UN OEWG), both aimed at developing interstate cyber norms and applying international law to cyberspace . Other efforts include the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace, a coalition of cybersecurity experts that promotes specific cyber norms, and the Paris Call, a \"multistakeholder initiative led by the French government and supported by Microsoft,\" which seeks to mainstream cyber norms outside of interstate dialogues .\nThe credibility of their participants legitimizes these formats, whether it is the legitimacy of the UN process or the inclusivity of multiple stakeholders, such as businesses, think tanks, and non-profits, in building standards for cyberspace . However, Ruhl et al. note that these efforts are constrained due to four factors. For one, the evolving nature of cyberspace impedes the development of sustainable norms, and the presence of multiple actors with varying interests inhibits the regulation of norm adherence in cyberspace. Second, states' cyber activities are often secretive and unknown, thus obstructing the implementation of international standards for cyberspace. Third, disagreement between great powers on cyberspace norms can frustrate agreements. For example, Russian and Chinese demands for greater state sovereignty in cyberspace are countered by the US' assertion for free and\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nPOLK\nindependent Internet access. Fourth, weak incentives to adhere to cyberspace norms can reduce the impact and sustainability of international agreements. In contrast, \"states with significant cyber capabilities seem ready and willing to employ them to advance their interests,\" presenting an incentive for states to dismiss norms or limit their scope of adherence . Therefore, the multilateral fora for establishing cyberspace norms currently faces significant limitations in their effectiveness, generating a high level of uncertainty in the domain of cyberspace.\n## Uncertainty in the Digital Realm\nThe uncertain nature of cyberspace and norms creates difficulties for dispute resolution. Unlike conventional conflict, where risks, calculations, and capacities are known in an exercise of \"control power,\" cyber conflict occurs in a realm of uncertainty, potentiality, and improvisation (Katzenstein &amp; Seybert, 2018). The \"fog of uncertainty\" (Katzenstein &amp; Seybert 2018: 36) limits states' abilities to know how cyberspace will evolve, who the actors are, and what their capabilities may entail, thus preventing states from assessing the long-term ramifications of a cyber attack's impact. The nebulousness of cyberspace results not in deterrence but in restraint, which Valeriano and Maness (2015: 54) describe as a \"policy outcome but not necessarily a process\" for states' limited use of cyber tools. Therefore, this restraint is a consequence of the ambiguity and insecurity characterizing cyberspace, suggesting that certainties regarding states' intentions and cyber capabilities are unattainable, thereby reducing the risk of escalation in cyber conflict.\nEscalation represents an \"increase in the intensity of a conflict and in the severity of the tactics used in pursuing it\"  and is crucial to the perception of ripeness in conflict. However, states' restraint in using cyber tools impedes the prominence of both escalation and ripeness in cyber conflict, a discrepancy which will be addressed in the next section. The uncertainty of cyberspace and the limitations of cyber norms results in weak perceptions of states' digital activities. The vagueness of cyberspace is an impediment to determining what should be negotiated, let alone when negotiations should be conducted. Analyzing the concept of \"ripeness\" in cyber conflict will answer the question of when states should negotiate on matters of cyberspace.\n## Overview of Ripeness Theory\nAs previously stated, Zartman's \"ripeness theory\" presents a condition for the timing and beginning of negotiation (2001). Ripeness is a perceptual event that\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nRIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nstems from the belief in a Mutually Hurting Stalemate (MHS) or a Mutually Enticing Opportunity (MEO) . Zartman defines MHS as the moment when \"parties find themselves locked in a conflict from which they cannot escalate to victory and this deadlock is painful to both of them\" (2008). This deadlock may be depicted as a plateau, a stalemate where the costs of continuing the violence outweigh the benefits, with both parties suffering from the ongoing conflict. Similarly, a catastrophic event, or a precipice, may threaten or have influenced perceptions of the conflict and impart a stalemate. To quote Zartman (2001: 8), \"the catastrophe provides a deadline or a lesson indicating that pain can be sharply increased if something is not done about it now.\" Upon the perception of an MHS, both parties recognize that the probability of unilaterally winning the conflict is decreased, making the stalemate more foreboding.\nIn response to the perception of a stalemate, the conflicting parties may attempt to seize the moment by pursuing a \"way out\" of the conflict, sustained by an MEO , through negotiation. Zartman's theory is displayed in Figure 1, which demonstrates the push and pull factors that lead to the decision and commitment to negotiate.\nIt should be noted that ripeness is merely a condition for encouraging states to negotiate an end to the conflict, one that is \"necessary, but not sufficient\" . As such, the propensity for success in cyber negotiation is not guaranteed in seizing the ripe moment for dialogue. Analysis of ripeness theory's application in conventional and cyber conflict demonstrates how the concept of a stalemate leads (or does not lead) to the perception that the timing is suitable for negotiation as an alternative to continued fighting.\nFIGURE 1 Elements of conventional ripeness theory and the process of negotiation ADAPTED FROM ZARTMAN (2000: 230, 242)\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nPOLK\n# Ripeness and Conventional Conflict\nIn kinetic warfare, ripeness theory holds merit. Conventional conflict may be escalated and then plateaued, as defined by an MHS, thus presenting an opportunity for seeking a way out through negotiation. Zartman (2008) illustrates this by stating that \"to ripen a conflict one must raise the level of conflict until the stalemate is reached and then further until it begins to hurt – and even then, work toward a perception of an impending catastrophe as well.\" This captures the idea behind MHS – a perceived stalemate must be generated for both sides, with the parties incurring unsustainable or unbearable costs in the long run even when there is no prospect for further escalation. Brahm illustrates the role of MHS as a tipping point or push-factor towards negotiation by depicting conventional conflict as a cresting wave (see Figure 2). After the emergence of the conflict, continuous escalation of hostilities leads to or threatens an impending catastrophe, the precipice of the wave at which point an MHS has occurred . If the MHS is perceived, it may push the parties towards de-escalation and negotiation, and confidence-building measures and the perception of an MEO can pull the parties closer toward an agreement and the end of the conflict .\nIn conventional conflict, weaponry and strategic maneuvers are useful in this pursuit of a stalemate since conventional weaponry varies in scale, targeting, and scope of damage. For example, during the Bosnian War, NATO's use of cruise missiles and stealth planes in \"Operation Deliberate Force\" destroyed 338 Serbian targets. The Bosnian Serbs perceived the use of US Navy Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles (TLAMs) and F-117 bombers as a major escalation by\nFIGURE 2 Stages of conflict\nADAPTED FROM BRAHM (2003)\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nRIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nNATO , and this campaign helped to push the Serbs to return to the Dayton Accords in late 1995 . By employing weaponry or strategy, practitioners in conventional conflict are able to achieve a stalemate by escalating the hostilities on the ground. Therefore, the role of escalation is integral to achieving MHS since it results in perceptions “that there has been a significant qualitative change in the conflict as a result of the new development” . When both parties escalate to unattainable levels, the conventional conflict plateaus while the sides experience mutual hurt.\nThese conflicts are then considered ripe for negotiation, and the moment may be seized to initiate negotiations and resolve the conflict. Examples of ripeness theory in kinetic conflict have been perceived in the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah War, the Yugoslav Wars in the 1990s, and the Angolan Civil War (Schrodt, Yilmaz &amp; Gerner 2003; Touval 2002: 167; Zartman 2000). In these cases, military escalation of conflict or mediator-induced perceptions of MHS pushed parties to commit to dialogue processes . As such, ripeness theory has strong applicability in cases of conventional conflict.\n## Ripeness and Cyber Conflict\nIn contrast, cyber conflicts do not have the same characteristics as conventional warfare. Cyber operations are not inherently escalatory, and using cyber means to intensify a cyber conflict to the point of ripeness is improbable. For one, states view cyber operations as de facto “escalatory offramps,” or alternatives to costly kinetic conflict that still signal state displeasure or aim to influence rivals’ behavior (Jensen &amp; Valeriano 2019: 2). As such, decision-makers are often inclined to use cyber operations as an extension of foreign policy because they are not escalatory. If faced with increased tensions with rival governments, states have displayed a preference for choosing cyber responses as a form of “sub-crisis maneuvering” or exit from heightened conflict (Jensen &amp; Valeriano 2019: 4).\nA 2019 survey of US, Russian, and Israeli civilians further demonstrates this perspective that cyber conflict is non-escalatory. In this study, respondents in all three countries showed a general preference for non-escalatory responses to cyber attacks in scenarios where the victim state had the capacity to respond with an in-kind cyber weapon (Jensen &amp; Valeriano 2019: 6). Respondents from Russia voted in favor of de-escalatory responses to cyber attacks, while citizens from the US and Israel most often favored proportional responses to the initial attack (Jensen &amp; Valeriano 2019: 7). All three countries had low responses expressing a preference for escalation against a cyber attack. These findings express a tendency to view cyber conflict as a non-escalatory domain (Jensen\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nPOLK\n&amp; Valeriano 2019), thereby casting doubt on the notion that responses to cyber operations could result in an escalation between two parties.\nEven in the most severe cases of cyber attacks, such as disruptions of critical infrastructure, victim states have exhibited a preference for non-escalatory response rather than escalatory action. The real-world examples of the 2015 and 2016 attacks on Ukrainian power grids capture this. In these events, the BlackEnergy 3 and Crashoverride malware, respectively, targeted energy companies or transmission substations resulting in the disruption of electricity supply to nearby consumers. These attacks had limited impact, lasting between one to six hours before restoring full operations , reflecting the low-intensity, high-manageability of the attack. Yet, the most notable feature of these attacks concerns Ukraine's response. First, Ukraine and allied countries largely attributed both attacks to a hacking group connected to Russian intelligence services , but this has not been proven. This demonstrates an attribution problem that highlights the uncertainty typical of cyber attacks and prevents rapid, escalatory responses of any form. In other words, given the lack of certainty regarding the perpetrator of the cyber attack, decision-makers were impeded in their ability to execute timely and sufficient responses akin to escalation through either digital or kinetic means. Second, even when members of the Ukrainian government condemned Russia for the act, no offensive response, either kinetic or in-kind, was taken . These cases show that even cyber attacks impacting critical infrastructure have low-escalatory potential, a trait that is especially unique when linked to the ongoing geopolitical tensions that shape Russian-Ukrainian relations outside the digital realm. As such, cyber conflicts cannot easily demonstrate escalatory potential using digital means.\nFurthermore, Borghard and Lonergan (2019; 125-138) argue that cyber operations are \"poor tools of escalation\" for four reasons: they are time-consuming to develop, they have a limited impact on the victim state, states have countervailing tradeoffs in using cyber tools, and there are few appropriate cross-domain responses to cyber attacks. First, developing retaliatory cyber tools is time-consuming (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 125). In the event of a cyber attack, a state or institution may not have immediate access to the digital tools required to launch a counteroffensive. According to Borghard and Lonergan (2019: 125), \"offensive cyber operations deliver effects against targets through exploiting a vulnerability to gain access (through an attack vector) to a target's network or system.\" This backdoor access would need to be pre-installed and ready to act on for a timely counterattack to work; without this preset, any response would be time-consuming and miss the opportunity to escalate the conflict. If a conflicting entity did have access to these digital means for a cyber\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nRIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\noffensive, it would have to reconcile with concerns of attribution (Wohlfeld &amp; Jasper 2018). While kinetic conflicts have a clear direction and source of an attack, cyber conflicts are not always evident (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 30).\nThis leads to the second issue: the effects of cyber operations are limited (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 131). If a state responds to a cyber attack with a cyber offensive of its own, the nature of the response would likely be limited in its impact and only supply a temporary nuisance or network disruption (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 123). In extreme cases, cyber offensives may attack critical infrastructure or influence economics by disrupting trust in governments and corporations. Yet even in these instances, the effects of the initial and responding cyber attacks would be temporary and unsustainable (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 131), thus failing to escalate the conflict.\nMoreover, many cyber attacks have uncertain and unintended repercussions (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 41), thus rendering hasty responses ineffective in the long run. By lacking a pronounced intensification of the cyber conflict due to limitations on impact, parties cannot escalate the conflict to a stalemate under conventional mhs. In the same vein, it is imperative to acknowledge that uncertainty permits future technological advances that may result in cyber tools with sufficient cross-domain capabilities, more destructive effects, or greater severity in impact. Whenever these tools are invented, perhaps the face of cyber conflict will change, and cyber operations will possess greater escalatory potential. Nevertheless, until that day, the current nature of cyber conflict demonstrates low-cost and low-impact effects upon the victimized state. As such, it limits the effectiveness of responding attacks at escalating a cyber conflict through digital means.\nThe third impediment for cyber escalation is the existence of countervailing tradeoffs for cyber operations (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 133). Many states execute cyber operations against other entities to achieve the goals of sabotage, espionage, or subversion , all of which require secrecy to succeed (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 134). Since cyber tools are perceived as a more cost-effective and clandestine alternative to conventional warfare and espionage, political leaders are more likely to benefit from the continued development of cyber offense capabilities (Wohlfeld &amp; Jasper 2018). Consequently, states will be less willing to employ conspicuous, escalatory operations if it risks compromising their other large-scale operations (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 134). The risk comes from the potential that the attack is discovered since patches can be made that impede future access to the systems and data that governments aim to exploit. This reduces the likelihood that conflicting parties will perceive an incentive to escalate cyber disputes via a public response, especially if governments are pressured to justify their actions by revealing\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nPOLK\nthat the initial attack occurred. In doing so, states risk exposing their vulnerabilities or threatening their international standing. As a result, states may be less likely to escalate a cyber conflict, both within and outside the domain of cyberspace (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 134).\nLastly, Borghard and Lonergan claim that it is unlikely that states will respond to a cyber attack through kinetic or cross-domain means (2019: 137). Unlike conventional conflict, cyber attacks do not produce the same carnage, psychological pressure, or violence as kinetic attacks. Instead, questions about the proportionality of responding to a cyber incident with cross-domain capabilities limit the feasibility of justifying kinetic responses to cyber attacks (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 137). Historically there has never been any cross-domain response to a first strike cyber attack, and there are very few instances of a kinetic response being used to answer cyber attacks in hybrid conflict. The most notable kinetic attack is Israel's 2019 airstrike against Hamas. In this instance, Israel's response to Hamas' cyber activities against the government appears to demonstrate an immediate conflict escalation. Yet, this dispute took place in the context of an ongoing and kinetic conflict, thus disqualifying its label as a pure cyber conflict (Borghard &amp; Schneider 2019). With this in mind, it is evident that there are significant limitations to a cross-domain escalation of pure cyber conflict.\nStill, some counterarguments stress the possibility of cross-domain escalation in cyber conflict by suggesting that a state could interpret an initial cyber attack as an act of war and employ a kinetic response. Borghard and Lonergan (2019: 138) acknowledge that the perception of some cyber attacks as low-impact or low-cost may apply to only certain states and political ideologies. Once again, uncertainty is an essential feature as much of the concern surrounding escalation in cyber conflict centers on the threats posed by ambiguity in risk analysis and escalation management (Libicki &amp; Tkacheva 2020).\nWhen states are not certain of their rivals' assumptions about how domains are interconnected and what constitutes an act of war, it is plausible that the result could lead to unintended escalation of the conflict into conventional warfare. In this scenario, if a state were to respond promptly to a cyber attack with a kinetic operation, then conventional understandings of MHS would have relevance; after all, at this point the conflict would have crossed a threshold into the physical realm and would follow conventional rules of engagement and escalation management. At this point, a cyber conflict-turned-conventional would no longer apply to this study since the focus is primarily on \"pure\" cyber conflict with no cross-domain aspects.\nHowever, what about a hypothetical in which a state first makes a threat to escalate a cyber conflict into a conventional war? In this scenario, the\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nuncertainty aspect of cyberspace suggests that mhs might not necessarily hold relevance. The threat of cross-domain escalation is a form of deterrence, which has limited and ambiguous influence in cyber conflict and the digital domain. Sweijs and Zilincik (2021: 133) state that three criteria influence escalation management in cross-domain deterrence (cdd): attribution, credibility and threat proportionality, and signaling.\n##### Attribution\nAttribution of initial cyber attacks can be tedious, time-consuming, and inexact, leading to uncertainty in directing the threat at the appropriate target. This uncertainty risks international embarrassment, condemnation, or even tension if the threatening state incorrectly identifies a perpetrator or lacks evidence. As a result, the threat may not effectively escalate the conflict across domains since it may be easily dismissed. Furthermore, if a threat is directed at another state, accurately or not, the accused state would have little incentive to act upon standard mhs conceptualizations of ripeness and agree to negotiations. Once the accusation has been made, any response to a threat of kinetic escalation of a cyber conflict would require the accused to admit their cyber capabilities, thereby negating the serviceability of these digital tools and jeopardizing other cyber operations elsewhere in the world. As such, mhs would not necessarily hold relevance in scenarios where states rely on cross-domain escalation threats because uncertainty and attribution limits prevent states from utilizing effective cdd strategies.\n##### Credibility and threat proportionality\nRegarding credibility and threat proportionality, Sweijs and Zilincik (2021: 137) note that cdd is “complicated by the inherent disproportionality of responses across domains and instruments of power.” In this case, the relevance of mhs to threats of escalation is limited by the uncertain risk of how the international community and general population will perceive this intimidation. Despite the concern over states’ diverging definitions of what constitutes appropriate cross-domain escalation, there is consensus that violent responses to non-violent offensive measures will result in more immediate and severe consequences, which may receive public and international skepticism . As such, states may differ in their gauge of a threat’s credibility. This divergence weakens the case for mhs’ relevance to threats of escalation in cyber conflict since the ensuing uncertainty weakens the efficacy of the threat that domain spillover is plausible or justifiable.\n##### Signaling\nLastly, issues with signaling threats of cross-domain escalation reduce the applicability of mhs processes to cyber conflicts that could turn conventional. In the cyber domain, cross-domain signaling may be misinterpreted, with signals conducted through military means risking greater ambiguity about the signaler’s intentions to the target. As Sweijs and Zilincik (2021: 140)\nPOLK\nnote, \"a signal of resolve to respond to cyberattacks by moving platforms for the launch of conventional or nuclear weapons may be easily interpreted as a preparation for hostilities rather than as an adjustment of the deterrence posture.\" As a result, the target of the threat may view the cross-domain action as separate from the cyber conflict or as a general increase in tension outside of the digital realm. The risk of ambiguity in cross-domain signaling impedes MHS principles' efficacy in escalating the conflict since the action may appear detached from or external to the cyber conflict.\nWithout the capacity to escalate ongoing digital disputes, cyber conflicts present a challenge to conventional ripeness theory and do not offer states an incentive to seek a negotiated agreement. Parties' perceptions of a mutually hurting stalemate are more difficult to achieve because the long-term intensifying effects of cyber operations are often imperceptible, reiterating the dilemma of uncertainty in characterizing cyber conflict. Similarly, if a state were to threaten cross-domain spillover, the likelihood that the threat of escalation would serve as a sufficient push-factor towards negotiation is impeded by factors of uncertainty. As such, current ideas about timing and ripeness in cyber conflict remain elusive for cyberspace negotiations and require a reexamination of MHS to address this deviation.\n## Re-defining Mutually Hurting Stalemate\nAddressing the discrepancy between ripeness theory and cyber conflict requires a closer examination of the concept of mutually hurting stalemate. The perception of a stalemate is clearly critical in pushing conflicting parties towards negotiation. However, existing scholarship emphasizes that perception is built on mutual hurt and the threat (or existence) of unsustainable escalation. Since cyber weapons are not reliable tools of escalation and cyber operations present enticing tradeoffs for their continued use, mutual hurt and the threat of intensification are not attainable. As such, redefining the idea of a stalemate provides an alteration of ripeness theory for cyber conflicts.\nThis new definition addresses the main component of MHS: the hurting stalemate. The mutuality of MHS is not called into question since it is an essential aspect of any conflict. The reciprocal nature of conflict is inherent to the disagreement: all parties must be targets and initiators of cyber attacks for the cyber conflict to exist. Even where attribution issues exist, the mutual perception of a cyber attack from a rival is sufficient for the conflict to persist. Consequently, tit-for-tat cyber attacks are crucial in both the conflict and\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nRIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nnegotiation stages, and mutuality remains integral to encouraging parties to approach negotiation as a way out of cyber conflict.\nWhile the hurting stalemate is crucial to perceptions of ripe moments in conventional conflict, the phrase itself is incomplete in characterizing cyber conflict. The hurting stalemate is a painful deadlock characterized by a plateau, \"a flat and unending terrain without relief\" , unbearable to both parties. This concept is not wholly accurate for cyber conflict due to the limits of inflicting pain through cyber means and the low-intensity nature of cyber operations. For one, cyber tools, like conventional weaponry, are a means for achieving political objectives. In cyber conflict, each cyber operation, analyzed individually, aims (and often achieves) short-term goals such as gaining trade and military secrets, displaying cyber capabilities, or deterring activity. When combined to characterize cyber conflict, the long-term goals reveal themselves. The long-term objectives in cyber conflict show how the mutuality of hurt is limited since the operations themselves are limited in scope and impact. In fact, it is challenging to conceptualize cyber conflict as \"winnable,\" given that the impact of cyber operations is constrained and unlikely to debilitate the target. According to Valeriano and Maness (2015: 61), cyber operations are often innocuous and used primarily \"as methods of signaling displeasure or discord to a rival,\" a demonstration of the restraint used by states when engaging in cyberspace. Cyber weapons have limited applicability in their \"hurting\" capability even in more destructive incidences, such as the Stuxnet worm that destroyed Iranian nuclear centrifuges in Operation Olympic Games. Though intending to deter or delay Iran's nuclear weapons development, Operation Olympic Games ultimately bolstered Tehran's determination to restore and expand its nuclear research in Natanz .\nWith this limitation in mind, it is important to note that hurt from cyber conflict still exists. Targeted countries may experience damages or disruptions to their institutions and networks, impacting daily operations or economic mobility. Similarly, non-cyber responses to cyber operations, such as sanctions, condemnation, or other negative foreign policy measures, may inflict damages on the perceived initiator of an attack. Therefore, hurt is present in cyber conflict. However, there is a critical distinction between kinetic and cyber hurt: the hurt is not exhaustive in cyber conflict. Since cyber conflict is non-escalatory and used as a first-response or low-intensity method of engagement (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015), the hurt it inflicts on the target is not equal to the painful deadlock prescribed by conventional MHS. Instead, this hurt is perpetually sustainable, akin to Zartman's idea of \"the soft, stable, and self-serving stalemate\" (S5).\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nPOLK\nAccording to Zartman, the S5 is \"a low-level conflict, even when punctuated by occasional blips of violence\" that \"leaves each of the parties ... able to claim that it has not been defeated, which is a victory of sorts\" (2005a: 52). The S5 typically describes intractable conflicts in the kinetic domain, explaining the absence of ripeness in pushing the conflicting parties towards a negotiated solution . In conventional analysis, factors of protracted conflict, zero-sum identities, the profitability of continued fighting, mutually exclusive solutions, and deficient perceptions of ripeness contribute to intractability in kinetic conflict . However, these features are not all representative of cyber conflict.\nCyber operations are both the means and ends to accomplishing short-term goals, disrupting issues of protraction even if the conflict itself is perpetual. Furthermore, cyber conflicts often do not involve zero-sum identities unique to the dispute, although the cyber conflict may exacerbate pre-existing conflicts between states. Nevertheless, the issues of profitability, solution saliency, and ripeness are typical of cyber conflicts, which are defined by countervailing tradeoffs encouraging the perpetuation of the conflict (Borghard &amp; Lonergan 2019: 133), and diverging norms and interests hampering cyber agreements. As such, cyber conflicts share some features of intractable disputes, which are emblematic of S5. However, S5 is still insufficient for characterizing cyber conflict due to the uncertainty surrounding cyberspace and the unique nature of intractability in the digital realm.\nWith these limitations in mind, the standard perception of a hurting stalemate is improbable in cyber conflict, and a conventional ripe moment for negotiation would not be perceived. Instead, adjusting the criteria for a hurting stalemate reshapes the conditions for ripeness in cyber conflict. This new condition focuses on a \"mutually harming standoff,\" a condition on the spectrum between Zartman's theories of S5 and MHS that permits the lack of a hurting stalemate in cyber conflict.\n## Mutually Harming Standoff, Ripeness, and Cyber Negotiations\nA mutually harming standoff (which will be referred to as MHS2) is distinct from a mutually hurting stalemate (hereafter referred to as MHS1) since it emphasizes the perfunctory character of the pain and reciprocity in cyber conflict. The \"harm\" inflicted by cyber operations may have a negative impact on the targeted state, but it is not so unbearable that the state is incapable of persisting without a way out. In other words, the state is not pressed into seeking an alternative to the cyber conflict since the harm it experiences is not exhaustive. Furthermore, a \"standoff\" provides a better image than a stalemate. While the hurting stalemate represents unwinnable deadlocks that are\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8–36\nRIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\npainful to all parties , the standoff is more akin to an effectively manageable, if not perpetual and harmful, dispute with high reciprocity and low escalation capacity (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 129). This captures the nature of cyber conflict and adapts a critical component of ripeness theory.\nIf MHS2 characterizes long-term cyber conflict, when and how can it be perceived? More importantly, how can negotiators operationalize MHS2 to encourage cyber negotiations if a ripe moment is improbable in cyber conflict? Both questions are linked to another component of ripeness theory: mutually enticing opportunity (MEO). In Zartman's ripeness theory, perceptions of MHS1 are necessary, if insufficient, for encouraging parties to engage in dialogue as a way out of conventional conflict. This may be supplemented by perceptions of an MEO, which acts as the pull-factor for parties to engage in and continue negotiations . Zartman acknowledges that few cases of conventional conflict demonstrate the opening of negotiations due to perceptions of an MEO alone. However, these perceptions help encourage parties to commit to negotiations once they commence . Still, since conventional MHS1 does not exist in cyber conflict, realizing an MHS2 coupled with perceptions of an MEO can push rival cyber parties toward negotiations.\nFigure 3 presents an adaptation of the standard stages of the conflict arc for cyber disputes. In this depiction, MHS2 represents the state of the conflict from the time of emergence. This shows that without escalatory capacities, cyber conflicts are inherently defined by the perpetual reciprocity of cyber\nFIGURE 3 Stages of cyber conflict\nADAPTED FROM BRAHM (2003)\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nPOLK\nattacks between states, continuing the plateau indefinitely as conflict persists in a low intensity and restrained manner. To disrupt this, the perception of an MEO is necessary to act as the new push-factor for parties to enter and commit to negotiations.\nIn cyber conflict, the MEO can manifest in several ways. These incentives may appear at different thresholds of pain throughout the dispute and encourage states to consider negotiations under various circumstances. Like MHS1, MHS2 pain thresholds are perceptual, and thus MEO S will be subjective from case to case . Analyzing an array of MEO S showcases potential push-factor attributes unique to the nature of cyberspace that could encourage cyber conflict negotiation.\nNorms development collaboration. Like conventional conflicts, both parties may inherently view alternatives to victory that do not include tit-for-tat cyber exchanges. This may have limitations pending each party's goals in conducting cyber operations, but the opportunity to collaborate may displace the benefits of using digital tools against rivals. This collaboration leads to an impactful and enticing opportunity for negotiation: norms development. Given the standard of uncertainty in the cyber realm, states can attempt to shape the digital world in their image by collaborating to bilaterally develop and diffuse norms that meet their interests on a global scale. In other words, by leveraging the perception that normative interests are more far-reaching and achievable through bilateral collaboration, negotiators may be more successful in pushing conflicting parties to the table to coordinate on broader issues that both address and extend beyond the ongoing conflict.\nThe MEO for norms development collaboration is especially pertinent in cyber conflicts where the targets are primarily private and government non-military infrastructure. This represents one threshold for pain on the lattice of MHS2 ripeness; when attacks are apparent and far-reaching in their impact on the public, states are more likely to respond negatively (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 125). This is because many states view public interference in cyberspace as \"crossing a line\" in the digital realm, despite the lack of norms or agreements dictating this taboo (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015). Conversely, in cyber conflicts where attacks primarily target political and military networks, \"victim\" states are less likely to react with a negative or conflict-prone response (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 123-124). This suggests that cyber conflicts which focus on traditional government-to-government attacks, including infiltrations and intrusions through Trojans and APTs, are likely to present the norm for cyber conflict (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015). On the other hand, DDoS attacks are more obvious in their display of aggression since they interfere with public websites and systems, and states are more likely to respond negatively to the attack due to pressure from the public impacted by the incident.\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nRIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nCyber conflicts that reach MHS2 thresholds, in which public infrastructure is the primary target, can present an MEO for parties to meet to recalibrate norms for cyberspace conduct. For example, suppose the cyber conflict is characterized by long-run DDoS attacks or infiltrations targeting non-military private and government networks. In that case, participants may use these perceived violations as an opportunity to collaborate and bilaterally promote norms in cyber conflict that benefit both parties. In other words, while perpetuating the tit-for-tat cycle of the cyber conflict is a non-escalatory option, continued DDoS attacks may present reasonable grounds for decision-makers to examine alternatives to the conflict, thereby seeking innovative solutions for a way out of MHS2. Furthermore, considering the absence of concrete norms in cyberspace, parties may view the chance to negotiate and act as norm-makers as a mutually enticing opportunity.\nProtean power. In addition to norms development collaboration, the opportunity for states to demonstrate \"protean power\" is an enticing opportunity for decision-makers to choose negotiation in cyber conflict. This form of power, coined by Katzenstein and Seybert in 2018, counters the aforementioned \"control power\" and acknowledges the importance of creativity and innovation in decision-making when facing increasingly uncertain international dynamics. Due to the uncertain nature of cyberspace, successful navigation and utility of the digital realm require states to remain innovative, flexible, and agile in responding to rapid changes in technology or when dealing with crises where assurances in risk analyses are limited. As such, the negotiating table is the ideal medium for states to gain and exhibit protean power since the choice to negotiate in cyber conflict is a strategic, albeit inventive and pioneering option that may result in relative gains for both states.\nMoreover, states will likely view the display of protean power as a complement or, in some cases, substitute to other conventional understandings of power dynamics, such as hard power. As Katzenstein and Seybert (2018: 25) put it, \"the world is well stocked with low-probability events such as the sudden appearance of terrorist organizations operating on a global scale and waves of large-scale human migration.\" Therefore, displaying creative prowess in the face of ambiguity, instability, and uncertainty is vital for actors \"to derive relative advantage from unexpected challenges\" (Katzenstein &amp; Seybert 2018: 25). In cyber conflict, states that choose to negotiate over a continuation of tit-for-tat exchanges that prolong the status quo of MHS2 are more likely to be perceived as adaptable and inventive in responding to uncertainty surrounding the nature of cyberspace and geopolitics in this domain. Consequently, states that choose negotiation in cyber conflict have a stronger capacity for protean power, making them more durable and influential in handling increasingly complex dynamics in world politics.\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nPOLK\nSmall state influence. Similarly, small states may be uniquely positioned to act on a push-factor MEO in cyber conflict since the newness of the domain presents opportunities for gaining leverage in the international arena. Following the benefits of protean power, the opportunity to demonstrate influence over rival states through innovation and improvisation in cyber conflict management incentivizes smaller states to push for negotiation as a means of alleviating tensions. This then acts as a push-factor MEO for smaller states seeking greater power in the international arena at large, especially since the democratic layout of cyberspace allows for ease of entry to new actors. In turn, larger states may be incentivized to negotiate in cyber conflict to further extend their influence in the digital realm, as well as the physical one.\nCross-conflict negotiation leverage. Finally, rival states with ongoing non-cyber tensions may be incentivized to negotiate as an avenue for leverage in other conflict domains. In other words, states with ongoing geopolitical tensions, such as the US and Russia, Japan and South Korea, or India and Pakistan, may be able to bargain agreements made in cyberspace with concessions in other negotiations or settlements. This also presents another scenario in which pain thresholds may be achieved in MHS2. Cyber conflicts that persist alongside other tensions or conflicts will prompt heightened sensitivities and feelings of annoyance between rivals. Yet, the digital realm remains the ideal medium for achieving cooperation or relative gains between rivals despite this distrust. The cyber domain provides an opportunity for norms development, an exhibition of power, and leverage in other conflict settlements. Thus, cyber conflicts between historic rival states are likely to perceive the status quo as a threshold of pain that makes an MEO for cooperation in the digital world appealing. Moreover, if the rivals perceive an opportunity to achieve non-cyber gains through cyber conflict negotiations, the parties already in conflict may consider this a push-factor MEO in cyberspace.\nThis MEO is well-suited for states engaged in regional conflict, a feature that Valeriano and Maness (2105: 81) note as being one of the most common fora for cyber conflict. For example, Japan and South Korea have deep-seated hostilities, ranging from disagreements over maritime control to enmities founded on the Korean peninsula's history of Japanese occupation. Many cyber-attacks between the two countries reflect these tensions, with both countries engaging in tit-for-tat exchanges between 2001 and 2011 (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 88). Interestingly, Japanese decision-makers often choose \"more cooperative interactions with their regional rivals\" despite ongoing cyber conflicts, suggesting a desire not to escalate tensions with nearby states (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 123). It follows, then, that regional rivals may have an MEO to use cyberspace as a platform for negotiation to influence overall tensions since the alternative is maintaining the status quo and perpetuating ongoing hostilities.\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nRIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nLastly, rivals may be incentivized to negotiate cyber conflict since they could gain greater international influence where their interests align. Again, Japan and South Korea exemplify this. Since both states are closely aligned with US interests (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 216), agreements between the two, especially those that impact both the cyber and physical domains, may strengthen their standing with the US and against larger rivals like China. As such, this opportunity for both mutual and relative gains acts as a push-factor for entrenched rival states to pursue cyber conflict negotiation.\nIn sum, conventional ripeness theory is limited in cyber conflict since mutually hurting stalemates (MHS1) are unattainable in cyberspace. Instead, a mutually harming standoff (MHS2) is more characteristic of the state of tit-for-tat cyber conflicts, where parties experience adverse effects from reciprocal attacks, but not at an unsustainable level. When long-term cyber conflict is recognized as an MHS2, specific attributes of the attacks may be operationalized to enact a push-factor MEO that encourages the parties to negotiate. These MEOs may hinge on the opportunity for cyber combatants to act as norm-makers by pursuing bilateral agreements that resolve the conflict and improve conduct in cyberspace or may focus on displays of protean power as small states or historic rivals. To represent this process, Figure 4 illustrates an adaptation of Zartman's conventional ripeness theory and negotiation progression to denote the push and pull aspects of MHS2 in cyber conflict. Here, MHS2 is presented\nFIGURE 4 Elements of Mutually Harming Standoff (MHS2) and the process of negotiation\nADAPTED FROM ZARTMAN (2000: 230, 242)\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nPOLK\nas the state of the conflict, while the push-factor MEO is a dependent variable requiring both parties' perception. Only after this perception is operationalized will the parties pursue negotiation as a way out of cyber conflict.\n## 2015 US-China Cybersecurity Agreement\nThe 2015 US-China Cybersecurity Agreement illustrates how MHS2 and MEO push-factors adapt the concept of timing in cyber conflict negotiations. These negotiations produced a cybersecurity agreement that established a precedent for defining economically motivated cyber espionage (EMCE) (Harold, Libicki, &amp; Stuth Cevallos 2016: 46). This demonstrates that norm-making is an attractive prospect for cyber negotiations following an MHS2, especially due to the uncertain and nebulous environment which characterizes cyberspace. The US-China agreement also showcases the limitations of applying current ripeness theory models to a bilateral cyber conflict. An overview of the US-China cyber conflict and its corresponding negotiations demonstrates how ripeness theory can be adjusted in cyber conflict to determine the timing of cyber negotiations.\n## Background: US-China Cyber Conflict\nThe US-China cyber conflict roughly began in 2003 and has predominately consisted of cyber espionage operations between the two countries (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 91–92). This characterization is key to the perpetuity of the conflict, and it is essential to examine both countries' stances on cyberspace and the rulebook by which they operate. First, the United States extends its values regarding individual freedoms and independence to the cyber realm (Brown &amp; Yung 2017a). The US government emphasizes online freedom of expression, liberal information flows, and data privacy in its national cybersecurity policies, and uses these values as the basis for which it evaluates foreign attacks on US networks (Brown &amp; Yung 2017a; Segal 2015). This is especially true for cyber espionage. According to Brown and Yung (2017a), the US makes distinctions between forms of espionage based on their objective, stating that \"in the US view, as long as such operations collect information about economic and financial matters for the purpose of benefiting national security, they are routine intelligence work.\" In this case, corporate espionage for the economic benefit of private companies is considered off-limits.\nChina also applies its political ideologies to cyberspace operations, and these values contradict the United States. At the forefront of China's cybersecurity strategy is the idea of Internet sovereignty, a norm shared by other\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nRIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\ngovernments to promote state control over networks within their territory (Brown &amp; Yung 2017b). The Chinese government advocates for states to set their own rules regarding cyberspace and pursues digital independence from the US, which owns most of the world's IP addresses and has been heavy-handed in Internet governance (Brown &amp; Yung 2017b; Singer &amp; Friedman 2014: 140; Levite &amp; Jinghua 2019). Furthermore, China rejects the militarization of cyberspace, accusing the US of securitizing the digital domain and aggressively developing \"cyber arms\" in response to activities by perceived rivals like Russia and China (Brown &amp; Yung 2017b).\nIt is this argument that is crucial to China's cyber operations. In China's view, the US' aggressive pursuit of offensive cyber capabilities necessitates China's cyber development (Brown &amp; Yung 2017a; Singer &amp; Friedman 2014: 140). Additionally, China's stance on cyber espionage makes no distinction between operations pursuing an economic advantage versus a national security advantage . Instead, China \"views economic competition as a way to achieve peer status with the US and sees cyberspace as an asymmetric instrument which it can successfully use to compete with the United States\" (Brown &amp; Yung 2017a). Thus, the Chinese agenda pursues cyber espionage for economic advantage as \"a quasi-legitimate way to achieve a North-South redistribution of wealth\" . China's cyber policies aim to level the imbalance between the West and China and promote norms of self-determination in cyberspace.\nIn the US-China cyber conflict, various cyber weapons were used. Between 2003 and 2006, the Titan Rain attack employed Trojans, or unauthorized software that permits access to a system or program, to infiltrate US government and contracting networks such as the State Department and Lockheed Martin (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 34; Rid 2012: 20). This attack was attributed to the Chinese government, as was the 2006 intrusion by the APT \"Shady RAT,\" which stole secret information related to negotiation strategies, manufacturing design plans, and US national security policies (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 91; Singer &amp; Friedman 2014: 92). The international hack by GhostNet, which lasted from 2007 to 2009, utilized phishing scams to acquire access to computer microphones and cameras, allowing hackers to record conversations by State Department and Pentagon officials (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 131). This, along with other long-run intrusions and thefts, was again attributed to the Chinese government.\nIn response, US agencies retaliated against Chinese institutions by employing defensive cyber attacks. Operation Cisco Raider lasted from 2006 to 2010 and attempted to counter the distribution of counterfeit Cisco technology stolen in a Chinese hack (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 91). Another operation,\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nPOLK\nBuckshot Yankee, responded against a hack of US defense networks (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 91). Finally, the long-term operation, Shotgiant, aimed to link the Chinese telecommunications firm, Huawei, to the People's Liberation Army (Valeriano &amp; Maness 2015: 91; Sanger &amp; Perlroth 2014; Sanger 2018). This operation also endeavored to \"exploit Huawei's technology so that when the company sold equipment to other countries ... the NSA could roam through their computer and telephone networks to conduct surveillance and, if ordered by the president, offensive cyberoperations\" (Sanger &amp; Perlroth 2014). As such, the US-China cyber conflict included exchanges of offensive and retaliatory operations between the two nations to combat diverging normative values regarding espionage.\n## Cyber Negotiations\nThroughout the cyber conflict, US-China tensions never escalated to kinetic force. Instead, the conflict remained tit-for-tat, with both governments suffering from espionage that notably affected both military and non-military private and government entities. Due to the dispute's long-term, low intensity, and restrained nature, the US-China cyber conflict gradually developed into an MHS2.\nThe MHS2 permitted both governments to continue with their cyber attacks. However, in 2009 they began to engage in Track Two diplomatic talks between the US think-tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) and China's Institute of Contemporary International Relations (CICIR) . What pushed the countries towards informal dialogue? According to one Chinese official, dialogue is a better alternative to perpetual conflict because both countries are capable of continued operations but would be better served by negotiating to settle their disagreements (Singer &amp; Friedman 2014). This represents the push-factor MEO, which promotes dialogue for norms establishment between two cyber rivals.\nThe Track Two talks further reflect the impact of MEOs for norm diffusion, with the first of these informal dialogues beginning in December 2009. Early dialogues focused on addressing both states' concerns about cyber sovereignty, cyberspace norms, multilateralism in addressing cybercrime, and confidence-building in cyberspace . These informal dialogues continued in addition to Track 1.5 discussions and alternated between Washington, DC and Beijing throughout the process. Eventually, discussions regarding cyber espionage and what it constitutes emerged alongside the issues of cyber sovereignty, governance, and US primacy in cyberspace (Harold, Libicki &amp; Stuth Cevallos 2016). It should be noted that these dialogues were \"were marked more by continuity than change,\" with participants on both sides maintaining their stances\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nRIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\non definitions of terms and values (Harold, Libicki &amp; Stuth Cevallos 2016: 49). Yet the governments' willingness to meet to discuss their stances in the cyber conflict signals an interesting push for a resolution in cyber conflict, without the need of a hurting stalemate.\nThese dialogues continued in a Track Two and Track 1.5 capacity, and by 2013, Track One negotiations commenced. However, these talks were interrupted in 2014 after the US indicted five People's Liberation Army officials with cyber espionage charges (Harold, Libicki &amp; Stuth Cevallos 2016; Brown &amp; Yung 2017a). The indictment asserted that members of the Chinese military stole trade secrets from US industries to bolster China's competitiveness in the international market. In response, the Chinese government walked away from the negotiations and asserted that the US accusations were hypocritical in light of the 2013 NSA leaks (Brown &amp; Yung 2017a). However, the talks resumed the following summer, and in September 2015, US President Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping released a statement on a new Cybersecurity Agreement (Harold, Libicki &amp; Stuth Cevallos 2016). The two governments agreed to improve coordination in investigating and preventing cybercrime, not conduct or support cyber intellectual property theft, and improve cooperation in promoting international norms in cyberspace .\nThe 2015 Agreement achieved both mixed results and mixed reactions. Though some scholars believe that China's agreement on the existence of economically motivated cyber espionage (EMCE) is an incremental step in reducing cyber intellectual property theft, few believe it has since decreased (Brown &amp; Yung 2017c). There has been continued concern about the quality of the agreement and China's adherence to the terms (Brown &amp; Yung 2017c). While the negotiators were able to successfully agree on cyber-specific definitions of EMCE, a significant achievement in cyber norm development, gaps in the agreement have allowed both countries to exploit technicalities in the agreement. For example, though reports suggest a decrease in Chinese economic espionage, it appears that \"Chinese operators are going after technologies that are dual-use [such as telecommunications industries], and so might not be covered by the agreements\" . Similarly, the US espionage operations against Huawei have persisted, with non-cyber sanctions and indictments attacking company leadership due to the recent dispute over 5G, surveillance, and data privacy .\n## Analysis\nDespite the weaknesses of the US-China Cybersecurity Agreement, the existence of the cyber negotiations sets a unique precedent regarding the timing of bilateral dialogues in cyber conflict. The concepts of MHS2 and push-factor\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nmeo demonstrate how ripeness can be determined within cyber disputes, thus adapting Zartman's original theory to a new domain of conflict. Reviewing the conditions of ripeness in the US-China cyber conflict helps capture the applicability of mhs2 and meo in cyber conflict.\nThroughout the US-China cyber dispute, long-term operations and attacks generated an entrenched and enduring conflict between two cyber rivals. The use of intrusive cyber weapons to conduct espionage on non-military targets prompted the exchange of attacks, and the diverging perspectives on cyber and espionage norms deepened the tensions between the two countries. In this case, the conflict's perpetuity embodied an mhs2, with both countries receiving damages in their economic and political security due to cyber and non-cyber retaliations. Even so, both countries were caught in a standoff rather than a stalemate since these damages were not exhaustive, permanent, or fatigue-inducing. In fact, both countries focused on long-term cyber weaponry, like apts and Trojans, to conduct lengthy operations that were sustainable regardless of the harm dealt to each government in response.\nWith this perpetual-while-manageable standoff reached, both countries continued to conduct their cyber operations against one another. Nevertheless, the opportunity to collaborate on norms development was the meo that pushed both governments towards negotiation. This was first captured and operationalized at the informal level. Through the Track Two dialogues, the US and Chinese think tanks provided a platform for sharing and understanding each other's values and perspectives of cyberspace and security. This informal communication linked the two governments, regardless of the conflict's perpetuity, and provided the opportunity for cooperation in norm-making and diffusion. This was especially enticing considering that the UN Group of Governmental Experts (UN gge) on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace has convened multiple times throughout the US-China conflict to establish international norms in cyberspace (gip Digital Watch Observatory 2021). If the US and China could bilaterally collaborate on cyberspace norms, their influence in international norm-making would be especially prominent and allow both countries to demonstrate their protean power in a new and uncertain domain.\nTrack 1.5 and Track One dialogues between the two governments further demonstrate this dedication to coordination in resolving the cyber conflict while establishing rules for conduct in cyberspace. Though the ultimate agreement may have failed in effectively instituting these norms, the fact that understanding was reached on the definition of emce is significant. The US and China's commitment to establishing norms in cyberspace to resolve the cyber conflict is therefore an important example of cyber negotiations. Future\nRIPENESS THEORY IN THE DIGITAL AGE\n\n# Conclusion\nThe emergence of new technologies undoubtedly impacts geopolitical conduct between states and influences rivalries old and new as a domain for conflict. Cyber conflict, regardless of its potential to supplant conventional warfare, has surfaced as a new source of tension between states, one that is ill-defined and difficult to regulate. As such, developing capacities for resolving cyber conflict requires new approaches to negotiation and mediation, and revisiting ripeness theory allows scholars and practitioners to adapt prevailing negotiation strategies to new realms of conflict.\nDue to the nature of cyber conflict, conventional ideas of ripeness theory are inadequate for deciding when to begin cyber negotiations. Limitations in escalation, the perception of cyber operations as \"escalatory offramps,\" countervailing tradeoffs in the use of cyber tools, and the first-use character of cyber weapons prevent states from perceiving mutually hurting stalemates in tit-for-tat cyber conflict. Therefore, modifying the definition of a hurting stalemate better captures the nature of cyber conflict and offers an alternative for timing negotiations. \"Mutually harming standoff\" is more emblematic of the plateau in cyber conflict since both states may feel the consequences of the conflict, but to a manageable and sustainable degree. When long-term cyber conflict is reached, an MHS2 has taken effect, and combining it with the component of mutually enticing opportunity will push actors towards cyber negotiations.\nThe MEO, while operating as a pull-factor in kinetic conflict, serves a more significant role in propelling conflicting parties toward negotiations because cyberspace provides incentives for collaboration over conflict. Though vested with the capacity for continued cyber conflict, rival states may perceive the opportunities to collaborate on norms development, exercise protean power, or gain leverage in external conflicts as ideal for promoting their agendas on cyberspace bilaterally. This is captured by the case of the US-China Cybersecurity Agreement.\nIn this instance, the reciprocal cyber conflict between the US and China was characterized by an MHS2. Nonetheless, the governments seized the opportunity to engage in norm-making through dialogue instead of unilaterally trying to \"win\" in cyber conflict. These negotiations evolved from informal Track Two discussions to Track One negotiation and agreement between American and\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION 28 (2023) 8-36\nPOLK\nChinese leadership, thus providing precedent for a bilateral negotiation to a pure \"cyber conflict.\" Though the agreement itself has flaws, the timing of the negotiation signals that MHS1 is not necessary and is better characterized by an MHS2. In addition, the MEO is a stronger and more necessary (if insufficient) component for achieving ripeness in cyber conflict.\nFuture research on the negotiation or mediation process may provide greater clarity on achieving more successful cyber agreements in the future. Likewise, examining the strategies of multilateral cyber negotiations and their impact on norms development would impact the nature of state-to-state cyber conflict. Such evolutions will necessitate further research as new capabilities and dynamics emerge. In the meantime, exploring other cyber conflicts, such as those between long-term rivals like the US-Russia, India-Pakistan, and North Korea-South Korea, may provide a prescriptive application of the adapted ripeness theory.\nThe application of ripeness theory, like conflict itself, is continually evolving. New technologies and conflict domains shape peace efforts and strategies in practical and academic application. In cyber conflict, adjusting the components of ripeness theory to include mutually harming standoffs and MEOs demonstrates how negotiation practices can shift to address emerging threats and realms of uncertainty that characterize new domains of conflict. Without this adjustment, cyber conflicts and other new realms for war, remain out of reach for resolution."

    "abstract": "When are cyber conflicts ripe for negotiation? Analysis of cyber conflict presents a challenge to the prevailing negotiation concept, Zartman's ripeness theory. Ripeness theory posits that the timing of a negotiation stems from the conflicting parties' perception of a \"mutually hurting stalemate\" (MHS) and \"a way out\" of conflict through dialogue. While this theory has shown merit for negotiations related to conventional warfare or economic disputes, there are gaps in its applicability for resolving cyber conflict. Specifically, the concept of a \"hurting stalemate\" has little to no presence in cyber disputes, rendering MHS incompatible with pure cyber negotiations. As such, redefining mutually hurting stalemate for cyber conflict is paramount to address this discrepancy. Examining the 2015 bilateral US-China Cybersecurity Agreement provides a context for applying our hypothesis and demonstrates how accepted negotiation theory may be applied to cyber conflict.",
