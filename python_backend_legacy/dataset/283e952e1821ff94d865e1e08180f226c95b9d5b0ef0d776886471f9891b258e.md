Elisabeth Braw and Gary Brown argue that adversary governments' practice of hiding behind proxies makes response and thus deterrence extraordinarily difficult. As a deterrence strategy adding to the existing deterrence directed against hostile actors, they propose 'personalised deterrence', with governments of targeted countries communicating directly to individual cyber attackers their intent to hold them personally responsible through denial of benefits and use of criminal law.\nThomas Fanning, CEO of Southern Company, the second-largest utility holding company in the US, spoke for many business leaders when, in summer 2018, he explained a source of frustration, saying: 'I can't fight back.' What Fanning would like is the chance to fight back against cyber attacks, a menace not just for utilities, but for governments and most companies in strategic sectors as well. Indeed, the majority of companies are targeted by cyber attacks. According to the UK government's 2019 Cyber Security Breaches Survey, 61% of large UK companies experienced cyber breaches or attacks in 2019. In summer 2017, NotPetya – a virus created by the Russian government-linked Sandworm hacker collective – disabled several multinational companies including Maersk, the Danish shipping firm, and the US pharmaceutical company Merck. Government agencies and other institutions are also attacked. For instance, Sweden's signals intelligence agency, FRA, estimates that there are more than 10,000 cyber attacks by hostile states or their proxies against targets in Sweden each month.\nThe real number is, as the FRA admits, likely to be far higher. For example, in May 2019, Deutsche Telekom's honeypot system was targeted by an average of 26 million attacks per day. By January 2020, the number had risen to an average of 42 million attacks per day, with many of the attacks stemming from states. It is a truism for cyber security specialists that there are only two kinds of businesses: those who know they have been hacked and those who do not. Deterring cyber attacks is\n1.

In this article, the term is used to mean cyber operations – including cyber-enabled information operations – intended to cause injury to people, damage or significantly disrupt computer systems, or manipulate information for strategic gain. The focus here is on advanced persistent threats (APTs), which are incidents of cyber aggression at a level of sophistication and scope that can only be achieved by states, and so are understood to be state-sponsored.\nThomas Schelling, a key deterrence theorist, defined deterrence as part of the diplomacy of\nviolence, the 'art of coercion and intimidation. It is about credibly signalling the power to hurt and inflict pain on a potential adversary' without resorting to an actual use of force. By this definition, deterrence of state-directed cyber aggression has been ineffective. This is not surprising, because the implementation of deterrence in cyberspace is extremely challenging.\nWhile targeted states could respond kinetically, the least escalatory response involves the use of cyberspace capabilities in return. This requires an effective cyberspace counterstrike capability, a willingness to use it and a public announcement of both. Each of these three steps presents a challenge.\nDeveloping and maintaining an arsenal of cyber capabilities, the first step, is difficult. Unlike other strategic capabilities, such as tanks and aircraft carriers, cyber tools are fragile in that they rely on stealth and the exploitation of unknown system vulnerabilities to work. From the moment they are used, they might be exposed to the adversary and, in many cases, easily mitigated or defeated. In addition,\nDOI: 10.1080/03071847.2020.1740493\nPersonalised Deterrence of Cyber Aggression\nthe access to adversaries' systems required to make use of cyber capabilities is fleeting. An intruder might be discovered or shut down by vigilant network administrators, or even normal system maintenance. Even if they are not employed, cyber capabilities lose effectiveness over time and eventually become obsolete, as hardware and software generations are developed and fielded.\nGovernments can take a number of actions against individual hackers to create costs that might dissuade them from engaging in cyber aggression\nEven when an appropriate counterstrike capability is available, the second step of deterrence – willingness to use – can be a hurdle. Discovered cyber capabilities can be repurposed for use by the target or by other bad actors to whom they might offer it. States must weigh the short-term benefit of using an effective cyber tool to respond against the long-term damage that might result should the capability be released into the wild.[10]\nPublic statements about cyber capabilities and the willingness to use them, the third step of effective deterrence, have proven just as difficult as the first two. Governments have generally been reluctant to discuss whether they engage in offensive cyber operations. However, the tide may have turned. The US Department of Defense's 2018 Cyber Strategy states that the US 'will accelerate the development of cyber capabilities for both warfighting and countering malicious cyber actors ... fielding capabilities that are scalable, adaptable, and diverse to provide maximum flexibility'.[11] The document goes on to note that the US military 'will be capable of employing cyberspace operations\nthroughout the spectrum of conflict, from day-to-day operations to wartime, in order to advance U.S. interests.[12] This is part of the US strategy of 'defending forward', perhaps the clearest cyber deterrence effort to date.\nThe UK also acknowledges its offensive cyber capabilities. 'We have the means to take offensive action in cyberspace, should we choose to do so', the UK government noted in the National Cyber Security Strategy 2016-2021.[13] In September 2018, GCHQ and the UK Ministry of Defence announced the creation of a 2,000-member offensive cyber force, which will consist of military personnel, GCHQ officials and private contractors.[14]\n# Challenges and Strategies\nAcknowledging the possession of cyber capabilities and expressing a general willingness to use them is only the first set of steps towards developing an effective deterrent. To complete the strategy, states should establish – for themselves, their allies and their adversaries – the specific circumstances under which they might employ cyber capabilities. Unfortunately, such specificity creates problems of its own. For example, setting out precisely when it would respond – ‘red lines’ – can limit a state’s response options. Clear pronouncements also inform adversaries about precisely how far they may safely push cyber aggression and may disclose more than is prudent about systems that might be particularly valuable or vulnerable.\nThe mechanics of deterrence-driven cyber actions are also complicated by the well-known 'attribution problem'.[15] States must have some level of certainty about the sponsor of cyber aggression to be able to respond confidently. It can be extremely difficult to collect and analyse enough technical proof of responsibility for a cyber incident to convince an international audience. Competent hackers use a number of techniques to obfuscate\n© RUSI Journal March 2020\nBraw and Brown\ntheir connection to the incident. Additionally, states are often unwilling to publicly release all the information they have about cyber incidents as they may have obtained it from a number of intelligence sources that they are unwilling to compromise. Further complicating the situation, cyber responses are sometimes most technically feasible in so-called 'neutral cyberspace' (such as on servers physically located in non-belligerent states). In itself, this action has the potential to be escalatory.\nPartly to avoid such escalation, some governments have engaged in a type of naming-and-shaming deterrence. These public campaigns are often directed against government sponsors of cyber attacks. Following the 2017 WannaCry 2.0 malware attack, which hit approximately 300,000 computers in 150 countries, a White House official blamed the North Korean regime, arguing that it must be held accountable.[16] Such naming and shaming has, however, proven to be of limited use. Effective shaming of a government requires convincing evidence that it is responsible for an aggressive cyber incident, and that level of certainty often requires states to reveal classified sources or methods that may be of continuing value if kept secret.[17] Even if the source can be safely disclosed, the attribution process often involves a time-consuming investigation into a complex web of contacts. These challenges mean that public statements are likely to be delayed, lessening the effectiveness of the technique. Regardless, named-and-shamed governments may not be susceptible to reputational damage. Compilations such as the Centre for Strategic and International Studies' Significant Cyber Incidents database list the same state sponsors year after year.[18]\nFinally, cyber attacks are frequently perpetrated by individuals or groups only informally or loosely sponsored by states.[19] Sponsoring governments create distance between themselves and their proxies, either by concealing official trails or dealing in informal agreements with non-state groups. Cyber criminals, for example, have been more than willing to work to advance state interests in\nreturn for money or political favour. This provides sponsoring states with plausible deniability on the international stage. The stakes are high when fighting fire with fire, and it would be destabilising to respond to a perceived state aggressor if they had no hand in the original activity.\nGiven these realities, this article proposes that, rather than trying to affect other states directly, governments should direct their deterrent efforts at individual perpetrators operating at the APT level, regardless of whether their sponsorship can be established in a definitive fashion.\nGovernments can take a number of actions against individual hackers to create costs that might dissuade them from engaging in cyber aggression. Examples of these costs are set out below and range from travel bans to financial penalties to criminal prosecution. The authors call this 'personalised deterrence'.\n## Personalised Deterrence\nPersonalised deterrence focuses on what individual hackers or attackers are most likely to value, and bases deterrence on that individual cost–benefit analysis. While individually deterring cyber attackers is time consuming, it gives the deterring state a wider range of tools – for example, in the areas of reputation and personal mobility – than those available for use against states. By focusing on the individual, the deterring state also alters the required level of attribution and proof from the current near-100% certainty model used to link attacks to hostile governments, to the beyond-reasonable-doubt model used in the criminal justice system.[20] This would have significant consequences, most of them helpful to liberal democracies.\nAs Timothy M McKenzie notes:\nThe deterrent declaration (or warning) must be loud and clear so the target cannot misread it, clearly documented in national policy, and consistently\n16.

To deter a target actively, one must have the means to threaten the target into inaction.²¹\nIn the case of personalised deterrence, not only will the deterrent signal be clear, the threats will become more effective as support for the strategy grows. While it is not easy to identify individuals, it is much easier than trying to link states to incidents. As noted earlier in this article, the proof would be lower for individuals because the cost of a mistake is lower in the case of an individual travel ban, for example. By contrast, a mistake against a state could result in countermeasures. As more states accept the effectiveness of the strategy, more will participate in travel bans, economic repercussions and so on, which will serve to expand the scope of the consequences faced by rogue hackers. Western legal systems afford governments a number of threat options, including: criminal prosecution;²² a permanent ban on entering the targeted country; a permanent ban on owning property in the targeted country; a permanent ban on appointments (such as seats on corporate boards) in the targeted country; and a permanent ban on owning or accessing bank accounts or other aspects of the financial system in the targeted country.\nIn addition to options available under the legal system, governments of targeted countries could damage individual perpetrators’ reputations by disclosing their involvement in cyber misdeeds. States and others have already used hacked webcams to take photos of aggressors, releasing the images as part of name-and-shame campaigns.²³ Individualised deterrence in this form would release such images, but would also publicly release information about individual hackers that would cause them embarrassment or otherwise make it difficult for them to carry on as normal. This could include: social media profiles; school and university records; criminal records, if any; and other publicly\naccessible information, such as personal tastes and habits, that could cause the perpetrator discomfort if released to the wider public.\nThe information to be released will often be available from open sources, but it is not out of the question that targeted states might obtain personal details from perpetrators’ systems while collecting information to establish responsibility for the activity. Like all espionage, obtaining information in this manner would undoubtedly violate the host state’s laws, but is not prohibited under international law.\nA primary reason personalised deterrence could be effective is that individuals and states weigh benefits and costs differently. While the benefits gained by a government from a cyber attack might be the weakening of an adversary or access to intelligence, an individual perpetrator seeks more personal benefits: money; foreign travel; a comfortable lifestyle. If the perpetrator of an attack – or a hacker preparing one – may have ambitions to travel or study abroad, or to hold international financial assets, the possibility of forfeiting such opportunities as a result of an employment choice may give them pause. For targeted states, it is a much more straightforward analysis than assessing how to best deter an entire state that might have interests that are entirely opaque.\nAn individual-focused approach to deterrence has been tested on a small scale. In 2015 and 2016, then US President Barack Obama signed executive orders imposing sanctions on individuals found to be engaging in malicious cyber activities against targets in the US.²⁴ Even though they failed to gain traction as a deterrence tool, the US government has more recently begun using the criminal justice system to charge individual cyber attackers in court. The proof of concept was the 2014 charging of five members of China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA)\n21. McKenzie, ‘Is Cyber Deterrence Possible?’, p. 2.\n22. Prosecution would likely be in absentia, given that aggressor states would be unlikely to extradite perpetrators for prosecution.\n23.

It subsequently became clear that the US rationale for the case was to signal its intent to address China's cyber misbehaviour and to demonstrate a willingness to look past the state to individual actors.²⁶\n## Personalised deterrence can drive a wedge between hackers and sponsors, forcing a choice\nThe 2014 hack of Sony Pictures was an apparent retaliation by North Korea against Sony's film *The Interview* which ridiculed North Korean ruler Kim Jong-un.²⁷ The attack crippled computers, deleted data and released embarrassing internal emails. In 2018, the US Department of Justice (DoJ) charged North Korean national Park Jin Hyok with conspiring to conduct cyber attacks and intrusions, accusing him of involvement in the Sony incident. The US DoJ also charged Park in connection with the WannaCry 2.0 attack, and for involvement in other cyber attacks.²⁸ It identified him as a member of a North Korean government-sponsored hacking team referred to as the Lazarus Group.²⁹ The US Department of the Treasury imposed sanctions on\nhim and against the regime-linked Chosun Expo Joint Venture, where he worked.³⁰ The sanctions include freezing US-controlled financial assets and prohibiting US nationals from engaging in business dealings with the company. In February 2020, the US DoJ went one step further, charging members of the PLA with the hack of credit reporting agency Equifax in 2017.³¹\nDuring the 2018 US election campaigns, US Cyber Command is also thought to have communicated to Russian individuals that it knew their identity and was aware of their nefarious activities in cyberspace, in essence warning them that there would be consequences if they interfered with the election.³²\nOutside the realm of cyberspace, states have sometimes used sanctions against senior officials of countries in response to aggressive behaviour. Following Russia's annexation of Crimea, for example, the EU and the US imposed so-called 'targeted sanctions' on Russian leaders. The EU's sanctions list includes visa bans and asset freezes for 170 persons,³³ while the US has implemented a range of sanctions, freezing the US-based assets of individuals involved in the annexation.³⁴\nWhat distinguishes personalised deterrence from analogous previous efforts is its certainty and formality. US Cyber Command has been on the right track with messages directed at individual hackers, but the reported instances appear to be the exception rather than the rule and are acknowledged only after\n25.

Personalised deterrence would go several steps further, publicising the range of possible consequences in advance, and taking the response well beyond notifications, beyond even naming and shaming, to naming, shaming and blaming. The most important aspect of the personalised approach is signalling the likelihood of specific consequences to individual hackers.\nDirecting deterrent methods at individual cyber actors thus avoids the necessity of accusing sponsoring governments, who normally deny involvement and make demands for irrefutable proof -- which is usually classified and endlessly debateable. Personalised deterrence can also drive a wedge between hackers and sponsors, forcing a choice. A hacker may be working to advance the interests of a sponsoring government, but the hacker's self-loyalty is likely to trump loyalty to the sponsor. If hackers are provided with clear warning that their personal lives will be directly affected by their hacking activities, they may think twice about what clients to take on and indeed whether to act as government proxies at all. Knowing that they will be placed on an indefinite blacklist for visits to NATO and EU member states as well as partner countries including Australia and New Zealand would pose a powerful deterrent to hackers who may wish to engage in this Western lifestyle. Hackers who may otherwise have engaged as proxies for states may decide the cost--benefit analysis has shifted enough to encourage them to seek other opportunities.\n## Conclusions\nPersonalised deterrence is an option that could be used by most Western governments. As previously detailed, governments could signal to a hacker engaged in -- or preparing to engage in -- attacks on institutions, companies or organisations located in their countries that the hacker will run risks beyond prosecution. Unmasking in the public domain would be a powerful deterrent against an individual accustomed to operating in obscurity. The same is true for reputational damage: an individual hacker accustomed to anonymity would be unlikely to accept assignments that risked yielding not just his or her name and location, but further information such as potentially embarrassing personal details as well. Because the shaming would include further punitive measures such as visa bans, would-be perpetrators are unlikely to engage in acts of aggression for the purpose of achieving notoriety, a common motivation for some Islamist terrorists and perpetrators of school shootings in the US, Indeed, as many governments can observe hacking attempts in real time, they could signal prospective punishment to the perpetrator even while they are preparing an attack.\nStability in cyberspace is critical to the functioning of liberal democracies' economies and national security. Effective, personalised deterrence will help ensure its availability. Although it does not replace other methods of deterrence, it supplements them effectively by using low-cost, non-escalatory means tailored to cyber actors.\nA strategy of personalised deterrence will grow more effective as it takes root. Most effectively, individual hackers will spread the word that hacking against certain states and their interests is no longer free of consequences. The same informal communication that enables governments to hire freelance hackers to do their bidding could work to dissuade hackers across the community. Personalised deterrence, with less explosive consequences in the case of error, also allows states to avoid the sticky attribution problem that sponsoring states have used to their advantage for the past two decades.\nElisabeth Braw is a Senior Research Fellow at RUSI, where she leads the Modern Deterrence project.\nGary Brown is a Professor of Cyber Law at the National Defense University in Washington, DC.",

States must weigh the short-term benefit of using an effective cyber tool to respond against the long-term damage that might result should the capability be released into the wild.[10] Public statements about cyber capabilities and the willingness to use them, the third step of effective deterrence, have proven just as difficult as the first two. Governments have generally been reluctant to discuss whether they engage in offensive cyber operations. However, the tide may have turned. The US Department of Defense's 2018 Cyber Strategy states that the US 'will accelerate the development of cyber capabilities for both warfighting and countering malicious cyber actors... fielding capabilities that are scalable, adaptable, and diverse to provide maximum flexibility'.[11] The document goes on to note that the US military 'will be capable of employing cyberspace operations throughout the spectrum of conflict, from day-to-day operations to wartime, in order to advance U.S. interests.[12] This is part of the US strategy of 'defending forward', perhaps the clearest cyber deterrence effort to date.\nThe UK also acknowledges its offensive cyber capabilities. 'We have the means to take offensive action in cyberspace, should we choose to do so', the UK government noted in the National Cyber Security Strategy 2016-2021.[13] In September 2018, GCHQ and the UK Ministry of Defence announced the creation of a 2,000-member offensive cyber force, which will consist of military personnel, GCHQ officials and private contractors.[14] # Challenges and Strategies Acknowledging the possession of cyber capabilities and expressing a general willingness to use them is only the first set of steps towards developing an effective deterrent. To complete the strategy, states should establish – for themselves, their allies and their adversaries – the specific circumstances under which they might employ cyber capabilities. Unfortunately, such specificity creates problems of its own. For example, setting out precisely when it would respond – ‘red lines’ – can limit a state’s response options. Clear pronouncements also inform adversaries about precisely how far they may safely push cyber aggression and may disclose more than is prudent about systems that might be particularly valuable or vulnerable.\nThe mechanics of deterrence-driven cyber actions are also complicated by the well-known 'attribution problem'.[15] States must have some level of certainty about the sponsor of cyber aggression to be able to respond confidently. It can be extremely difficult to collect and analyse enough technical proof of responsibility for a cyber incident to convince an international audience. Competent hackers use a number of techniques to obfuscate © RUSI Journal March 2020 Braw and Brown their connection to the incident. Additionally, states are often unwilling to publicly release all the information they have about cyber incidents as they may have obtained it from a number of intelligence sources that they are unwilling to compromise. Further complicating the situation, cyber responses are sometimes most technically feasible in so-called 'neutral cyberspace' (such as on servers physically located in non-belligerent states). In itself, this action has the potential to be escalatory.\nPartly to avoid such escalation, some governments have engaged in a type of naming-and-shaming deterrence. These public campaigns are often directed against government sponsors of cyber attacks. Following the 2017 WannaCry 2.0 malware attack, which hit approximately 300,000 computers in 150 countries, a White House official blamed the North Korean regime, arguing that it must be held accountable.[16] Such naming and shaming has, however, proven to be of limited use. Effective shaming of a government requires convincing evidence that it is responsible for an aggressive cyber incident, and that level of certainty often requires states to reveal classified sources or methods that may be of continuing value if kept secret.[17] Even if the source can be safely disclosed, the attribution process often involves a time-consuming investigation into a complex web of contacts. These challenges mean that public statements are likely to be delayed, lessening the effectiveness of the technique. Regardless, named-and-shamed governments may not be susceptible to reputational damage. Compilations such as the Centre for Strategic and International Studies' Significant Cyber Incidents database list the same state sponsors year after year.[18] Finally, cyber attacks are frequently perpetrated by individuals or groups only informally or loosely sponsored by states.[19] Sponsoring governments create distance between themselves and their proxies, either by concealing official trails or dealing in informal agreements with non-state groups. Cyber criminals, for example, have been more than willing to work to advance state interests in return for money or political favour. This provides sponsoring states with plausible deniability on the international stage. The stakes are high when fighting fire with fire, and it would be destabilising to respond to a perceived state aggressor if they had no hand in the original activity.\nGiven these realities, this article proposes that, rather than trying to affect other states directly, governments should direct their deterrent efforts at individual perpetrators operating at the APT level, regardless of whether their sponsorship can be established in a definitive fashion.\nGovernments can take a number of actions against individual hackers to create costs that might dissuade them from engaging in cyber aggression. Examples of these costs are set out below and range from travel bans to financial penalties to criminal prosecution. The authors call this 'personalised deterrence'.\n## Personalised Deterrence Personalised deterrence focuses on what individual hackers or attackers are most likely to value, and bases deterrence on that individual cost–benefit analysis. While individually deterring cyber attackers is time consuming, it gives the deterring state a wider range of tools – for example, in the areas of reputation and personal mobility – than those available for use against states. By focusing on the individual, the deterring state also alters the required level of attribution and proof from the current near-100% certainty model used to link attacks to hostile governments, to the beyond-reasonable-doubt model used in the criminal justice system.[20] This would have significant consequences, most of them helpful to liberal democracies.\nAs Timothy M McKenzie notes: The deterrent declaration (or warning) must be loud and clear so the target cannot misread it, clearly documented in national policy, and consistently Personalised Deterrence of Cyber Aggression echoed in the words and actions of civilian and military leaders. To deter a target actively, one must have the means to threaten the target into inaction.²¹ In the case of personalised deterrence, not only will the deterrent signal be clear, the threats will become more effective as support for the strategy grows. While it is not easy to identify individuals, it is much easier than trying to link states to incidents. As noted earlier in this article, the proof would be lower for individuals because the cost of a mistake is lower in the case of an individual travel ban, for example. By contrast, a mistake against a state could result in countermeasures. As more states accept the effectiveness of the strategy, more will participate in travel bans, economic repercussions and so on, which will serve to expand the scope of the consequences faced by rogue hackers. Western legal systems afford governments a number of threat options, including: criminal prosecution;²² a permanent ban on entering the targeted country; a permanent ban on owning property in the targeted country; a permanent ban on appointments (such as seats on corporate boards) in the targeted country; and a permanent ban on owning or accessing bank accounts or other aspects of the financial system in the targeted country.\nIn addition to options available under the legal system, governments of targeted countries could damage individual perpetrators’ reputations by disclosing their involvement in cyber misdeeds. States and others have already used hacked webcams to take photos of aggressors, releasing the images as part of name-and-shame campaigns.²³ Individualised deterrence in this form would release such images, but would also publicly release information about individual hackers that would cause them embarrassment or otherwise make it difficult for them to carry on as normal. This could include: social media profiles; school and university records; criminal records, if any; and other publicly accessible information, such as personal tastes and habits, that could cause the perpetrator discomfort if released to the wider public.\nThe information to be released will often be available from open sources, but it is not out of the question that targeted states might obtain personal details from perpetrators’ systems while collecting information to establish responsibility for the activity. Like all espionage, obtaining information in this manner would undoubtedly violate the host state’s laws, but is not prohibited under international law.\nA primary reason personalised deterrence could be effective is that individuals and states weigh benefits and costs differently. While the benefits gained by a government from a cyber attack might be the weakening of an adversary or access to intelligence, an individual perpetrator seeks more personal benefits: money; foreign travel; a comfortable lifestyle. If the perpetrator of an attack – or a hacker preparing one – may have ambitions to travel or study abroad, or to hold international financial assets, the possibility of forfeiting such opportunities as a result of an employment choice may give them pause. For targeted states, it is a much more straightforward analysis than assessing how to best deter an entire state that might have interests that are entirely opaque.\nAn individual-focused approach to deterrence has been tested on a small scale. In 2015 and 2016, then US President Barack Obama signed executive orders imposing sanctions on individuals found to be engaging in malicious cyber activities against targets in the US.²⁴ Even though they failed to gain traction as a deterrence tool, the US government has more recently begun using the criminal justice system to charge individual cyber attackers in court. The proof of concept was the 2014 charging of five members of China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) © RUSI Journal March 2020</https:> Braw and Brown with cyber espionage and other offences.²⁵ The case was criticised at the time because it seemed unlikely that Beijing would make the PLA members available for trial in the US. It subsequently became clear that the US rationale for the case was to signal its intent to address China's cyber misbehaviour and to demonstrate a willingness to look past the state to individual actors.²⁶ ## Personalised deterrence can drive a wedge between hackers and sponsors, forcing a choice The 2014 hack of Sony Pictures was an apparent retaliation by North Korea against Sony's film *The Interview* which ridiculed North Korean ruler Kim Jong-un.²⁷ The attack crippled computers, deleted data and released embarrassing internal emails. In 2018, the US Department of Justice (DoJ) charged North Korean national Park Jin Hyok with conspiring to conduct cyber attacks and intrusions, accusing him of involvement in the Sony incident. The US DoJ also charged Park in connection with the WannaCry 2.0 attack, and for involvement in other cyber attacks.²⁸ It identified him as a member of a North Korean government-sponsored hacking team referred to as the Lazarus Group.²⁹ The US Department of the Treasury imposed sanctions on him and against the regime-linked Chosun Expo Joint Venture, where he worked.³⁰ The sanctions include freezing US-controlled financial assets and prohibiting US nationals from engaging in business dealings with the company. In February 2020, the US DoJ went one step further, charging members of the PLA with the hack of credit reporting agency Equifax in 2017.³¹ During the 2018 US election campaigns, US Cyber Command is also thought to have communicated to Russian individuals that it knew their identity and was aware of their nefarious activities in cyberspace, in essence warning them that there would be consequences if they interfered with the election.³² Outside the realm of cyberspace, states have sometimes used sanctions against senior officials of countries in response to aggressive behaviour. Following Russia's annexation of Crimea, for example, the EU and the US imposed so-called 'targeted sanctions' on Russian leaders. The EU's sanctions list includes visa bans and asset freezes for 170 persons,³³ while the US has implemented a range of sanctions, freezing the US-based assets of individuals involved in the annexation.³⁴ What distinguishes personalised deterrence from analogous previous efforts is its certainty and formality. US Cyber Command has been on the right track with messages directed at individual hackers, but the reported instances appear to be the exception rather than the rule and are acknowledged only after the fact. Personalised deterrence would go several steps further, publicising the range of possible consequences in advance, and taking the response well beyond notifications, beyond even naming and shaming, to naming, shaming and blaming. The most important aspect of the personalised approach is signalling the likelihood of specific consequences to individual hackers.\nDirecting deterrent methods at individual cyber actors thus avoids the necessity of accusing sponsoring governments, who normally deny involvement and make demands for irrefutable proof -- which is usually classified and endlessly debateable. Personalised deterrence can also drive a wedge between hackers and sponsors, forcing a choice. A hacker may be working to advance the interests of a sponsoring government, but the hacker's self-loyalty is likely to trump loyalty to the sponsor. If hackers are provided with clear warning that their personal lives will be directly affected by their hacking activities, they may think twice about what clients to take on and indeed whether to act as government proxies at all. Knowing that they will be placed on an indefinite blacklist for visits to NATO and EU member states as well as partner countries including Australia and New Zealand would pose a powerful deterrent to hackers who may wish to engage in this Western lifestyle. Hackers who may otherwise have engaged as proxies for states may decide the cost--benefit analysis has shifted enough to encourage them to seek other opportunities.\n## Conclusions Personalised deterrence is an option that could be used by most Western governments. As previously detailed, governments could signal to a hacker engaged in -- or preparing to engage in -- attacks on institutions, companies or organisations located in their countries that the hacker will run risks beyond prosecution. Unmasking in the public domain would be a powerful deterrent against an individual accustomed to operating in obscurity. The same is true for reputational damage: an individual hacker accustomed to anonymity would be unlikely to accept assignments that risked yielding not just his or her name and location, but further information such as potentially embarrassing personal details as well. Because the shaming would include further punitive measures such as visa bans, would-be perpetrators are unlikely to engage in acts of aggression for the purpose of achieving notoriety, a common motivation for some Islamist terrorists and perpetrators of school shootings in the US, Indeed, as many governments can observe hacking attempts in real time, they could signal prospective punishment to the perpetrator even while they are preparing an attack.\nStability in cyberspace is critical to the functioning of liberal democracies' economies and national security. Effective, personalised deterrence will help ensure its availability. Although it does not replace other methods of deterrence, it supplements them effectively by using low-cost, non-escalatory means tailored to cyber actors.\nA strategy of personalised deterrence will grow more effective as it takes root. Most effectively, individual hackers will spread the word that hacking against certain states and their interests is no longer free of consequences. The same informal communication that enables governments to hire freelance hackers to do their bidding could work to dissuade hackers across the community. Personalised deterrence, with less explosive consequences in the case of error, also allows states to avoid the sticky attribution problem that sponsoring states have used to their advantage for the past two decades.\nElisabeth Braw is a Senior Research Fellow at RUSI, where she leads the Modern Deterrence project.\nGary Brown is a Professor of Cyber Law at the National Defense University in Washington, DC.",

    "# Personalised Deterrence of Cyber Aggression": "Elisabeth Braw and Gary Brown\nThe continuing occurrence of state-sponsored cyber attacks against liberal democracies, including private sector and civil society targets, shows that deterrence efforts have been less than successful. Elisabeth Braw and Gary Brown argue that adversary governments' practice of hiding behind proxies makes response and thus deterrence extraordinarily difficult. As a deterrence strategy adding to the existing deterrence directed against hostile actors, they propose 'personalised deterrence', with governments of targeted countries communicating directly to individual cyber attackers their intent to hold them personally responsible through denial of benefits and use of criminal law.\nThomas Fanning, CEO of Southern Company, the second-largest utility holding company in the US, spoke for many business leaders when, in summer 2018, he explained a source of frustration, saying: 'I can't fight back.' What Fanning would like is the chance to fight back against cyber attacks, a menace not just for utilities, but for governments and most companies in strategic sectors as well. Indeed, the majority of companies are targeted by cyber attacks. According to the UK government's 2019 Cyber Security Breaches Survey, 61% of large UK companies experienced cyber breaches or attacks in 2019. In summer 2017, NotPetya – a virus created by the Russian government-linked Sandworm hacker collective – disabled several multinational companies including Maersk, the Danish shipping firm, and the US pharmaceutical company Merck. Government agencies and other institutions are also attacked. For instance, Sweden's signals intelligence agency, FRA, estimates that there are more than 10,000 cyber attacks by hostile states or their proxies against targets in Sweden each month.\nThe real number is, as the FRA admits, likely to be far higher. For example, in May 2019, Deutsche Telekom's honeypot system was targeted by an average of 26 million attacks per day. By January 2020, the number had risen to an average of 42 million attacks per day, with many of the attacks stemming from states. It is a truism for cyber security specialists that there are only two kinds of businesses: those who know they have been hacked and those who do not. Deterring cyber attacks is\n1.

    "# Towards a Deterrence Capability": "Definitions of a 'cyber attack' range from including every unfriendly cyber activity to those that are exclusively lethal or destructive. In this article, the term is used to mean cyber operations – including cyber-enabled information operations – intended to cause injury to people, damage or significantly disrupt computer systems, or manipulate information for strategic gain. The focus here is on advanced persistent threats (APTs), which are incidents of cyber aggression at a level of sophistication and scope that can only be achieved by states, and so are understood to be state-sponsored.\nThomas Schelling, a key deterrence theorist, defined deterrence as part of the diplomacy of\nviolence, the 'art of coercion and intimidation. It is about credibly signalling the power to hurt and inflict pain on a potential adversary' without resorting to an actual use of force. By this definition, deterrence of state-directed cyber aggression has been ineffective. This is not surprising, because the implementation of deterrence in cyberspace is extremely challenging.\nWhile targeted states could respond kinetically, the least escalatory response involves the use of cyberspace capabilities in return. This requires an effective cyberspace counterstrike capability, a willingness to use it and a public announcement of both. Each of these three steps presents a challenge.\nDeveloping and maintaining an arsenal of cyber capabilities, the first step, is difficult. Unlike other strategic capabilities, such as tanks and aircraft carriers, cyber tools are fragile in that they rely on stealth and the exploitation of unknown system vulnerabilities to work. From the moment they are used, they might be exposed to the adversary and, in many cases, easily mitigated or defeated.

Elisabeth Braw and Gary Brown argue that adversary governments' practice of hiding behind proxies makes response and thus deterrence extraordinarily difficult. As a deterrence strategy adding to the existing deterrence directed against hostile actors, they propose 'personalised deterrence', with governments of targeted countries communicating directly to individual cyber attackers their intent to hold them personally responsible through denial of benefits and use of criminal law.\nThomas Fanning, CEO of Southern Company, the second-largest utility holding company in the US, spoke for many business leaders when, in summer 2018, he explained a source of frustration, saying: 'I can't fight back.' What Fanning would like is the chance to fight back against cyber attacks, a menace not just for utilities, but for governments and most companies in strategic sectors as well. Indeed, the majority of companies are targeted by cyber attacks. According to the UK government's 2019 Cyber Security Breaches Survey, 61% of large UK companies experienced cyber breaches or attacks in 2019. In summer 2017, NotPetya – a virus created by the Russian government-linked Sandworm hacker collective – disabled several multinational companies including Maersk, the Danish shipping firm, and the US pharmaceutical company Merck. Government agencies and other institutions are also attacked. For instance, Sweden's signals intelligence agency, FRA, estimates that there are more than 10,000 cyber attacks by hostile states or their proxies against targets in Sweden each month.\nThe real number is, as the FRA admits, likely to be far higher. For example, in May 2019, Deutsche Telekom's honeypot system was targeted by an average of 26 million attacks per day. By January 2020, the number had risen to an average of 42 million attacks per day, with many of the attacks stemming from states. It is a truism for cyber security specialists that there are only two kinds of businesses: those who know they have been hacked and those who do not. Deterring cyber attacks is © RUSI Journal Vol. 165, No. 2, March 2020 pp. 48-54</https:></https:></https:> State-sponsored cyber attacks pose a major threat to countries' national security. Adopting a name-and-shame approach could decrease the willingness of lone actors to act as proxies for hostile states. Courtesy of valerybrozhinsky/Adobe Stock justifiably a high priority for Western governments, and the first step in developing a strategy is clearly to understand what they are trying to achieve.\n# Towards a Deterrence Capability Definitions of a 'cyber attack' range from including every unfriendly cyber activity to those that are exclusively lethal or destructive. In this article, the term is used to mean cyber operations – including cyber-enabled information operations – intended to cause injury to people, damage or significantly disrupt computer systems, or manipulate information for strategic gain. The focus here is on advanced persistent threats (APTs), which are incidents of cyber aggression at a level of sophistication and scope that can only be achieved by states, and so are understood to be state-sponsored.\nThomas Schelling, a key deterrence theorist, defined deterrence as part of the diplomacy of violence, the 'art of coercion and intimidation. It is about credibly signalling the power to hurt and inflict pain on a potential adversary' without resorting to an actual use of force. By this definition, deterrence of state-directed cyber aggression has been ineffective. This is not surprising, because the implementation of deterrence in cyberspace is extremely challenging.\nWhile targeted states could respond kinetically, the least escalatory response involves the use of cyberspace capabilities in return. This requires an effective cyberspace counterstrike capability, a willingness to use it and a public announcement of both. Each of these three steps presents a challenge.\nDeveloping and maintaining an arsenal of cyber capabilities, the first step, is difficult. Unlike other strategic capabilities, such as tanks and aircraft carriers, cyber tools are fragile in that they rely on stealth and the exploitation of unknown system vulnerabilities to work. From the moment they are used, they might be exposed to the adversary and, in many cases, easily mitigated or defeated. In addition, DOI: 10.1080/03071847.2020.1740493 Personalised Deterrence of Cyber Aggression the access to adversaries' systems required to make use of cyber capabilities is fleeting. An intruder might be discovered or shut down by vigilant network administrators, or even normal system maintenance. Even if they are not employed, cyber capabilities lose effectiveness over time and eventually become obsolete, as hardware and software generations are developed and fielded.\nGovernments can take a number of actions against individual hackers to create costs that might dissuade them from engaging in cyber aggression Even when an appropriate counterstrike capability is available, the second step of deterrence – willingness to use – can be a hurdle. Discovered cyber capabilities can be repurposed for use by the target or by other bad actors to whom they might offer it. States must weigh the short-term benefit of using an effective cyber tool to respond against the long-term damage that might result should the capability be released into the wild.[10] Public statements about cyber capabilities and the willingness to use them, the third step of effective deterrence, have proven just as difficult as the first two. Governments have generally been reluctant to discuss whether they engage in offensive cyber operations. However, the tide may have turned. The US Department of Defense's 2018 Cyber Strategy states that the US 'will accelerate the development of cyber capabilities for both warfighting and countering malicious cyber actors... fielding capabilities that are scalable, adaptable, and diverse to provide maximum flexibility'.[11] The document goes on to note that the US military 'will be capable of employing cyberspace operations throughout the spectrum of conflict, from day-to-day operations to wartime, in order to advance U.S. interests.[12] This is part of the US strategy of 'defending forward', perhaps the clearest cyber deterrence effort to date.\nThe UK also acknowledges its offensive cyber capabilities. 'We have the means to take offensive action in cyberspace, should we choose to do so', the UK government noted in the National Cyber Security Strategy 2016-2021.[13] In September 2018, GCHQ and the UK Ministry of Defence announced the creation of a 2,000-member offensive cyber force, which will consist of military personnel, GCHQ officials and private contractors.[14] # Challenges and Strategies Acknowledging the possession of cyber capabilities and expressing a general willingness to use them is only the first set of steps towards developing an effective deterrent. To complete the strategy, states should establish – for themselves, their allies and their adversaries – the specific circumstances under which they might employ cyber capabilities. Unfortunately, such specificity creates problems of its own. For example, setting out precisely when it would respond – ‘red lines’ – can limit a state’s response options. Clear pronouncements also inform adversaries about precisely how far they may safely push cyber aggression and may disclose more than is prudent about systems that might be particularly valuable or vulnerable.\nThe mechanics of deterrence-driven cyber actions are also complicated by the well-known 'attribution problem'.[15] States must have some level of certainty about the sponsor of cyber aggression to be able to respond confidently. It can be extremely difficult to collect and analyse enough technical proof of responsibility for a cyber incident to convince an international audience. Competent hackers use a number of techniques to obfuscate © RUSI Journal March 2020 Braw and Brown their connection to the incident. Additionally, states are often unwilling to publicly release all the information they have about cyber incidents as they may have obtained it from a number of intelligence sources that they are unwilling to compromise. Further complicating the situation, cyber responses are sometimes most technically feasible in so-called 'neutral cyberspace' (such as on servers physically located in non-belligerent states). In itself, this action has the potential to be escalatory.\nPartly to avoid such escalation, some governments have engaged in a type of naming-and-shaming deterrence. These public campaigns are often directed against government sponsors of cyber attacks. Following the 2017 WannaCry 2.0 malware attack, which hit approximately 300,000 computers in 150 countries, a White House official blamed the North Korean regime, arguing that it must be held accountable.[16] Such naming and shaming has, however, proven to be of limited use. Effective shaming of a government requires convincing evidence that it is responsible for an aggressive cyber incident, and that level of certainty often requires states to reveal classified sources or methods that may be of continuing value if kept secret.[17] Even if the source can be safely disclosed, the attribution process often involves a time-consuming investigation into a complex web of contacts. These challenges mean that public statements are likely to be delayed, lessening the effectiveness of the technique. Regardless, named-and-shamed governments may not be susceptible to reputational damage. Compilations such as the Centre for Strategic and International Studies' Significant Cyber Incidents database list the same state sponsors year after year.[18] Finally, cyber attacks are frequently perpetrated by individuals or groups only informally or loosely sponsored by states.[19] Sponsoring governments create distance between themselves and their proxies, either by concealing official trails or dealing in informal agreements with non-state groups. Cyber criminals, for example, have been more than willing to work to advance state interests in return for money or political favour. This provides sponsoring states with plausible deniability on the international stage. The stakes are high when fighting fire with fire, and it would be destabilising to respond to a perceived state aggressor if they had no hand in the original activity.\nGiven these realities, this article proposes that, rather than trying to affect other states directly, governments should direct their deterrent efforts at individual perpetrators operating at the APT level, regardless of whether their sponsorship can be established in a definitive fashion.\nGovernments can take a number of actions against individual hackers to create costs that might dissuade them from engaging in cyber aggression. Examples of these costs are set out below and range from travel bans to financial penalties to criminal prosecution. The authors call this 'personalised deterrence'.\n## Personalised Deterrence Personalised deterrence focuses on what individual hackers or attackers are most likely to value, and bases deterrence on that individual cost–benefit analysis. While individually deterring cyber attackers is time consuming, it gives the deterring state a wider range of tools – for example, in the areas of reputation and personal mobility – than those available for use against states. By focusing on the individual, the deterring state also alters the required level of attribution and proof from the current near-100% certainty model used to link attacks to hostile governments, to the beyond-reasonable-doubt model used in the criminal justice system.[20] This would have significant consequences, most of them helpful to liberal democracies.\nAs Timothy M McKenzie notes: The deterrent declaration (or warning) must be loud and clear so the target cannot misread it, clearly documented in national policy, and consistently Personalised Deterrence of Cyber Aggression echoed in the words and actions of civilian and military leaders. To deter a target actively, one must have the means to threaten the target into inaction.²¹ In the case of personalised deterrence, not only will the deterrent signal be clear, the threats will become more effective as support for the strategy grows. While it is not easy to identify individuals, it is much easier than trying to link states to incidents. As noted earlier in this article, the proof would be lower for individuals because the cost of a mistake is lower in the case of an individual travel ban, for example. By contrast, a mistake against a state could result in countermeasures. As more states accept the effectiveness of the strategy, more will participate in travel bans, economic repercussions and so on, which will serve to expand the scope of the consequences faced by rogue hackers. Western legal systems afford governments a number of threat options, including: criminal prosecution;²² a permanent ban on entering the targeted country; a permanent ban on owning property in the targeted country; a permanent ban on appointments (such as seats on corporate boards) in the targeted country; and a permanent ban on owning or accessing bank accounts or other aspects of the financial system in the targeted country.\nIn addition to options available under the legal system, governments of targeted countries could damage individual perpetrators’ reputations by disclosing their involvement in cyber misdeeds. States and others have already used hacked webcams to take photos of aggressors, releasing the images as part of name-and-shame campaigns.²³ Individualised deterrence in this form would release such images, but would also publicly release information about individual hackers that would cause them embarrassment or otherwise make it difficult for them to carry on as normal. This could include: social media profiles; school and university records; criminal records, if any; and other publicly accessible information, such as personal tastes and habits, that could cause the perpetrator discomfort if released to the wider public.\nThe information to be released will often be available from open sources, but it is not out of the question that targeted states might obtain personal details from perpetrators’ systems while collecting information to establish responsibility for the activity. Like all espionage, obtaining information in this manner would undoubtedly violate the host state’s laws, but is not prohibited under international law.\nA primary reason personalised deterrence could be effective is that individuals and states weigh benefits and costs differently. While the benefits gained by a government from a cyber attack might be the weakening of an adversary or access to intelligence, an individual perpetrator seeks more personal benefits: money; foreign travel; a comfortable lifestyle. If the perpetrator of an attack – or a hacker preparing one – may have ambitions to travel or study abroad, or to hold international financial assets, the possibility of forfeiting such opportunities as a result of an employment choice may give them pause. For targeted states, it is a much more straightforward analysis than assessing how to best deter an entire state that might have interests that are entirely opaque.\nAn individual-focused approach to deterrence has been tested on a small scale. In 2015 and 2016, then US President Barack Obama signed executive orders imposing sanctions on individuals found to be engaging in malicious cyber activities against targets in the US.²⁴ Even though they failed to gain traction as a deterrence tool, the US government has more recently begun using the criminal justice system to charge individual cyber attackers in court. The proof of concept was the 2014 charging of five members of China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) © RUSI Journal March 2020</https:> Braw and Brown with cyber espionage and other offences.²⁵ The case was criticised at the time because it seemed unlikely that Beijing would make the PLA members available for trial in the US. It subsequently became clear that the US rationale for the case was to signal its intent to address China's cyber misbehaviour and to demonstrate a willingness to look past the state to individual actors.²⁶ ## Personalised deterrence can drive a wedge between hackers and sponsors, forcing a choice The 2014 hack of Sony Pictures was an apparent retaliation by North Korea against Sony's film *The Interview* which ridiculed North Korean ruler Kim Jong-un.²⁷ The attack crippled computers, deleted data and released embarrassing internal emails.

While targeted states could respond kinetically, the least escalatory response involves the use of cyberspace capabilities in return. This requires an effective cyberspace counterstrike capability, a willingness to use it and a public announcement of both. Each of these three steps presents a challenge. Developing and maintaining an arsenal of cyber capabilities, the first step, is difficult. Unlike other strategic capabilities, such as tanks and aircraft carriers, cyber tools are fragile in that they rely on stealth and the exploitation of unknown system vulnerabilities to work. From the moment they are used, they might be exposed to the adversary and, in many cases, easily mitigated or defeated. In addition, DOI: 10.1080/03071847.2020.1740493 Personalised Deterrence of Cyber Aggression the access to adversaries' systems required to make use of cyber capabilities is fleeting. An intruder might be discovered or shut down by vigilant network administrators, or even normal system maintenance. Even if they are not employed, cyber capabilities lose effectiveness over time and eventually become obsolete, as hardware and software generations are developed and fielded. Governments can take a number of actions against individual hackers to create costs that might dissuade them from engaging in cyber aggression Even when an appropriate counterstrike capability is available, the second step of deterrence – willingness to use – can be a hurdle. Discovered cyber capabilities can be repurposed for use by the target or by other bad actors to whom they might offer it. States must weigh the short-term benefit of using an effective cyber tool to respond against the long-term damage that might result should the capability be released into the wild.[10] Public statements about cyber capabilities and the willingness to use them, the third step of effective deterrence, have proven just as difficult as the first two. Governments have generally been reluctant to discuss whether they engage in offensive cyber operations. However, the tide may have turned. The US Department of Defense's 2018 Cyber Strategy states that the US 'will accelerate the development of cyber capabilities for both warfighting and countering malicious cyber actors ... fielding capabilities that are scalable, adaptable, and diverse to provide maximum flexibility'.[11] The document goes on to note that the US military 'will be capable of employing cyberspace operations throughout the spectrum of conflict, from day-to-day operations to wartime, in order to advance U.S. interests.[12] This is part of the US strategy of 'defending forward', perhaps the clearest cyber deterrence effort to date. The UK also acknowledges its offensive cyber capabilities. 'We have the means to take offensive action in cyberspace, should we choose to do so', the UK government noted in the National Cyber Security Strategy 2016-2021.[13] In September 2018, GCHQ and the UK Ministry of Defence announced the creation of a 2,000-member offensive cyber force, which will consist of military personnel, GCHQ officials and private contractors.[14] # Challenges and Strategies Acknowledging the possession of cyber capabilities and expressing a general willingness to use them is only the first set of steps towards developing an effective deterrent. To complete the strategy, states should establish – for themselves, their allies and their adversaries – the specific circumstances under which they might employ cyber capabilities. Unfortunately, such specificity creates problems of its own. For example, setting out precisely when it would respond – ‘red lines’ – can limit a state’s response options. Clear pronouncements also inform adversaries about precisely how far they may safely push cyber aggression and may disclose more than is prudent about systems that might be particularly valuable or vulnerable. The mechanics of deterrence-driven cyber actions are also complicated by the well-known 'attribution problem'.[15] States must have some level of certainty about the sponsor of cyber aggression to be able to respond confidently. It can be extremely difficult to collect and analyse enough technical proof of responsibility for a cyber incident to convince an international audience. Competent hackers use a number of techniques to obfuscate © RUSI Journal March 2020 Braw and Brown their connection to the incident. Additionally, states are often unwilling to publicly release all the information they have about cyber incidents as they may have obtained it from a number of intelligence sources that they are unwilling to compromise. Further complicating the situation, cyber responses are sometimes most technically feasible in so-called 'neutral cyberspace' (such as on servers physically located in non-belligerent states). In itself, this action has the potential to be escalatory. Partly to avoid such escalation, some governments have engaged in a type of naming-and-shaming deterrence. These public campaigns are often directed against government sponsors of cyber attacks. Following the 2017 WannaCry 2.0 malware attack, which hit approximately 300,000 computers in 150 countries, a White House official blamed the North Korean regime, arguing that it must be held accountable.[16] Such naming and shaming has, however, proven to be of limited use. Effective shaming of a government requires convincing evidence that it is responsible for an aggressive cyber incident, and that level of certainty often requires states to reveal classified sources or methods that may be of continuing value if kept secret.[17] Even if the source can be safely disclosed, the attribution process often involves a time-consuming investigation into a complex web of contacts. These challenges mean that public statements are likely to be delayed, lessening the effectiveness of the technique. Regardless, named-and-shamed governments may not be susceptible to reputational damage. Compilations such as the Centre for Strategic and International Studies' Significant Cyber Incidents database list the same state sponsors year after year.[18] Finally, cyber attacks are frequently perpetrated by individuals or groups only informally or loosely sponsored by states.[19] Sponsoring governments create distance between themselves and their proxies, either by concealing official trails or dealing in informal agreements with non-state groups. Cyber criminals, for example, have been more than willing to work to advance state interests in return for money or political favour. This provides sponsoring states with plausible deniability on the international stage. The stakes are high when fighting fire with fire, and it would be destabilising to respond to a perceived state aggressor if they had no hand in the original activity. Given these realities, this article proposes that, rather than trying to affect other states directly, governments should direct their deterrent efforts at individual perpetrators operating at the APT level, regardless of whether their sponsorship can be established in a definitive fashion. Governments can take a number of actions against individual hackers to create costs that might dissuade them from engaging in cyber aggression. Examples of these costs are set out below and range from travel bans to financial penalties to criminal prosecution. The authors call this 'personalised deterrence'. ## Personalised Deterrence Personalised deterrence focuses on what individual hackers or attackers are most likely to value, and bases deterrence on that individual cost–benefit analysis. While individually deterring cyber attackers is time consuming, it gives the deterring state a wider range of tools – for example, in the areas of reputation and personal mobility – than those available for use against states. By focusing on the individual, the deterring state also alters the required level of attribution and proof from the current near-100% certainty model used to link attacks to hostile governments, to the beyond-reasonable-doubt model used in the criminal justice system.[20] This would have significant consequences, most of them helpful to liberal democracies. As Timothy M McKenzie notes: The deterrent declaration (or warning) must be loud and clear so the target cannot misread it, clearly documented in national policy, and consistently",

To deter a target actively, one must have the means to threaten the target into inaction.²¹ In the case of personalised deterrence, not only will the deterrent signal be clear, the threats will become more effective as support for the strategy grows. While it is not easy to identify individuals, it is much easier than trying to link states to incidents. As noted earlier in this article, the proof would be lower for individuals because the cost of a mistake is lower in the case of an individual travel ban, for example. By contrast, a mistake against a state could result in countermeasures. As more states accept the effectiveness of the strategy, more will participate in travel bans, economic repercussions and so on, which will serve to expand the scope of the consequences faced by rogue hackers. Western legal systems afford governments a number of threat options, including: criminal prosecution;²² a permanent ban on entering the targeted country; a permanent ban on owning property in the targeted country; a permanent ban on appointments (such as seats on corporate boards) in the targeted country; and a permanent ban on owning or accessing bank accounts or other aspects of the financial system in the targeted country. In addition to options available under the legal system, governments of targeted countries could damage individual perpetrators’ reputations by disclosing their involvement in cyber misdeeds. States and others have already used hacked webcams to take photos of aggressors, releasing the images as part of name-and-shame campaigns.²³ Individualised deterrence in this form would release such images, but would also publicly release information about individual hackers that would cause them embarrassment or otherwise make it difficult for them to carry on as normal. This could include: social media profiles; school and university records; criminal records, if any; and other publicly accessible information, such as personal tastes and habits, that could cause the perpetrator discomfort if released to the wider public. The information to be released will often be available from open sources, but it is not out of the question that targeted states might obtain personal details from perpetrators’ systems while collecting information to establish responsibility for the activity. Like all espionage, obtaining information in this manner would undoubtedly violate the host state’s laws, but is not prohibited under international law. A primary reason personalised deterrence could be effective is that individuals and states weigh benefits and costs differently. While the benefits gained by a government from a cyber attack might be the weakening of an adversary or access to intelligence, an individual perpetrator seeks more personal benefits: money; foreign travel; a comfortable lifestyle. If the perpetrator of an attack – or a hacker preparing one – may have ambitions to travel or study abroad, or to hold international financial assets, the possibility of forfeiting such opportunities as a result of an employment choice may give them pause. For targeted states, it is a much more straightforward analysis than assessing how to best deter an entire state that might have interests that are entirely opaque. An individual-focused approach to deterrence has been tested on a small scale. In 2015 and 2016, then US President Barack Obama signed executive orders imposing sanctions on individuals found to be engaging in malicious cyber activities against targets in the US.²⁴ Even though they failed to gain traction as a deterrence tool, the US government has more recently begun using the criminal justice system to charge individual cyber attackers in court. The proof of concept was the 2014 charging of five members of China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA)",

It subsequently became clear that the US rationale for the case was to signal its intent to address China's cyber misbehaviour and to demonstrate a willingness to look past the state to individual actors.²⁶ ## Personalised deterrence can drive a wedge between hackers and sponsors, forcing a choice The 2014 hack of Sony Pictures was an apparent retaliation by North Korea against Sony's film *The Interview* which ridiculed North Korean ruler Kim Jong-un.²⁷ The attack crippled computers, deleted data and released embarrassing internal emails. In 2018, the US Department of Justice (DoJ) charged North Korean national Park Jin Hyok with conspiring to conduct cyber attacks and intrusions, accusing him of involvement in the Sony incident. The US DoJ also charged Park in connection with the WannaCry 2.0 attack, and for involvement in other cyber attacks.²⁸ It identified him as a member of a North Korean government-sponsored hacking team referred to as the Lazarus Group.²⁹ The US Department of the Treasury imposed sanctions on him and against the regime-linked Chosun Expo Joint Venture, where he worked.³⁰ The sanctions include freezing US-controlled financial assets and prohibiting US nationals from engaging in business dealings with the company. In February 2020, the US DoJ went one step further, charging members of the PLA with the hack of credit reporting agency Equifax in 2017.³¹ During the 2018 US election campaigns, US Cyber Command is also thought to have communicated to Russian individuals that it knew their identity and was aware of their nefarious activities in cyberspace, in essence warning them that there would be consequences if they interfered with the election.³² Outside the realm of cyberspace, states have sometimes used sanctions against senior officials of countries in response to aggressive behaviour. Following Russia's annexation of Crimea, for example, the EU and the US imposed so-called 'targeted sanctions' on Russian leaders. The EU's sanctions list includes visa bans and asset freezes for 170 persons,³³ while the US has implemented a range of sanctions, freezing the US-based assets of individuals involved in the annexation.³⁴ What distinguishes personalised deterrence from analogous previous efforts is its certainty and formality. US Cyber Command has been on the right track with messages directed at individual hackers, but the reported instances appear to be the exception rather than the rule and are acknowledged only after",

Personalised deterrence would go several steps further, publicising the range of possible consequences in advance, and taking the response well beyond notifications, beyond even naming and shaming, to naming, shaming and blaming. The most important aspect of the personalised approach is signalling the likelihood of specific consequences to individual hackers. Directing deterrent methods at individual cyber actors thus avoids the necessity of accusing sponsoring governments, who normally deny involvement and make demands for irrefutable proof -- which is usually classified and endlessly debateable. Personalised deterrence can also drive a wedge between hackers and sponsors, forcing a choice. A hacker may be working to advance the interests of a sponsoring government, but the hacker's self-loyalty is likely to trump loyalty to the sponsor. If hackers are provided with clear warning that their personal lives will be directly affected by their hacking activities, they may think twice about what clients to take on and indeed whether to act as government proxies at all. Knowing that they will be placed on an indefinite blacklist for visits to NATO and EU member states as well as partner countries including Australia and New Zealand would pose a powerful deterrent to hackers who may wish to engage in this Western lifestyle. Hackers who may otherwise have engaged as proxies for states may decide the cost--benefit analysis has shifted enough to encourage them to seek other opportunities. ## Conclusions Personalised deterrence is an option that could be used by most Western governments. As previously detailed, governments could signal to a hacker engaged in -- or preparing to engage in -- attacks on institutions, companies or organisations located in their countries that the hacker will run risks beyond prosecution. Unmasking in the public domain would be a powerful deterrent against an individual accustomed to operating in obscurity. The same is true for reputational damage: an individual hacker accustomed to anonymity would be unlikely to accept assignments that risked yielding not just his or her name and location, but further information such as potentially embarrassing personal details as well. Because the shaming would include further punitive measures such as visa bans, would-be perpetrators are unlikely to engage in acts of aggression for the purpose of achieving notoriety, a common motivation for some Islamist terrorists and perpetrators of school shootings in the US, Indeed, as many governments can observe hacking attempts in real time, they could signal prospective punishment to the perpetrator even while they are preparing an attack. Stability in cyberspace is critical to the functioning of liberal democracies' economies and national security. Effective, personalised deterrence will help ensure its availability. Although it does not replace other methods of deterrence, it supplements them effectively by using low-cost, non-escalatory means tailored to cyber actors. A strategy of personalised deterrence will grow more effective as it takes root. Most effectively, individual hackers will spread the word that hacking against certain states and their interests is no longer free of consequences. The same informal communication that enables governments to hire freelance hackers to do their bidding could work to dissuade hackers across the community. Personalised deterrence, with less explosive consequences in the case of error, also allows states to avoid the sticky attribution problem that sponsoring states have used to their advantage for the past two decades.

Elisabeth Braw and Gary Brown argue that adversary governments' practice of hiding behind proxies makes response and thus deterrence extraordinarily difficult. As a deterrence strategy adding to the existing deterrence directed against hostile actors, they propose 'personalised deterrence', with governments of targeted countries communicating directly to individual cyber attackers their intent to hold them personally responsible through denial of benefits and use of criminal law.\nThomas Fanning, CEO of Southern Company, the second-largest utility holding company in the US, spoke for many business leaders when, in summer 2018, he explained a source of frustration, saying: 'I can't fight back.' What Fanning would like is the chance to fight back against cyber attacks, a menace not just for utilities, but for governments and most companies in strategic sectors as well. Indeed, the majority of companies are targeted by cyber attacks. According to the UK government's 2019 Cyber Security Breaches Survey, 61% of large UK companies experienced cyber breaches or attacks in 2019. In summer 2017, NotPetya – a virus created by the Russian government-linked Sandworm hacker collective – disabled several multinational companies including Maersk, the Danish shipping firm, and the US pharmaceutical company Merck. Government agencies and other institutions are also attacked. For instance, Sweden's signals intelligence agency, FRA, estimates that there are more than 10,000 cyber attacks by hostile states or their proxies against targets in Sweden each month.\nThe real number is, as the FRA admits, likely to be far higher. For example, in May 2019, Deutsche Telekom's honeypot system was targeted by an average of 26 million attacks per day. By January 2020, the number had risen to an average of 42 million attacks per day, with many of the attacks stemming from states. It is a truism for cyber security specialists that there are only two kinds of businesses: those who know they have been hacked and those who do not. Deterring cyber attacks is © RUSI Journal Vol. 165, No. 2, March 2020 pp. 48-54</https:></https:></https:> State-sponsored cyber attacks pose a major threat to countries' national security. Adopting a name-and-shame approach could decrease the willingness of lone actors to act as proxies for hostile states. Courtesy of valerybrozhinsky/Adobe Stock justifiably a high priority for Western governments, and the first step in developing a strategy is clearly to understand what they are trying to achieve.\n# Towards a Deterrence Capability Definitions of a 'cyber attack' range from including every unfriendly cyber activity to those that are exclusively lethal or destructive. In this article, the term is used to mean cyber operations – including cyber-enabled information operations – intended to cause injury to people, damage or significantly disrupt computer systems, or manipulate information for strategic gain. The focus here is on advanced persistent threats (APTs), which are incidents of cyber aggression at a level of sophistication and scope that can only be achieved by states, and so are understood to be state-sponsored.\nThomas Schelling, a key deterrence theorist, defined deterrence as part of the diplomacy of violence, the 'art of coercion and intimidation. It is about credibly signalling the power to hurt and inflict pain on a potential adversary' without resorting to an actual use of force. By this definition, deterrence of state-directed cyber aggression has been ineffective. This is not surprising, because the implementation of deterrence in cyberspace is extremely challenging.\nWhile targeted states could respond kinetically, the least escalatory response involves the use of cyberspace capabilities in return. This requires an effective cyberspace counterstrike capability, a willingness to use it and a public announcement of both. Each of these three steps presents a challenge.\nDeveloping and maintaining an arsenal of cyber capabilities, the first step, is difficult. Unlike other strategic capabilities, such as tanks and aircraft carriers, cyber tools are fragile in that they rely on stealth and the exploitation of unknown system vulnerabilities to work. From the moment they are used, they might be exposed to the adversary and, in many cases, easily mitigated or defeated. In addition, DOI: 10.1080/03071847.2020.1740493 Personalised Deterrence of Cyber Aggression the access to adversaries' systems required to make use of cyber capabilities is fleeting. An intruder might be discovered or shut down by vigilant network administrators, or even normal system maintenance. Even if they are not employed, cyber capabilities lose effectiveness over time and eventually become obsolete, as hardware and software generations are developed and fielded.\nGovernments can take a number of actions against individual hackers to create costs that might dissuade them from engaging in cyber aggression Even when an appropriate counterstrike capability is available, the second step of deterrence – willingness to use – can be a hurdle. Discovered cyber capabilities can be repurposed for use by the target or by other bad actors to whom they might offer it. States must weigh the short-term benefit of using an effective cyber tool to respond against the long-term damage that might result should the capability be released into the wild.[10] Public statements about cyber capabilities and the willingness to use them, the third step of effective deterrence, have proven just as difficult as the first two. Governments have generally been reluctant to discuss whether they engage in offensive cyber operations. However, the tide may have turned. The US Department of Defense's 2018 Cyber Strategy states that the US 'will accelerate the development of cyber capabilities for both warfighting and countering malicious cyber actors... fielding capabilities that are scalable, adaptable, and diverse to provide maximum flexibility'.[11] The document goes on to note that the US military 'will be capable of employing cyberspace operations throughout the spectrum of conflict, from day-to-day operations to wartime, in order to advance U.S. interests.[12] This is part of the US strategy of 'defending forward', perhaps the clearest cyber deterrence effort to date.\nThe UK also acknowledges its offensive cyber capabilities. 'We have the means to take offensive action in cyberspace, should we choose to do so', the UK government noted in the National Cyber Security Strategy 2016-2021.[13] In September 2018, GCHQ and the UK Ministry of Defence announced the creation of a 2,000-member offensive cyber force, which will consist of military personnel, GCHQ officials and private contractors.[14] # Challenges and Strategies Acknowledging the possession of cyber capabilities and expressing a general willingness to use them is only the first set of steps towards developing an effective deterrent. To complete the strategy, states should establish – for themselves, their allies and their adversaries – the specific circumstances under which they might employ cyber capabilities. Unfortunately, such specificity creates problems of its own. For example, setting out precisely when it would respond – ‘red lines’ – can limit a state’s response options. Clear pronouncements also inform adversaries about precisely how far they may safely push cyber aggression and may disclose more than is prudent about systems that might be particularly valuable or vulnerable.\nThe mechanics of deterrence-driven cyber actions are also complicated by the well-known 'attribution problem'.[15] States must have some level of certainty about the sponsor of cyber aggression to be able to respond confidently. It can be extremely difficult to collect and analyse enough technical proof of responsibility for a cyber incident to convince an international audience. Competent hackers use a number of techniques to obfuscate © RUSI Journal March 2020 Braw and Brown their connection to the incident. Additionally, states are often unwilling to publicly release all the information they have about cyber incidents as they may have obtained it from a number of intelligence sources that they are unwilling to compromise. Further complicating the situation, cyber responses are sometimes most technically feasible in so-called 'neutral cyberspace' (such as on servers physically located in non-belligerent states). In itself, this action has the potential to be escalatory.\nPartly to avoid such escalation, some governments have engaged in a type of naming-and-shaming deterrence. These public campaigns are often directed against government sponsors of cyber attacks. Following the 2017 WannaCry 2.0 malware attack, which hit approximately 300,000 computers in 150 countries, a White House official blamed the North Korean regime, arguing that it must be held accountable.[16] Such naming and shaming has, however, proven to be of limited use. Effective shaming of a government requires convincing evidence that it is responsible for an aggressive cyber incident, and that level of certainty often requires states to reveal classified sources or methods that may be of continuing value if kept secret.[17] Even if the source can be safely disclosed, the attribution process often involves a time-consuming investigation into a complex web of contacts. These challenges mean that public statements are likely to be delayed, lessening the effectiveness of the technique. Regardless, named-and-shamed governments may not be susceptible to reputational damage. Compilations such as the Centre for Strategic and International Studies' Significant Cyber Incidents database list the same state sponsors year after year.[18] Finally, cyber attacks are frequently perpetrated by individuals or groups only informally or loosely sponsored by states.[19] Sponsoring governments create distance between themselves and their proxies, either by concealing official trails or dealing in informal agreements with non-state groups. Cyber criminals, for example, have been more than willing to work to advance state interests in return for money or political favour. This provides sponsoring states with plausible deniability on the international stage. The stakes are high when fighting fire with fire, and it would be destabilising to respond to a perceived state aggressor if they had no hand in the original activity.\nGiven these realities, this article proposes that, rather than trying to affect other states directly, governments should direct their deterrent efforts at individual perpetrators operating at the APT level, regardless of whether their sponsorship can be established in a definitive fashion.\nGovernments can take a number of actions against individual hackers to create costs that might dissuade them from engaging in cyber aggression. Examples of these costs are set out below and range from travel bans to financial penalties to criminal prosecution. The authors call this 'personalised deterrence'.\n## Personalised Deterrence Personalised deterrence focuses on what individual hackers or attackers are most likely to value, and bases deterrence on that individual cost–benefit analysis. While individually deterring cyber attackers is time consuming, it gives the deterring state a wider range of tools – for example, in the areas of reputation and personal mobility – than those available for use against states. By focusing on the individual, the deterring state also alters the required level of attribution and proof from the current near-100% certainty model used to link attacks to hostile governments, to the beyond-reasonable-doubt model used in the criminal justice system.[20] This would have significant consequences, most of them helpful to liberal democracies.\nAs Timothy M McKenzie notes: The deterrent declaration (or warning) must be loud and clear so the target cannot misread it, clearly documented in national policy, and consistently Personalised Deterrence of Cyber Aggression echoed in the words and actions of civilian and military leaders. To deter a target actively, one must have the means to threaten the target into inaction.²¹ In the case of personalised deterrence, not only will the deterrent signal be clear, the threats will become more effective as support for the strategy grows. While it is not easy to identify individuals, it is much easier than trying to link states to incidents. As noted earlier in this article, the proof would be lower for individuals because the cost of a mistake is lower in the case of an individual travel ban, for example. By contrast, a mistake against a state could result in countermeasures. As more states accept the effectiveness of the strategy, more will participate in travel bans, economic repercussions and so on, which will serve to expand the scope of the consequences faced by rogue hackers. Western legal systems afford governments a number of threat options, including: criminal prosecution;²² a permanent ban on entering the targeted country; a permanent ban on owning property in the targeted country; a permanent ban on appointments (such as seats on corporate boards) in the targeted country; and a permanent ban on owning or accessing bank accounts or other aspects of the financial system in the targeted country.\nIn addition to options available under the legal system, governments of targeted countries could damage individual perpetrators’ reputations by disclosing their involvement in cyber misdeeds. States and others have already used hacked webcams to take photos of aggressors, releasing the images as part of name-and-shame campaigns.²³ Individualised deterrence in this form would release such images, but would also publicly release information about individual hackers that would cause them embarrassment or otherwise make it difficult for them to carry on as normal. This could include: social media profiles; school and university records; criminal records, if any; and other publicly accessible information, such as personal tastes and habits, that could cause the perpetrator discomfort if released to the wider public.\nThe information to be released will often be available from open sources, but it is not out of the question that targeted states might obtain personal details from perpetrators’ systems while collecting information to establish responsibility for the activity. Like all espionage, obtaining information in this manner would undoubtedly violate the host state’s laws, but is not prohibited under international law.\nA primary reason personalised deterrence could be effective is that individuals and states weigh benefits and costs differently. While the benefits gained by a government from a cyber attack might be the weakening of an adversary or access to intelligence, an individual perpetrator seeks more personal benefits: money; foreign travel; a comfortable lifestyle. If the perpetrator of an attack – or a hacker preparing one – may have ambitions to travel or study abroad, or to hold international financial assets, the possibility of forfeiting such opportunities as a result of an employment choice may give them pause. For targeted states, it is a much more straightforward analysis than assessing how to best deter an entire state that might have interests that are entirely opaque.\nAn individual-focused approach to deterrence has been tested on a small scale. In 2015 and 2016, then US President Barack Obama signed executive orders imposing sanctions on individuals found to be engaging in malicious cyber activities against targets in the US.²⁴ Even though they failed to gain traction as a deterrence tool, the US government has more recently begun using the criminal justice system to charge individual cyber attackers in court. The proof of concept was the 2014 charging of five members of China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) © RUSI Journal March 2020</https:> Braw and Brown with cyber espionage and other offences.²⁵ The case was criticised at the time because it seemed unlikely that Beijing would make the PLA members available for trial in the US. It subsequently became clear that the US rationale for the case was to signal its intent to address China's cyber misbehaviour and to demonstrate a willingness to look past the state to individual actors.²⁶ ## Personalised deterrence can drive a wedge between hackers and sponsors, forcing a choice The 2014 hack of Sony Pictures was an apparent retaliation by North Korea against Sony's film *The Interview* which ridiculed North Korean ruler Kim Jong-un.²⁷ The attack crippled computers, deleted data and released embarrassing internal emails. In 2018, the US Department of Justice (DoJ) charged North Korean national Park Jin Hyok with conspiring to conduct cyber attacks and intrusions, accusing him of involvement in the Sony incident. The US DoJ also charged Park in connection with the WannaCry 2.0 attack, and for involvement in other cyber attacks.²⁸ It identified him as a member of a North Korean government-sponsored hacking team referred to as the Lazarus Group.²⁹ The US Department of the Treasury imposed sanctions on him and against the regime-linked Chosun Expo Joint Venture, where he worked.³⁰ The sanctions include freezing US-controlled financial assets and prohibiting US nationals from engaging in business dealings with the company. In February 2020, the US DoJ went one step further, charging members of the PLA with the hack of credit reporting agency Equifax in 2017.³¹ During the 2018 US election campaigns, US Cyber Command is also thought to have communicated to Russian individuals that it knew their identity and was aware of their nefarious activities in cyberspace, in essence warning them that there would be consequences if they interfered with the election.³² Outside the realm of cyberspace, states have sometimes used sanctions against senior officials of countries in response to aggressive behaviour. Following Russia's annexation of Crimea, for example, the EU and the US imposed so-called 'targeted sanctions' on Russian leaders. The EU's sanctions list includes visa bans and asset freezes for 170 persons,³³ while the US has implemented a range of sanctions, freezing the US-based assets of individuals involved in the annexation.³⁴ What distinguishes personalised deterrence from analogous previous efforts is its certainty and formality. US Cyber Command has been on the right track with messages directed at individual hackers, but the reported instances appear to be the exception rather than the rule and are acknowledged only after the fact. Personalised deterrence would go several steps further, publicising the range of possible consequences in advance, and taking the response well beyond notifications, beyond even naming and shaming, to naming, shaming and blaming. The most important aspect of the personalised approach is signalling the likelihood of specific consequences to individual hackers.\nDirecting deterrent methods at individual cyber actors thus avoids the necessity of accusing sponsoring governments, who normally deny involvement and make demands for irrefutable proof -- which is usually classified and endlessly debateable. Personalised deterrence can also drive a wedge between hackers and sponsors, forcing a choice. A hacker may be working to advance the interests of a sponsoring government, but the hacker's self-loyalty is likely to trump loyalty to the sponsor. If hackers are provided with clear warning that their personal lives will be directly affected by their hacking activities, they may think twice about what clients to take on and indeed whether to act as government proxies at all. Knowing that they will be placed on an indefinite blacklist for visits to NATO and EU member states as well as partner countries including Australia and New Zealand would pose a powerful deterrent to hackers who may wish to engage in this Western lifestyle. Hackers who may otherwise have engaged as proxies for states may decide the cost--benefit analysis has shifted enough to encourage them to seek other opportunities.\n## Conclusions Personalised deterrence is an option that could be used by most Western governments. As previously detailed, governments could signal to a hacker engaged in -- or preparing to engage in -- attacks on institutions, companies or organisations located in their countries that the hacker will run risks beyond prosecution. Unmasking in the public domain would be a powerful deterrent against an individual accustomed to operating in obscurity. The same is true for reputational damage: an individual hacker accustomed to anonymity would be unlikely to accept assignments that risked yielding not just his or her name and location, but further information such as potentially embarrassing personal details as well. Because the shaming would include further punitive measures such as visa bans, would-be perpetrators are unlikely to engage in acts of aggression for the purpose of achieving notoriety, a common motivation for some Islamist terrorists and perpetrators of school shootings in the US, Indeed, as many governments can observe hacking attempts in real time, they could signal prospective punishment to the perpetrator even while they are preparing an attack.\nStability in cyberspace is critical to the functioning of liberal democracies' economies and national security. Effective, personalised deterrence will help ensure its availability. Although it does not replace other methods of deterrence, it supplements them effectively by using low-cost, non-escalatory means tailored to cyber actors.\nA strategy of personalised deterrence will grow more effective as it takes root. Most effectively, individual hackers will spread the word that hacking against certain states and their interests is no longer free of consequences. The same informal communication that enables governments to hire freelance hackers to do their bidding could work to dissuade hackers across the community. Personalised deterrence, with less explosive consequences in the case of error, also allows states to avoid the sticky attribution problem that sponsoring states have used to their advantage for the past two decades.\nElisabeth Braw is a Senior Research Fellow at RUSI, where she leads the Modern Deterrence project.\nGary Brown is a Professor of Cyber Law at the National Defense University in Washington, DC."

To deter a target actively, one must have the means to threaten the target into inaction.²¹ In the case of personalised deterrence, not only will the deterrent signal be clear, the threats will become more effective as support for the strategy grows. While it is not easy to identify individuals, it is much easier than trying to link states to incidents. As noted earlier in this article, the proof would be lower for individuals because the cost of a mistake is lower in the case of an individual travel ban, for example. By contrast, a mistake against a state could result in countermeasures. As more states accept the effectiveness of the strategy, more will participate in travel bans, economic repercussions and so on, which will serve to expand the scope of the consequences faced by rogue hackers. Western legal systems afford governments a number of threat options, including: criminal prosecution;²² a permanent ban on entering the targeted country; a permanent ban on owning property in the targeted country; a permanent ban on appointments (such as seats on corporate boards) in the targeted country; and a permanent ban on owning or accessing bank accounts or other aspects of the financial system in the targeted country. In addition to options available under the legal system, governments of targeted countries could damage individual perpetrators’ reputations by disclosing their involvement in cyber misdeeds. States and others have already used hacked webcams to take photos of aggressors, releasing the images as part of name-and-shame campaigns.²³ Individualised deterrence in this form would release such images, but would also publicly release information about individual hackers that would cause them embarrassment or otherwise make it difficult for them to carry on as normal. This could include: social media profiles; school and university records; criminal records, if any; and other publicly accessible information, such as personal tastes and habits, that could cause the perpetrator discomfort if released to the wider public. The information to be released will often be available from open sources, but it is not out of the question that targeted states might obtain personal details from perpetrators’ systems while collecting information to establish responsibility for the activity. Like all espionage, obtaining information in this manner would undoubtedly violate the host state’s laws, but is not prohibited under international law. A primary reason personalised deterrence could be effective is that individuals and states weigh benefits and costs differently. While the benefits gained by a government from a cyber attack might be the weakening of an adversary or access to intelligence, an individual perpetrator seeks more personal benefits: money; foreign travel; a comfortable lifestyle. If the perpetrator of an attack – or a hacker preparing one – may have ambitions to travel or study abroad, or to hold international financial assets, the possibility of forfeiting such opportunities as a result of an employment choice may give them pause. For targeted states, it is a much more straightforward analysis than assessing how to best deter an entire state that might have interests that are entirely opaque. An individual-focused approach to deterrence has been tested on a small scale. In 2015 and 2016, then US President Barack Obama signed executive orders imposing sanctions on individuals found to be engaging in malicious cyber activities against targets in the US.²⁴ Even though they failed to gain traction as a deterrence tool, the US government has more recently begun using the criminal justice system to charge individual cyber attackers in court. The proof of concept was the 2014 charging of five members of China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA)"

Elisabeth Braw and Gary Brown argue that adversary governments' practice of hiding behind proxies makes response and thus deterrence extraordinarily difficult. As a deterrence strategy adding to the existing deterrence directed against hostile actors, they propose 'personalised deterrence', with governments of targeted countries communicating directly to individual cyber attackers their intent to hold them personally responsible through denial of benefits and use of criminal law.\nThomas Fanning, CEO of Southern Company, the second-largest utility holding company in the US, spoke for many business leaders when, in summer 2018, he explained a source of frustration, saying: 'I can't fight back.' What Fanning would like is the chance to fight back against cyber attacks, a menace not just for utilities, but for governments and most companies in strategic sectors as well. Indeed, the majority of companies are targeted by cyber attacks. According to the UK government's 2019 Cyber Security Breaches Survey, 61% of large UK companies experienced cyber breaches or attacks in 2019. In summer 2017, NotPetya – a virus created by the Russian government-linked Sandworm hacker collective – disabled several multinational companies including Maersk, the Danish shipping firm, and the US pharmaceutical company Merck. Government agencies and other institutions are also attacked. For instance, Sweden's signals intelligence agency, FRA, estimates that there are more than 10,000 cyber attacks by hostile states or their proxies against targets in Sweden each month.\nThe real number is, as the FRA admits, likely to be far higher. For example, in May 2019, Deutsche Telekom's honeypot system was targeted by an average of 26 million attacks per day. By January 2020, the number had risen to an average of 42 million attacks per day, with many of the attacks stemming from states. It is a truism for cyber security specialists that there are only two kinds of businesses: those who know they have been hacked and those who do not. Deterring cyber attacks is\n1.

Courtesy of valerybrozhinsky/Adobe Stock\njustifiably a high priority for Western governments, and the first step in developing a strategy is clearly to understand what they are trying to achieve.\n# Towards a Deterrence Capability\nDefinitions of a 'cyber attack' range from including every unfriendly cyber activity to those that are exclusively lethal or destructive. In this article, the term is used to mean cyber operations – including cyber-enabled information operations – intended to cause injury to people, damage or significantly disrupt computer systems, or manipulate information for strategic gain. The focus here is on advanced persistent threats (APTs), which are incidents of cyber aggression at a level of sophistication and scope that can only be achieved by states, and so are understood to be state-sponsored.\nThomas Schelling, a key deterrence theorist, defined deterrence as part of the diplomacy of\nviolence, the 'art of coercion and intimidation. It is about credibly signalling the power to hurt and inflict pain on a potential adversary' without resorting to an actual use of force. By this definition, deterrence of state-directed cyber aggression has been ineffective. This is not surprising, because the implementation of deterrence in cyberspace is extremely challenging.\nWhile targeted states could respond kinetically, the least escalatory response involves the use of cyberspace capabilities in return. This requires an effective cyberspace counterstrike capability, a willingness to use it and a public announcement of both. Each of these three steps presents a challenge.\nDeveloping and maintaining an arsenal of cyber capabilities, the first step, is difficult. Unlike other strategic capabilities, such as tanks and aircraft carriers, cyber tools are fragile in that they rely on stealth and the exploitation of unknown system vulnerabilities to work. From the moment they are used, they might be exposed to the adversary and, in many cases, easily mitigated or defeated. In addition,\nDOI: 10.1080/03071847.2020.1740493\nPersonalised Deterrence of Cyber Aggression\nthe access to adversaries' systems required to make use of cyber capabilities is fleeting. An intruder might be discovered or shut down by vigilant network administrators, or even normal system maintenance. Even if they are not employed, cyber capabilities lose effectiveness over time and eventually become obsolete, as hardware and software generations are developed and fielded.\nGovernments can take a number of actions against individual hackers to create costs that might dissuade them from engaging in cyber aggression\nEven when an appropriate counterstrike capability is available, the second step of deterrence – willingness to use – can be a hurdle. Discovered cyber capabilities can be repurposed for use by the target or by other bad actors to whom they might offer it. States must weigh the short-term benefit of using an effective cyber tool to respond against the long-term damage that might result should the capability be released into the wild.\nPublic statements about cyber capabilities and the willingness to use them, the third step of effective deterrence, have proven just as difficult as the first two. Governments have generally been reluctant to discuss whether they engage in offensive cyber operations. However, the tide may have turned. The US Department of Defense's 2018 Cyber Strategy states that the US 'will accelerate the development of cyber capabilities for both warfighting and countering malicious cyber actors ... fielding capabilities that are scalable, adaptable, and diverse to provide maximum flexibility'. The document goes on to note that the US military 'will be capable of employing cyberspace operations\nthroughout the spectrum of conflict, from day-to-day operations to wartime, in order to advance U.S. interests. This is part of the US strategy of 'defending forward', perhaps the clearest cyber deterrence effort to date.\nThe UK also acknowledges its offensive cyber capabilities. 'We have the means to take offensive action in cyberspace, should we choose to do so', the UK government noted in the National Cyber Security Strategy 2016-2021. In September 2018, GCHQ and the UK Ministry of Defence announced the creation of a 2,000-member offensive cyber force, which will consist of military personnel, GCHQ officials and private contractors.\n# Challenges and Strategies\nAcknowledging the possession of cyber capabilities and expressing a general willingness to use them is only the first set of steps towards developing an effective deterrent. To complete the strategy, states should establish – for themselves, their allies and their adversaries – the specific circumstances under which they might employ cyber capabilities. Unfortunately, such specificity creates problems of its own. For example, setting out precisely when it would respond – ‘red lines’ – can limit a state’s response options. Clear pronouncements also inform adversaries about precisely how far they may safely push cyber aggression and may disclose more than is prudent about systems that might be particularly valuable or vulnerable.\nThe mechanics of deterrence-driven cyber actions are also complicated by the well-known 'attribution problem'. States must have some level of certainty about the sponsor of cyber aggression to be able to respond confidently. It can be extremely difficult to collect and analyse enough technical proof of responsibility for a cyber incident to convince an international audience. Competent hackers use a number of techniques to obfuscate\n© RUSI Journal March 2020\nBraw and Brown\ntheir connection to the incident. Additionally, states are often unwilling to publicly release all the information they have about cyber incidents as they may have obtained it from a number of intelligence sources that they are unwilling to compromise. Further complicating the situation, cyber responses are sometimes most technically feasible in so-called 'neutral cyberspace' (such as on servers physically located in non-belligerent states). In itself, this action has the potential to be escalatory.\nPartly to avoid such escalation, some governments have engaged in a type of naming-and-shaming deterrence. These public campaigns are often directed against government sponsors of cyber attacks. Following the 2017 WannaCry 2.0 malware attack, which hit approximately 300,000 computers in 150 countries, a White House official blamed the North Korean regime, arguing that it must be held accountable. Such naming and shaming has, however, proven to be of limited use. Effective shaming of a government requires convincing evidence that it is responsible for an aggressive cyber incident, and that level of certainty often requires states to reveal classified sources or methods that may be of continuing value if kept secret. Even if the source can be safely disclosed, the attribution process often involves a time-consuming investigation into a complex web of contacts. These challenges mean that public statements are likely to be delayed, lessening the effectiveness of the technique. Regardless, named-and-shamed governments may not be susceptible to reputational damage. Compilations such as the Centre for Strategic and International Studies' Significant Cyber Incidents database list the same state sponsors year after year.\nFinally, cyber attacks are frequently perpetrated by individuals or groups only informally or loosely sponsored by states. Sponsoring governments create distance between themselves and their proxies, either by concealing official trails or dealing in informal agreements with non-state groups. Cyber criminals, for example, have been more than willing to work to advance state interests in\nreturn for money or political favour. This provides sponsoring states with plausible deniability on the international stage. The stakes are high when fighting fire with fire, and it would be destabilising to respond to a perceived state aggressor if they had no hand in the original activity.\nGiven these realities, this article proposes that, rather than trying to affect other states directly, governments should direct their deterrent efforts at individual perpetrators operating at the APT level, regardless of whether their sponsorship can be established in a definitive fashion.\nGovernments can take a number of actions against individual hackers to create costs that might dissuade them from engaging in cyber aggression. Examples of these costs are set out below and range from travel bans to financial penalties to criminal prosecution. The authors call this 'personalised deterrence'.\n## Personalised Deterrence\nPersonalised deterrence focuses on what individual hackers or attackers are most likely to value, and bases deterrence on that individual cost–benefit analysis. While individually deterring cyber attackers is time consuming, it gives the deterring state a wider range of tools – for example, in the areas of reputation and personal mobility – than those available for use against states. By focusing on the individual, the deterring state also alters the required level of attribution and proof from the current near-100% certainty model used to link attacks to hostile governments, to the beyond-reasonable-doubt model used in the criminal justice system. This would have significant consequences, most of them helpful to liberal democracies.\nAs Timothy M McKenzie notes:\nThe deterrent declaration (or warning) must be loud and clear so the target cannot misread it, clearly documented in national policy, and consistently\n16.

It subsequently became clear that the US rationale for the case was to signal its intent to address China's cyber misbehaviour and to demonstrate a willingness to look past the state to individual actors.²⁶\n## Personalised deterrence can drive a wedge between hackers and sponsors, forcing a choice\nThe 2014 hack of Sony Pictures was an apparent retaliation by North Korea against Sony's film *The Interview* which ridiculed North Korean ruler Kim Jong-un.²⁷ The attack crippled computers, deleted data and released embarrassing internal emails. In 2018, the US Department of Justice (DoJ) charged North Korean national Park Jin Hyok with conspiring to conduct cyber attacks and intrusions, accusing him of involvement in the Sony incident. The US DoJ also charged Park in connection with the WannaCry 2.0 attack, and for involvement in other cyber attacks.²⁸ It identified him as a member of a North Korean government-sponsored hacking team referred to as the Lazarus Group.²⁹ The US Department of the Treasury imposed sanctions on\nhim and against the regime-linked Chosun Expo Joint Venture, where he worked.³⁰ The sanctions include freezing US-controlled financial assets and prohibiting US nationals from engaging in business dealings with the company. In February 2020, the US DoJ went one step further, charging members of the PLA with the hack of credit reporting agency Equifax in 2017.³¹\nDuring the 2018 US election campaigns, US Cyber Command is also thought to have communicated to Russian individuals that it knew their identity and was aware of their nefarious activities in cyberspace, in essence warning them that there would be consequences if they interfered with the election.³²\nOutside the realm of cyberspace, states have sometimes used sanctions against senior officials of countries in response to aggressive behaviour. Following Russia's annexation of Crimea, for example, the EU and the US imposed so-called 'targeted sanctions' on Russian leaders. The EU's sanctions list includes visa bans and asset freezes for 170 persons,³³ while the US has implemented a range of sanctions, freezing the US-based assets of individuals involved in the annexation.³⁴\nWhat distinguishes personalised deterrence from analogous previous efforts is its certainty and formality. US Cyber Command has been on the right track with messages directed at individual hackers, but the reported instances appear to be the exception rather than the rule and are acknowledged only after\n25.

Personalised deterrence would go several steps further, publicising the range of possible consequences in advance, and taking the response well beyond notifications, beyond even naming and shaming, to naming, shaming and blaming. The most important aspect of the personalised approach is signalling the likelihood of specific consequences to individual hackers.\nDirecting deterrent methods at individual cyber actors thus avoids the necessity of accusing sponsoring governments, who normally deny involvement and make demands for irrefutable proof -- which is usually classified and endlessly debateable. Personalised deterrence can also drive a wedge between hackers and sponsors, forcing a choice. A hacker may be working to advance the interests of a sponsoring government, but the hacker's self-loyalty is likely to trump loyalty to the sponsor. If hackers are provided with clear warning that their personal lives will be directly affected by their hacking activities, they may think twice about what clients to take on and indeed whether to act as government proxies at all. Knowing that they will be placed on an indefinite blacklist for visits to NATO and EU member states as well as partner countries including Australia and New Zealand would pose a powerful deterrent to hackers who may wish to engage in this Western lifestyle. Hackers who may otherwise have engaged as proxies for states may decide the cost--benefit analysis has shifted enough to encourage them to seek other opportunities.\n## Conclusions\nPersonalised deterrence is an option that could be used by most Western governments. As previously detailed, governments could signal to a hacker engaged in -- or preparing to engage in -- attacks on institutions, companies or organisations located in their countries that the hacker will run risks beyond prosecution. Unmasking in the public domain would be a powerful deterrent against an individual accustomed to operating in obscurity. The same is true for reputational damage: an individual hacker accustomed to anonymity would be unlikely to accept assignments that risked yielding not just his or her name and location, but further information such as potentially embarrassing personal details as well.

Elisabeth Braw and Gary Brown argue that adversary governments' practice of hiding behind proxies makes response and thus deterrence extraordinarily difficult. As a deterrence strategy adding to the existing deterrence directed against hostile actors, they propose 'personalised deterrence', with governments of targeted countries communicating directly to individual cyber attackers their intent to hold them personally responsible through denial of benefits and use of criminal law.\nThomas Fanning, CEO of Southern Company, the second-largest utility holding company in the US, spoke for many business leaders when, in summer 2018, he explained a source of frustration, saying: 'I can't fight back.' What Fanning would like is the chance to fight back against cyber attacks, a menace not just for utilities, but for governments and most companies in strategic sectors as well. Indeed, the majority of companies are targeted by cyber attacks. According to the UK government's 2019 Cyber Security Breaches Survey, 61% of large UK companies experienced cyber breaches or attacks in 2019. In summer 2017, NotPetya – a virus created by the Russian government-linked Sandworm hacker collective – disabled several multinational companies including Maersk, the Danish shipping firm, and the US pharmaceutical company Merck. Government agencies and other institutions are also attacked. For instance, Sweden's signals intelligence agency, FRA, estimates that there are more than 10,000 cyber attacks by hostile states or their proxies against targets in Sweden each month.\nThe real number is, as the FRA admits, likely to be far higher. For example, in May 2019, Deutsche Telekom's honeypot system was targeted by an average of 26 million attacks per day. By January 2020, the number had risen to an average of 42 million attacks per day, with many of the attacks stemming from states. It is a truism for cyber security specialists that there are only two kinds of businesses: those who know they have been hacked and those who do not. Deterring cyber attacks is © RUSI Journal Vol. 165, No. 2, March 2020 pp. 48-54</https:></https:></https:> State-sponsored cyber attacks pose a major threat to countries' national security. Adopting a name-and-shame approach could decrease the willingness of lone actors to act as proxies for hostile states. Courtesy of valerybrozhinsky/Adobe Stock justifiably a high priority for Western governments, and the first step in developing a strategy is clearly to understand what they are trying to achieve.\n# Towards a Deterrence Capability Definitions of a 'cyber attack' range from including every unfriendly cyber activity to those that are exclusively lethal or destructive. In this article, the term is used to mean cyber operations – including cyber-enabled information operations – intended to cause injury to people, damage or significantly disrupt computer systems, or manipulate information for strategic gain. The focus here is on advanced persistent threats (APTs), which are incidents of cyber aggression at a level of sophistication and scope that can only be achieved by states, and so are understood to be state-sponsored.\nThomas Schelling, a key deterrence theorist, defined deterrence as part of the diplomacy of violence, the 'art of coercion and intimidation. It is about credibly signalling the power to hurt and inflict pain on a potential adversary' without resorting to an actual use of force. By this definition, deterrence of state-directed cyber aggression has been ineffective. This is not surprising, because the implementation of deterrence in cyberspace is extremely challenging.\nWhile targeted states could respond kinetically, the least escalatory response involves the use of cyberspace capabilities in return. This requires an effective cyberspace counterstrike capability, a willingness to use it and a public announcement of both. Each of these three steps presents a challenge.\nDeveloping and maintaining an arsenal of cyber capabilities, the first step, is difficult. Unlike other strategic capabilities, such as tanks and aircraft carriers, cyber tools are fragile in that they rely on stealth and the exploitation of unknown system vulnerabilities to work. From the moment they are used, they might be exposed to the adversary and, in many cases, easily mitigated or defeated. In addition, DOI: 10.1080/03071847.2020.1740493 Personalised Deterrence of Cyber Aggression the access to adversaries' systems required to make use of cyber capabilities is fleeting. An intruder might be discovered or shut down by vigilant network administrators, or even normal system maintenance. Even if they are not employed, cyber capabilities lose effectiveness over time and eventually become obsolete, as hardware and software generations are developed and fielded.\nGovernments can take a number of actions against individual hackers to create costs that might dissuade them from engaging in cyber aggression Even when an appropriate counterstrike capability is available, the second step of deterrence – willingness to use – can be a hurdle. Discovered cyber capabilities can be repurposed for use by the target or by other bad actors to whom they might offer it. States must weigh the short-term benefit of using an effective cyber tool to respond against the long-term damage that might result should the capability be released into the wild.[10] Public statements about cyber capabilities and the willingness to use them, the third step of effective deterrence, have proven just as difficult as the first two. Governments have generally been reluctant to discuss whether they engage in offensive cyber operations. However, the tide may have turned. The US Department of Defense's 2018 Cyber Strategy states that the US 'will accelerate the development of cyber capabilities for both warfighting and countering malicious cyber actors... fielding capabilities that are scalable, adaptable, and diverse to provide maximum flexibility'.[11] The document goes on to note that the US military 'will be capable of employing cyberspace operations throughout the spectrum of conflict, from day-to-day operations to wartime, in order to advance U.S. interests.[12] This is part of the US strategy of 'defending forward', perhaps the clearest cyber deterrence effort to date.\nThe UK also acknowledges its offensive cyber capabilities. 'We have the means to take offensive action in cyberspace, should we choose to do so', the UK government noted in the National Cyber Security Strategy 2016-2021.[13] In September 2018, GCHQ and the UK Ministry of Defence announced the creation of a 2,000-member offensive cyber force, which will consist of military personnel, GCHQ officials and private contractors.[14] # Challenges and Strategies Acknowledging the possession of cyber capabilities and expressing a general willingness to use them is only the first set of steps towards developing an effective deterrent. To complete the strategy, states should establish – for themselves, their allies and their adversaries – the specific circumstances under which they might employ cyber capabilities. Unfortunately, such specificity creates problems of its own. For example, setting out precisely when it would respond – ‘red lines’ – can limit a state’s response options. Clear pronouncements also inform adversaries about precisely how far they may safely push cyber aggression and may disclose more than is prudent about systems that might be particularly valuable or vulnerable.\nThe mechanics of deterrence-driven cyber actions are also complicated by the well-known 'attribution problem'.[15] States must have some level of certainty about the sponsor of cyber aggression to be able to respond confidently. It can be extremely difficult to collect and analyse enough technical proof of responsibility for a cyber incident to convince an international audience. Competent hackers use a number of techniques to obfuscate © RUSI Journal March 2020 Braw and Brown their connection to the incident. Additionally, states are often unwilling to publicly release all the information they have about cyber incidents as they may have obtained it from a number of intelligence sources that they are unwilling to compromise. Further complicating the situation, cyber responses are sometimes most technically feasible in so-called 'neutral cyberspace' (such as on servers physically located in non-belligerent states). In itself, this action has the potential to be escalatory.\nPartly to avoid such escalation, some governments have engaged in a type of naming-and-shaming deterrence. These public campaigns are often directed against government sponsors of cyber attacks. Following the 2017 WannaCry 2.0 malware attack, which hit approximately 300,000 computers in 150 countries, a White House official blamed the North Korean regime, arguing that it must be held accountable.[16] Such naming and shaming has, however, proven to be of limited use. Effective shaming of a government requires convincing evidence that it is responsible for an aggressive cyber incident, and that level of certainty often requires states to reveal classified sources or methods that may be of continuing value if kept secret.[17] Even if the source can be safely disclosed, the attribution process often involves a time-consuming investigation into a complex web of contacts. These challenges mean that public statements are likely to be delayed, lessening the effectiveness of the technique. Regardless, named-and-shamed governments may not be susceptible to reputational damage. Compilations such as the Centre for Strategic and International Studies' Significant Cyber Incidents database list the same state sponsors year after year.[18] Finally, cyber attacks are frequently perpetrated by individuals or groups only informally or loosely sponsored by states.[19] Sponsoring governments create distance between themselves and their proxies, either by concealing official trails or dealing in informal agreements with non-state groups. Cyber criminals, for example, have been more than willing to work to advance state interests in return for money or political favour. This provides sponsoring states with plausible deniability on the international stage. The stakes are high when fighting fire with fire, and it would be destabilising to respond to a perceived state aggressor if they had no hand in the original activity.\nGiven these realities, this article proposes that, rather than trying to affect other states directly, governments should direct their deterrent efforts at individual perpetrators operating at the APT level, regardless of whether their sponsorship can be established in a definitive fashion.\nGovernments can take a number of actions against individual hackers to create costs that might dissuade them from engaging in cyber aggression. Examples of these costs are set out below and range from travel bans to financial penalties to criminal prosecution. The authors call this 'personalised deterrence'.\n## Personalised Deterrence Personalised deterrence focuses on what individual hackers or attackers are most likely to value, and bases deterrence on that individual cost–benefit analysis. While individually deterring cyber attackers is time consuming, it gives the deterring state a wider range of tools – for example, in the areas of reputation and personal mobility – than those available for use against states. By focusing on the individual, the deterring state also alters the required level of attribution and proof from the current near-100% certainty model used to link attacks to hostile governments, to the beyond-reasonable-doubt model used in the criminal justice system.[20] This would have significant consequences, most of them helpful to liberal democracies.\nAs Timothy M McKenzie notes: The deterrent declaration (or warning) must be loud and clear so the target cannot misread it, clearly documented in national policy, and consistently Personalised Deterrence of Cyber Aggression echoed in the words and actions of civilian and military leaders. To deter a target actively, one must have the means to threaten the target into inaction.²¹ In the case of personalised deterrence, not only will the deterrent signal be clear, the threats will become more effective as support for the strategy grows. While it is not easy to identify individuals, it is much easier than trying to link states to incidents. As noted earlier in this article, the proof would be lower for individuals because the cost of a mistake is lower in the case of an individual travel ban, for example. By contrast, a mistake against a state could result in countermeasures. As more states accept the effectiveness of the strategy, more will participate in travel bans, economic repercussions and so on, which will serve to expand the scope of the consequences faced by rogue hackers. Western legal systems afford governments a number of threat options, including: criminal prosecution;²² a permanent ban on entering the targeted country; a permanent ban on owning property in the targeted country; a permanent ban on appointments (such as seats on corporate boards) in the targeted country; and a permanent ban on owning or accessing bank accounts or other aspects of the financial system in the targeted country.\nIn addition to options available under the legal system, governments of targeted countries could damage individual perpetrators’ reputations by disclosing their involvement in cyber misdeeds. States and others have already used hacked webcams to take photos of aggressors, releasing the images as part of name-and-shame campaigns.²³ Individualised deterrence in this form would release such images, but would also publicly release information about individual hackers that would cause them embarrassment or otherwise make it difficult for them to carry on as normal. This could include: social media profiles; school and university records; criminal records, if any; and other publicly accessible information, such as personal tastes and habits, that could cause the perpetrator discomfort if released to the wider public.\nThe information to be released will often be available from open sources, but it is not out of the question that targeted states might obtain personal details from perpetrators’ systems while collecting information to establish responsibility for the activity. Like all espionage, obtaining information in this manner would undoubtedly violate the host state’s laws, but is not prohibited under international law.\nA primary reason personalised deterrence could be effective is that individuals and states weigh benefits and costs differently. While the benefits gained by a government from a cyber attack might be the weakening of an adversary or access to intelligence, an individual perpetrator seeks more personal benefits: money; foreign travel; a comfortable lifestyle. If the perpetrator of an attack – or a hacker preparing one – may have ambitions to travel or study abroad, or to hold international financial assets, the possibility of forfeiting such opportunities as a result of an employment choice may give them pause. For targeted states, it is a much more straightforward analysis than assessing how to best deter an entire state that might have interests that are entirely opaque.\nAn individual-focused approach to deterrence has been tested on a small scale. In 2015 and 2016, then US President Barack Obama signed executive orders imposing sanctions on individuals found to be engaging in malicious cyber activities against targets in the US.²⁴ Even though they failed to gain traction as a deterrence tool, the US government has more recently begun using the criminal justice system to charge individual cyber attackers in court. The proof of concept was the 2014 charging of five members of China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) © RUSI Journal March 2020</https:> Braw and Brown with cyber espionage and other offences.²⁵ The case was criticised at the time because it seemed unlikely that Beijing would make the PLA members available for trial in the US. It subsequently became clear that the US rationale for the case was to signal its intent to address China's cyber misbehaviour and to demonstrate a willingness to look past the state to individual actors.²⁶ ## Personalised deterrence can drive a wedge between hackers and sponsors, forcing a choice The 2014 hack of Sony Pictures was an apparent retaliation by North Korea against Sony's film *The Interview* which ridiculed North Korean ruler Kim Jong-un.²⁷ The attack crippled computers, deleted data and released embarrassing internal emails. In 2018, the US Department of Justice (DoJ) charged North Korean national Park Jin Hyok with conspiring to conduct cyber attacks and intrusions, accusing him of involvement in the Sony incident. The US DoJ also charged Park in connection with the WannaCry 2.0 attack, and for involvement in other cyber attacks.²⁸ It identified him as a member of a North Korean government-sponsored hacking team referred to as the Lazarus Group.²⁹ The US Department of the Treasury imposed sanctions on him and against the regime-linked Chosun Expo Joint Venture, where he worked.³⁰ The sanctions include freezing US-controlled financial assets and prohibiting US nationals from engaging in business dealings with the company. In February 2020, the US DoJ went one step further, charging members of the PLA with the hack of credit reporting agency Equifax in 2017.³¹ During the 2018 US election campaigns, US Cyber Command is also thought to have communicated to Russian individuals that it knew their identity and was aware of their nefarious activities in cyberspace, in essence warning them that there would be consequences if they interfered with the election.³² Outside the realm of cyberspace, states have sometimes used sanctions against senior officials of countries in response to aggressive behaviour. Following Russia's annexation of Crimea, for example, the EU and the US imposed so-called 'targeted sanctions' on Russian leaders. The EU's sanctions list includes visa bans and asset freezes for 170 persons,³³ while the US has implemented a range of sanctions, freezing the US-based assets of individuals involved in the annexation.³⁴ What distinguishes personalised deterrence from analogous previous efforts is its certainty and formality. US Cyber Command has been on the right track with messages directed at individual hackers, but the reported instances appear to be the exception rather than the rule and are acknowledged only after the fact. Personalised deterrence would go several steps further, publicising the range of possible consequences in advance, and taking the response well beyond notifications, beyond even naming and shaming, to naming, shaming and blaming. The most important aspect of the personalised approach is signalling the likelihood of specific consequences to individual hackers.\nDirecting deterrent methods at individual cyber actors thus avoids the necessity of accusing sponsoring governments, who normally deny involvement and make demands for irrefutable proof -- which is usually classified and endlessly debateable. Personalised deterrence can also drive a wedge between hackers and sponsors, forcing a choice. A hacker may be working to advance the interests of a sponsoring government, but the hacker's self-loyalty is likely to trump loyalty to the sponsor. If hackers are provided with clear warning that their personal lives will be directly affected by their hacking activities, they may think twice about what clients to take on and indeed whether to act as government proxies at all. Knowing that they will be placed on an indefinite blacklist for visits to NATO and EU member states as well as partner countries including Australia and New Zealand would pose a powerful deterrent to hackers who may wish to engage in this Western lifestyle. Hackers who may otherwise have engaged as proxies for states may decide the cost--benefit analysis has shifted enough to encourage them to seek other opportunities.\n## Conclusions Personalised deterrence is an option that could be used by most Western governments. As previously detailed, governments could signal to a hacker engaged in -- or preparing to engage in -- attacks on institutions, companies or organisations located in their countries that the hacker will run risks beyond prosecution. Unmasking in the public domain would be a powerful deterrent against an individual accustomed to operating in obscurity. The same is true for reputational damage: an individual hacker accustomed to anonymity would be unlikely to accept assignments that risked yielding not just his or her name and location, but further information such as potentially embarrassing personal details as well. Because the shaming would include further punitive measures such as visa bans, would-be perpetrators are unlikely to engage in acts of aggression for the purpose of achieving notoriety, a common motivation for some Islamist terrorists and perpetrators of school shootings in the US, Indeed, as many governments can observe hacking attempts in real time, they could signal prospective punishment to the perpetrator even while they are preparing an attack.\nStability in cyberspace is critical to the functioning of liberal democracies' economies and national security. Effective, personalised deterrence will help ensure its availability. Although it does not replace other methods of deterrence, it supplements them effectively by using low-cost, non-escalatory means tailored to cyber actors.\nA strategy of personalised deterrence will grow more effective as it takes root. Most effectively, individual hackers will spread the word that hacking against certain states and their interests is no longer free of consequences. The same informal communication that enables governments to hire freelance hackers to do their bidding could work to dissuade hackers across the community.

    "State-sponsored cyber attacks pose a major threat to countries' national security. Adopting a name-and-shame approach could decrease the willingness of lone actors to act as proxies for hostile states. Courtesy of valerybrozhinsky/Adobe Stock\n\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\njustifiably a high priority for Western governments, and the first step in developing a strategy is clearly to understand what they are trying to achieve.\n\n# Towards a Deterrence Capability\n\nDefinitions of a 'cyber attack' range from including every unfriendly cyber activity to those that are exclusively lethal or destructive. In this article, the term is used to mean cyber operations – including cyber-enabled information operations – intended to cause injury to people, damage or significantly disrupt computer systems, or manipulate information for strategic gain. The focus here is on advanced persistent threats (APTs), which are incidents of cyber aggression at a level of sophistication and scope that can only be achieved by states, and so are understood to be state-sponsored.\n\nThomas Schelling, a key deterrence theorist, defined deterrence as part of the diplomacy of\n\nviolence, the 'art of coercion and intimidation. It is about credibly signalling the power to hurt and inflict pain on a potential adversary' without resorting to an actual use of force. By this definition, deterrence of state-directed cyber aggression has been ineffective. This is not surprising, because the implementation of deterrence in cyberspace is extremely challenging.\n\nWhile targeted states could respond kinetically, the least escalatory response involves the use of cyberspace capabilities in return. This requires an effective cyberspace counterstrike capability, a willingness to use it and a public announcement of both. Each of these three steps presents a challenge.\n\nDeveloping and maintaining an arsenal of cyber capabilities, the first step, is difficult. Unlike other strategic capabilities, such as tanks and aircraft carriers, cyber tools are fragile in that they rely on stealth and the exploitation of unknown system vulnerabilities to work. From the moment they are used, they might be exposed to the adversary and, in many cases, easily mitigated or defeated. In addition,\n\nDOI: 10.1080/03071847.2020.1740493",
    "Personalised Deterrence of Cyber Aggression\n\nthe access to adversaries' systems required to make use of cyber capabilities is fleeting. An intruder might be discovered or shut down by vigilant network administrators, or even normal system maintenance. Even if they are not employed, cyber capabilities lose effectiveness over time and eventually become obsolete, as hardware and software generations are developed and fielded.\n\nGovernments can take a number of actions against individual hackers to create costs that might dissuade them from engaging in cyber aggression\n\nEven when an appropriate counterstrike capability is available, the second step of deterrence – willingness to use – can be a hurdle. Discovered cyber capabilities can be repurposed for use by the target or by other bad actors to whom they might offer it. States must weigh the short-term benefit of using an effective cyber tool to respond against the long-term damage that might result should the capability be released into the wild.[10]\n\nPublic statements about cyber capabilities and the willingness to use them, the third step of effective deterrence, have proven just as difficult as the first two. Governments have generally been reluctant to discuss whether they engage in offensive cyber operations. However, the tide may have turned. The US Department of Defense's 2018 Cyber Strategy states that the US 'will accelerate the development of cyber capabilities for both warfighting and countering malicious cyber actors ... fielding capabilities that are scalable, adaptable, and diverse to provide maximum flexibility'.[11] The document goes on to note that the US military 'will be capable of employing cyberspace operations\n\nthroughout the spectrum of conflict, from day-to-day operations to wartime, in order to advance U.S. interests.[12] This is part of the US strategy of 'defending forward', perhaps the clearest cyber deterrence effort to date.\n\nThe UK also acknowledges its offensive cyber capabilities. 'We have the means to take offensive action in cyberspace, should we choose to do so', the UK government noted in the National Cyber Security Strategy 2016-2021.[13] In September 2018, GCHQ and the UK Ministry of Defence announced the creation of a 2,000-member offensive cyber force, which will consist of military personnel, GCHQ officials and private contractors.[14]\n\n# Challenges and Strategies\n\nAcknowledging the possession of cyber capabilities and expressing a general willingness to use them is only the first set of steps towards developing an effective deterrent. To complete the strategy, states should establish – for themselves, their allies and their adversaries – the specific circumstances under which they might employ cyber capabilities. Unfortunately, such specificity creates problems of its own. For example, setting out precisely when it would respond – ‘red lines’ – can limit a state’s response options. Clear pronouncements also inform adversaries about precisely how far they may safely push cyber aggression and may disclose more than is prudent about systems that might be particularly valuable or vulnerable.\n\nThe mechanics of deterrence-driven cyber actions are also complicated by the well-known 'attribution problem'.[15] States must have some level of certainty about the sponsor of cyber aggression to be able to respond confidently. It can be extremely difficult to collect and analyse enough technical proof of responsibility for a cyber incident to convince an international audience. Competent hackers use a number of techniques to obfuscate\n\n© RUSI Journal March 2020",
    "Braw and Brown\n\ntheir connection to the incident. Additionally, states are often unwilling to publicly release all the information they have about cyber incidents as they may have obtained it from a number of intelligence sources that they are unwilling to compromise. Further complicating the situation, cyber responses are sometimes most technically feasible in so-called 'neutral cyberspace' (such as on servers physically located in non-belligerent states). In itself, this action has the potential to be escalatory.\n\nPartly to avoid such escalation, some governments have engaged in a type of naming-and-shaming deterrence. These public campaigns are often directed against government sponsors of cyber attacks. Following the 2017 WannaCry 2.0 malware attack, which hit approximately 300,000 computers in 150 countries, a White House official blamed the North Korean regime, arguing that it must be held accountable.[16] Such naming and shaming has, however, proven to be of limited use. Effective shaming of a government requires convincing evidence that it is responsible for an aggressive cyber incident, and that level of certainty often requires states to reveal classified sources or methods that may be of continuing value if kept secret.[17] Even if the source can be safely disclosed, the attribution process often involves a time-consuming investigation into a complex web of contacts. These challenges mean that public statements are likely to be delayed, lessening the effectiveness of the technique. Regardless, named-and-shamed governments may not be susceptible to reputational damage. Compilations such as the Centre for Strategic and International Studies' Significant Cyber Incidents database list the same state sponsors year after year.[18]\n\nFinally, cyber attacks are frequently perpetrated by individuals or groups only informally or loosely sponsored by states.[19] Sponsoring governments create distance between themselves and their proxies, either by concealing official trails or dealing in informal agreements with non-state groups. Cyber criminals, for example, have been more than willing to work to advance state interests in\n\nreturn for money or political favour. This provides sponsoring states with plausible deniability on the international stage. The stakes are high when fighting fire with fire, and it would be destabilising to respond to a perceived state aggressor if they had no hand in the original activity.\n\nGiven these realities, this article proposes that, rather than trying to affect other states directly, governments should direct their deterrent efforts at individual perpetrators operating at the APT level, regardless of whether their sponsorship can be established in a definitive fashion.\n\nGovernments can take a number of actions against individual hackers to create costs that might dissuade them from engaging in cyber aggression. Examples of these costs are set out below and range from travel bans to financial penalties to criminal prosecution. The authors call this 'personalised deterrence'.\n\n## Personalised Deterrence\n\nPersonalised deterrence focuses on what individual hackers or attackers are most likely to value, and bases deterrence on that individual cost–benefit analysis. While individually deterring cyber attackers is time consuming, it gives the deterring state a wider range of tools – for example, in the areas of reputation and personal mobility – than those available for use against states. By focusing on the individual, the deterring state also alters the required level of attribution and proof from the current near-100% certainty model used to link attacks to hostile governments, to the beyond-reasonable-doubt model used in the criminal justice system.[20] This would have significant consequences, most of them helpful to liberal democracies.\n\nAs Timothy M McKenzie notes:\n\nThe deterrent declaration (or warning) must be loud and clear so the target cannot misread it, clearly documented in national policy, and consistently\n\n16.

    "Personalised Deterrence of Cyber Aggression\n\nechoed in the words and actions of civilian and military leaders. To deter a target actively, one must have the means to threaten the target into inaction.²¹\n\nIn the case of personalised deterrence, not only will the deterrent signal be clear, the threats will become more effective as support for the strategy grows. While it is not easy to identify individuals, it is much easier than trying to link states to incidents. As noted earlier in this article, the proof would be lower for individuals because the cost of a mistake is lower in the case of an individual travel ban, for example. By contrast, a mistake against a state could result in countermeasures. As more states accept the effectiveness of the strategy, more will participate in travel bans, economic repercussions and so on, which will serve to expand the scope of the consequences faced by rogue hackers. Western legal systems afford governments a number of threat options, including: criminal prosecution;²² a permanent ban on entering the targeted country; a permanent ban on owning property in the targeted country; a permanent ban on appointments (such as seats on corporate boards) in the targeted country; and a permanent ban on owning or accessing bank accounts or other aspects of the financial system in the targeted country.\n\nIn addition to options available under the legal system, governments of targeted countries could damage individual perpetrators’ reputations by disclosing their involvement in cyber misdeeds. States and others have already used hacked webcams to take photos of aggressors, releasing the images as part of name-and-shame campaigns.²³ Individualised deterrence in this form would release such images, but would also publicly release information about individual hackers that would cause them embarrassment or otherwise make it difficult for them to carry on as normal. This could include: social media profiles; school and university records; criminal records, if any; and other publicly\n\naccessible information, such as personal tastes and habits, that could cause the perpetrator discomfort if released to the wider public.\n\nThe information to be released will often be available from open sources, but it is not out of the question that targeted states might obtain personal details from perpetrators’ systems while collecting information to establish responsibility for the activity. Like all espionage, obtaining information in this manner would undoubtedly violate the host state’s laws, but is not prohibited under international law.\n\nA primary reason personalised deterrence could be effective is that individuals and states weigh benefits and costs differently. While the benefits gained by a government from a cyber attack might be the weakening of an adversary or access to intelligence, an individual perpetrator seeks more personal benefits: money; foreign travel; a comfortable lifestyle. If the perpetrator of an attack – or a hacker preparing one – may have ambitions to travel or study abroad, or to hold international financial assets, the possibility of forfeiting such opportunities as a result of an employment choice may give them pause. For targeted states, it is a much more straightforward analysis than assessing how to best deter an entire state that might have interests that are entirely opaque.\n\nAn individual-focused approach to deterrence has been tested on a small scale. In 2015 and 2016, then US President Barack Obama signed executive orders imposing sanctions on individuals found to be engaging in malicious cyber activities against targets in the US.²⁴ Even though they failed to gain traction as a deterrence tool, the US government has more recently begun using the criminal justice system to charge individual cyber attackers in court. The proof of concept was the 2014 charging of five members of China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA)\n\n21. McKenzie, ‘Is Cyber Deterrence Possible?’, p. 2.\n22. Prosecution would likely be in absentia, given that aggressor states would be unlikely to extradite perpetrators for prosecution.\n23.

    "Braw and Brown\n\nwith cyber espionage and other offences.²⁵ The case was criticised at the time because it seemed unlikely that Beijing would make the PLA members available for trial in the US. It subsequently became clear that the US rationale for the case was to signal its intent to address China's cyber misbehaviour and to demonstrate a willingness to look past the state to individual actors.²⁶\n\n## Personalised deterrence can drive a wedge between hackers and sponsors, forcing a choice\n\nThe 2014 hack of Sony Pictures was an apparent retaliation by North Korea against Sony's film *The Interview* which ridiculed North Korean ruler Kim Jong-un.²⁷ The attack crippled computers, deleted data and released embarrassing internal emails. In 2018, the US Department of Justice (DoJ) charged North Korean national Park Jin Hyok with conspiring to conduct cyber attacks and intrusions, accusing him of involvement in the Sony incident. The US DoJ also charged Park in connection with the WannaCry 2.0 attack, and for involvement in other cyber attacks.²⁸ It identified him as a member of a North Korean government-sponsored hacking team referred to as the Lazarus Group.²⁹ The US Department of the Treasury imposed sanctions on\n\nhim and against the regime-linked Chosun Expo Joint Venture, where he worked.³⁰ The sanctions include freezing US-controlled financial assets and prohibiting US nationals from engaging in business dealings with the company. In February 2020, the US DoJ went one step further, charging members of the PLA with the hack of credit reporting agency Equifax in 2017.³¹\n\nDuring the 2018 US election campaigns, US Cyber Command is also thought to have communicated to Russian individuals that it knew their identity and was aware of their nefarious activities in cyberspace, in essence warning them that there would be consequences if they interfered with the election.³²\n\nOutside the realm of cyberspace, states have sometimes used sanctions against senior officials of countries in response to aggressive behaviour. Following Russia's annexation of Crimea, for example, the EU and the US imposed so-called 'targeted sanctions' on Russian leaders. The EU's sanctions list includes visa bans and asset freezes for 170 persons,³³ while the US has implemented a range of sanctions, freezing the US-based assets of individuals involved in the annexation.³⁴\n\nWhat distinguishes personalised deterrence from analogous previous efforts is its certainty and formality. US Cyber Command has been on the right track with messages directed at individual hackers, but the reported instances appear to be the exception rather than the rule and are acknowledged only after\n\n25.

    "the fact. Personalised deterrence would go several steps further, publicising the range of possible consequences in advance, and taking the response well beyond notifications, beyond even naming and shaming, to naming, shaming and blaming. The most important aspect of the personalised approach is signalling the likelihood of specific consequences to individual hackers.\n\nDirecting deterrent methods at individual cyber actors thus avoids the necessity of accusing sponsoring governments, who normally deny involvement and make demands for irrefutable proof -- which is usually classified and endlessly debateable. Personalised deterrence can also drive a wedge between hackers and sponsors, forcing a choice. A hacker may be working to advance the interests of a sponsoring government, but the hacker's self-loyalty is likely to trump loyalty to the sponsor. If hackers are provided with clear warning that their personal lives will be directly affected by their hacking activities, they may think twice about what clients to take on and indeed whether to act as government proxies at all. Knowing that they will be placed on an indefinite blacklist for visits to NATO and EU member states as well as partner countries including Australia and New Zealand would pose a powerful deterrent to hackers who may wish to engage in this Western lifestyle. Hackers who may otherwise have engaged as proxies for states may decide the cost--benefit analysis has shifted enough to encourage them to seek other opportunities.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nPersonalised deterrence is an option that could be used by most Western governments. As previously detailed, governments could signal to a hacker engaged in -- or preparing to engage in -- attacks on institutions, companies or organisations located in their countries that the hacker will run risks beyond prosecution. Unmasking in the public domain would be a powerful deterrent against an individual accustomed to operating in obscurity. The same is true for reputational damage: an individual hacker accustomed to anonymity would be unlikely to accept assignments that risked yielding not just his or her name and location, but further information such as potentially embarrassing personal details as well. Because the shaming would include further punitive measures such as visa bans, would-be perpetrators are unlikely to engage in acts of aggression for the purpose of achieving notoriety, a common motivation for some Islamist terrorists and perpetrators of school shootings in the US, Indeed, as many governments can observe hacking attempts in real time, they could signal prospective punishment to the perpetrator even while they are preparing an attack.\n\nStability in cyberspace is critical to the functioning of liberal democracies' economies and national security. Effective, personalised deterrence will help ensure its availability. Although it does not replace other methods of deterrence, it supplements them effectively by using low-cost, non-escalatory means tailored to cyber actors.\n\nA strategy of personalised deterrence will grow more effective as it takes root. Most effectively, individual hackers will spread the word that hacking against certain states and their interests is no longer free of consequences. The same informal communication that enables governments to hire freelance hackers to do their bidding could work to dissuade hackers across the community. Personalised deterrence, with less explosive consequences in the case of error, also allows states to avoid the sticky attribution problem that sponsoring states have used to their advantage for the past two decades.\n\nElisabeth Braw is a Senior Research Fellow at RUSI, where she leads the Modern Deterrence project.\n\nGary Brown is a Professor of Cyber Law at the National Defense University in Washington, DC."
