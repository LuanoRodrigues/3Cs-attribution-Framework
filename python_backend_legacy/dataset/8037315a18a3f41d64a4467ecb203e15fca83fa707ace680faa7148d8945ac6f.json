The answers can be ordered under the following three headings: within man, within the structure of the separate states, within the system\" - Kenneth N. Waltz; Man, The State, and War (1959)\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe conception of the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET), an early predecessor to the internet, brought with it a litany of questions and debates regarding the role of conflict and security in cyberspace. As the internet developed into a tool of common use, these concerns have only been amplified, sustaining the long-term development of legal, defense, and intelligence frameworks. In fact, one of the first concerns leveled toward ARPANET was a lack of security protocol. In 1972, Willis Ware, an engineer working for the Research and Development (RAND) corporation, released a commissioned report on the challenges of securing information in an open network such as the internet.¹ The first of its kind, the “Ware Report” was declassified seven years later, and is widely considered the foundational document for cybersecurity. In it, Ware lists several items of note for the Defense Science Board, outlining actions and future research focused on resource sharing and “facilitating progress toward handling the open [information] environment”.²\n\nToday, power and conflict within the domain of cyberspace has become even more contentious. The relationship between cyberspace and existing international norms is muddied by its position as a domain of conflict that exists entirely within the information environment.³ Traditionally, the information environment has been the purview of espionage and intelligence\n\n¹ Willis Howard Ware, IEEE Computer Society. “Security Controls for Computer Systems, tech. report R-609-PR, RAND, Defense Science Board Task Force on Computer Security, 1972”. R-609- 1-PR was reissued Oct. 1979. This widely circulated report was informally known as 'the Ware report.'\n\n² ibid\n\n³ Bircher, John E. Issue brief.

This constant shift in technological and, by-proxy, environmental conditions challenges the international community’s ability to attribute and respond to harmful acts in cyberspace. Debate is also open on what kinds of activities must be tolerated as the natural costs of competition in this newer domain. The ability to generate outsized effects that might otherwise be too costly indicates that the geopolitical situation of states in competition affects their actions in cyber conflict. Overall, cyberspace violates previously held norms of international relations in ways that often serve to destabilize the current international order at a relatively low cost to the instigating party.⁵\n\nIn order to establish where the current international legal consensus is insufficient to divert or absolve conflict in cyberspace, behavioral norms of states and their proxies in cyber conflict must be positioned geopolitically and contextualized through the lens of current theories of international cyber conflict. This mode of analysis of state actors alongside the current state of international law in cyberspace reveals that barriers to attribution preventing retaliatory action might be hurdled by implementing a due diligence standard of data-sharing; streamlining the identification of hostile actors and potentially narrowing the network pathways that hostile actors can use to generate conflict.\n\n## Project Overview\n\nInterpreting the effects of interstate conflicts in a domain like cyberspace, with the capacity to drastically shift conditions from case-to-case, poses a major challenge to constructing\n\n⁴ Scott, Len &amp; Jackson, Peter.

It presents a description and examination of the current activities of a set of three predominant state powers; The United States, Russia, and China. The case section will frame these states in two ways within the field of international relations and security studies to establish a behavioral archetype of state activity in cyberspace. Firstly, the cases will measure the relative power and trajectory of the states in question, utilizing geostrategic momentum; a comparison of per-capita net resources and the relative success a given state has had in attaining its stated goals.⁶ This measurement will provide insight into how geopolitical context may change the motivations and incentives of powerful states in cyberspace. Secondly, the case study will employ Nazli Choucri’s three categorizations of cyber conflict to define the specific actions of selected states.⁷ Anchored in lateral pressure theory, these categorizations outline the argument that an international coordinated response is necessary to diminish cyber conflict, and helps to delineate which types of conflict in cyberspace could be affected by an international legal response. The goal of such a case comparison is to establish, through consistent and formal analysis,⁸ any cross-case behaviors in cyberspace that come into conflict with the durability of the current international status quo, how these courses of action are chosen, and how these activities obscure themselves from traditional thresholds of attribution in cyber conflict.\n\nThe main structural theory that this case study utilizes is the categorization of cyber conflict developed by Nazli Choucri, as an extension of the broader lateral pressure theory.⁹\n\n⁶ Michael Beckley; The Power of Nations: Measuring What Matters.

As stated in an overview of lateral pressure theory:\n\n“As states expand their activities outside territorial boundaries, they encounter other states similarly engaged. Expansion may result in intersections among spheres of influence and set in motion complex interactions that can lead to escalation and conflict – or to cooperation and collaboration – depending on intents and capabilities.”¹⁰\n\nUnder lateral pressure theory, Cyberspace affects international relations in seven different ways:\n\nTable 1.1\nCharacteristics of cyberspace\n\n- Temporality—replaces conventional temporality with near instantaneity\n- Physicality—transcends constraints of geography and physical location\n- Permeation—penetrates boundaries and jurisdictions\n- Fluidity—manifests sustained shifts and reconfigurations\n- Participation—reduces barriers to activism and political expression\n- Attribution—obscures identities of actors and links to action\n- Accountability—bypasses mechanisms of responsibility\n\nChoucri, N.

These strategies necessitate an examination of the current conditions of international cyber conflict, and the development of guidelines for establishing cooperative strategies of attribution in this relatively new domain.\n\nChoucri characterizes three different categories of international cyber conflict; contentions over the architecture and management of cyberspace, cyber conflict for political advantage and profit, and cyber threats to national security. Architecture and management conflicts take place primarily outside of cyberspace, but state activities within cyberspace are a primary affecting agent in such negotiations, and the results of these contentions can shape the nature of cyberspace as a whole domain. The other two types of cyber conflict are inseparable from the architecture of cyberspace itself, and so any treaties or agreements governing them must account for this first type of cyber conflict, although it takes place in the “real” domain.\n\nCyber conflict for political advantage and profit comprise the widest band of interstate conflict in cyberspace.

In the context of international lawmaking however, the national security concerns of a state provide a steep incentive that often shape its diplomatic priorities. An assessment of these concerns will inform the discussion of where international law currently fails to address cyber conflict.\n\nTable 6.1 Cyber conflicts and threats to security\n\n|   | Types | Cases  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  I. | Contentions over architecture and management of cyberspace | End-to-end argument\nLayers principle\nNetwork neutrality\n“Code is Law”  |\n|  II. | Cyber conflict for political advantage and profit | State power for political control\nCyber challenges to the state\nCompetitive politics via cyber venues\nCyber crime and cyber espionage  |\n|  III. | Cyber threats to national security | Militarization of cyberspace\nCyber warfare\nCyber threats to infrastructure\nCyber terrorism  |\n\nChoucri, N.

Choucri identifies four principles of architecture and management pertinent to the first kind of cyber conflict: the end-to-end argument, the layers principle, network neutrality, and “Code is Law”.\n\nThe end-to-end argument and layers principle work together to form cyberspace as it conceptually is. End-to-end refers to the layered structure of information passage through the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol(TCP/IP); namely that communication protocols are justified in the lower layers. This nature of TCP/IP is fundamental to the way cyberspace works, and so begets the layers principle: “the law should respect the integrity of layered Internet architecture.”¹⁴\n\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\nThese network structures were produced by, and remain dominantly under the control of, American non-profits and the private sector; but the implications of these two principles to a review of current international law are clear. Effective multilateral agreements with regard to cyberspace should adequately address the TCP/IP structure by not violating the layered structure, or risk undermining the viability of the network for its intended purpose.

This is the principle that receives the most contention from nations outside the United States.\n\nAn archetypal example of refuting network neutrality is China's Golden Shield project, colloquially known as the \"Great Firewall\".[15] While the activities of the Golden Shield program are an expression of state power for political control, a different sub-category of cyber conflict; the denial of access to certain cyber-spaces at the transport layer indicates that the PRC opposes or at least disregards the concept of net neutrality as a necessary component of cyberspace.\n\nThe final principle of architectural conflicts regarding cyberspace is a dictum that neatly surmises the first three in a neutral package: \"Code is Law\". Cyberspace is a human-made realm, and the constructed network structure that allows cyberspace to work also determines the limitations of how it can be used. Ultimately, this is a system determined by consensus of real domain actors, and a change in consensus can potentially change the structure of cyberspace as well.[16]\n\n[15] S. Chandel, Z. Jingji, Y.

In other words, the increasingly political nature of the cyber domain generally contributes to a growing propensity to use traditional regulatory instruments and leverages.”¹⁷\n\nThis correlate signals that as cyberspace is politicized, there is greater opportunity to address conflicts within it through more traditional means, such as treaty or custom. The architectural and managerial principles of cyberspace provide a clear outline of how states can effectively craft international laws of cyberspace: with respect for its layered structure, with clear consensus definitions of neutrality, and with the acknowledgement that changing consensus can change the cyber environment itself.\n\nThe widest band of state activity falls into the second category of cyber conflict: conflict for political advantage and profit. There are two major pathways for this type of cyber conflict to affect international relations; cybercrime including espionage, and competitive politics through cyberspace.\n\nA distinction between these two activity types is their visibility. Competitive politics that employ cyberspace to accomplish goals tend to be fairly visible, taking place on the open web and frequently in tandem with real domain activity. Many competitive political strategies that take place in cyberspace utilize visibility as a primary component; either by uplifting the qualities of the acting state, or by displaying the shortcomings and flaws of an opposing state.\n\n¹⁷ Choucri, N.

This type of activity can include using cyberspace to spy; hacking into government databases to retrieve classified information. It can also include the discreet theft of intellectual property, and the corruption of competitor states' information networks.\n\nWhile a distinguishing factor between competitive politics and cybercrime/espionage is visibility, both share features that challenge a nation's ability to attribute these activities. A hostile actor may transmit data through the network infrastructure of third-party states in order to disguise the origin of cybercrime, or call upon a foreign asset to publish propaganda from a distant geographic location, offering a means of obscuring the propaganda's source. The capacity that cyberspace creates for states to escalate competitive actions while maintaining deniability generates the third type of cyber conflict characterized by Choucri: cyber threats to national security.\n\nCyber threats to national security have been rising exponentially, generated by both cybercrime and competitive politics. This category includes militarization of cyberspace, cyber terrorism, threats to infrastructure and cyberwarfare generally. Most notably, these threats take specific forms based on the first two types of cyber conflict; their structure is limited by the architecture of cyberspace, and their purpose informed by the competitive politics therein. Cyber threats to national security are felt widely and are coming from all over the world, leveraging the permeability of cyberspace and its disregard for political borders.[18] In order to maintain cyberspace as a normative domain of international relations, while diminishing cyber threats to national security, a coordinated international response is necessary and may be facilitated\n\n[18] Talbot, David. 2010. *Moore’s Outlaws*.

To this end, China’s approach to cyber conflict indicates an acknowledgement of areas where the PRC’s power is most advantageous, such as economy and political influence.²⁷ Two such examples of China’s activity in cyber conflict include the “Great Firewall”, and “Great Cannon” methods.\n\nChina’s Great Firewall is an IP-based national internet boundary that blocks content in opposition to PRC objectives at the “gateway”(Transmission Layer of TCP/IP). This method of national censorship has come under fire as directly oppositional to the principle of network neutrality, and as China has expanded its exposure to western economies and societies, the Great Firewall approach has somewhat broken down and evolved toward individual surveillance under the Golden Shield Project. The Great Firewall and Golden Shield are manifestations of a normative counterargument to network neutrality, referred to casually as “cyber sovereignty”.²⁸ This opposition to network neutrality falls firmly under the first type of Choucri’s categories of cyber conflict; conflict regarding the architecture and management of cyberspace.

The Great Cannon is a program that allows its user to inject malware into internet traffic passing through the Great Firewall. It leverages the massive internet user base in China to generate nearly insurmountable distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks; effectively closing down targeted websites. In March 2015, the non-profit Great Fire, which assists citizens of China in circumventing the Great Firewall, was targeted by the Great Cannon. The attack lasted five days, and targeted both the website as well as its host server with Amazon CloudFront, costing them nearly $30,000 a day in sustained denial of service. Between 2015 and 2018, evidence of Great Cannon activity arose in cyberattacks targeting apps used by the Hong Kong student protests, such as PopVote.²⁹\n\nBecause the Great Cannon shares source code with the Great Firewall, and has been used almost exclusively to damage the online presence of entities that oppose the PRC, it is almost certainly attributable to the PRC and its organs. It is also used primarily toward regions that Chinese officials consider \"domestic\". The PRC's approach to threats to their foreign interests is more detached.

Because of the quietness of the attack, it took US officials nearly five years to locate and attribute the malware, and only with the additional help of Dutch intelligence services.

To the concern of the security and of every nation, incomplete or undecided legal doctrine on cyber conflict provides room for states to block attributability of internationally wrongful acts, avoiding traditional repercussions. Many current standards of international law overlap conceptually with state activity in cyberspace, but do not adequately address how the nature of cyberspace itself affects decision making in this domain.\n\nThrough the national profiles of activity in cyberspace, it is clear that states are not necessarily incentivized to work together at the risk of revealing their own activities in cyberspace. Getting powerful nations to dedicate large amounts of resources to stopping cyber conflict will pose a challenge, even though a more stable cyberspace is a communal good. A possible incentive to join in cooperative responses through treaty and custom may be overall exposure to cyber conflicts. Further study on specific measurable variables that could trace a given state's exposure to cyber conflict of any or all types is available through Choucri's work, and developing these measurements could help tailor specific incentive options for nations to collaborate on treaties addressing cyber conflict attribution.\n\n⁴⁹ The Application of International Law to State Activity in Cyberspace New Zealand Office of Foreign Affairs (1 December 2020)\n⁵⁰ International cyber law: interactive toolkit.

Enough nations doing so can create a “dragnet” effect, accelerating the attribution of malicious actors who would utilize public networks. Such an effect could cool cyber conflicts overall, by addressing the core incentive toward cyber conflict by heightening the initial costs to actors who would hope to remain anonymous.\n\n⁵¹ Jensen, Eric Talbot and Watts, Sean and Watts, Sean, *A Cyber Duty of Due Diligence: Gentle Civilizer or Crude Destabilizer?* (July 13, 2017). 95 Texas Law Review 1555 (2017), BYU Law Research Paper No. 17-16, Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3002036",

The answers can be ordered under the following three headings: within man, within the structure of the separate states, within the system\" - Kenneth N. Waltz; Man, The State, and War (1959)\n## Introduction\nThe conception of the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET), an early predecessor to the internet, brought with it a litany of questions and debates regarding the role of conflict and security in cyberspace. As the internet developed into a tool of common use, these concerns have only been amplified, sustaining the long-term development of legal, defense, and intelligence frameworks. In fact, one of the first concerns leveled toward ARPANET was a lack of security protocol. In 1972, Willis Ware, an engineer working for the Research and Development (RAND) corporation, released a commissioned report on the challenges of securing information in an open network such as the internet.¹ The first of its kind, the “Ware Report” was declassified seven years later, and is widely considered the foundational document for cybersecurity. In it, Ware lists several items of note for the Defense Science Board, outlining actions and future research focused on resource sharing and “facilitating progress toward handling the open [information] environment”.²\nToday, power and conflict within the domain of cyberspace has become even more contentious. The relationship between cyberspace and existing international norms is muddied by its position as a domain of conflict that exists entirely within the information environment.³ Traditionally, the information environment has been the purview of espionage and intelligence\n¹ Willis Howard Ware, IEEE Computer Society. “Security Controls for Computer Systems, tech. report R-609-PR, RAND, Defense Science Board Task Force on Computer Security, 1972”. R-609- 1-PR was reissued Oct. 1979. This widely circulated report was informally known as 'the Ware report.'\n² ibid\n³ Bircher, John E. Issue brief.

This constant shift in technological and, by-proxy, environmental conditions challenges the international community’s ability to attribute and respond to harmful acts in cyberspace. Debate is also open on what kinds of activities must be tolerated as the natural costs of competition in this newer domain. The ability to generate outsized effects that might otherwise be too costly indicates that the geopolitical situation of states in competition affects their actions in cyber conflict. Overall, cyberspace violates previously held norms of international relations in ways that often serve to destabilize the current international order at a relatively low cost to the instigating party.⁵\nIn order to establish where the current international legal consensus is insufficient to divert or absolve conflict in cyberspace, behavioral norms of states and their proxies in cyber conflict must be positioned geopolitically and contextualized through the lens of current theories of international cyber conflict. This mode of analysis of state actors alongside the current state of international law in cyberspace reveals that barriers to attribution preventing retaliatory action might be hurdled by implementing a due diligence standard of data-sharing; streamlining the identification of hostile actors and potentially narrowing the network pathways that hostile actors can use to generate conflict.\n## Project Overview\nInterpreting the effects of interstate conflicts in a domain like cyberspace, with the capacity to drastically shift conditions from case-to-case, poses a major challenge to constructing\n⁴ Scott, Len &amp; Jackson, Peter.

It presents a description and examination of the current activities of a set of three predominant state powers; The United States, Russia, and China. The case section will frame these states in two ways within the field of international relations and security studies to establish a behavioral archetype of state activity in cyberspace. Firstly, the cases will measure the relative power and trajectory of the states in question, utilizing geostrategic momentum; a comparison of per-capita net resources and the relative success a given state has had in attaining its stated goals.⁶ This measurement will provide insight into how geopolitical context may change the motivations and incentives of powerful states in cyberspace. Secondly, the case study will employ Nazli Choucri’s three categorizations of cyber conflict to define the specific actions of selected states.⁷ Anchored in lateral pressure theory, these categorizations outline the argument that an international coordinated response is necessary to diminish cyber conflict, and helps to delineate which types of conflict in cyberspace could be affected by an international legal response. The goal of such a case comparison is to establish, through consistent and formal analysis,⁸ any cross-case behaviors in cyberspace that come into conflict with the durability of the current international status quo, how these courses of action are chosen, and how these activities obscure themselves from traditional thresholds of attribution in cyber conflict.\nThe main structural theory that this case study utilizes is the categorization of cyber conflict developed by Nazli Choucri, as an extension of the broader lateral pressure theory.⁹\n⁶ Michael Beckley; The Power of Nations: Measuring What Matters.

What is Lateral Pressure? | Nazli Choucri. Retrieved April 16, 2023, from https://nchoucri.mit.edu/theory/lateral-pressure\nTurner 4\nCyber conflict within lateral pressure theory is contextualized by a state’s propensity to act beyond its established boundaries, and measures this propensity through three driving factors; people, resources, and technology. As stated in an overview of lateral pressure theory:\n“As states expand their activities outside territorial boundaries, they encounter other states similarly engaged. Expansion may result in intersections among spheres of influence and set in motion complex interactions that can lead to escalation and conflict – or to cooperation and collaboration – depending on intents and capabilities.”¹⁰\nUnder lateral pressure theory, Cyberspace affects international relations in seven different ways:\nTable 1.1\nCharacteristics of cyberspace\n- Temporality—replaces conventional temporality with near instantaneity\n- Physicality—transcends constraints of geography and physical location\n- Permeation—penetrates boundaries and jurisdictions\n- Fluidity—manifests sustained shifts and reconfigurations\n- Participation—reduces barriers to activism and political expression\n- Attribution—obscures identities of actors and links to action\n- Accountability—bypasses mechanisms of responsibility\nChoucri, N.

These strategies necessitate an examination of the current conditions of international cyber conflict, and the development of guidelines for establishing cooperative strategies of attribution in this relatively new domain.\nChoucri characterizes three different categories of international cyber conflict; contentions over the architecture and management of cyberspace, cyber conflict for political advantage and profit, and cyber threats to national security. Architecture and management conflicts take place primarily outside of cyberspace, but state activities within cyberspace are a primary affecting agent in such negotiations, and the results of these contentions can shape the nature of cyberspace as a whole domain. The other two types of cyber conflict are inseparable from the architecture of cyberspace itself, and so any treaties or agreements governing them must account for this first type of cyber conflict, although it takes place in the “real” domain.\nCyber conflict for political advantage and profit comprise the widest band of interstate conflict in cyberspace. These conflicts include many national concerns, but “become\n¹¹ Choucri, N. (2012). Cyberpolitics in International Relations.

In the context of international lawmaking however, the national security concerns of a state provide a steep incentive that often shape its diplomatic priorities. An assessment of these concerns will inform the discussion of where international law currently fails to address cyber conflict.\nTable 6.1 Cyber conflicts and threats to security\n|   | Types | Cases  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  I. | Contentions over architecture and management of cyberspace | End-to-end argument\nLayers principle\nNetwork neutrality\n“Code is Law”  |\n|  II. | Cyber conflict for political advantage and profit | State power for political control\nCyber challenges to the state\nCompetitive politics via cyber venues\nCyber crime and cyber espionage  |\n|  III. | Cyber threats to national security | Militarization of cyberspace\nCyber warfare\nCyber threats to infrastructure\nCyber terrorism  |\nChoucri, N. (2012). Cyberpolitics in International Relations. Table 6.1 The MIT Press. http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hhkrs\nContentions over architecture and management arise in the real domain as conflicts regarding the way that cyberspace is structured and regulated. Until recently, the United States\n¹³ Choucri, N. (2012). Cyberpolitics in International Relations. The MIT Press. http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hhkrs\nTurner 7\nhosted many of the organizations that oversee the regulation and structure of cyberspace at-large, but at the state level, the picture is a bit more fragmented. Choucri identifies four principles of architecture and management pertinent to the first kind of cyber conflict: the end-to-end argument, the layers principle, network neutrality, and “Code is Law”.\nThe end-to-end argument and layers principle work together to form cyberspace as it conceptually is. End-to-end refers to the layered structure of information passage through the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol(TCP/IP); namely that communication protocols are justified in the lower layers. This nature of TCP/IP is fundamental to the way cyberspace works, and so begets the layers principle: “the law should respect the integrity of layered Internet architecture.”¹⁴\nThese network structures were produced by, and remain dominantly under the control of, American non-profits and the private sector; but the implications of these two principles to a review of current international law are clear. Effective multilateral agreements with regard to cyberspace should adequately address the TCP/IP structure by not violating the layered structure, or risk undermining the viability of the network for its intended purpose. This can be most\n¹⁴ Solum, Lawrence B. and Minn Chung. 2003. *The Layers Principle: Internet Architecture and the Law*. Public Law and Legal Theory Research Paper 55, University of San Diego School of Law, June.\nTurner 8\ndirectly achieved by regulating layers specifically, and applying regulations narrowly to the layers they affect.\nThe principle of network neutrality is associated with the architecture of the internet, but reflects an ideological bent, and as such has come to the center of debates regarding access to the open web. network neutrality proposes that the structure of cyberspace should concern itself only with transmission and connectivity, and not interfere with neutral access to any content on the web. This is the principle that receives the most contention from nations outside the United States.\nAn archetypal example of refuting network neutrality is China's Golden Shield project, colloquially known as the \"Great Firewall\".[15] While the activities of the Golden Shield program are an expression of state power for political control, a different sub-category of cyber conflict; the denial of access to certain cyber-spaces at the transport layer indicates that the PRC opposes or at least disregards the concept of net neutrality as a necessary component of cyberspace.\nThe final principle of architectural conflicts regarding cyberspace is a dictum that neatly surmises the first three in a neutral package: \"Code is Law\". Cyberspace is a human-made realm, and the constructed network structure that allows cyberspace to work also determines the limitations of how it can be used. Ultimately, this is a system determined by consensus of real domain actors, and a change in consensus can potentially change the structure of cyberspace as well.[16]\n[15] S. Chandel, Z. Jingji, Y. Yunnan, S. Jingyao and Z. Zhipeng, \"The Golden Shield Project of China: A Decade Later—An in-Depth Study of the Great Firewall,\" 2019 International Conference on Cyber-Enabled Distributed Computing and Knowledge Discovery (CyberC), Guilin, China, 2019, pp. 111-119, doi: 10.1109/CyberC.2019.00027.\n[16] Lessig, Lawrence. 1999. Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace. New York : Basic Books.\nTurner 9\nChoucri draws several correlates from these principles of cyber conflict, but the one most relevant to the creation of international law is as follows:\n“...The third correlate is the close coupling of politicization in cyberspace with the uses of regulatory instruments that have been effective in kinetic domains. In other words, the increasingly political nature of the cyber domain generally contributes to a growing propensity to use traditional regulatory instruments and leverages.”¹⁷\nThis correlate signals that as cyberspace is politicized, there is greater opportunity to address conflicts within it through more traditional means, such as treaty or custom. The architectural and managerial principles of cyberspace provide a clear outline of how states can effectively craft international laws of cyberspace: with respect for its layered structure, with clear consensus definitions of neutrality, and with the acknowledgement that changing consensus can change the cyber environment itself.\nThe widest band of state activity falls into the second category of cyber conflict: conflict for political advantage and profit. There are two major pathways for this type of cyber conflict to affect international relations; cybercrime including espionage, and competitive politics through cyberspace.\nA distinction between these two activity types is their visibility. Competitive politics that employ cyberspace to accomplish goals tend to be fairly visible, taking place on the open web and frequently in tandem with real domain activity. Many competitive political strategies that take place in cyberspace utilize visibility as a primary component; either by uplifting the qualities of the acting state, or by displaying the shortcomings and flaws of an opposing state.\n¹⁷ Choucri, N. (2012). Cyberpolitics in International Relations. The MIT Press. http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hhkrs\nTurner 10\nCybercrime and espionage, on the other hand, by its very nature incorporates efforts to remain clandestine while generating political or economic gain for the actor. This type of activity can include using cyberspace to spy; hacking into government databases to retrieve classified information. It can also include the discreet theft of intellectual property, and the corruption of competitor states' information networks.\nWhile a distinguishing factor between competitive politics and cybercrime/espionage is visibility, both share features that challenge a nation's ability to attribute these activities. A hostile actor may transmit data through the network infrastructure of third-party states in order to disguise the origin of cybercrime, or call upon a foreign asset to publish propaganda from a distant geographic location, offering a means of obscuring the propaganda's source. The capacity that cyberspace creates for states to escalate competitive actions while maintaining deniability generates the third type of cyber conflict characterized by Choucri: cyber threats to national security.\nCyber threats to national security have been rising exponentially, generated by both cybercrime and competitive politics. This category includes militarization of cyberspace, cyber terrorism, threats to infrastructure and cyberwarfare generally. Most notably, these threats take specific forms based on the first two types of cyber conflict; their structure is limited by the architecture of cyberspace, and their purpose informed by the competitive politics therein. Cyber threats to national security are felt widely and are coming from all over the world, leveraging the permeability of cyberspace and its disregard for political borders.[18] In order to maintain cyberspace as a normative domain of international relations, while diminishing cyber threats to national security, a coordinated international response is necessary and may be facilitated\n[18] Talbot, David. 2010. *Moore’s Outlaws*.

This measurement aligns with the lateral pressure framework of observing people, resources, and technology to draw its conclusions. International relations scholar Dani Belo has proposed a means of measuring the strategic actions of states over time by comparing socio-economic patterns with the level of success a nation has achieved relative to\nTurner 12\ntheir stated goals.¹⁹ Belo grounds this framework of “geostrategic momentum” in a hybrid approach to measuring power first developed by Michael Beckley and later revisited by Caleb Pomeroy, measuring both net resources and expenses per-capita, weighing these measurements against outcomes over time to determine a nation’s relative power.²⁰ ²¹ These measurements are expressed by placing a nation’s “actual role” globally in juxtaposition with its “ideal role” based on its net per-capita resources and frequency of successful foreign policy actions.\nAn additional consideration that these case studies must make is that some less intensive types of cyber conflict are not necessarily the subject of international law. Cyberspace has greatly enhanced the opportunity for states to engage in intelligence competition; the practice of examining and generating actionable intelligence from the open information environment. This activity, while competitive and generative of conflict, is broadly accepted by states as an inherent cost to information sharing. When determining which activities necessitate a cooperative international legal response, an examination of how cyber conflict exceeds the bounds of acceptable competition must be undertaken.²² Such examinations indicate that the primary means through which cyber conflict exceeds the upper threshold of intelligence competition is the ability to generate large detrimental or deterrent effects at very little cost; a resource-asymmetry that has significant practical implications for competing states.²³\n¹⁹ Belo, Dani.

Costs of information gathering are greatly reduced through networked computer systems, both closed and open. These states and their pseudo- or non- state proxies may also readily launch low-level attacks such as disinformation campaigns without incurring the same disruptive costs that a military psychological operation or traditional propaganda effort may incur. instances of infrastructural sabotage, such as the disruption and denial of telecom and financial transaction services through malware and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, also provide directly damaging options to states at very little cost comparable to similar courses of action.²⁴ The same principle of low-cost information warfare applies to more powerful states, when the other conditions of competition are less favorable.\nBelo’s measurement of geostrategic momentum characterizes the motivations of state actors, and Choucri’s categorization of cyber conflicts outlines the need for cooperative international responses, and frames the structural limitations of any such response. Taken together through focused case comparisons, an international legal response that can effectively attribute actions harmful cyber conflict may emerge.\n## Cases\n## China\nIn parallel with the chronological development of cyberspace as a domain of international conflict, China has held a steeply ascendant trajectory in nearly every realm of state power.²⁵ As the primary political and economic rival of the United States, China holds advantages that loom large over the question of unipolarity. Namely, China’s actual global role is much smaller than its\n²⁴ Clarke, R.A.; Knake, R.K. (2010). Cyber War: The Next Threat To National Security And What To Do About It.

Oxford University Press.\nTurner 14\npotential role, by a margin similar to the inverse of the United States (whose actual role tends to exceed its ideal potential role).²⁶\nThis potentiality gap provides opportunity to move more slowly than other nations with revisionist intent; utilizing a multiplicity of low-level conflict to subvert the option of open warfare with their great-power rival. Notably, military power remains one area where the United States maintains a clearly superior capacity. To this end, China’s approach to cyber conflict indicates an acknowledgement of areas where the PRC’s power is most advantageous, such as economy and political influence.²⁷ Two such examples of China’s activity in cyber conflict include the “Great Firewall”, and “Great Cannon” methods.\nChina’s Great Firewall is an IP-based national internet boundary that blocks content in opposition to PRC objectives at the “gateway”(Transmission Layer of TCP/IP). This method of national censorship has come under fire as directly oppositional to the principle of network neutrality, and as China has expanded its exposure to western economies and societies, the Great Firewall approach has somewhat broken down and evolved toward individual surveillance under the Golden Shield Project. The Great Firewall and Golden Shield are manifestations of a normative counterargument to network neutrality, referred to casually as “cyber sovereignty”.²⁸ This opposition to network neutrality falls firmly under the first type of Choucri’s categories of cyber conflict; conflict regarding the architecture and management of cyberspace. In light of heavy domestic and international opposition to the PRC’s conception of cyber sovereignty, China\n²⁶ Pepe, Dr. Michael S., and Kaitlyn Krolik. “Using Power Cycle Theory and Role Realignment Theory to Recognize the International Roles of China and the United States.” International Journal of Business and Social Science, vol. 8, no. 4, Apr. 2017, pp. 20–28.\n²⁷ Booze Allen Hamilton (2022).

The Great Cannon is a program that allows its user to inject malware into internet traffic passing through the Great Firewall. It leverages the massive internet user base in China to generate nearly insurmountable distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks; effectively closing down targeted websites. In March 2015, the non-profit Great Fire, which assists citizens of China in circumventing the Great Firewall, was targeted by the Great Cannon. The attack lasted five days, and targeted both the website as well as its host server with Amazon CloudFront, costing them nearly $30,000 a day in sustained denial of service. Between 2015 and 2018, evidence of Great Cannon activity arose in cyberattacks targeting apps used by the Hong Kong student protests, such as PopVote.²⁹\nBecause the Great Cannon shares source code with the Great Firewall, and has been used almost exclusively to damage the online presence of entities that oppose the PRC, it is almost certainly attributable to the PRC and its organs. It is also used primarily toward regions that Chinese officials consider \"domestic\". The PRC's approach to threats to their foreign interests is more detached. While many of the tactics remain similar, they utilize sponsored and aligned groups of hackers who may not be considered to be under the direct control of the PRC.³⁰ This speaks directly to China's geopolitical situation.\n²⁹ “佔中網被駭 恐影響投票數 (“Occupy Central Online Hacked.

Booze Allen Hamilton.\nTurner 16\nUnlike the actors in other cases, China's geopolitical position contains explicit benefits to maintaining a significantly more damaging but less attributable approach afforded by cyber conflict. The economic benefit that the PRC enjoys under the current international order is not something that China can necessarily afford to lose; and most of China's offensive cyber capabilities are positioned toward the political sustainability of the PRC.[31] This strategy appears designed to frustrate current oppositional international power structures, without generating kinetic threats to opposing states' national security. These activities outline an objective to stably shift power in cyberspace toward China by leveraging the massive user base within the Great Firewall; without engaging in hostility through more conventional means, or in areas where opposing state powers remain strongly superior.[32]\nWhen it comes to the international harm deployed by this strategy, it is difficult to stabilize against or directly deter through the system of international law. The strategy that China has selected obscures attribution of hostilities, while still creating circumstances that benefit China's own accumulation of power.[33] Still, generating an adequate means of attributing these types of conflict, whether they are enacted by a state or state-sponsored organization, may provide a pathway toward repair under international law.\n## Russia\nUnlike China's strategy, archetypal of a state actor ascending in overall power and influence; Russia's overall profile has been on a declining track for some time, their actual role\n[31] Hodgson, Q.

Russia presents a unique case as a great power in decline. Due to generational shock and chronic poverty, Russia has suffered a severely low birth rate since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, only recently reaching replacement levels again in 2007.³⁴ This decline in relative population has suppressed Russia’s own defense capabilities entering the 21st Century. According to Belo,\n“The country possesses vast natural resources reserves and a large military, but the liabilities are enormous. Russia’s stagnating real wages, low labor productivity, internal political instability, decline in population, and increased spending on welfare decrease its potential to invest resources in elements of soft and hard power”³⁵\nRussia’s activity in cyber conflict has a strong tendency to rely on offensive capabilities regionally and in parallel with kinetic conflict and expansionist efforts, often targeting critical infrastructure.³⁶ These tactics have increased in frequency and severity since 2007, in parallel with Russia's expansionist endeavors in Georgia, Crimea, and Ukraine.³⁷\nAnalysis of Russia’s near-abroad activity and outcomes show them to belong squarely to Choucri’s second category of cyber conflict; as a continuation of a larger strategy to “draft” power by degrading the capacity of their geopolitical region such that their relative power does not decline, despite their actual power doing so inevitably. A particularly strong evidentiary strategy is the intensity of Russia’s diasporadical outreach and the volume of russo-nationalistic propaganda that comprises their cyberspace presence in the post-soviet region.

Globally, Russia utilizes low-level offensive strategies in cyberspace such as misinformation and espionage where more direct offenses would garner severe repercussions. The relative power of Russia’s targets in cyberspace also has a strong corollary with the chosen modes of cyber conflict.³⁹ The Agent.btz incursion is a perfect example of Russia’s selective conflict.\nIn 2008, an incursion of malware meant to locate and retrieve sensitive information from closed government sites was identified in networks around the world, including the U.S. Department of Defense’s classified intranet.⁴⁰ The incursion was named Agent.btz. The DoD determined that while no sensitive information was retrieved, the progenitor of the malware did have access to said information.\nThe brilliance of agent.btz was in its function: while it observed the network, it did not retrieve or send classified data at any point; operating more like a periscope into stored classified documents. Because of the quietness of the attack, it took US officials nearly five years to locate and attribute the malware, and only with the additional help of Dutch intelligence services. By that point, there was administrative disagreement on how to respond given that so much time had passed.\n³⁸ Gabuev, A. (2018, February 23).

Often, offenses are carried out by state-sponsored private actors and proxies, further confusing the ability to construct a strategic response. Utilizing sponsored non-state actors also creates jurisdictional barriers that must be overcome by victim states, in terms of seeking reparation.\nEven when malware such as this becomes attributable to Russia, it is specifically to groups that do not necessarily meet the standard of government authority for attribution; groups like the Dukes. CozyDuke, known officially as APT(Advanced Persistent Threat)29, is one such group that works to specifically target Executive offices of states opposed to Russia, including the White House and US State Department. Such groups are technically private actors, often financed anonymously and provided instructions through non-cyber backchannels, obscuring attributability further.\n## The United States\nThe ability to obscure attribution doesn’t only serve less powerful nations; it can also be of value to more powerful nations who find themselves in less favorable positions. This often happens to the United States. As the progenitor of the needed network infrastructure for cyberspace activities, the United States maintains a technical advantage as a unipole that must be iterated to be maintained as the conditions of cyberspace evolve.⁴¹ Access to the open web is steadily rising over time, and this advantageous factor is no longer prominent enough to prevent damaging cyber conflict involving the United States.⁴² Preservation of the interests of the United\n⁴¹ Yuan-kang Wang (2020) *The Durability of a Unipolar System: Lessons from East Asian History*, Security Studies, 29:5, 832-863, DOI: 10.1080/09636412.2020.1859127\n⁴² Brantly, Aaron F. “Entanglement in Cyberspace: Minding the Deterrence Gap.” Democracy and Security 16, no. 3 (2020): 210–33. https://doi.org/10.1080/17419166.2020.1773807.\nTurner 20\nStates as a unipole requires a strategy that acknowledges mere advantage as insufficient to generate complete deterrence, but a necessary component to maintain its interests in all three categories of cyber conflict described by Choucri. Currently, the United States' contentions over the architecture and management of cyberspace are more about maintaining norms than establishing new ones, and fostering passive technological advances that allow the maintenance of a dominant cyberspace presence. conditions of cyber conflict for political gain or profit indicate that a hyper-defensive \"Firewall\" approach similar to that of China would not provide the United States a full deterrence strategy.⁴³ Rather, The United States has explored possible responses to cyber conflict with certain conditions and responsibilities in mind: Non-escalation of the conflict itself, maintenance of its technological edge, and accurate and prompt attribution of internationally wrongful acts.⁴⁴ ⁴⁵ ⁴⁶\nUnfortunately, when the United States does itself engage in cyber conflict for political gain, it frequently does not follow these tendencies. This was the case with the Stuxnet virus. Stuxnet was a malware focused toward the industrial controls of Iranian nuclear research infrastructure, assumedly through a planted USB drive. The virus itself used pieces of code found earlier within the conficker virus, a \"worm\" type virus that originated in Romania.⁴⁷ What it did was effectively destroy Iranian nuclear research infrastructure without creating a nuclear crisis, or inserting a military force of any kind. This incident forced a major question of conflict to the forefront: is an attack that creates an effect similar to military intervention, but does not\n⁴³ Valeriano, B., &amp; Maness, R. C. (2014).

(2011). Worm: The first digital world war. Atlantic Monthly Press.\nTurner 21\nactually require military intervention, still a violation of a state’s sovereignty? The debate on this question has been mostly delayed, due in part to the obfuscation of attributability.⁴⁸ While the attack has been all but traced back to the United States and its allies, clever use of cooperative regional proxies and obfuscatory tactics that the US had itself been victim of in the past has kept true accountability for Stuxnet out of reach.\nA major concern with the implementation of Stuxnet is that it may offer legitimacy to tactics that are ultimately harmful to a cooperative mitigation of cyber threats to national security. Lending credence to tactics that deny attribution is a high-risk strategy for the United States to undertake, and may not serve to maintain their current level of dominance in the cyber domain, given the relationship between these types of conflict and the national security threats they generate.\n## Legal Analysis of Case Activity\nDespite the many ways that cyberspace allows states in conflict to obfuscate attribution for damaging actions, the standards of attributing a wrongful act remain fairly clear. An internationally wrongful act can be attributed to a state when:\n(1) The actor has been empowered with government authority,\nand\n(2) when the act is taken as an exercise of that government authority.\nThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization CCDCOE Cyber Law Toolkit notes that\n⁴⁸ Marr, Carson (2019) \"Cyberwarfare and Applied Just War Theory: Assessing the Stuxnet Worm through Jus ad Bellum and Jus in Bello,\" Penn Journal of Philosophy, Politics &amp; Economics: Vol. 14: Iss. 1, Article 2. Available at: https://repository.upenn.edu/spice/vol14/iss1/2\nTurner 22\n\"An internationally wrongful act can be attributed to a state if it was carried out by organs of the state, persons or entities empowered to exercise elements of governmental authority on behalf of that state, or agents acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of the state; or where the state acknowledges and adopts the act as its own.\"⁴⁹ ⁵⁰\nCyberspace incentivizes the denial of attribution by altering the cost and effect of international activity in ways that allow states to acquire significant political and economic gain. To the concern of the security and of every nation, incomplete or undecided legal doctrine on cyber conflict provides room for states to block attributability of internationally wrongful acts, avoiding traditional repercussions. Many current standards of international law overlap conceptually with state activity in cyberspace, but do not adequately address how the nature of cyberspace itself affects decision making in this domain.\nThrough the national profiles of activity in cyberspace, it is clear that states are not necessarily incentivized to work together at the risk of revealing their own activities in cyberspace. Getting powerful nations to dedicate large amounts of resources to stopping cyber conflict will pose a challenge, even though a more stable cyberspace is a communal good. A possible incentive to join in cooperative responses through treaty and custom may be overall exposure to cyber conflicts. Further study on specific measurable variables that could trace a given state's exposure to cyber conflict of any or all types is available through Choucri's work, and developing these measurements could help tailor specific incentive options for nations to collaborate on treaties addressing cyber conflict attribution.\n⁴⁹ The Application of International Law to State Activity in Cyberspace New Zealand Office of Foreign Affairs (1 December 2020)\n⁵⁰ International cyber law: interactive toolkit. (2023, March 20). Attribution. International cyber law: interactive toolkit. https://cyberlaw.ccdcoe.org/wiki/Attribution\nTurner 23\nOne current recommendation is that these gaps may be managed through a heightened due diligence standard; holding states responsible as proxy legal-persons for the data their infrastructure transmits. The implications of heightened responsibility of due diligence standards contains its own compelling set of challenges.⁵¹ An alternative may be to expedite the attribution process by creating an enhanced standard of cooperation through heightened due diligence specifically toward transmitted data; not as a means of attribution for aiding and abetting data transfer, but instead as a means to accelerate the process of accurately attributing the origin state of the offending action. Agreements to share public TCP/IP data with friendly nations respects the Layer Principle and doesn’t interfere with the End-to-End argument. Sharing residual data only addresses the transport layer of TCP/IP, and can be done without inhibiting access or transmission.\nTreaties allowing for narrow and specific data access from partner states under certain conditions could serve the purpose of limiting international conflict. Additionally, robust data-sharing agreements could narrow the possible pathways malicious data might take to arrive at its target, creating overall narrower channels of deduction for the harmed state. Creating data openness between states narrows the pathways that malicious data can travel without detection, heightening the cost of generating harmful effects in cyberspace. Enough nations doing so can create a “dragnet” effect, accelerating the attribution of malicious actors who would utilize public networks. Such an effect could cool cyber conflicts overall, by addressing the core incentive toward cyber conflict by heightening the initial costs to actors who would hope to remain anonymous.\n⁵¹ Jensen, Eric Talbot and Watts, Sean and Watts, Sean, *A Cyber Duty of Due Diligence: Gentle Civilizer or Crude Destabilizer?* (July 13, 2017). 95 Texas Law Review 1555 (2017), BYU Law Research Paper No. 17-16, Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3002036\nTurner 24",

The answers can be ordered under the following three headings: within man, within the structure of the separate states, within the system\" - Kenneth N. Waltz; Man, The State, and War (1959)\n## Introduction\nThe conception of the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET), an early predecessor to the internet, brought with it a litany of questions and debates regarding the role of conflict and security in cyberspace. As the internet developed into a tool of common use, these concerns have only been amplified, sustaining the long-term development of legal, defense, and intelligence frameworks. In fact, one of the first concerns leveled toward ARPANET was a lack of security protocol. In 1972, Willis Ware, an engineer working for the Research and Development (RAND) corporation, released a commissioned report on the challenges of securing information in an open network such as the internet. The first of its kind, the “Ware Report” was declassified seven years later, and is widely considered the foundational document for cybersecurity. In it, Ware lists several items of note for the Defense Science Board, outlining actions and future research focused on resource sharing and “facilitating progress toward handling the open [information] environment”.\nToday, power and conflict within the domain of cyberspace has become even more contentious. The relationship between cyberspace and existing international norms is muddied by its position as a domain of conflict that exists entirely within the information environment. Traditionally, the information environment has been the purview of espionage and intelligence\n Willis Howard Ware, IEEE Computer Society. “Security Controls for Computer Systems, tech. report R-609-PR, RAND, Defense Science Board Task Force on Computer Security, 1972”.

While this remains true in cyberspace, the potential for infrastructural, economic, and otherwise material damage through cyber conflict has been thoroughly realized.\nThe diversity of tactics available in cyberspace advance at a rapid rate. This constant shift in technological and, by-proxy, environmental conditions challenges the international community’s ability to attribute and respond to harmful acts in cyberspace. Debate is also open on what kinds of activities must be tolerated as the natural costs of competition in this newer domain. The ability to generate outsized effects that might otherwise be too costly indicates that the geopolitical situation of states in competition affects their actions in cyber conflict. Overall, cyberspace violates previously held norms of international relations in ways that often serve to destabilize the current international order at a relatively low cost to the instigating party.\nIn order to establish where the current international legal consensus is insufficient to divert or absolve conflict in cyberspace, behavioral norms of states and their proxies in cyber conflict must be positioned geopolitically and contextualized through the lens of current theories of international cyber conflict. This mode of analysis of state actors alongside the current state of international law in cyberspace reveals that barriers to attribution preventing retaliatory action might be hurdled by implementing a due diligence standard of data-sharing; streamlining the identification of hostile actors and potentially narrowing the network pathways that hostile actors can use to generate conflict.\n## Project Overview\nInterpreting the effects of interstate conflicts in a domain like cyberspace, with the capacity to drastically shift conditions from case-to-case, poses a major challenge to constructing\n Scott, Len &amp; Jackson, Peter.

It presents a description and examination of the current activities of a set of three predominant state powers; The United States, Russia, and China. The case section will frame these states in two ways within the field of international relations and security studies to establish a behavioral archetype of state activity in cyberspace. Firstly, the cases will measure the relative power and trajectory of the states in question, utilizing geostrategic momentum; a comparison of per-capita net resources and the relative success a given state has had in attaining its stated goals. This measurement will provide insight into how geopolitical context may change the motivations and incentives of powerful states in cyberspace. Secondly, the case study will employ Nazli Choucri’s three categorizations of cyber conflict to define the specific actions of selected states. Anchored in lateral pressure theory, these categorizations outline the argument that an international coordinated response is necessary to diminish cyber conflict, and helps to delineate which types of conflict in cyberspace could be affected by an international legal response. The goal of such a case comparison is to establish, through consistent and formal analysis, any cross-case behaviors in cyberspace that come into conflict with the durability of the current international status quo, how these courses of action are chosen, and how these activities obscure themselves from traditional thresholds of attribution in cyber conflict.\nThe main structural theory that this case study utilizes is the categorization of cyber conflict developed by Nazli Choucri, as an extension of the broader lateral pressure theory.\n Michael Beckley; The Power of Nations: Measuring What Matters.

What is Lateral Pressure? | Nazli Choucri. Retrieved April 16, 2023, from https://nchoucri.mit.edu/theory/lateral-pressure\nTurner 4\nCyber conflict within lateral pressure theory is contextualized by a state’s propensity to act beyond its established boundaries, and measures this propensity through three driving factors; people, resources, and technology. As stated in an overview of lateral pressure theory:\n“As states expand their activities outside territorial boundaries, they encounter other states similarly engaged. Expansion may result in intersections among spheres of influence and set in motion complex interactions that can lead to escalation and conflict – or to cooperation and collaboration – depending on intents and capabilities.”\nUnder lateral pressure theory, Cyberspace affects international relations in seven different ways:\nTable 1.1\nCharacteristics of cyberspace\n- Temporality—replaces conventional temporality with near instantaneity\n- Physicality—transcends constraints of geography and physical location\n- Permeation—penetrates boundaries and jurisdictions\n- Fluidity—manifests sustained shifts and reconfigurations\n- Participation—reduces barriers to activism and political expression\n- Attribution—obscures identities of actors and links to action\n- Accountability—bypasses mechanisms of responsibility\nChoucri, N.

These effects of cyberspace on international relations create an ideal domain for states to engage in political, economic, and other unconventional strategies of conflict that fall below the threshold of warfare; commonly referred to as the “gray zone”. Within the cyberspace gray zone, revisionist actors use the first five features identified by Choucri to inhibit other states from successfully clarifying the final two; Attribution and Accountability. These strategies necessitate an examination of the current conditions of international cyber conflict, and the development of guidelines for establishing cooperative strategies of attribution in this relatively new domain.\nChoucri characterizes three different categories of international cyber conflict; contentions over the architecture and management of cyberspace, cyber conflict for political advantage and profit, and cyber threats to national security. Architecture and management conflicts take place primarily outside of cyberspace, but state activities within cyberspace are a primary affecting agent in such negotiations, and the results of these contentions can shape the nature of cyberspace as a whole domain. The other two types of cyber conflict are inseparable from the architecture of cyberspace itself, and so any treaties or agreements governing them must account for this first type of cyber conflict, although it takes place in the “real” domain.\nCyber conflict for political advantage and profit comprise the widest band of interstate conflict in cyberspace. These conflicts include many national concerns, but “become\n Choucri, N. (2012). Cyberpolitics in International Relations.

As this study is focused particularly on international conflict in cyberspace, it will cover two substrates of cyber conflict for political advantage and profit that have the highest potential to become international: competitive politics via cyber venues, and cybercrime/espionage.\nCyber threats to national security are, according to Choucri, strictly a concern of nations and not necessarily interactive with the international and global system. In the context of international lawmaking however, the national security concerns of a state provide a steep incentive that often shape its diplomatic priorities. An assessment of these concerns will inform the discussion of where international law currently fails to address cyber conflict.\nTable 6.1 Cyber conflicts and threats to security\n|   | Types | Cases  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  I. | Contentions over architecture and management of cyberspace | End-to-end argument\nLayers principle\nNetwork neutrality\n“Code is Law”  |\n|  II. | Cyber conflict for political advantage and profit | State power for political control\nCyber challenges to the state\nCompetitive politics via cyber venues\nCyber crime and cyber espionage  |\n|  III. | Cyber threats to national security | Militarization of cyberspace\nCyber warfare\nCyber threats to infrastructure\nCyber terrorism  |\nChoucri, N. (2012). Cyberpolitics in International Relations. Table 6.1 The MIT Press. http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hhkrs\nContentions over architecture and management arise in the real domain as conflicts regarding the way that cyberspace is structured and regulated. Until recently, the United States\n Choucri, N. (2012). Cyberpolitics in International Relations. The MIT Press. http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hhkrs\nTurner 7\nhosted many of the organizations that oversee the regulation and structure of cyberspace at-large, but at the state level, the picture is a bit more fragmented. Choucri identifies four principles of architecture and management pertinent to the first kind of cyber conflict: the end-to-end argument, the layers principle, network neutrality, and “Code is Law”.\nThe end-to-end argument and layers principle work together to form cyberspace as it conceptually is. End-to-end refers to the layered structure of information passage through the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol(TCP/IP); namely that communication protocols are justified in the lower layers. This nature of TCP/IP is fundamental to the way cyberspace works, and so begets the layers principle: “the law should respect the integrity of layered Internet architecture.”\nThese network structures were produced by, and remain dominantly under the control of, American non-profits and the private sector; but the implications of these two principles to a review of current international law are clear. Effective multilateral agreements with regard to cyberspace should adequately address the TCP/IP structure by not violating the layered structure, or risk undermining the viability of the network for its intended purpose. This can be most\n Solum, Lawrence B. and Minn Chung. 2003. *The Layers Principle: Internet Architecture and the Law*. Public Law and Legal Theory Research Paper 55, University of San Diego School of Law, June.\nTurner 8\ndirectly achieved by regulating layers specifically, and applying regulations narrowly to the layers they affect.\nThe principle of network neutrality is associated with the architecture of the internet, but reflects an ideological bent, and as such has come to the center of debates regarding access to the open web. network neutrality proposes that the structure of cyberspace should concern itself only with transmission and connectivity, and not interfere with neutral access to any content on the web. This is the principle that receives the most contention from nations outside the United States.\nAn archetypal example of refuting network neutrality is China's Golden Shield project, colloquially known as the \"Great Firewall\".[15] While the activities of the Golden Shield program are an expression of state power for political control, a different sub-category of cyber conflict; the denial of access to certain cyber-spaces at the transport layer indicates that the PRC opposes or at least disregards the concept of net neutrality as a necessary component of cyberspace.\nThe final principle of architectural conflicts regarding cyberspace is a dictum that neatly surmises the first three in a neutral package: \"Code is Law\". Cyberspace is a human-made realm, and the constructed network structure that allows cyberspace to work also determines the limitations of how it can be used. Ultimately, this is a system determined by consensus of real domain actors, and a change in consensus can potentially change the structure of cyberspace as well.[16]\n[15] S. Chandel, Z. Jingji, Y. Yunnan, S. Jingyao and Z. Zhipeng, \"The Golden Shield Project of China: A Decade Later—An in-Depth Study of the Great Firewall,\" 2019 International Conference on Cyber-Enabled Distributed Computing and Knowledge Discovery (CyberC), Guilin, China, 2019, pp. 111-119, doi: 10.1109/CyberC.2019.00027.\n[16] Lessig, Lawrence. 1999. Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace. New York : Basic Books.\nTurner 9\nChoucri draws several correlates from these principles of cyber conflict, but the one most relevant to the creation of international law is as follows:\n“...The third correlate is the close coupling of politicization in cyberspace with the uses of regulatory instruments that have been effective in kinetic domains. In other words, the increasingly political nature of the cyber domain generally contributes to a growing propensity to use traditional regulatory instruments and leverages.”\nThis correlate signals that as cyberspace is politicized, there is greater opportunity to address conflicts within it through more traditional means, such as treaty or custom. The architectural and managerial principles of cyberspace provide a clear outline of how states can effectively craft international laws of cyberspace: with respect for its layered structure, with clear consensus definitions of neutrality, and with the acknowledgement that changing consensus can change the cyber environment itself.\nThe widest band of state activity falls into the second category of cyber conflict: conflict for political advantage and profit. There are two major pathways for this type of cyber conflict to affect international relations; cybercrime including espionage, and competitive politics through cyberspace.\nA distinction between these two activity types is their visibility. Competitive politics that employ cyberspace to accomplish goals tend to be fairly visible, taking place on the open web and frequently in tandem with real domain activity. Many competitive political strategies that take place in cyberspace utilize visibility as a primary component; either by uplifting the qualities of the acting state, or by displaying the shortcomings and flaws of an opposing state.\n Choucri, N. (2012). Cyberpolitics in International Relations. The MIT Press. http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hhkrs\nTurner 10\nCybercrime and espionage, on the other hand, by its very nature incorporates efforts to remain clandestine while generating political or economic gain for the actor. This type of activity can include using cyberspace to spy; hacking into government databases to retrieve classified information. It can also include the discreet theft of intellectual property, and the corruption of competitor states' information networks.\nWhile a distinguishing factor between competitive politics and cybercrime/espionage is visibility, both share features that challenge a nation's ability to attribute these activities. A hostile actor may transmit data through the network infrastructure of third-party states in order to disguise the origin of cybercrime, or call upon a foreign asset to publish propaganda from a distant geographic location, offering a means of obscuring the propaganda's source. The capacity that cyberspace creates for states to escalate competitive actions while maintaining deniability generates the third type of cyber conflict characterized by Choucri: cyber threats to national security.\nCyber threats to national security have been rising exponentially, generated by both cybercrime and competitive politics. This category includes militarization of cyberspace, cyber terrorism, threats to infrastructure and cyberwarfare generally. Most notably, these threats take specific forms based on the first two types of cyber conflict; their structure is limited by the architecture of cyberspace, and their purpose informed by the competitive politics therein. Cyber threats to national security are felt widely and are coming from all over the world, leveraging the permeability of cyberspace and its disregard for political borders.[18] In order to maintain cyberspace as a normative domain of international relations, while diminishing cyber threats to national security, a coordinated international response is necessary and may be facilitated\n[18] Talbot, David. 2010. *Moore’s Outlaws*. Technology Review 113 (4): 43. https://www.technologyreview.com/2010/06/22/202336/moores-outlaws/\nTurner 11\nthrough developing the international laws of cyberspace.\nIn keeping with Choucri's description of cyber conflict, the case section contextualizes the geopolitical position of each nation studied, using a measurement of power and trajectory called \"Geostrategic Momentum\". This measurement aligns with the lateral pressure framework of observing people, resources, and technology to draw its conclusions. International relations scholar Dani Belo has proposed a means of measuring the strategic actions of states over time by comparing socio-economic patterns with the level of success a nation has achieved relative to\nTurner 12\ntheir stated goals. Belo grounds this framework of “geostrategic momentum” in a hybrid approach to measuring power first developed by Michael Beckley and later revisited by Caleb Pomeroy, measuring both net resources and expenses per-capita, weighing these measurements against outcomes over time to determine a nation’s relative power.  These measurements are expressed by placing a nation’s “actual role” globally in juxtaposition with its “ideal role” based on its net per-capita resources and frequency of successful foreign policy actions.\nAn additional consideration that these case studies must make is that some less intensive types of cyber conflict are not necessarily the subject of international law. Cyberspace has greatly enhanced the opportunity for states to engage in intelligence competition; the practice of examining and generating actionable intelligence from the open information environment. This activity, while competitive and generative of conflict, is broadly accepted by states as an inherent cost to information sharing. When determining which activities necessitate a cooperative international legal response, an examination of how cyber conflict exceeds the bounds of acceptable competition must be undertaken. Such examinations indicate that the primary means through which cyber conflict exceeds the upper threshold of intelligence competition is the ability to generate large detrimental or deterrent effects at very little cost; a resource-asymmetry that has significant practical implications for competing states.\n Belo, Dani.

Costs of information gathering are greatly reduced through networked computer systems, both closed and open. These states and their pseudo- or non- state proxies may also readily launch low-level attacks such as disinformation campaigns without incurring the same disruptive costs that a military psychological operation or traditional propaganda effort may incur. instances of infrastructural sabotage, such as the disruption and denial of telecom and financial transaction services through malware and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, also provide directly damaging options to states at very little cost comparable to similar courses of action. The same principle of low-cost information warfare applies to more powerful states, when the other conditions of competition are less favorable.\nBelo’s measurement of geostrategic momentum characterizes the motivations of state actors, and Choucri’s categorization of cyber conflicts outlines the need for cooperative international responses, and frames the structural limitations of any such response. Taken together through focused case comparisons, an international legal response that can effectively attribute actions harmful cyber conflict may emerge.\n## Cases\n## China\nIn parallel with the chronological development of cyberspace as a domain of international conflict, China has held a steeply ascendant trajectory in nearly every realm of state power. As the primary political and economic rival of the United States, China holds advantages that loom large over the question of unipolarity. Namely, China’s actual global role is much smaller than its\n Clarke, R.A.; Knake, R.K. (2010). Cyber War: The Next Threat To National Security And What To Do About It. Harper Collins.\n Joseph, W. A. (2019). Politics in China: An introduction. Oxford University Press.\nTurner 14\npotential role, by a margin similar to the inverse of the United States (whose actual role tends to exceed its ideal potential role).\nThis potentiality gap provides opportunity to move more slowly than other nations with revisionist intent; utilizing a multiplicity of low-level conflict to subvert the option of open warfare with their great-power rival. Notably, military power remains one area where the United States maintains a clearly superior capacity. To this end, China’s approach to cyber conflict indicates an acknowledgement of areas where the PRC’s power is most advantageous, such as economy and political influence. Two such examples of China’s activity in cyber conflict include the “Great Firewall”, and “Great Cannon” methods.\nChina’s Great Firewall is an IP-based national internet boundary that blocks content in opposition to PRC objectives at the “gateway”(Transmission Layer of TCP/IP). This method of national censorship has come under fire as directly oppositional to the principle of network neutrality, and as China has expanded its exposure to western economies and societies, the Great Firewall approach has somewhat broken down and evolved toward individual surveillance under the Golden Shield Project. The Great Firewall and Golden Shield are manifestations of a normative counterargument to network neutrality, referred to casually as “cyber sovereignty”. This opposition to network neutrality falls firmly under the first type of Choucri’s categories of cyber conflict; conflict regarding the architecture and management of cyberspace. In light of heavy domestic and international opposition to the PRC’s conception of cyber sovereignty, China\n Pepe, Dr. Michael S., and Kaitlyn Krolik. “Using Power Cycle Theory and Role Realignment Theory to Recognize the International Roles of China and the United States.” International Journal of Business and Social Science, vol. 8, no. 4, Apr. 2017, pp. 20–28.\n Booze Allen Hamilton (2022).

The Great Cannon is a program that allows its user to inject malware into internet traffic passing through the Great Firewall. It leverages the massive internet user base in China to generate nearly insurmountable distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks; effectively closing down targeted websites. In March 2015, the non-profit Great Fire, which assists citizens of China in circumventing the Great Firewall, was targeted by the Great Cannon. The attack lasted five days, and targeted both the website as well as its host server with Amazon CloudFront, costing them nearly $30,000 a day in sustained denial of service. Between 2015 and 2018, evidence of Great Cannon activity arose in cyberattacks targeting apps used by the Hong Kong student protests, such as PopVote.\nBecause the Great Cannon shares source code with the Great Firewall, and has been used almost exclusively to damage the online presence of entities that oppose the PRC, it is almost certainly attributable to the PRC and its organs. It is also used primarily toward regions that Chinese officials consider \"domestic\". The PRC's approach to threats to their foreign interests is more detached. While many of the tactics remain similar, they utilize sponsored and aligned groups of hackers who may not be considered to be under the direct control of the PRC. This speaks directly to China's geopolitical situation.\n “佔中網被駭 恐影響投票數 (“Occupy Central Online Hacked.

(rep.). Same Cloak, More Dagger: Decoding how the People's Republic of China Uses Cyberattacks. Booze Allen Hamilton.\nTurner 16\nUnlike the actors in other cases, China's geopolitical position contains explicit benefits to maintaining a significantly more damaging but less attributable approach afforded by cyber conflict. The economic benefit that the PRC enjoys under the current international order is not something that China can necessarily afford to lose; and most of China's offensive cyber capabilities are positioned toward the political sustainability of the PRC.[31] This strategy appears designed to frustrate current oppositional international power structures, without generating kinetic threats to opposing states' national security. These activities outline an objective to stably shift power in cyberspace toward China by leveraging the massive user base within the Great Firewall; without engaging in hostility through more conventional means, or in areas where opposing state powers remain strongly superior.[32]\nWhen it comes to the international harm deployed by this strategy, it is difficult to stabilize against or directly deter through the system of international law. The strategy that China has selected obscures attribution of hostilities, while still creating circumstances that benefit China's own accumulation of power.[33] Still, generating an adequate means of attributing these types of conflict, whether they are enacted by a state or state-sponsored organization, may provide a pathway toward repair under international law.\n## Russia\nUnlike China's strategy, archetypal of a state actor ascending in overall power and influence; Russia's overall profile has been on a declining track for some time, their actual role\n[31] Hodgson, Q.

Due to generational shock and chronic poverty, Russia has suffered a severely low birth rate since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, only recently reaching replacement levels again in 2007. This decline in relative population has suppressed Russia’s own defense capabilities entering the 21st Century. According to Belo,\n“The country possesses vast natural resources reserves and a large military, but the liabilities are enormous. Russia’s stagnating real wages, low labor productivity, internal political instability, decline in population, and increased spending on welfare decrease its potential to invest resources in elements of soft and hard power”\nRussia’s activity in cyber conflict has a strong tendency to rely on offensive capabilities regionally and in parallel with kinetic conflict and expansionist efforts, often targeting critical infrastructure. These tactics have increased in frequency and severity since 2007, in parallel with Russia's expansionist endeavors in Georgia, Crimea, and Ukraine.\nAnalysis of Russia’s near-abroad activity and outcomes show them to belong squarely to Choucri’s second category of cyber conflict; as a continuation of a larger strategy to “draft” power by degrading the capacity of their geopolitical region such that their relative power does not decline, despite their actual power doing so inevitably. A particularly strong evidentiary strategy is the intensity of Russia’s diasporadical outreach and the volume of russo-nationalistic propaganda that comprises their cyberspace presence in the post-soviet region.

Additionally, in order to maintain its relative power, Russia leverages the deniability of such activity, ultimately deferring accountability and legitimizing cyber conflicts for political gain. Globally, Russia utilizes low-level offensive strategies in cyberspace such as misinformation and espionage where more direct offenses would garner severe repercussions. The relative power of Russia’s targets in cyberspace also has a strong corollary with the chosen modes of cyber conflict. The Agent.btz incursion is a perfect example of Russia’s selective conflict.\nIn 2008, an incursion of malware meant to locate and retrieve sensitive information from closed government sites was identified in networks around the world, including the U.S. Department of Defense’s classified intranet. The incursion was named Agent.btz. The DoD determined that while no sensitive information was retrieved, the progenitor of the malware did have access to said information.\nThe brilliance of agent.btz was in its function: while it observed the network, it did not retrieve or send classified data at any point; operating more like a periscope into stored classified documents. Because of the quietness of the attack, it took US officials nearly five years to locate and attribute the malware, and only with the additional help of Dutch intelligence services. By that point, there was administrative disagreement on how to respond given that so much time had passed.\n Gabuev, A. (2018, February 23).

Often, offenses are carried out by state-sponsored private actors and proxies, further confusing the ability to construct a strategic response. Utilizing sponsored non-state actors also creates jurisdictional barriers that must be overcome by victim states, in terms of seeking reparation.\nEven when malware such as this becomes attributable to Russia, it is specifically to groups that do not necessarily meet the standard of government authority for attribution; groups like the Dukes. CozyDuke, known officially as APT(Advanced Persistent Threat)29, is one such group that works to specifically target Executive offices of states opposed to Russia, including the White House and US State Department. Such groups are technically private actors, often financed anonymously and provided instructions through non-cyber backchannels, obscuring attributability further.\n## The United States\nThe ability to obscure attribution doesn’t only serve less powerful nations; it can also be of value to more powerful nations who find themselves in less favorable positions. This often happens to the United States. As the progenitor of the needed network infrastructure for cyberspace activities, the United States maintains a technical advantage as a unipole that must be iterated to be maintained as the conditions of cyberspace evolve. Access to the open web is steadily rising over time, and this advantageous factor is no longer prominent enough to prevent damaging cyber conflict involving the United States.

Currently, the United States' contentions over the architecture and management of cyberspace are more about maintaining norms than establishing new ones, and fostering passive technological advances that allow the maintenance of a dominant cyberspace presence. conditions of cyber conflict for political gain or profit indicate that a hyper-defensive \"Firewall\" approach similar to that of China would not provide the United States a full deterrence strategy. Rather, The United States has explored possible responses to cyber conflict with certain conditions and responsibilities in mind: Non-escalation of the conflict itself, maintenance of its technological edge, and accurate and prompt attribution of internationally wrongful acts.\nUnfortunately, when the United States does itself engage in cyber conflict for political gain, it frequently does not follow these tendencies. This was the case with the Stuxnet virus. Stuxnet was a malware focused toward the industrial controls of Iranian nuclear research infrastructure, assumedly through a planted USB drive. The virus itself used pieces of code found earlier within the conficker virus, a \"worm\" type virus that originated in Romania. What it did was effectively destroy Iranian nuclear research infrastructure without creating a nuclear crisis, or inserting a military force of any kind. This incident forced a major question of conflict to the forefront: is an attack that creates an effect similar to military intervention, but does not\n Valeriano, B., &amp; Maness, R. C. (2014).

The debate on this question has been mostly delayed, due in part to the obfuscation of attributability. While the attack has been all but traced back to the United States and its allies, clever use of cooperative regional proxies and obfuscatory tactics that the US had itself been victim of in the past has kept true accountability for Stuxnet out of reach.\nA major concern with the implementation of Stuxnet is that it may offer legitimacy to tactics that are ultimately harmful to a cooperative mitigation of cyber threats to national security. Lending credence to tactics that deny attribution is a high-risk strategy for the United States to undertake, and may not serve to maintain their current level of dominance in the cyber domain, given the relationship between these types of conflict and the national security threats they generate.\n## Legal Analysis of Case Activity\nDespite the many ways that cyberspace allows states in conflict to obfuscate attribution for damaging actions, the standards of attributing a wrongful act remain fairly clear. An internationally wrongful act can be attributed to a state when:\n(1) The actor has been empowered with government authority,\nand\n(2) when the act is taken as an exercise of that government authority.\nThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization CCDCOE Cyber Law Toolkit notes that\n Marr, Carson (2019) \"Cyberwarfare and Applied Just War Theory: Assessing the Stuxnet Worm through Jus ad Bellum and Jus in Bello,\" Penn Journal of Philosophy, Politics &amp; Economics: Vol. 14: Iss. 1, Article 2. Available at: https://repository.upenn.edu/spice/vol14/iss1/2\nTurner 22\n\"An internationally wrongful act can be attributed to a state if it was carried out by organs of the state, persons or entities empowered to exercise elements of governmental authority on behalf of that state, or agents acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of the state; or where the state acknowledges and adopts the act as its own.\"\nCyberspace incentivizes the denial of attribution by altering the cost and effect of international activity in ways that allow states to acquire significant political and economic gain. To the concern of the security and of every nation, incomplete or undecided legal doctrine on cyber conflict provides room for states to block attributability of internationally wrongful acts, avoiding traditional repercussions. Many current standards of international law overlap conceptually with state activity in cyberspace, but do not adequately address how the nature of cyberspace itself affects decision making in this domain.\nThrough the national profiles of activity in cyberspace, it is clear that states are not necessarily incentivized to work together at the risk of revealing their own activities in cyberspace. Getting powerful nations to dedicate large amounts of resources to stopping cyber conflict will pose a challenge, even though a more stable cyberspace is a communal good. A possible incentive to join in cooperative responses through treaty and custom may be overall exposure to cyber conflicts. Further study on specific measurable variables that could trace a given state's exposure to cyber conflict of any or all types is available through Choucri's work, and developing these measurements could help tailor specific incentive options for nations to collaborate on treaties addressing cyber conflict attribution.\n The Application of International Law to State Activity in Cyberspace New Zealand Office of Foreign Affairs (1 December 2020)\n International cyber law: interactive toolkit. (2023, March 20). Attribution. International cyber law: interactive toolkit. https://cyberlaw.ccdcoe.org/wiki/Attribution\nTurner 23\nOne current recommendation is that these gaps may be managed through a heightened due diligence standard; holding states responsible as proxy legal-persons for the data their infrastructure transmits. The implications of heightened responsibility of due diligence standards contains its own compelling set of challenges. An alternative may be to expedite the attribution process by creating an enhanced standard of cooperation through heightened due diligence specifically toward transmitted data; not as a means of attribution for aiding and abetting data transfer, but instead as a means to accelerate the process of accurately attributing the origin state of the offending action. Agreements to share public TCP/IP data with friendly nations respects the Layer Principle and doesn’t interfere with the End-to-End argument. Sharing residual data only addresses the transport layer of TCP/IP, and can be done without inhibiting access or transmission.\nTreaties allowing for narrow and specific data access from partner states under certain conditions could serve the purpose of limiting international conflict. Additionally, robust data-sharing agreements could narrow the possible pathways malicious data might take to arrive at its target, creating overall narrower channels of deduction for the harmed state. Creating data openness between states narrows the pathways that malicious data can travel without detection, heightening the cost of generating harmful effects in cyberspace. Enough nations doing so can create a “dragnet” effect, accelerating the attribution of malicious actors who would utilize public networks. Such an effect could cool cyber conflicts overall, by addressing the core incentive toward cyber conflict by heightening the initial costs to actors who would hope to remain anonymous.\n Jensen, Eric Talbot and Watts, Sean and Watts, Sean, *A Cyber Duty of Due Diligence: Gentle Civilizer or Crude Destabilizer?* (July 13, 2017). 95 Texas Law Review 1555 (2017), BYU Law Research Paper No. 17-16, Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3002036\nTurner 24",

The answers can be ordered under the following three headings: within man, within the structure of the separate states, within the system\" - Kenneth N. Waltz; Man, The State, and War (1959)\n## Introduction\nThe conception of the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET), an early predecessor to the internet, brought with it a litany of questions and debates regarding the role of conflict and security in cyberspace. As the internet developed into a tool of common use, these concerns have only been amplified, sustaining the long-term development of legal, defense, and intelligence frameworks. In fact, one of the first concerns leveled toward ARPANET was a lack of security protocol. In 1972, Willis Ware, an engineer working for the Research and Development (RAND) corporation, released a commissioned report on the challenges of securing information in an open network such as the internet. The first of its kind, the “Ware Report” was declassified seven years later, and is widely considered the foundational document for cybersecurity. In it, Ware lists several items of note for the Defense Science Board, outlining actions and future research focused on resource sharing and “facilitating progress toward handling the open [information] environment”.\nToday, power and conflict within the domain of cyberspace has become even more contentious. The relationship between cyberspace and existing international norms is muddied by its position as a domain of conflict that exists entirely within the information environment. Traditionally, the information environment has been the purview of espionage and intelligence\n Willis Howard Ware, IEEE Computer Society. “Security Controls for Computer Systems, tech. report R-609-PR, RAND, Defense Science Board Task Force on Computer Security, 1972”. R-609- 1-PR was reissued Oct. 1979. This widely circulated report was informally known as 'the Ware report.'\n ibid\n Bircher, John E. Issue brief.

While this remains true in cyberspace, the potential for infrastructural, economic, and otherwise material damage through cyber conflict has been thoroughly realized.\nThe diversity of tactics available in cyberspace advance at a rapid rate. This constant shift in technological and, by-proxy, environmental conditions challenges the international community’s ability to attribute and respond to harmful acts in cyberspace. Debate is also open on what kinds of activities must be tolerated as the natural costs of competition in this newer domain. The ability to generate outsized effects that might otherwise be too costly indicates that the geopolitical situation of states in competition affects their actions in cyber conflict. Overall, cyberspace violates previously held norms of international relations in ways that often serve to destabilize the current international order at a relatively low cost to the instigating party.\nIn order to establish where the current international legal consensus is insufficient to divert or absolve conflict in cyberspace, behavioral norms of states and their proxies in cyber conflict must be positioned geopolitically and contextualized through the lens of current theories of international cyber conflict. This mode of analysis of state actors alongside the current state of international law in cyberspace reveals that barriers to attribution preventing retaliatory action might be hurdled by implementing a due diligence standard of data-sharing; streamlining the identification of hostile actors and potentially narrowing the network pathways that hostile actors can use to generate conflict.\n## Project Overview\nInterpreting the effects of interstate conflicts in a domain like cyberspace, with the capacity to drastically shift conditions from case-to-case, poses a major challenge to constructing\n Scott, Len &amp; Jackson, Peter.

It presents a description and examination of the current activities of a set of three predominant state powers; The United States, Russia, and China. The case section will frame these states in two ways within the field of international relations and security studies to establish a behavioral archetype of state activity in cyberspace. Firstly, the cases will measure the relative power and trajectory of the states in question, utilizing geostrategic momentum; a comparison of per-capita net resources and the relative success a given state has had in attaining its stated goals. This measurement will provide insight into how geopolitical context may change the motivations and incentives of powerful states in cyberspace. Secondly, the case study will employ Nazli Choucri’s three categorizations of cyber conflict to define the specific actions of selected states. Anchored in lateral pressure theory, these categorizations outline the argument that an international coordinated response is necessary to diminish cyber conflict, and helps to delineate which types of conflict in cyberspace could be affected by an international legal response. The goal of such a case comparison is to establish, through consistent and formal analysis, any cross-case behaviors in cyberspace that come into conflict with the durability of the current international status quo, how these courses of action are chosen, and how these activities obscure themselves from traditional thresholds of attribution in cyber conflict.\nThe main structural theory that this case study utilizes is the categorization of cyber conflict developed by Nazli Choucri, as an extension of the broader lateral pressure theory.\n Michael Beckley; The Power of Nations: Measuring What Matters.

As stated in an overview of lateral pressure theory:\n“As states expand their activities outside territorial boundaries, they encounter other states similarly engaged. Expansion may result in intersections among spheres of influence and set in motion complex interactions that can lead to escalation and conflict – or to cooperation and collaboration – depending on intents and capabilities.”\nUnder lateral pressure theory, Cyberspace affects international relations in seven different ways:\nTable 1.1\nCharacteristics of cyberspace\n- Temporality—replaces conventional temporality with near instantaneity\n- Physicality—transcends constraints of geography and physical location\n- Permeation—penetrates boundaries and jurisdictions\n- Fluidity—manifests sustained shifts and reconfigurations\n- Participation—reduces barriers to activism and political expression\n- Attribution—obscures identities of actors and links to action\n- Accountability—bypasses mechanisms of responsibility\nChoucri, N.

These effects of cyberspace on international relations create an ideal domain for states to engage in political, economic, and other unconventional strategies of conflict that fall below the threshold of warfare; commonly referred to as the “gray zone”. Within the cyberspace gray zone, revisionist actors use the first five features identified by Choucri to inhibit other states from successfully clarifying the final two; Attribution and Accountability. These strategies necessitate an examination of the current conditions of international cyber conflict, and the development of guidelines for establishing cooperative strategies of attribution in this relatively new domain.\nChoucri characterizes three different categories of international cyber conflict; contentions over the architecture and management of cyberspace, cyber conflict for political advantage and profit, and cyber threats to national security. Architecture and management conflicts take place primarily outside of cyberspace, but state activities within cyberspace are a primary affecting agent in such negotiations, and the results of these contentions can shape the nature of cyberspace as a whole domain. The other two types of cyber conflict are inseparable from the architecture of cyberspace itself, and so any treaties or agreements governing them must account for this first type of cyber conflict, although it takes place in the “real” domain.\nCyber conflict for political advantage and profit comprise the widest band of interstate conflict in cyberspace. These conflicts include many national concerns, but “become\n Choucri, N. (2012). Cyberpolitics in International Relations.

As this study is focused particularly on international conflict in cyberspace, it will cover two substrates of cyber conflict for political advantage and profit that have the highest potential to become international: competitive politics via cyber venues, and cybercrime/espionage.\nCyber threats to national security are, according to Choucri, strictly a concern of nations and not necessarily interactive with the international and global system. In the context of international lawmaking however, the national security concerns of a state provide a steep incentive that often shape its diplomatic priorities. An assessment of these concerns will inform the discussion of where international law currently fails to address cyber conflict.\nTable 6.1 Cyber conflicts and threats to security\n|   | Types | Cases  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  I. | Contentions over architecture and management of cyberspace | End-to-end argument\nLayers principle\nNetwork neutrality\n“Code is Law”  |\n|  II. | Cyber conflict for political advantage and profit | State power for political control\nCyber challenges to the state\nCompetitive politics via cyber venues\nCyber crime and cyber espionage  |\n|  III. | Cyber threats to national security | Militarization of cyberspace\nCyber warfare\nCyber threats to infrastructure\nCyber terrorism  |\nChoucri, N.

Table 6.1 The MIT Press. http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hhkrs\nContentions over architecture and management arise in the real domain as conflicts regarding the way that cyberspace is structured and regulated. Until recently, the United States\n Choucri, N. (2012). Cyberpolitics in International Relations. The MIT Press. http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hhkrs\nTurner 7\nhosted many of the organizations that oversee the regulation and structure of cyberspace at-large, but at the state level, the picture is a bit more fragmented. Choucri identifies four principles of architecture and management pertinent to the first kind of cyber conflict: the end-to-end argument, the layers principle, network neutrality, and “Code is Law”.\nThe end-to-end argument and layers principle work together to form cyberspace as it conceptually is. End-to-end refers to the layered structure of information passage through the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol(TCP/IP); namely that communication protocols are justified in the lower layers. This nature of TCP/IP is fundamental to the way cyberspace works, and so begets the layers principle: “the law should respect the integrity of layered Internet architecture.”\nThese network structures were produced by, and remain dominantly under the control of, American non-profits and the private sector; but the implications of these two principles to a review of current international law are clear. Effective multilateral agreements with regard to cyberspace should adequately address the TCP/IP structure by not violating the layered structure, or risk undermining the viability of the network for its intended purpose. This can be most\n Solum, Lawrence B. and Minn Chung. 2003. *The Layers Principle: Internet Architecture and the Law*. Public Law and Legal Theory Research Paper 55, University of San Diego School of Law, June.\nTurner 8\ndirectly achieved by regulating layers specifically, and applying regulations narrowly to the layers they affect.\nThe principle of network neutrality is associated with the architecture of the internet, but reflects an ideological bent, and as such has come to the center of debates regarding access to the open web. network neutrality proposes that the structure of cyberspace should concern itself only with transmission and connectivity, and not interfere with neutral access to any content on the web. This is the principle that receives the most contention from nations outside the United States.\nAn archetypal example of refuting network neutrality is China's Golden Shield project, colloquially known as the \"Great Firewall\".[15] While the activities of the Golden Shield program are an expression of state power for political control, a different sub-category of cyber conflict; the denial of access to certain cyber-spaces at the transport layer indicates that the PRC opposes or at least disregards the concept of net neutrality as a necessary component of cyberspace.\nThe final principle of architectural conflicts regarding cyberspace is a dictum that neatly surmises the first three in a neutral package: \"Code is Law\". Cyberspace is a human-made realm, and the constructed network structure that allows cyberspace to work also determines the limitations of how it can be used. Ultimately, this is a system determined by consensus of real domain actors, and a change in consensus can potentially change the structure of cyberspace as well.[16]\n[15] S. Chandel, Z. Jingji, Y. Yunnan, S. Jingyao and Z. Zhipeng, \"The Golden Shield Project of China: A Decade Later—An in-Depth Study of the Great Firewall,\" 2019 International Conference on Cyber-Enabled Distributed Computing and Knowledge Discovery (CyberC), Guilin, China, 2019, pp. 111-119, doi: 10.1109/CyberC.2019.00027.\n[16] Lessig, Lawrence. 1999. Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace. New York : Basic Books.\nTurner 9\nChoucri draws several correlates from these principles of cyber conflict, but the one most relevant to the creation of international law is as follows:\n“...The third correlate is the close coupling of politicization in cyberspace with the uses of regulatory instruments that have been effective in kinetic domains. In other words, the increasingly political nature of the cyber domain generally contributes to a growing propensity to use traditional regulatory instruments and leverages.”\nThis correlate signals that as cyberspace is politicized, there is greater opportunity to address conflicts within it through more traditional means, such as treaty or custom. The architectural and managerial principles of cyberspace provide a clear outline of how states can effectively craft international laws of cyberspace: with respect for its layered structure, with clear consensus definitions of neutrality, and with the acknowledgement that changing consensus can change the cyber environment itself.\nThe widest band of state activity falls into the second category of cyber conflict: conflict for political advantage and profit. There are two major pathways for this type of cyber conflict to affect international relations; cybercrime including espionage, and competitive politics through cyberspace.\nA distinction between these two activity types is their visibility. Competitive politics that employ cyberspace to accomplish goals tend to be fairly visible, taking place on the open web and frequently in tandem with real domain activity. Many competitive political strategies that take place in cyberspace utilize visibility as a primary component; either by uplifting the qualities of the acting state, or by displaying the shortcomings and flaws of an opposing state.\n Choucri, N. (2012). Cyberpolitics in International Relations. The MIT Press. http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hhkrs\nTurner 10\nCybercrime and espionage, on the other hand, by its very nature incorporates efforts to remain clandestine while generating political or economic gain for the actor. This type of activity can include using cyberspace to spy; hacking into government databases to retrieve classified information. It can also include the discreet theft of intellectual property, and the corruption of competitor states' information networks.\nWhile a distinguishing factor between competitive politics and cybercrime/espionage is visibility, both share features that challenge a nation's ability to attribute these activities. A hostile actor may transmit data through the network infrastructure of third-party states in order to disguise the origin of cybercrime, or call upon a foreign asset to publish propaganda from a distant geographic location, offering a means of obscuring the propaganda's source. The capacity that cyberspace creates for states to escalate competitive actions while maintaining deniability generates the third type of cyber conflict characterized by Choucri: cyber threats to national security.\nCyber threats to national security have been rising exponentially, generated by both cybercrime and competitive politics. This category includes militarization of cyberspace, cyber terrorism, threats to infrastructure and cyberwarfare generally. Most notably, these threats take specific forms based on the first two types of cyber conflict; their structure is limited by the architecture of cyberspace, and their purpose informed by the competitive politics therein. Cyber threats to national security are felt widely and are coming from all over the world, leveraging the permeability of cyberspace and its disregard for political borders.[18] In order to maintain cyberspace as a normative domain of international relations, while diminishing cyber threats to national security, a coordinated international response is necessary and may be facilitated\n[18] Talbot, David. 2010. *Moore’s Outlaws*. Technology Review 113 (4): 43. https://www.technologyreview.com/2010/06/22/202336/moores-outlaws/\nTurner 11\nthrough developing the international laws of cyberspace.\nIn keeping with Choucri's description of cyber conflict, the case section contextualizes the geopolitical position of each nation studied, using a measurement of power and trajectory called \"Geostrategic Momentum\". This measurement aligns with the lateral pressure framework of observing people, resources, and technology to draw its conclusions. International relations scholar Dani Belo has proposed a means of measuring the strategic actions of states over time by comparing socio-economic patterns with the level of success a nation has achieved relative to\nTurner 12\ntheir stated goals. Belo grounds this framework of “geostrategic momentum” in a hybrid approach to measuring power first developed by Michael Beckley and later revisited by Caleb Pomeroy, measuring both net resources and expenses per-capita, weighing these measurements against outcomes over time to determine a nation’s relative power.  These measurements are expressed by placing a nation’s “actual role” globally in juxtaposition with its “ideal role” based on its net per-capita resources and frequency of successful foreign policy actions.\nAn additional consideration that these case studies must make is that some less intensive types of cyber conflict are not necessarily the subject of international law. Cyberspace has greatly enhanced the opportunity for states to engage in intelligence competition; the practice of examining and generating actionable intelligence from the open information environment. This activity, while competitive and generative of conflict, is broadly accepted by states as an inherent cost to information sharing. When determining which activities necessitate a cooperative international legal response, an examination of how cyber conflict exceeds the bounds of acceptable competition must be undertaken. Such examinations indicate that the primary means through which cyber conflict exceeds the upper threshold of intelligence competition is the ability to generate large detrimental or deterrent effects at very little cost; a resource-asymmetry that has significant practical implications for competing states.\n Belo, Dani.

Costs of information gathering are greatly reduced through networked computer systems, both closed and open. These states and their pseudo- or non- state proxies may also readily launch low-level attacks such as disinformation campaigns without incurring the same disruptive costs that a military psychological operation or traditional propaganda effort may incur. instances of infrastructural sabotage, such as the disruption and denial of telecom and financial transaction services through malware and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, also provide directly damaging options to states at very little cost comparable to similar courses of action. The same principle of low-cost information warfare applies to more powerful states, when the other conditions of competition are less favorable.\nBelo’s measurement of geostrategic momentum characterizes the motivations of state actors, and Choucri’s categorization of cyber conflicts outlines the need for cooperative international responses, and frames the structural limitations of any such response. Taken together through focused case comparisons, an international legal response that can effectively attribute actions harmful cyber conflict may emerge.\n## Cases\n## China\nIn parallel with the chronological development of cyberspace as a domain of international conflict, China has held a steeply ascendant trajectory in nearly every realm of state power. As the primary political and economic rival of the United States, China holds advantages that loom large over the question of unipolarity. Namely, China’s actual global role is much smaller than its\n Clarke, R.A.; Knake, R.K. (2010). Cyber War: The Next Threat To National Security And What To Do About It. Harper Collins.\n Joseph, W. A. (2019). Politics in China: An introduction. Oxford University Press.\nTurner 14\npotential role, by a margin similar to the inverse of the United States (whose actual role tends to exceed its ideal potential role).\nThis potentiality gap provides opportunity to move more slowly than other nations with revisionist intent; utilizing a multiplicity of low-level conflict to subvert the option of open warfare with their great-power rival. Notably, military power remains one area where the United States maintains a clearly superior capacity. To this end, China’s approach to cyber conflict indicates an acknowledgement of areas where the PRC’s power is most advantageous, such as economy and political influence. Two such examples of China’s activity in cyber conflict include the “Great Firewall”, and “Great Cannon” methods.\nChina’s Great Firewall is an IP-based national internet boundary that blocks content in opposition to PRC objectives at the “gateway”(Transmission Layer of TCP/IP). This method of national censorship has come under fire as directly oppositional to the principle of network neutrality, and as China has expanded its exposure to western economies and societies, the Great Firewall approach has somewhat broken down and evolved toward individual surveillance under the Golden Shield Project. The Great Firewall and Golden Shield are manifestations of a normative counterargument to network neutrality, referred to casually as “cyber sovereignty”. This opposition to network neutrality falls firmly under the first type of Choucri’s categories of cyber conflict; conflict regarding the architecture and management of cyberspace. In light of heavy domestic and international opposition to the PRC’s conception of cyber sovereignty, China\n Pepe, Dr. Michael S., and Kaitlyn Krolik. “Using Power Cycle Theory and Role Realignment Theory to Recognize the International Roles of China and the United States.” International Journal of Business and Social Science, vol. 8, no. 4, Apr. 2017, pp. 20–28.\n Booze Allen Hamilton (2022).

The Great Cannon is a program that allows its user to inject malware into internet traffic passing through the Great Firewall. It leverages the massive internet user base in China to generate nearly insurmountable distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks; effectively closing down targeted websites. In March 2015, the non-profit Great Fire, which assists citizens of China in circumventing the Great Firewall, was targeted by the Great Cannon. The attack lasted five days, and targeted both the website as well as its host server with Amazon CloudFront, costing them nearly $30,000 a day in sustained denial of service. Between 2015 and 2018, evidence of Great Cannon activity arose in cyberattacks targeting apps used by the Hong Kong student protests, such as PopVote.\nBecause the Great Cannon shares source code with the Great Firewall, and has been used almost exclusively to damage the online presence of entities that oppose the PRC, it is almost certainly attributable to the PRC and its organs. It is also used primarily toward regions that Chinese officials consider \"domestic\". The PRC's approach to threats to their foreign interests is more detached. While many of the tactics remain similar, they utilize sponsored and aligned groups of hackers who may not be considered to be under the direct control of the PRC. This speaks directly to China's geopolitical situation.\n “佔中網被駭 恐影響投票數 (“Occupy Central Online Hacked.

(rep.). Same Cloak, More Dagger: Decoding how the People's Republic of China Uses Cyberattacks. Booze Allen Hamilton.\nTurner 16\nUnlike the actors in other cases, China's geopolitical position contains explicit benefits to maintaining a significantly more damaging but less attributable approach afforded by cyber conflict. The economic benefit that the PRC enjoys under the current international order is not something that China can necessarily afford to lose; and most of China's offensive cyber capabilities are positioned toward the political sustainability of the PRC.[31] This strategy appears designed to frustrate current oppositional international power structures, without generating kinetic threats to opposing states' national security. These activities outline an objective to stably shift power in cyberspace toward China by leveraging the massive user base within the Great Firewall; without engaging in hostility through more conventional means, or in areas where opposing state powers remain strongly superior.[32]\nWhen it comes to the international harm deployed by this strategy, it is difficult to stabilize against or directly deter through the system of international law. The strategy that China has selected obscures attribution of hostilities, while still creating circumstances that benefit China's own accumulation of power.[33] Still, generating an adequate means of attributing these types of conflict, whether they are enacted by a state or state-sponsored organization, may provide a pathway toward repair under international law.\n## Russia\nUnlike China's strategy, archetypal of a state actor ascending in overall power and influence; Russia's overall profile has been on a declining track for some time, their actual role\n[31] Hodgson, Q.

Russia presents a unique case as a great power in decline. Due to generational shock and chronic poverty, Russia has suffered a severely low birth rate since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, only recently reaching replacement levels again in 2007. This decline in relative population has suppressed Russia’s own defense capabilities entering the 21st Century. According to Belo,\n“The country possesses vast natural resources reserves and a large military, but the liabilities are enormous. Russia’s stagnating real wages, low labor productivity, internal political instability, decline in population, and increased spending on welfare decrease its potential to invest resources in elements of soft and hard power”\nRussia’s activity in cyber conflict has a strong tendency to rely on offensive capabilities regionally and in parallel with kinetic conflict and expansionist efforts, often targeting critical infrastructure. These tactics have increased in frequency and severity since 2007, in parallel with Russia's expansionist endeavors in Georgia, Crimea, and Ukraine.\nAnalysis of Russia’s near-abroad activity and outcomes show them to belong squarely to Choucri’s second category of cyber conflict; as a continuation of a larger strategy to “draft” power by degrading the capacity of their geopolitical region such that their relative power does not decline, despite their actual power doing so inevitably. A particularly strong evidentiary strategy is the intensity of Russia’s diasporadical outreach and the volume of russo-nationalistic propaganda that comprises their cyberspace presence in the post-soviet region.

Additionally, in order to maintain its relative power, Russia leverages the deniability of such activity, ultimately deferring accountability and legitimizing cyber conflicts for political gain. Globally, Russia utilizes low-level offensive strategies in cyberspace such as misinformation and espionage where more direct offenses would garner severe repercussions. The relative power of Russia’s targets in cyberspace also has a strong corollary with the chosen modes of cyber conflict. The Agent.btz incursion is a perfect example of Russia’s selective conflict.\nIn 2008, an incursion of malware meant to locate and retrieve sensitive information from closed government sites was identified in networks around the world, including the U.S. Department of Defense’s classified intranet. The incursion was named Agent.btz. The DoD determined that while no sensitive information was retrieved, the progenitor of the malware did have access to said information.\nThe brilliance of agent.btz was in its function: while it observed the network, it did not retrieve or send classified data at any point; operating more like a periscope into stored classified documents. Because of the quietness of the attack, it took US officials nearly five years to locate and attribute the malware, and only with the additional help of Dutch intelligence services. By that point, there was administrative disagreement on how to respond given that so much time had passed.\n Gabuev, A. (2018, February 23).

Often, offenses are carried out by state-sponsored private actors and proxies, further confusing the ability to construct a strategic response. Utilizing sponsored non-state actors also creates jurisdictional barriers that must be overcome by victim states, in terms of seeking reparation.\nEven when malware such as this becomes attributable to Russia, it is specifically to groups that do not necessarily meet the standard of government authority for attribution; groups like the Dukes. CozyDuke, known officially as APT(Advanced Persistent Threat)29, is one such group that works to specifically target Executive offices of states opposed to Russia, including the White House and US State Department. Such groups are technically private actors, often financed anonymously and provided instructions through non-cyber backchannels, obscuring attributability further.\n## The United States\nThe ability to obscure attribution doesn’t only serve less powerful nations; it can also be of value to more powerful nations who find themselves in less favorable positions. This often happens to the United States. As the progenitor of the needed network infrastructure for cyberspace activities, the United States maintains a technical advantage as a unipole that must be iterated to be maintained as the conditions of cyberspace evolve. Access to the open web is steadily rising over time, and this advantageous factor is no longer prominent enough to prevent damaging cyber conflict involving the United States. Preservation of the interests of the United\n Yuan-kang Wang (2020) *The Durability of a Unipolar System: Lessons from East Asian History*, Security Studies, 29:5, 832-863, DOI: 10.1080/09636412.2020.1859127\n Brantly, Aaron F. “Entanglement in Cyberspace: Minding the Deterrence Gap.” Democracy and Security 16, no. 3 (2020): 210–33. https://doi.org/10.1080/17419166.2020.1773807.\nTurner 20\nStates as a unipole requires a strategy that acknowledges mere advantage as insufficient to generate complete deterrence, but a necessary component to maintain its interests in all three categories of cyber conflict described by Choucri. Currently, the United States' contentions over the architecture and management of cyberspace are more about maintaining norms than establishing new ones, and fostering passive technological advances that allow the maintenance of a dominant cyberspace presence. conditions of cyber conflict for political gain or profit indicate that a hyper-defensive \"Firewall\" approach similar to that of China would not provide the United States a full deterrence strategy. Rather, The United States has explored possible responses to cyber conflict with certain conditions and responsibilities in mind: Non-escalation of the conflict itself, maintenance of its technological edge, and accurate and prompt attribution of internationally wrongful acts.\nUnfortunately, when the United States does itself engage in cyber conflict for political gain, it frequently does not follow these tendencies. This was the case with the Stuxnet virus. Stuxnet was a malware focused toward the industrial controls of Iranian nuclear research infrastructure, assumedly through a planted USB drive. The virus itself used pieces of code found earlier within the conficker virus, a \"worm\" type virus that originated in Romania. What it did was effectively destroy Iranian nuclear research infrastructure without creating a nuclear crisis, or inserting a military force of any kind. This incident forced a major question of conflict to the forefront: is an attack that creates an effect similar to military intervention, but does not\n Valeriano, B., &amp; Maness, R. C. (2014).

The debate on this question has been mostly delayed, due in part to the obfuscation of attributability. While the attack has been all but traced back to the United States and its allies, clever use of cooperative regional proxies and obfuscatory tactics that the US had itself been victim of in the past has kept true accountability for Stuxnet out of reach.\nA major concern with the implementation of Stuxnet is that it may offer legitimacy to tactics that are ultimately harmful to a cooperative mitigation of cyber threats to national security. Lending credence to tactics that deny attribution is a high-risk strategy for the United States to undertake, and may not serve to maintain their current level of dominance in the cyber domain, given the relationship between these types of conflict and the national security threats they generate.\n## Legal Analysis of Case Activity\nDespite the many ways that cyberspace allows states in conflict to obfuscate attribution for damaging actions, the standards of attributing a wrongful act remain fairly clear. An internationally wrongful act can be attributed to a state when:\n(1) The actor has been empowered with government authority,\nand\n(2) when the act is taken as an exercise of that government authority.\nThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization CCDCOE Cyber Law Toolkit notes that\n Marr, Carson (2019) \"Cyberwarfare and Applied Just War Theory: Assessing the Stuxnet Worm through Jus ad Bellum and Jus in Bello,\" Penn Journal of Philosophy, Politics &amp; Economics: Vol. 14: Iss. 1, Article 2. Available at: https://repository.upenn.edu/spice/vol14/iss1/2\nTurner 22\n\"An internationally wrongful act can be attributed to a state if it was carried out by organs of the state, persons or entities empowered to exercise elements of governmental authority on behalf of that state, or agents acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of the state; or where the state acknowledges and adopts the act as its own.\"\nCyberspace incentivizes the denial of attribution by altering the cost and effect of international activity in ways that allow states to acquire significant political and economic gain. To the concern of the security and of every nation, incomplete or undecided legal doctrine on cyber conflict provides room for states to block attributability of internationally wrongful acts, avoiding traditional repercussions. Many current standards of international law overlap conceptually with state activity in cyberspace, but do not adequately address how the nature of cyberspace itself affects decision making in this domain.\nThrough the national profiles of activity in cyberspace, it is clear that states are not necessarily incentivized to work together at the risk of revealing their own activities in cyberspace. Getting powerful nations to dedicate large amounts of resources to stopping cyber conflict will pose a challenge, even though a more stable cyberspace is a communal good. A possible incentive to join in cooperative responses through treaty and custom may be overall exposure to cyber conflicts. Further study on specific measurable variables that could trace a given state's exposure to cyber conflict of any or all types is available through Choucri's work, and developing these measurements could help tailor specific incentive options for nations to collaborate on treaties addressing cyber conflict attribution.\n The Application of International Law to State Activity in Cyberspace New Zealand Office of Foreign Affairs (1 December 2020)\n International cyber law: interactive toolkit. (2023, March 20). Attribution. International cyber law: interactive toolkit. https://cyberlaw.ccdcoe.org/wiki/Attribution\nTurner 23\nOne current recommendation is that these gaps may be managed through a heightened due diligence standard; holding states responsible as proxy legal-persons for the data their infrastructure transmits. The implications of heightened responsibility of due diligence standards contains its own compelling set of challenges. An alternative may be to expedite the attribution process by creating an enhanced standard of cooperation through heightened due diligence specifically toward transmitted data; not as a means of attribution for aiding and abetting data transfer, but instead as a means to accelerate the process of accurately attributing the origin state of the offending action. Agreements to share public TCP/IP data with friendly nations respects the Layer Principle and doesn’t interfere with the End-to-End argument. Sharing residual data only addresses the transport layer of TCP/IP, and can be done without inhibiting access or transmission.\nTreaties allowing for narrow and specific data access from partner states under certain conditions could serve the purpose of limiting international conflict. Additionally, robust data-sharing agreements could narrow the possible pathways malicious data might take to arrive at its target, creating overall narrower channels of deduction for the harmed state. Creating data openness between states narrows the pathways that malicious data can travel without detection, heightening the cost of generating harmful effects in cyberspace. Enough nations doing so can create a “dragnet” effect, accelerating the attribution of malicious actors who would utilize public networks. Such an effect could cool cyber conflicts overall, by addressing the core incentive toward cyber conflict by heightening the initial costs to actors who would hope to remain anonymous.\n Jensen, Eric Talbot and Watts, Sean and Watts, Sean, *A Cyber Duty of Due Diligence: Gentle Civilizer or Crude Destabilizer?* (July 13, 2017). 95 Texas Law Review 1555 (2017), BYU Law Research Paper No. 17-16, Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3002036\nTurner 24",

The answers can be ordered under the following three headings: within man, within the structure of the separate states, within the system\" - Kenneth N. Waltz; Man, The State, and War (1959)\n## Introduction\nThe conception of the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET), an early predecessor to the internet, brought with it a litany of questions and debates regarding the role of conflict and security in cyberspace. As the internet developed into a tool of common use, these concerns have only been amplified, sustaining the long-term development of legal, defense, and intelligence frameworks. In fact, one of the first concerns leveled toward ARPANET was a lack of security protocol. In 1972, Willis Ware, an engineer working for the Research and Development (RAND) corporation, released a commissioned report on the challenges of securing information in an open network such as the internet. The first of its kind, the “Ware Report” was declassified seven years later, and is widely considered the foundational document for cybersecurity. In it, Ware lists several items of note for the Defense Science Board, outlining actions and future research focused on resource sharing and “facilitating progress toward handling the open [information] environment”.\nToday, power and conflict within the domain of cyberspace has become even more contentious. The relationship between cyberspace and existing international norms is muddied by its position as a domain of conflict that exists entirely within the information environment. Traditionally, the information environment has been the purview of espionage and intelligence\n Willis Howard Ware, IEEE Computer Society. “Security Controls for Computer Systems, tech. report R-609-PR, RAND, Defense Science Board Task Force on Computer Security, 1972”. R-609- 1-PR was reissued Oct. 1979. This widely circulated report was informally known as 'the Ware report.'\n ibid\n Bircher, John E. Issue brief. Breaking the Status Quo: Information and the Future Force. Carlisle, PA: US Army War College, 2012\nTurner 2\noperations. While this remains true in cyberspace, the potential for infrastructural, economic, and otherwise material damage through cyber conflict has been thoroughly realized.\nThe diversity of tactics available in cyberspace advance at a rapid rate. This constant shift in technological and, by-proxy, environmental conditions challenges the international community’s ability to attribute and respond to harmful acts in cyberspace. Debate is also open on what kinds of activities must be tolerated as the natural costs of competition in this newer domain. The ability to generate outsized effects that might otherwise be too costly indicates that the geopolitical situation of states in competition affects their actions in cyber conflict. Overall, cyberspace violates previously held norms of international relations in ways that often serve to destabilize the current international order at a relatively low cost to the instigating party.\nIn order to establish where the current international legal consensus is insufficient to divert or absolve conflict in cyberspace, behavioral norms of states and their proxies in cyber conflict must be positioned geopolitically and contextualized through the lens of current theories of international cyber conflict. This mode of analysis of state actors alongside the current state of international law in cyberspace reveals that barriers to attribution preventing retaliatory action might be hurdled by implementing a due diligence standard of data-sharing; streamlining the identification of hostile actors and potentially narrowing the network pathways that hostile actors can use to generate conflict.\n## Project Overview\nInterpreting the effects of interstate conflicts in a domain like cyberspace, with the capacity to drastically shift conditions from case-to-case, poses a major challenge to constructing\n Scott, Len &amp; Jackson, Peter. (2004). The Study of Intelligence in Theory and Practice. Intelligence and National Security. 19. 10.1080/0268452042000302930.\n Choucri, N. (2012). Cyberpolitics in International Relations. The MIT Press. http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hhkrs\nTurner 3\na consistent research model. This paper instead takes the approach of a multi-context review. It presents a description and examination of the current activities of a set of three predominant state powers; The United States, Russia, and China. The case section will frame these states in two ways within the field of international relations and security studies to establish a behavioral archetype of state activity in cyberspace. Firstly, the cases will measure the relative power and trajectory of the states in question, utilizing geostrategic momentum; a comparison of per-capita net resources and the relative success a given state has had in attaining its stated goals. This measurement will provide insight into how geopolitical context may change the motivations and incentives of powerful states in cyberspace. Secondly, the case study will employ Nazli Choucri’s three categorizations of cyber conflict to define the specific actions of selected states. Anchored in lateral pressure theory, these categorizations outline the argument that an international coordinated response is necessary to diminish cyber conflict, and helps to delineate which types of conflict in cyberspace could be affected by an international legal response. The goal of such a case comparison is to establish, through consistent and formal analysis, any cross-case behaviors in cyberspace that come into conflict with the durability of the current international status quo, how these courses of action are chosen, and how these activities obscure themselves from traditional thresholds of attribution in cyber conflict.\nThe main structural theory that this case study utilizes is the categorization of cyber conflict developed by Nazli Choucri, as an extension of the broader lateral pressure theory.\n Michael Beckley; The Power of Nations: Measuring What Matters.

As stated in an overview of lateral pressure theory:\n“As states expand their activities outside territorial boundaries, they encounter other states similarly engaged. Expansion may result in intersections among spheres of influence and set in motion complex interactions that can lead to escalation and conflict – or to cooperation and collaboration – depending on intents and capabilities.”\nUnder lateral pressure theory, Cyberspace affects international relations in seven different ways:\nTable 1.1\nCharacteristics of cyberspace\n- Temporality—replaces conventional temporality with near instantaneity\n- Physicality—transcends constraints of geography and physical location\n- Permeation—penetrates boundaries and jurisdictions\n- Fluidity—manifests sustained shifts and reconfigurations\n- Participation—reduces barriers to activism and political expression\n- Attribution—obscures identities of actors and links to action\n- Accountability—bypasses mechanisms of responsibility\nChoucri, N.

These effects of cyberspace on international relations create an ideal domain for states to engage in political, economic, and other unconventional strategies of conflict that fall below the threshold of warfare; commonly referred to as the “gray zone”. Within the cyberspace gray zone, revisionist actors use the first five features identified by Choucri to inhibit other states from successfully clarifying the final two; Attribution and Accountability. These strategies necessitate an examination of the current conditions of international cyber conflict, and the development of guidelines for establishing cooperative strategies of attribution in this relatively new domain.\nChoucri characterizes three different categories of international cyber conflict; contentions over the architecture and management of cyberspace, cyber conflict for political advantage and profit, and cyber threats to national security. Architecture and management conflicts take place primarily outside of cyberspace, but state activities within cyberspace are a primary affecting agent in such negotiations, and the results of these contentions can shape the nature of cyberspace as a whole domain. The other two types of cyber conflict are inseparable from the architecture of cyberspace itself, and so any treaties or agreements governing them must account for this first type of cyber conflict, although it takes place in the “real” domain.\nCyber conflict for political advantage and profit comprise the widest band of interstate conflict in cyberspace. These conflicts include many national concerns, but “become\n Choucri, N. (2012). Cyberpolitics in International Relations.

As this study is focused particularly on international conflict in cyberspace, it will cover two substrates of cyber conflict for political advantage and profit that have the highest potential to become international: competitive politics via cyber venues, and cybercrime/espionage.\nCyber threats to national security are, according to Choucri, strictly a concern of nations and not necessarily interactive with the international and global system. In the context of international lawmaking however, the national security concerns of a state provide a steep incentive that often shape its diplomatic priorities. An assessment of these concerns will inform the discussion of where international law currently fails to address cyber conflict.\nTable 6.1 Cyber conflicts and threats to security\n|   | Types | Cases  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  I. | Contentions over architecture and management of cyberspace | End-to-end argument\nLayers principle\nNetwork neutrality\n“Code is Law”  |\n|  II. | Cyber conflict for political advantage and profit | State power for political control\nCyber challenges to the state\nCompetitive politics via cyber venues\nCyber crime and cyber espionage  |\n|  III. | Cyber threats to national security | Militarization of cyberspace\nCyber warfare\nCyber threats to infrastructure\nCyber terrorism  |\nChoucri, N.

Table 6.1 The MIT Press. http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hhkrs\nContentions over architecture and management arise in the real domain as conflicts regarding the way that cyberspace is structured and regulated. Until recently, the United States\n Choucri, N. (2012). Cyberpolitics in International Relations. The MIT Press. http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hhkrs\nTurner 7\nhosted many of the organizations that oversee the regulation and structure of cyberspace at-large, but at the state level, the picture is a bit more fragmented. Choucri identifies four principles of architecture and management pertinent to the first kind of cyber conflict: the end-to-end argument, the layers principle, network neutrality, and “Code is Law”.\nThe end-to-end argument and layers principle work together to form cyberspace as it conceptually is. End-to-end refers to the layered structure of information passage through the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol(TCP/IP); namely that communication protocols are justified in the lower layers. This nature of TCP/IP is fundamental to the way cyberspace works, and so begets the layers principle: “the law should respect the integrity of layered Internet architecture.”\nThese network structures were produced by, and remain dominantly under the control of, American non-profits and the private sector; but the implications of these two principles to a review of current international law are clear. Effective multilateral agreements with regard to cyberspace should adequately address the TCP/IP structure by not violating the layered structure, or risk undermining the viability of the network for its intended purpose. This can be most\n Solum, Lawrence B. and Minn Chung. 2003. *The Layers Principle: Internet Architecture and the Law*. Public Law and Legal Theory Research Paper 55, University of San Diego School of Law, June.\nTurner 8\ndirectly achieved by regulating layers specifically, and applying regulations narrowly to the layers they affect.\nThe principle of network neutrality is associated with the architecture of the internet, but reflects an ideological bent, and as such has come to the center of debates regarding access to the open web. network neutrality proposes that the structure of cyberspace should concern itself only with transmission and connectivity, and not interfere with neutral access to any content on the web. This is the principle that receives the most contention from nations outside the United States.\nAn archetypal example of refuting network neutrality is China's Golden Shield project, colloquially known as the \"Great Firewall\".[15] While the activities of the Golden Shield program are an expression of state power for political control, a different sub-category of cyber conflict; the denial of access to certain cyber-spaces at the transport layer indicates that the PRC opposes or at least disregards the concept of net neutrality as a necessary component of cyberspace.\nThe final principle of architectural conflicts regarding cyberspace is a dictum that neatly surmises the first three in a neutral package: \"Code is Law\". Cyberspace is a human-made realm, and the constructed network structure that allows cyberspace to work also determines the limitations of how it can be used. Ultimately, this is a system determined by consensus of real domain actors, and a change in consensus can potentially change the structure of cyberspace as well.[16]\n[15] S. Chandel, Z. Jingji, Y. Yunnan, S. Jingyao and Z. Zhipeng, \"The Golden Shield Project of China: A Decade Later—An in-Depth Study of the Great Firewall,\" 2019 International Conference on Cyber-Enabled Distributed Computing and Knowledge Discovery (CyberC), Guilin, China, 2019, pp. 111-119, doi: 10.1109/CyberC.2019.00027.\n[16] Lessig, Lawrence. 1999. Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace. New York : Basic Books.\nTurner 9\nChoucri draws several correlates from these principles of cyber conflict, but the one most relevant to the creation of international law is as follows:\n“...The third correlate is the close coupling of politicization in cyberspace with the uses of regulatory instruments that have been effective in kinetic domains. In other words, the increasingly political nature of the cyber domain generally contributes to a growing propensity to use traditional regulatory instruments and leverages.”\nThis correlate signals that as cyberspace is politicized, there is greater opportunity to address conflicts within it through more traditional means, such as treaty or custom. The architectural and managerial principles of cyberspace provide a clear outline of how states can effectively craft international laws of cyberspace: with respect for its layered structure, with clear consensus definitions of neutrality, and with the acknowledgement that changing consensus can change the cyber environment itself.\nThe widest band of state activity falls into the second category of cyber conflict: conflict for political advantage and profit. There are two major pathways for this type of cyber conflict to affect international relations; cybercrime including espionage, and competitive politics through cyberspace.\nA distinction between these two activity types is their visibility. Competitive politics that employ cyberspace to accomplish goals tend to be fairly visible, taking place on the open web and frequently in tandem with real domain activity. Many competitive political strategies that take place in cyberspace utilize visibility as a primary component; either by uplifting the qualities of the acting state, or by displaying the shortcomings and flaws of an opposing state.\n Choucri, N. (2012). Cyberpolitics in International Relations. The MIT Press. http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hhkrs\nTurner 10\nCybercrime and espionage, on the other hand, by its very nature incorporates efforts to remain clandestine while generating political or economic gain for the actor. This type of activity can include using cyberspace to spy; hacking into government databases to retrieve classified information. It can also include the discreet theft of intellectual property, and the corruption of competitor states' information networks.\nWhile a distinguishing factor between competitive politics and cybercrime/espionage is visibility, both share features that challenge a nation's ability to attribute these activities. A hostile actor may transmit data through the network infrastructure of third-party states in order to disguise the origin of cybercrime, or call upon a foreign asset to publish propaganda from a distant geographic location, offering a means of obscuring the propaganda's source. The capacity that cyberspace creates for states to escalate competitive actions while maintaining deniability generates the third type of cyber conflict characterized by Choucri: cyber threats to national security.\nCyber threats to national security have been rising exponentially, generated by both cybercrime and competitive politics. This category includes militarization of cyberspace, cyber terrorism, threats to infrastructure and cyberwarfare generally. Most notably, these threats take specific forms based on the first two types of cyber conflict; their structure is limited by the architecture of cyberspace, and their purpose informed by the competitive politics therein. Cyber threats to national security are felt widely and are coming from all over the world, leveraging the permeability of cyberspace and its disregard for political borders.[18] In order to maintain cyberspace as a normative domain of international relations, while diminishing cyber threats to national security, a coordinated international response is necessary and may be facilitated\n[18] Talbot, David. 2010. *Moore’s Outlaws*. Technology Review 113 (4): 43. https://www.technologyreview.com/2010/06/22/202336/moores-outlaws/\nTurner 11\nthrough developing the international laws of cyberspace.\nIn keeping with Choucri's description of cyber conflict, the case section contextualizes the geopolitical position of each nation studied, using a measurement of power and trajectory called \"Geostrategic Momentum\". This measurement aligns with the lateral pressure framework of observing people, resources, and technology to draw its conclusions. International relations scholar Dani Belo has proposed a means of measuring the strategic actions of states over time by comparing socio-economic patterns with the level of success a nation has achieved relative to\nTurner 12\ntheir stated goals. Belo grounds this framework of “geostrategic momentum” in a hybrid approach to measuring power first developed by Michael Beckley and later revisited by Caleb Pomeroy, measuring both net resources and expenses per-capita, weighing these measurements against outcomes over time to determine a nation’s relative power.  These measurements are expressed by placing a nation’s “actual role” globally in juxtaposition with its “ideal role” based on its net per-capita resources and frequency of successful foreign policy actions.\nAn additional consideration that these case studies must make is that some less intensive types of cyber conflict are not necessarily the subject of international law. Cyberspace has greatly enhanced the opportunity for states to engage in intelligence competition; the practice of examining and generating actionable intelligence from the open information environment. This activity, while competitive and generative of conflict, is broadly accepted by states as an inherent cost to information sharing. When determining which activities necessitate a cooperative international legal response, an examination of how cyber conflict exceeds the bounds of acceptable competition must be undertaken. Such examinations indicate that the primary means through which cyber conflict exceeds the upper threshold of intelligence competition is the ability to generate large detrimental or deterrent effects at very little cost; a resource-asymmetry that has significant practical implications for competing states.\n Belo, Dani.

Costs of information gathering are greatly reduced through networked computer systems, both closed and open. These states and their pseudo- or non- state proxies may also readily launch low-level attacks such as disinformation campaigns without incurring the same disruptive costs that a military psychological operation or traditional propaganda effort may incur. instances of infrastructural sabotage, such as the disruption and denial of telecom and financial transaction services through malware and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, also provide directly damaging options to states at very little cost comparable to similar courses of action. The same principle of low-cost information warfare applies to more powerful states, when the other conditions of competition are less favorable.\nBelo’s measurement of geostrategic momentum characterizes the motivations of state actors, and Choucri’s categorization of cyber conflicts outlines the need for cooperative international responses, and frames the structural limitations of any such response. Taken together through focused case comparisons, an international legal response that can effectively attribute actions harmful cyber conflict may emerge.\n## Cases\n## China\nIn parallel with the chronological development of cyberspace as a domain of international conflict, China has held a steeply ascendant trajectory in nearly every realm of state power. As the primary political and economic rival of the United States, China holds advantages that loom large over the question of unipolarity. Namely, China’s actual global role is much smaller than its\n Clarke, R.A.; Knake, R.K. (2010). Cyber War: The Next Threat To National Security And What To Do About It. Harper Collins.\n Joseph, W. A. (2019). Politics in China: An introduction. Oxford University Press.\nTurner 14\npotential role, by a margin similar to the inverse of the United States (whose actual role tends to exceed its ideal potential role).\nThis potentiality gap provides opportunity to move more slowly than other nations with revisionist intent; utilizing a multiplicity of low-level conflict to subvert the option of open warfare with their great-power rival. Notably, military power remains one area where the United States maintains a clearly superior capacity. To this end, China’s approach to cyber conflict indicates an acknowledgement of areas where the PRC’s power is most advantageous, such as economy and political influence. Two such examples of China’s activity in cyber conflict include the “Great Firewall”, and “Great Cannon” methods.\nChina’s Great Firewall is an IP-based national internet boundary that blocks content in opposition to PRC objectives at the “gateway”(Transmission Layer of TCP/IP). This method of national censorship has come under fire as directly oppositional to the principle of network neutrality, and as China has expanded its exposure to western economies and societies, the Great Firewall approach has somewhat broken down and evolved toward individual surveillance under the Golden Shield Project. The Great Firewall and Golden Shield are manifestations of a normative counterargument to network neutrality, referred to casually as “cyber sovereignty”. This opposition to network neutrality falls firmly under the first type of Choucri’s categories of cyber conflict; conflict regarding the architecture and management of cyberspace. In light of heavy domestic and international opposition to the PRC’s conception of cyber sovereignty, China\n Pepe, Dr. Michael S., and Kaitlyn Krolik. “Using Power Cycle Theory and Role Realignment Theory to Recognize the International Roles of China and the United States.” International Journal of Business and Social Science, vol. 8, no. 4, Apr. 2017, pp. 20–28.\n Booze Allen Hamilton (2022).

The Great Cannon is a program that allows its user to inject malware into internet traffic passing through the Great Firewall. It leverages the massive internet user base in China to generate nearly insurmountable distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks; effectively closing down targeted websites. In March 2015, the non-profit Great Fire, which assists citizens of China in circumventing the Great Firewall, was targeted by the Great Cannon. The attack lasted five days, and targeted both the website as well as its host server with Amazon CloudFront, costing them nearly $30,000 a day in sustained denial of service. Between 2015 and 2018, evidence of Great Cannon activity arose in cyberattacks targeting apps used by the Hong Kong student protests, such as PopVote.\nBecause the Great Cannon shares source code with the Great Firewall, and has been used almost exclusively to damage the online presence of entities that oppose the PRC, it is almost certainly attributable to the PRC and its organs. It is also used primarily toward regions that Chinese officials consider \"domestic\". The PRC's approach to threats to their foreign interests is more detached. While many of the tactics remain similar, they utilize sponsored and aligned groups of hackers who may not be considered to be under the direct control of the PRC. This speaks directly to China's geopolitical situation.\n “佔中網被駭 恐影響投票數 (“Occupy Central Online Hacked.

(rep.). Same Cloak, More Dagger: Decoding how the People's Republic of China Uses Cyberattacks. Booze Allen Hamilton.\nTurner 16\nUnlike the actors in other cases, China's geopolitical position contains explicit benefits to maintaining a significantly more damaging but less attributable approach afforded by cyber conflict. The economic benefit that the PRC enjoys under the current international order is not something that China can necessarily afford to lose; and most of China's offensive cyber capabilities are positioned toward the political sustainability of the PRC.[31] This strategy appears designed to frustrate current oppositional international power structures, without generating kinetic threats to opposing states' national security. These activities outline an objective to stably shift power in cyberspace toward China by leveraging the massive user base within the Great Firewall; without engaging in hostility through more conventional means, or in areas where opposing state powers remain strongly superior.[32]\nWhen it comes to the international harm deployed by this strategy, it is difficult to stabilize against or directly deter through the system of international law. The strategy that China has selected obscures attribution of hostilities, while still creating circumstances that benefit China's own accumulation of power.[33] Still, generating an adequate means of attributing these types of conflict, whether they are enacted by a state or state-sponsored organization, may provide a pathway toward repair under international law.\n## Russia\nUnlike China's strategy, archetypal of a state actor ascending in overall power and influence; Russia's overall profile has been on a declining track for some time, their actual role\n[31] Hodgson, Q.

Russia presents a unique case as a great power in decline. Due to generational shock and chronic poverty, Russia has suffered a severely low birth rate since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, only recently reaching replacement levels again in 2007. This decline in relative population has suppressed Russia’s own defense capabilities entering the 21st Century. According to Belo,\n“The country possesses vast natural resources reserves and a large military, but the liabilities are enormous. Russia’s stagnating real wages, low labor productivity, internal political instability, decline in population, and increased spending on welfare decrease its potential to invest resources in elements of soft and hard power”\nRussia’s activity in cyber conflict has a strong tendency to rely on offensive capabilities regionally and in parallel with kinetic conflict and expansionist efforts, often targeting critical infrastructure. These tactics have increased in frequency and severity since 2007, in parallel with Russia's expansionist endeavors in Georgia, Crimea, and Ukraine.\nAnalysis of Russia’s near-abroad activity and outcomes show them to belong squarely to Choucri’s second category of cyber conflict; as a continuation of a larger strategy to “draft” power by degrading the capacity of their geopolitical region such that their relative power does not decline, despite their actual power doing so inevitably. A particularly strong evidentiary strategy is the intensity of Russia’s diasporadical outreach and the volume of russo-nationalistic propaganda that comprises their cyberspace presence in the post-soviet region.

Additionally, in order to maintain its relative power, Russia leverages the deniability of such activity, ultimately deferring accountability and legitimizing cyber conflicts for political gain. Globally, Russia utilizes low-level offensive strategies in cyberspace such as misinformation and espionage where more direct offenses would garner severe repercussions. The relative power of Russia’s targets in cyberspace also has a strong corollary with the chosen modes of cyber conflict. The Agent.btz incursion is a perfect example of Russia’s selective conflict.\nIn 2008, an incursion of malware meant to locate and retrieve sensitive information from closed government sites was identified in networks around the world, including the U.S. Department of Defense’s classified intranet. The incursion was named Agent.btz. The DoD determined that while no sensitive information was retrieved, the progenitor of the malware did have access to said information.\nThe brilliance of agent.btz was in its function: while it observed the network, it did not retrieve or send classified data at any point; operating more like a periscope into stored classified documents. Because of the quietness of the attack, it took US officials nearly five years to locate and attribute the malware, and only with the additional help of Dutch intelligence services. By that point, there was administrative disagreement on how to respond given that so much time had passed.\n Gabuev, A. (2018, February 23).

Often, offenses are carried out by state-sponsored private actors and proxies, further confusing the ability to construct a strategic response. Utilizing sponsored non-state actors also creates jurisdictional barriers that must be overcome by victim states, in terms of seeking reparation.\nEven when malware such as this becomes attributable to Russia, it is specifically to groups that do not necessarily meet the standard of government authority for attribution; groups like the Dukes. CozyDuke, known officially as APT(Advanced Persistent Threat)29, is one such group that works to specifically target Executive offices of states opposed to Russia, including the White House and US State Department. Such groups are technically private actors, often financed anonymously and provided instructions through non-cyber backchannels, obscuring attributability further.\n## The United States\nThe ability to obscure attribution doesn’t only serve less powerful nations; it can also be of value to more powerful nations who find themselves in less favorable positions. This often happens to the United States. As the progenitor of the needed network infrastructure for cyberspace activities, the United States maintains a technical advantage as a unipole that must be iterated to be maintained as the conditions of cyberspace evolve. Access to the open web is steadily rising over time, and this advantageous factor is no longer prominent enough to prevent damaging cyber conflict involving the United States.

Currently, the United States' contentions over the architecture and management of cyberspace are more about maintaining norms than establishing new ones, and fostering passive technological advances that allow the maintenance of a dominant cyberspace presence. conditions of cyber conflict for political gain or profit indicate that a hyper-defensive \"Firewall\" approach similar to that of China would not provide the United States a full deterrence strategy. Rather, The United States has explored possible responses to cyber conflict with certain conditions and responsibilities in mind: Non-escalation of the conflict itself, maintenance of its technological edge, and accurate and prompt attribution of internationally wrongful acts.\nUnfortunately, when the United States does itself engage in cyber conflict for political gain, it frequently does not follow these tendencies. This was the case with the Stuxnet virus. Stuxnet was a malware focused toward the industrial controls of Iranian nuclear research infrastructure, assumedly through a planted USB drive. The virus itself used pieces of code found earlier within the conficker virus, a \"worm\" type virus that originated in Romania. What it did was effectively destroy Iranian nuclear research infrastructure without creating a nuclear crisis, or inserting a military force of any kind.

The debate on this question has been mostly delayed, due in part to the obfuscation of attributability. While the attack has been all but traced back to the United States and its allies, clever use of cooperative regional proxies and obfuscatory tactics that the US had itself been victim of in the past has kept true accountability for Stuxnet out of reach.\nA major concern with the implementation of Stuxnet is that it may offer legitimacy to tactics that are ultimately harmful to a cooperative mitigation of cyber threats to national security. Lending credence to tactics that deny attribution is a high-risk strategy for the United States to undertake, and may not serve to maintain their current level of dominance in the cyber domain, given the relationship between these types of conflict and the national security threats they generate.\n## Legal Analysis of Case Activity\nDespite the many ways that cyberspace allows states in conflict to obfuscate attribution for damaging actions, the standards of attributing a wrongful act remain fairly clear. An internationally wrongful act can be attributed to a state when:\n(1) The actor has been empowered with government authority,\nand\n(2) when the act is taken as an exercise of that government authority.\nThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization CCDCOE Cyber Law Toolkit notes that\n Marr, Carson (2019) \"Cyberwarfare and Applied Just War Theory: Assessing the Stuxnet Worm through Jus ad Bellum and Jus in Bello,\" Penn Journal of Philosophy, Politics &amp; Economics: Vol. 14: Iss. 1, Article 2. Available at: https://repository.upenn.edu/spice/vol14/iss1/2\nTurner 22\n\"An internationally wrongful act can be attributed to a state if it was carried out by organs of the state, persons or entities empowered to exercise elements of governmental authority on behalf of that state, or agents acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of the state; or where the state acknowledges and adopts the act as its own.\"\nCyberspace incentivizes the denial of attribution by altering the cost and effect of international activity in ways that allow states to acquire significant political and economic gain. To the concern of the security and of every nation, incomplete or undecided legal doctrine on cyber conflict provides room for states to block attributability of internationally wrongful acts, avoiding traditional repercussions. Many current standards of international law overlap conceptually with state activity in cyberspace, but do not adequately address how the nature of cyberspace itself affects decision making in this domain.\nThrough the national profiles of activity in cyberspace, it is clear that states are not necessarily incentivized to work together at the risk of revealing their own activities in cyberspace. Getting powerful nations to dedicate large amounts of resources to stopping cyber conflict will pose a challenge, even though a more stable cyberspace is a communal good. A possible incentive to join in cooperative responses through treaty and custom may be overall exposure to cyber conflicts. Further study on specific measurable variables that could trace a given state's exposure to cyber conflict of any or all types is available through Choucri's work, and developing these measurements could help tailor specific incentive options for nations to collaborate on treaties addressing cyber conflict attribution.\n The Application of International Law to State Activity in Cyberspace New Zealand Office of Foreign Affairs (1 December 2020)\n International cyber law: interactive toolkit. (2023, March 20). Attribution. International cyber law: interactive toolkit. https://cyberlaw.ccdcoe.org/wiki/Attribution\nTurner 23\nOne current recommendation is that these gaps may be managed through a heightened due diligence standard; holding states responsible as proxy legal-persons for the data their infrastructure transmits. The implications of heightened responsibility of due diligence standards contains its own compelling set of challenges. An alternative may be to expedite the attribution process by creating an enhanced standard of cooperation through heightened due diligence specifically toward transmitted data; not as a means of attribution for aiding and abetting data transfer, but instead as a means to accelerate the process of accurately attributing the origin state of the offending action. Agreements to share public TCP/IP data with friendly nations respects the Layer Principle and doesn’t interfere with the End-to-End argument. Sharing residual data only addresses the transport layer of TCP/IP, and can be done without inhibiting access or transmission.\nTreaties allowing for narrow and specific data access from partner states under certain conditions could serve the purpose of limiting international conflict. Additionally, robust data-sharing agreements could narrow the possible pathways malicious data might take to arrive at its target, creating overall narrower channels of deduction for the harmed state. Creating data openness between states narrows the pathways that malicious data can travel without detection, heightening the cost of generating harmful effects in cyberspace. Enough nations doing so can create a “dragnet” effect, accelerating the attribution of malicious actors who would utilize public networks. Such an effect could cool cyber conflicts overall, by addressing the core incentive toward cyber conflict by heightening the initial costs to actors who would hope to remain anonymous.\n Jensen, Eric Talbot and Watts, Sean and Watts, Sean, *A Cyber Duty of Due Diligence: Gentle Civilizer or Crude Destabilizer?* (July 13, 2017). 95 Texas Law Review 1555 (2017), BYU Law Research Paper No. 17-16, Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3002036\nTurner 24"

The answers can be ordered under the following three headings: within man, within the structure of the separate states, within the system\" - Kenneth N. Waltz; Man, The State, and War (1959)\n## Introduction\nThe conception of the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET), an early predecessor to the internet, brought with it a litany of questions and debates regarding the role of conflict and security in cyberspace. As the internet developed into a tool of common use, these concerns have only been amplified, sustaining the long-term development of legal, defense, and intelligence frameworks. In fact, one of the first concerns leveled toward ARPANET was a lack of security protocol. In 1972, Willis Ware, an engineer working for the Research and Development (RAND) corporation, released a commissioned report on the challenges of securing information in an open network such as the internet.¹ The first of its kind, the “Ware Report” was declassified seven years later, and is widely considered the foundational document for cybersecurity. In it, Ware lists several items of note for the Defense Science Board, outlining actions and future research focused on resource sharing and “facilitating progress toward handling the open [information] environment”.²\nToday, power and conflict within the domain of cyberspace has become even more contentious. The relationship between cyberspace and existing international norms is muddied by its position as a domain of conflict that exists entirely within the information environment.³ Traditionally, the information environment has been the purview of espionage and intelligence\n¹ Willis Howard Ware, IEEE Computer Society. “Security Controls for Computer Systems, tech. report R-609-PR, RAND, Defense Science Board Task Force on Computer Security, 1972”. R-609- 1-PR was reissued Oct. 1979. This widely circulated report was informally known as 'the Ware report.'\n² ibid\n³ Bircher, John E. Issue brief.

This constant shift in technological and, by-proxy, environmental conditions challenges the international community’s ability to attribute and respond to harmful acts in cyberspace. Debate is also open on what kinds of activities must be tolerated as the natural costs of competition in this newer domain. The ability to generate outsized effects that might otherwise be too costly indicates that the geopolitical situation of states in competition affects their actions in cyber conflict. Overall, cyberspace violates previously held norms of international relations in ways that often serve to destabilize the current international order at a relatively low cost to the instigating party.⁵\nIn order to establish where the current international legal consensus is insufficient to divert or absolve conflict in cyberspace, behavioral norms of states and their proxies in cyber conflict must be positioned geopolitically and contextualized through the lens of current theories of international cyber conflict. This mode of analysis of state actors alongside the current state of international law in cyberspace reveals that barriers to attribution preventing retaliatory action might be hurdled by implementing a due diligence standard of data-sharing; streamlining the identification of hostile actors and potentially narrowing the network pathways that hostile actors can use to generate conflict.\n## Project Overview\nInterpreting the effects of interstate conflicts in a domain like cyberspace, with the capacity to drastically shift conditions from case-to-case, poses a major challenge to constructing\n⁴ Scott, Len &amp; Jackson, Peter.

It presents a description and examination of the current activities of a set of three predominant state powers; The United States, Russia, and China. The case section will frame these states in two ways within the field of international relations and security studies to establish a behavioral archetype of state activity in cyberspace. Firstly, the cases will measure the relative power and trajectory of the states in question, utilizing geostrategic momentum; a comparison of per-capita net resources and the relative success a given state has had in attaining its stated goals.⁶ This measurement will provide insight into how geopolitical context may change the motivations and incentives of powerful states in cyberspace. Secondly, the case study will employ Nazli Choucri’s three categorizations of cyber conflict to define the specific actions of selected states.⁷ Anchored in lateral pressure theory, these categorizations outline the argument that an international coordinated response is necessary to diminish cyber conflict, and helps to delineate which types of conflict in cyberspace could be affected by an international legal response. The goal of such a case comparison is to establish, through consistent and formal analysis,⁸ any cross-case behaviors in cyberspace that come into conflict with the durability of the current international status quo, how these courses of action are chosen, and how these activities obscure themselves from traditional thresholds of attribution in cyber conflict.\nThe main structural theory that this case study utilizes is the categorization of cyber conflict developed by Nazli Choucri, as an extension of the broader lateral pressure theory.⁹\n⁶ Michael Beckley; The Power of Nations: Measuring What Matters.

What is Lateral Pressure? | Nazli Choucri. Retrieved April 16, 2023, from https://nchoucri.mit.edu/theory/lateral-pressure\nTurner 4\nCyber conflict within lateral pressure theory is contextualized by a state’s propensity to act beyond its established boundaries, and measures this propensity through three driving factors; people, resources, and technology. As stated in an overview of lateral pressure theory:\n“As states expand their activities outside territorial boundaries, they encounter other states similarly engaged. Expansion may result in intersections among spheres of influence and set in motion complex interactions that can lead to escalation and conflict – or to cooperation and collaboration – depending on intents and capabilities.”¹⁰\nUnder lateral pressure theory, Cyberspace affects international relations in seven different ways:\nTable 1.1\nCharacteristics of cyberspace\n- Temporality—replaces conventional temporality with near instantaneity\n- Physicality—transcends constraints of geography and physical location\n- Permeation—penetrates boundaries and jurisdictions\n- Fluidity—manifests sustained shifts and reconfigurations\n- Participation—reduces barriers to activism and political expression\n- Attribution—obscures identities of actors and links to action\n- Accountability—bypasses mechanisms of responsibility\nChoucri, N.

These strategies necessitate an examination of the current conditions of international cyber conflict, and the development of guidelines for establishing cooperative strategies of attribution in this relatively new domain.\nChoucri characterizes three different categories of international cyber conflict; contentions over the architecture and management of cyberspace, cyber conflict for political advantage and profit, and cyber threats to national security. Architecture and management conflicts take place primarily outside of cyberspace, but state activities within cyberspace are a primary affecting agent in such negotiations, and the results of these contentions can shape the nature of cyberspace as a whole domain. The other two types of cyber conflict are inseparable from the architecture of cyberspace itself, and so any treaties or agreements governing them must account for this first type of cyber conflict, although it takes place in the “real” domain.\nCyber conflict for political advantage and profit comprise the widest band of interstate conflict in cyberspace. These conflicts include many national concerns, but “become\n¹¹ Choucri, N. (2012). Cyberpolitics in International Relations.

In the context of international lawmaking however, the national security concerns of a state provide a steep incentive that often shape its diplomatic priorities. An assessment of these concerns will inform the discussion of where international law currently fails to address cyber conflict.\nTable 6.1 Cyber conflicts and threats to security\n|   | Types | Cases  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  I. | Contentions over architecture and management of cyberspace | End-to-end argument\nLayers principle\nNetwork neutrality\n“Code is Law”  |\n|  II. | Cyber conflict for political advantage and profit | State power for political control\nCyber challenges to the state\nCompetitive politics via cyber venues\nCyber crime and cyber espionage  |\n|  III. | Cyber threats to national security | Militarization of cyberspace\nCyber warfare\nCyber threats to infrastructure\nCyber terrorism  |\nChoucri, N. (2012). Cyberpolitics in International Relations. Table 6.1 The MIT Press. http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hhkrs\nContentions over architecture and management arise in the real domain as conflicts regarding the way that cyberspace is structured and regulated. Until recently, the United States\n¹³ Choucri, N. (2012). Cyberpolitics in International Relations. The MIT Press. http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hhkrs\nTurner 7\nhosted many of the organizations that oversee the regulation and structure of cyberspace at-large, but at the state level, the picture is a bit more fragmented. Choucri identifies four principles of architecture and management pertinent to the first kind of cyber conflict: the end-to-end argument, the layers principle, network neutrality, and “Code is Law”.\nThe end-to-end argument and layers principle work together to form cyberspace as it conceptually is. End-to-end refers to the layered structure of information passage through the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol(TCP/IP); namely that communication protocols are justified in the lower layers. This nature of TCP/IP is fundamental to the way cyberspace works, and so begets the layers principle: “the law should respect the integrity of layered Internet architecture.”¹⁴\nThese network structures were produced by, and remain dominantly under the control of, American non-profits and the private sector; but the implications of these two principles to a review of current international law are clear. Effective multilateral agreements with regard to cyberspace should adequately address the TCP/IP structure by not violating the layered structure, or risk undermining the viability of the network for its intended purpose. This can be most\n¹⁴ Solum, Lawrence B. and Minn Chung. 2003. *The Layers Principle: Internet Architecture and the Law*. Public Law and Legal Theory Research Paper 55, University of San Diego School of Law, June.\nTurner 8\ndirectly achieved by regulating layers specifically, and applying regulations narrowly to the layers they affect.\nThe principle of network neutrality is associated with the architecture of the internet, but reflects an ideological bent, and as such has come to the center of debates regarding access to the open web. network neutrality proposes that the structure of cyberspace should concern itself only with transmission and connectivity, and not interfere with neutral access to any content on the web. This is the principle that receives the most contention from nations outside the United States.\nAn archetypal example of refuting network neutrality is China's Golden Shield project, colloquially known as the \"Great Firewall\". While the activities of the Golden Shield program are an expression of state power for political control, a different sub-category of cyber conflict; the denial of access to certain cyber-spaces at the transport layer indicates that the PRC opposes or at least disregards the concept of net neutrality as a necessary component of cyberspace.\nThe final principle of architectural conflicts regarding cyberspace is a dictum that neatly surmises the first three in a neutral package: \"Code is Law\". Cyberspace is a human-made realm, and the constructed network structure that allows cyberspace to work also determines the limitations of how it can be used. Ultimately, this is a system determined by consensus of real domain actors, and a change in consensus can potentially change the structure of cyberspace as well.\n S. Chandel, Z. Jingji, Y. Yunnan, S. Jingyao and Z. Zhipeng, \"The Golden Shield Project of China: A Decade Later—An in-Depth Study of the Great Firewall,\" 2019 International Conference on Cyber-Enabled Distributed Computing and Knowledge Discovery (CyberC), Guilin, China, 2019, pp. 111-119, doi: 10.1109/CyberC.2019.00027.\n Lessig, Lawrence. 1999. Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace. New York : Basic Books.\nTurner 9\nChoucri draws several correlates from these principles of cyber conflict, but the one most relevant to the creation of international law is as follows:\n“...The third correlate is the close coupling of politicization in cyberspace with the uses of regulatory instruments that have been effective in kinetic domains. In other words, the increasingly political nature of the cyber domain generally contributes to a growing propensity to use traditional regulatory instruments and leverages.”¹⁷\nThis correlate signals that as cyberspace is politicized, there is greater opportunity to address conflicts within it through more traditional means, such as treaty or custom. The architectural and managerial principles of cyberspace provide a clear outline of how states can effectively craft international laws of cyberspace: with respect for its layered structure, with clear consensus definitions of neutrality, and with the acknowledgement that changing consensus can change the cyber environment itself.\nThe widest band of state activity falls into the second category of cyber conflict: conflict for political advantage and profit. There are two major pathways for this type of cyber conflict to affect international relations; cybercrime including espionage, and competitive politics through cyberspace.\nA distinction between these two activity types is their visibility. Competitive politics that employ cyberspace to accomplish goals tend to be fairly visible, taking place on the open web and frequently in tandem with real domain activity. Many competitive political strategies that take place in cyberspace utilize visibility as a primary component; either by uplifting the qualities of the acting state, or by displaying the shortcomings and flaws of an opposing state.\n¹⁷ Choucri, N. (2012). Cyberpolitics in International Relations. The MIT Press. http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hhkrs\nTurner 10\nCybercrime and espionage, on the other hand, by its very nature incorporates efforts to remain clandestine while generating political or economic gain for the actor. This type of activity can include using cyberspace to spy; hacking into government databases to retrieve classified information. It can also include the discreet theft of intellectual property, and the corruption of competitor states' information networks.\nWhile a distinguishing factor between competitive politics and cybercrime/espionage is visibility, both share features that challenge a nation's ability to attribute these activities. A hostile actor may transmit data through the network infrastructure of third-party states in order to disguise the origin of cybercrime, or call upon a foreign asset to publish propaganda from a distant geographic location, offering a means of obscuring the propaganda's source. The capacity that cyberspace creates for states to escalate competitive actions while maintaining deniability generates the third type of cyber conflict characterized by Choucri: cyber threats to national security.\nCyber threats to national security have been rising exponentially, generated by both cybercrime and competitive politics. This category includes militarization of cyberspace, cyber terrorism, threats to infrastructure and cyberwarfare generally. Most notably, these threats take specific forms based on the first two types of cyber conflict; their structure is limited by the architecture of cyberspace, and their purpose informed by the competitive politics therein. Cyber threats to national security are felt widely and are coming from all over the world, leveraging the permeability of cyberspace and its disregard for political borders. In order to maintain cyberspace as a normative domain of international relations, while diminishing cyber threats to national security, a coordinated international response is necessary and may be facilitated\n Talbot, David. 2010. *Moore’s Outlaws*. Technology Review 113 (4): 43. https://www.technologyreview.com/2010/06/22/202336/moores-outlaws/\nTurner 11\nthrough developing the international laws of cyberspace.\nIn keeping with Choucri's description of cyber conflict, the case section contextualizes the geopolitical position of each nation studied, using a measurement of power and trajectory called \"Geostrategic Momentum\". This measurement aligns with the lateral pressure framework of observing people, resources, and technology to draw its conclusions. International relations scholar Dani Belo has proposed a means of measuring the strategic actions of states over time by comparing socio-economic patterns with the level of success a nation has achieved relative to\nTurner 12\ntheir stated goals.¹⁹ Belo grounds this framework of “geostrategic momentum” in a hybrid approach to measuring power first developed by Michael Beckley and later revisited by Caleb Pomeroy, measuring both net resources and expenses per-capita, weighing these measurements against outcomes over time to determine a nation’s relative power.²⁰ ²¹ These measurements are expressed by placing a nation’s “actual role” globally in juxtaposition with its “ideal role” based on its net per-capita resources and frequency of successful foreign policy actions.\nAn additional consideration that these case studies must make is that some less intensive types of cyber conflict are not necessarily the subject of international law. Cyberspace has greatly enhanced the opportunity for states to engage in intelligence competition; the practice of examining and generating actionable intelligence from the open information environment. This activity, while competitive and generative of conflict, is broadly accepted by states as an inherent cost to information sharing. When determining which activities necessitate a cooperative international legal response, an examination of how cyber conflict exceeds the bounds of acceptable competition must be undertaken.²² Such examinations indicate that the primary means through which cyber conflict exceeds the upper threshold of intelligence competition is the ability to generate large detrimental or deterrent effects at very little cost; a resource-asymmetry that has significant practical implications for competing states.²³\n¹⁹ Belo, Dani.

Costs of information gathering are greatly reduced through networked computer systems, both closed and open. These states and their pseudo- or non- state proxies may also readily launch low-level attacks such as disinformation campaigns without incurring the same disruptive costs that a military psychological operation or traditional propaganda effort may incur. instances of infrastructural sabotage, such as the disruption and denial of telecom and financial transaction services through malware and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, also provide directly damaging options to states at very little cost comparable to similar courses of action.²⁴ The same principle of low-cost information warfare applies to more powerful states, when the other conditions of competition are less favorable.\nBelo’s measurement of geostrategic momentum characterizes the motivations of state actors, and Choucri’s categorization of cyber conflicts outlines the need for cooperative international responses, and frames the structural limitations of any such response. Taken together through focused case comparisons, an international legal response that can effectively attribute actions harmful cyber conflict may emerge.\n## Cases\n## China\nIn parallel with the chronological development of cyberspace as a domain of international conflict, China has held a steeply ascendant trajectory in nearly every realm of state power.²⁵ As the primary political and economic rival of the United States, China holds advantages that loom large over the question of unipolarity. Namely, China’s actual global role is much smaller than its\n²⁴ Clarke, R.A.; Knake, R.K. (2010). Cyber War: The Next Threat To National Security And What To Do About It.

Oxford University Press.\nTurner 14\npotential role, by a margin similar to the inverse of the United States (whose actual role tends to exceed its ideal potential role).²⁶\nThis potentiality gap provides opportunity to move more slowly than other nations with revisionist intent; utilizing a multiplicity of low-level conflict to subvert the option of open warfare with their great-power rival. Notably, military power remains one area where the United States maintains a clearly superior capacity. To this end, China’s approach to cyber conflict indicates an acknowledgement of areas where the PRC’s power is most advantageous, such as economy and political influence.²⁷ Two such examples of China’s activity in cyber conflict include the “Great Firewall”, and “Great Cannon” methods.\nChina’s Great Firewall is an IP-based national internet boundary that blocks content in opposition to PRC objectives at the “gateway”(Transmission Layer of TCP/IP). This method of national censorship has come under fire as directly oppositional to the principle of network neutrality, and as China has expanded its exposure to western economies and societies, the Great Firewall approach has somewhat broken down and evolved toward individual surveillance under the Golden Shield Project. The Great Firewall and Golden Shield are manifestations of a normative counterargument to network neutrality, referred to casually as “cyber sovereignty”.²⁸ This opposition to network neutrality falls firmly under the first type of Choucri’s categories of cyber conflict; conflict regarding the architecture and management of cyberspace. In light of heavy domestic and international opposition to the PRC’s conception of cyber sovereignty, China\n²⁶ Pepe, Dr. Michael S., and Kaitlyn Krolik. “Using Power Cycle Theory and Role Realignment Theory to Recognize the International Roles of China and the United States.” International Journal of Business and Social Science, vol. 8, no. 4, Apr. 2017, pp. 20–28.\n²⁷ Booze Allen Hamilton (2022).

The Great Cannon is a program that allows its user to inject malware into internet traffic passing through the Great Firewall. It leverages the massive internet user base in China to generate nearly insurmountable distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks; effectively closing down targeted websites. In March 2015, the non-profit Great Fire, which assists citizens of China in circumventing the Great Firewall, was targeted by the Great Cannon. The attack lasted five days, and targeted both the website as well as its host server with Amazon CloudFront, costing them nearly $30,000 a day in sustained denial of service. Between 2015 and 2018, evidence of Great Cannon activity arose in cyberattacks targeting apps used by the Hong Kong student protests, such as PopVote.²⁹\nBecause the Great Cannon shares source code with the Great Firewall, and has been used almost exclusively to damage the online presence of entities that oppose the PRC, it is almost certainly attributable to the PRC and its organs. It is also used primarily toward regions that Chinese officials consider \"domestic\". The PRC's approach to threats to their foreign interests is more detached. While many of the tactics remain similar, they utilize sponsored and aligned groups of hackers who may not be considered to be under the direct control of the PRC.³⁰ This speaks directly to China's geopolitical situation.\n²⁹ “佔中網被駭 恐影響投票數 (“Occupy Central Online Hacked.

Booze Allen Hamilton.\nTurner 16\nUnlike the actors in other cases, China's geopolitical position contains explicit benefits to maintaining a significantly more damaging but less attributable approach afforded by cyber conflict. The economic benefit that the PRC enjoys under the current international order is not something that China can necessarily afford to lose; and most of China's offensive cyber capabilities are positioned toward the political sustainability of the PRC. This strategy appears designed to frustrate current oppositional international power structures, without generating kinetic threats to opposing states' national security. These activities outline an objective to stably shift power in cyberspace toward China by leveraging the massive user base within the Great Firewall; without engaging in hostility through more conventional means, or in areas where opposing state powers remain strongly superior.\nWhen it comes to the international harm deployed by this strategy, it is difficult to stabilize against or directly deter through the system of international law. The strategy that China has selected obscures attribution of hostilities, while still creating circumstances that benefit China's own accumulation of power. Still, generating an adequate means of attributing these types of conflict, whether they are enacted by a state or state-sponsored organization, may provide a pathway toward repair under international law.\n## Russia\nUnlike China's strategy, archetypal of a state actor ascending in overall power and influence; Russia's overall profile has been on a declining track for some time, their actual role\n Hodgson, Q.

Russia presents a unique case as a great power in decline. Due to generational shock and chronic poverty, Russia has suffered a severely low birth rate since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, only recently reaching replacement levels again in 2007.³⁴ This decline in relative population has suppressed Russia’s own defense capabilities entering the 21st Century. According to Belo,\n“The country possesses vast natural resources reserves and a large military, but the liabilities are enormous. Russia’s stagnating real wages, low labor productivity, internal political instability, decline in population, and increased spending on welfare decrease its potential to invest resources in elements of soft and hard power”³⁵\nRussia’s activity in cyber conflict has a strong tendency to rely on offensive capabilities regionally and in parallel with kinetic conflict and expansionist efforts, often targeting critical infrastructure.³⁶ These tactics have increased in frequency and severity since 2007, in parallel with Russia's expansionist endeavors in Georgia, Crimea, and Ukraine.³⁷\nAnalysis of Russia’s near-abroad activity and outcomes show them to belong squarely to Choucri’s second category of cyber conflict; as a continuation of a larger strategy to “draft” power by degrading the capacity of their geopolitical region such that their relative power does not decline, despite their actual power doing so inevitably. A particularly strong evidentiary strategy is the intensity of Russia’s diasporadical outreach and the volume of russo-nationalistic propaganda that comprises their cyberspace presence in the post-soviet region.

Globally, Russia utilizes low-level offensive strategies in cyberspace such as misinformation and espionage where more direct offenses would garner severe repercussions. The relative power of Russia’s targets in cyberspace also has a strong corollary with the chosen modes of cyber conflict.³⁹ The Agent.btz incursion is a perfect example of Russia’s selective conflict.\nIn 2008, an incursion of malware meant to locate and retrieve sensitive information from closed government sites was identified in networks around the world, including the U.S. Department of Defense’s classified intranet.⁴⁰ The incursion was named Agent.btz. The DoD determined that while no sensitive information was retrieved, the progenitor of the malware did have access to said information.\nThe brilliance of agent.btz was in its function: while it observed the network, it did not retrieve or send classified data at any point; operating more like a periscope into stored classified documents. Because of the quietness of the attack, it took US officials nearly five years to locate and attribute the malware, and only with the additional help of Dutch intelligence services. By that point, there was administrative disagreement on how to respond given that so much time had passed.\n³⁸ Gabuev, A. (2018, February 23).

Often, offenses are carried out by state-sponsored private actors and proxies, further confusing the ability to construct a strategic response. Utilizing sponsored non-state actors also creates jurisdictional barriers that must be overcome by victim states, in terms of seeking reparation.\nEven when malware such as this becomes attributable to Russia, it is specifically to groups that do not necessarily meet the standard of government authority for attribution; groups like the Dukes. CozyDuke, known officially as APT(Advanced Persistent Threat)29, is one such group that works to specifically target Executive offices of states opposed to Russia, including the White House and US State Department. Such groups are technically private actors, often financed anonymously and provided instructions through non-cyber backchannels, obscuring attributability further.\n## The United States\nThe ability to obscure attribution doesn’t only serve less powerful nations; it can also be of value to more powerful nations who find themselves in less favorable positions. This often happens to the United States. As the progenitor of the needed network infrastructure for cyberspace activities, the United States maintains a technical advantage as a unipole that must be iterated to be maintained as the conditions of cyberspace evolve.⁴¹ Access to the open web is steadily rising over time, and this advantageous factor is no longer prominent enough to prevent damaging cyber conflict involving the United States.⁴² Preservation of the interests of the United\n⁴¹ Yuan-kang Wang (2020) *The Durability of a Unipolar System: Lessons from East Asian History*, Security Studies, 29:5, 832-863, DOI: 10.1080/09636412.2020.1859127\n⁴² Brantly, Aaron F. “Entanglement in Cyberspace: Minding the Deterrence Gap.” Democracy and Security 16, no. 3 (2020): 210–33. https://doi.org/10.1080/17419166.2020.1773807.\nTurner 20\nStates as a unipole requires a strategy that acknowledges mere advantage as insufficient to generate complete deterrence, but a necessary component to maintain its interests in all three categories of cyber conflict described by Choucri. Currently, the United States' contentions over the architecture and management of cyberspace are more about maintaining norms than establishing new ones, and fostering passive technological advances that allow the maintenance of a dominant cyberspace presence. conditions of cyber conflict for political gain or profit indicate that a hyper-defensive \"Firewall\" approach similar to that of China would not provide the United States a full deterrence strategy.⁴³ Rather, The United States has explored possible responses to cyber conflict with certain conditions and responsibilities in mind: Non-escalation of the conflict itself, maintenance of its technological edge, and accurate and prompt attribution of internationally wrongful acts.⁴⁴ ⁴⁵ ⁴⁶\nUnfortunately, when the United States does itself engage in cyber conflict for political gain, it frequently does not follow these tendencies. This was the case with the Stuxnet virus. Stuxnet was a malware focused toward the industrial controls of Iranian nuclear research infrastructure, assumedly through a planted USB drive. The virus itself used pieces of code found earlier within the conficker virus, a \"worm\" type virus that originated in Romania.⁴⁷ What it did was effectively destroy Iranian nuclear research infrastructure without creating a nuclear crisis, or inserting a military force of any kind. This incident forced a major question of conflict to the forefront: is an attack that creates an effect similar to military intervention, but does not\n⁴³ Valeriano, B., &amp; Maness, R. C. (2014).

The debate on this question has been mostly delayed, due in part to the obfuscation of attributability.⁴⁸ While the attack has been all but traced back to the United States and its allies, clever use of cooperative regional proxies and obfuscatory tactics that the US had itself been victim of in the past has kept true accountability for Stuxnet out of reach.\nA major concern with the implementation of Stuxnet is that it may offer legitimacy to tactics that are ultimately harmful to a cooperative mitigation of cyber threats to national security. Lending credence to tactics that deny attribution is a high-risk strategy for the United States to undertake, and may not serve to maintain their current level of dominance in the cyber domain, given the relationship between these types of conflict and the national security threats they generate.\n## Legal Analysis of Case Activity\nDespite the many ways that cyberspace allows states in conflict to obfuscate attribution for damaging actions, the standards of attributing a wrongful act remain fairly clear. An internationally wrongful act can be attributed to a state when:\n(1) The actor has been empowered with government authority,\nand\n(2) when the act is taken as an exercise of that government authority.\nThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization CCDCOE Cyber Law Toolkit notes that\n⁴⁸ Marr, Carson (2019) \"Cyberwarfare and Applied Just War Theory: Assessing the Stuxnet Worm through Jus ad Bellum and Jus in Bello,\" Penn Journal of Philosophy, Politics &amp; Economics: Vol. 14: Iss. 1, Article 2. Available at: https://repository.upenn.edu/spice/vol14/iss1/2\nTurner 22\n\"An internationally wrongful act can be attributed to a state if it was carried out by organs of the state, persons or entities empowered to exercise elements of governmental authority on behalf of that state, or agents acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of the state; or where the state acknowledges and adopts the act as its own.\"⁴⁹ ⁵⁰\nCyberspace incentivizes the denial of attribution by altering the cost and effect of international activity in ways that allow states to acquire significant political and economic gain. To the concern of the security and of every nation, incomplete or undecided legal doctrine on cyber conflict provides room for states to block attributability of internationally wrongful acts, avoiding traditional repercussions. Many current standards of international law overlap conceptually with state activity in cyberspace, but do not adequately address how the nature of cyberspace itself affects decision making in this domain.\nThrough the national profiles of activity in cyberspace, it is clear that states are not necessarily incentivized to work together at the risk of revealing their own activities in cyberspace. Getting powerful nations to dedicate large amounts of resources to stopping cyber conflict will pose a challenge, even though a more stable cyberspace is a communal good. A possible incentive to join in cooperative responses through treaty and custom may be overall exposure to cyber conflicts. Further study on specific measurable variables that could trace a given state's exposure to cyber conflict of any or all types is available through Choucri's work, and developing these measurements could help tailor specific incentive options for nations to collaborate on treaties addressing cyber conflict attribution.\n⁴⁹ The Application of International Law to State Activity in Cyberspace New Zealand Office of Foreign Affairs (1 December 2020)\n⁵⁰ International cyber law: interactive toolkit. (2023, March 20). Attribution. International cyber law: interactive toolkit. https://cyberlaw.ccdcoe.org/wiki/Attribution\nTurner 23\nOne current recommendation is that these gaps may be managed through a heightened due diligence standard; holding states responsible as proxy legal-persons for the data their infrastructure transmits. The implications of heightened responsibility of due diligence standards contains its own compelling set of challenges.⁵¹ An alternative may be to expedite the attribution process by creating an enhanced standard of cooperation through heightened due diligence specifically toward transmitted data; not as a means of attribution for aiding and abetting data transfer, but instead as a means to accelerate the process of accurately attributing the origin state of the offending action. Agreements to share public TCP/IP data with friendly nations respects the Layer Principle and doesn’t interfere with the End-to-End argument. Sharing residual data only addresses the transport layer of TCP/IP, and can be done without inhibiting access or transmission.\nTreaties allowing for narrow and specific data access from partner states under certain conditions could serve the purpose of limiting international conflict. Additionally, robust data-sharing agreements could narrow the possible pathways malicious data might take to arrive at its target, creating overall narrower channels of deduction for the harmed state. Creating data openness between states narrows the pathways that malicious data can travel without detection, heightening the cost of generating harmful effects in cyberspace. Enough nations doing so can create a “dragnet” effect, accelerating the attribution of malicious actors who would utilize public networks. Such an effect could cool cyber conflicts overall, by addressing the core incentive toward cyber conflict by heightening the initial costs to actors who would hope to remain anonymous.\n⁵¹ Jensen, Eric Talbot and Watts, Sean and Watts, Sean, *A Cyber Duty of Due Diligence: Gentle Civilizer or Crude Destabilizer?* (July 13, 2017). 95 Texas Law Review 1555 (2017), BYU Law Research Paper No. 17-16, Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3002036\nTurner 24"

The answers can be ordered under the following three headings: within man, within the structure of the separate states, within the system\" - Kenneth N. Waltz; Man, The State, and War (1959)\n## Introduction\nThe conception of the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET), an early predecessor to the internet, brought with it a litany of questions and debates regarding the role of conflict and security in cyberspace. As the internet developed into a tool of common use, these concerns have only been amplified, sustaining the long-term development of legal, defense, and intelligence frameworks. In fact, one of the first concerns leveled toward ARPANET was a lack of security protocol. In 1972, Willis Ware, an engineer working for the Research and Development (RAND) corporation, released a commissioned report on the challenges of securing information in an open network such as the internet.¹ The first of its kind, the “Ware Report” was declassified seven years later, and is widely considered the foundational document for cybersecurity. In it, Ware lists several items of note for the Defense Science Board, outlining actions and future research focused on resource sharing and “facilitating progress toward handling the open [information] environment”.²\nToday, power and conflict within the domain of cyberspace has become even more contentious. The relationship between cyberspace and existing international norms is muddied by its position as a domain of conflict that exists entirely within the information environment.³ Traditionally, the information environment has been the purview of espionage and intelligence\n¹ Willis Howard Ware, IEEE Computer Society. “Security Controls for Computer Systems, tech. report R-609-PR, RAND, Defense Science Board Task Force on Computer Security, 1972”. R-609- 1-PR was reissued Oct. 1979. This widely circulated report was informally known as 'the Ware report.'\n² ibid\n³ Bircher, John E. Issue brief.

This constant shift in technological and, by-proxy, environmental conditions challenges the international community’s ability to attribute and respond to harmful acts in cyberspace. Debate is also open on what kinds of activities must be tolerated as the natural costs of competition in this newer domain. The ability to generate outsized effects that might otherwise be too costly indicates that the geopolitical situation of states in competition affects their actions in cyber conflict. Overall, cyberspace violates previously held norms of international relations in ways that often serve to destabilize the current international order at a relatively low cost to the instigating party.⁵\nIn order to establish where the current international legal consensus is insufficient to divert or absolve conflict in cyberspace, behavioral norms of states and their proxies in cyber conflict must be positioned geopolitically and contextualized through the lens of current theories of international cyber conflict. This mode of analysis of state actors alongside the current state of international law in cyberspace reveals that barriers to attribution preventing retaliatory action might be hurdled by implementing a due diligence standard of data-sharing; streamlining the identification of hostile actors and potentially narrowing the network pathways that hostile actors can use to generate conflict.\n## Project Overview\nInterpreting the effects of interstate conflicts in a domain like cyberspace, with the capacity to drastically shift conditions from case-to-case, poses a major challenge to constructing\n⁴ Scott, Len &amp; Jackson, Peter.

It presents a description and examination of the current activities of a set of three predominant state powers; The United States, Russia, and China. The case section will frame these states in two ways within the field of international relations and security studies to establish a behavioral archetype of state activity in cyberspace. Firstly, the cases will measure the relative power and trajectory of the states in question, utilizing geostrategic momentum; a comparison of per-capita net resources and the relative success a given state has had in attaining its stated goals.⁶ This measurement will provide insight into how geopolitical context may change the motivations and incentives of powerful states in cyberspace. Secondly, the case study will employ Nazli Choucri’s three categorizations of cyber conflict to define the specific actions of selected states.⁷ Anchored in lateral pressure theory, these categorizations outline the argument that an international coordinated response is necessary to diminish cyber conflict, and helps to delineate which types of conflict in cyberspace could be affected by an international legal response. The goal of such a case comparison is to establish, through consistent and formal analysis,⁸ any cross-case behaviors in cyberspace that come into conflict with the durability of the current international status quo, how these courses of action are chosen, and how these activities obscure themselves from traditional thresholds of attribution in cyber conflict.\nThe main structural theory that this case study utilizes is the categorization of cyber conflict developed by Nazli Choucri, as an extension of the broader lateral pressure theory.⁹\n⁶ Michael Beckley; The Power of Nations: Measuring What Matters.

As stated in an overview of lateral pressure theory:\n“As states expand their activities outside territorial boundaries, they encounter other states similarly engaged. Expansion may result in intersections among spheres of influence and set in motion complex interactions that can lead to escalation and conflict – or to cooperation and collaboration – depending on intents and capabilities.”¹⁰\nUnder lateral pressure theory, Cyberspace affects international relations in seven different ways:\nTable 1.1\nCharacteristics of cyberspace\n- Temporality—replaces conventional temporality with near instantaneity\n- Physicality—transcends constraints of geography and physical location\n- Permeation—penetrates boundaries and jurisdictions\n- Fluidity—manifests sustained shifts and reconfigurations\n- Participation—reduces barriers to activism and political expression\n- Attribution—obscures identities of actors and links to action\n- Accountability—bypasses mechanisms of responsibility\nChoucri, N.

These strategies necessitate an examination of the current conditions of international cyber conflict, and the development of guidelines for establishing cooperative strategies of attribution in this relatively new domain.\nChoucri characterizes three different categories of international cyber conflict; contentions over the architecture and management of cyberspace, cyber conflict for political advantage and profit, and cyber threats to national security. Architecture and management conflicts take place primarily outside of cyberspace, but state activities within cyberspace are a primary affecting agent in such negotiations, and the results of these contentions can shape the nature of cyberspace as a whole domain. The other two types of cyber conflict are inseparable from the architecture of cyberspace itself, and so any treaties or agreements governing them must account for this first type of cyber conflict, although it takes place in the “real” domain.\nCyber conflict for political advantage and profit comprise the widest band of interstate conflict in cyberspace. These conflicts include many national concerns, but “become\n¹¹ Choucri, N. (2012). Cyberpolitics in International Relations.

In the context of international lawmaking however, the national security concerns of a state provide a steep incentive that often shape its diplomatic priorities. An assessment of these concerns will inform the discussion of where international law currently fails to address cyber conflict.\nTable 6.1 Cyber conflicts and threats to security\n|   | Types | Cases  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  I. | Contentions over architecture and management of cyberspace | End-to-end argument\nLayers principle\nNetwork neutrality\n“Code is Law”  |\n|  II. | Cyber conflict for political advantage and profit | State power for political control\nCyber challenges to the state\nCompetitive politics via cyber venues\nCyber crime and cyber espionage  |\n|  III. | Cyber threats to national security | Militarization of cyberspace\nCyber warfare\nCyber threats to infrastructure\nCyber terrorism  |\nChoucri, N. (2012). Cyberpolitics in International Relations. Table 6.1 The MIT Press. http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hhkrs\nContentions over architecture and management arise in the real domain as conflicts regarding the way that cyberspace is structured and regulated. Until recently, the United States\n¹³ Choucri, N. (2012). Cyberpolitics in International Relations. The MIT Press. http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hhkrs\nTurner 7\nhosted many of the organizations that oversee the regulation and structure of cyberspace at-large, but at the state level, the picture is a bit more fragmented. Choucri identifies four principles of architecture and management pertinent to the first kind of cyber conflict: the end-to-end argument, the layers principle, network neutrality, and “Code is Law”.\nThe end-to-end argument and layers principle work together to form cyberspace as it conceptually is. End-to-end refers to the layered structure of information passage through the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol(TCP/IP); namely that communication protocols are justified in the lower layers. This nature of TCP/IP is fundamental to the way cyberspace works, and so begets the layers principle: “the law should respect the integrity of layered Internet architecture.”¹⁴\nThese network structures were produced by, and remain dominantly under the control of, American non-profits and the private sector; but the implications of these two principles to a review of current international law are clear. Effective multilateral agreements with regard to cyberspace should adequately address the TCP/IP structure by not violating the layered structure, or risk undermining the viability of the network for its intended purpose. This can be most\n¹⁴ Solum, Lawrence B. and Minn Chung. 2003. *The Layers Principle: Internet Architecture and the Law*. Public Law and Legal Theory Research Paper 55, University of San Diego School of Law, June.\nTurner 8\ndirectly achieved by regulating layers specifically, and applying regulations narrowly to the layers they affect.\nThe principle of network neutrality is associated with the architecture of the internet, but reflects an ideological bent, and as such has come to the center of debates regarding access to the open web. network neutrality proposes that the structure of cyberspace should concern itself only with transmission and connectivity, and not interfere with neutral access to any content on the web. This is the principle that receives the most contention from nations outside the United States.\nAn archetypal example of refuting network neutrality is China's Golden Shield project, colloquially known as the \"Great Firewall\".[15] While the activities of the Golden Shield program are an expression of state power for political control, a different sub-category of cyber conflict; the denial of access to certain cyber-spaces at the transport layer indicates that the PRC opposes or at least disregards the concept of net neutrality as a necessary component of cyberspace.\nThe final principle of architectural conflicts regarding cyberspace is a dictum that neatly surmises the first three in a neutral package: \"Code is Law\". Cyberspace is a human-made realm, and the constructed network structure that allows cyberspace to work also determines the limitations of how it can be used. Ultimately, this is a system determined by consensus of real domain actors, and a change in consensus can potentially change the structure of cyberspace as well.[16]\n[15] S. Chandel, Z. Jingji, Y. Yunnan, S. Jingyao and Z. Zhipeng, \"The Golden Shield Project of China: A Decade Later—An in-Depth Study of the Great Firewall,\" 2019 International Conference on Cyber-Enabled Distributed Computing and Knowledge Discovery (CyberC), Guilin, China, 2019, pp. 111-119, doi: 10.1109/CyberC.2019.00027.\n[16] Lessig, Lawrence. 1999. Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace. New York : Basic Books.\nTurner 9\nChoucri draws several correlates from these principles of cyber conflict, but the one most relevant to the creation of international law is as follows:\n“...The third correlate is the close coupling of politicization in cyberspace with the uses of regulatory instruments that have been effective in kinetic domains. In other words, the increasingly political nature of the cyber domain generally contributes to a growing propensity to use traditional regulatory instruments and leverages.”¹⁷\nThis correlate signals that as cyberspace is politicized, there is greater opportunity to address conflicts within it through more traditional means, such as treaty or custom. The architectural and managerial principles of cyberspace provide a clear outline of how states can effectively craft international laws of cyberspace: with respect for its layered structure, with clear consensus definitions of neutrality, and with the acknowledgement that changing consensus can change the cyber environment itself.\nThe widest band of state activity falls into the second category of cyber conflict: conflict for political advantage and profit. There are two major pathways for this type of cyber conflict to affect international relations; cybercrime including espionage, and competitive politics through cyberspace.\nA distinction between these two activity types is their visibility. Competitive politics that employ cyberspace to accomplish goals tend to be fairly visible, taking place on the open web and frequently in tandem with real domain activity. Many competitive political strategies that take place in cyberspace utilize visibility as a primary component; either by uplifting the qualities of the acting state, or by displaying the shortcomings and flaws of an opposing state.\n¹⁷ Choucri, N. (2012). Cyberpolitics in International Relations. The MIT Press. http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hhkrs\nTurner 10\nCybercrime and espionage, on the other hand, by its very nature incorporates efforts to remain clandestine while generating political or economic gain for the actor. This type of activity can include using cyberspace to spy; hacking into government databases to retrieve classified information. It can also include the discreet theft of intellectual property, and the corruption of competitor states' information networks.\nWhile a distinguishing factor between competitive politics and cybercrime/espionage is visibility, both share features that challenge a nation's ability to attribute these activities. A hostile actor may transmit data through the network infrastructure of third-party states in order to disguise the origin of cybercrime, or call upon a foreign asset to publish propaganda from a distant geographic location, offering a means of obscuring the propaganda's source. The capacity that cyberspace creates for states to escalate competitive actions while maintaining deniability generates the third type of cyber conflict characterized by Choucri: cyber threats to national security.\nCyber threats to national security have been rising exponentially, generated by both cybercrime and competitive politics. This category includes militarization of cyberspace, cyber terrorism, threats to infrastructure and cyberwarfare generally. Most notably, these threats take specific forms based on the first two types of cyber conflict; their structure is limited by the architecture of cyberspace, and their purpose informed by the competitive politics therein. Cyber threats to national security are felt widely and are coming from all over the world, leveraging the permeability of cyberspace and its disregard for political borders.[18] In order to maintain cyberspace as a normative domain of international relations, while diminishing cyber threats to national security, a coordinated international response is necessary and may be facilitated\n[18] Talbot, David. 2010. *Moore’s Outlaws*. Technology Review 113 (4): 43. https://www.technologyreview.com/2010/06/22/202336/moores-outlaws/\nTurner 11\nthrough developing the international laws of cyberspace.\nIn keeping with Choucri's description of cyber conflict, the case section contextualizes the geopolitical position of each nation studied, using a measurement of power and trajectory called \"Geostrategic Momentum\". This measurement aligns with the lateral pressure framework of observing people, resources, and technology to draw its conclusions. International relations scholar Dani Belo has proposed a means of measuring the strategic actions of states over time by comparing socio-economic patterns with the level of success a nation has achieved relative to\nTurner 12\ntheir stated goals.¹⁹ Belo grounds this framework of “geostrategic momentum” in a hybrid approach to measuring power first developed by Michael Beckley and later revisited by Caleb Pomeroy, measuring both net resources and expenses per-capita, weighing these measurements against outcomes over time to determine a nation’s relative power.²⁰ ²¹ These measurements are expressed by placing a nation’s “actual role” globally in juxtaposition with its “ideal role” based on its net per-capita resources and frequency of successful foreign policy actions.\nAn additional consideration that these case studies must make is that some less intensive types of cyber conflict are not necessarily the subject of international law. Cyberspace has greatly enhanced the opportunity for states to engage in intelligence competition; the practice of examining and generating actionable intelligence from the open information environment. This activity, while competitive and generative of conflict, is broadly accepted by states as an inherent cost to information sharing. When determining which activities necessitate a cooperative international legal response, an examination of how cyber conflict exceeds the bounds of acceptable competition must be undertaken.²² Such examinations indicate that the primary means through which cyber conflict exceeds the upper threshold of intelligence competition is the ability to generate large detrimental or deterrent effects at very little cost; a resource-asymmetry that has significant practical implications for competing states.²³\n¹⁹ Belo, Dani.

Costs of information gathering are greatly reduced through networked computer systems, both closed and open. These states and their pseudo- or non- state proxies may also readily launch low-level attacks such as disinformation campaigns without incurring the same disruptive costs that a military psychological operation or traditional propaganda effort may incur. instances of infrastructural sabotage, such as the disruption and denial of telecom and financial transaction services through malware and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, also provide directly damaging options to states at very little cost comparable to similar courses of action.²⁴ The same principle of low-cost information warfare applies to more powerful states, when the other conditions of competition are less favorable.\nBelo’s measurement of geostrategic momentum characterizes the motivations of state actors, and Choucri’s categorization of cyber conflicts outlines the need for cooperative international responses, and frames the structural limitations of any such response. Taken together through focused case comparisons, an international legal response that can effectively attribute actions harmful cyber conflict may emerge.\n## Cases\n## China\nIn parallel with the chronological development of cyberspace as a domain of international conflict, China has held a steeply ascendant trajectory in nearly every realm of state power.²⁵ As the primary political and economic rival of the United States, China holds advantages that loom large over the question of unipolarity. Namely, China’s actual global role is much smaller than its\n²⁴ Clarke, R.A.; Knake, R.K. (2010). Cyber War: The Next Threat To National Security And What To Do About It.

Oxford University Press.\nTurner 14\npotential role, by a margin similar to the inverse of the United States (whose actual role tends to exceed its ideal potential role).²⁶\nThis potentiality gap provides opportunity to move more slowly than other nations with revisionist intent; utilizing a multiplicity of low-level conflict to subvert the option of open warfare with their great-power rival. Notably, military power remains one area where the United States maintains a clearly superior capacity. To this end, China’s approach to cyber conflict indicates an acknowledgement of areas where the PRC’s power is most advantageous, such as economy and political influence.²⁷ Two such examples of China’s activity in cyber conflict include the “Great Firewall”, and “Great Cannon” methods.\nChina’s Great Firewall is an IP-based national internet boundary that blocks content in opposition to PRC objectives at the “gateway”(Transmission Layer of TCP/IP). This method of national censorship has come under fire as directly oppositional to the principle of network neutrality, and as China has expanded its exposure to western economies and societies, the Great Firewall approach has somewhat broken down and evolved toward individual surveillance under the Golden Shield Project. The Great Firewall and Golden Shield are manifestations of a normative counterargument to network neutrality, referred to casually as “cyber sovereignty”.²⁸ This opposition to network neutrality falls firmly under the first type of Choucri’s categories of cyber conflict; conflict regarding the architecture and management of cyberspace. In light of heavy domestic and international opposition to the PRC’s conception of cyber sovereignty, China\n²⁶ Pepe, Dr. Michael S., and Kaitlyn Krolik. “Using Power Cycle Theory and Role Realignment Theory to Recognize the International Roles of China and the United States.” International Journal of Business and Social Science, vol. 8, no. 4, Apr. 2017, pp. 20–28.\n²⁷ Booze Allen Hamilton (2022).

The Great Cannon is a program that allows its user to inject malware into internet traffic passing through the Great Firewall. It leverages the massive internet user base in China to generate nearly insurmountable distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks; effectively closing down targeted websites. In March 2015, the non-profit Great Fire, which assists citizens of China in circumventing the Great Firewall, was targeted by the Great Cannon. The attack lasted five days, and targeted both the website as well as its host server with Amazon CloudFront, costing them nearly $30,000 a day in sustained denial of service. Between 2015 and 2018, evidence of Great Cannon activity arose in cyberattacks targeting apps used by the Hong Kong student protests, such as PopVote.²⁹\nBecause the Great Cannon shares source code with the Great Firewall, and has been used almost exclusively to damage the online presence of entities that oppose the PRC, it is almost certainly attributable to the PRC and its organs. It is also used primarily toward regions that Chinese officials consider \"domestic\". The PRC's approach to threats to their foreign interests is more detached. While many of the tactics remain similar, they utilize sponsored and aligned groups of hackers who may not be considered to be under the direct control of the PRC.³⁰ This speaks directly to China's geopolitical situation.\n²⁹ “佔中網被駭 恐影響投票數 (“Occupy Central Online Hacked.

Booze Allen Hamilton.\nTurner 16\nUnlike the actors in other cases, China's geopolitical position contains explicit benefits to maintaining a significantly more damaging but less attributable approach afforded by cyber conflict. The economic benefit that the PRC enjoys under the current international order is not something that China can necessarily afford to lose; and most of China's offensive cyber capabilities are positioned toward the political sustainability of the PRC.[31] This strategy appears designed to frustrate current oppositional international power structures, without generating kinetic threats to opposing states' national security. These activities outline an objective to stably shift power in cyberspace toward China by leveraging the massive user base within the Great Firewall; without engaging in hostility through more conventional means, or in areas where opposing state powers remain strongly superior.[32]\nWhen it comes to the international harm deployed by this strategy, it is difficult to stabilize against or directly deter through the system of international law. The strategy that China has selected obscures attribution of hostilities, while still creating circumstances that benefit China's own accumulation of power.[33] Still, generating an adequate means of attributing these types of conflict, whether they are enacted by a state or state-sponsored organization, may provide a pathway toward repair under international law.\n## Russia\nUnlike China's strategy, archetypal of a state actor ascending in overall power and influence; Russia's overall profile has been on a declining track for some time, their actual role\n[31] Hodgson, Q.

Russia presents a unique case as a great power in decline. Due to generational shock and chronic poverty, Russia has suffered a severely low birth rate since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, only recently reaching replacement levels again in 2007.³⁴ This decline in relative population has suppressed Russia’s own defense capabilities entering the 21st Century. According to Belo,\n“The country possesses vast natural resources reserves and a large military, but the liabilities are enormous. Russia’s stagnating real wages, low labor productivity, internal political instability, decline in population, and increased spending on welfare decrease its potential to invest resources in elements of soft and hard power”³⁵\nRussia’s activity in cyber conflict has a strong tendency to rely on offensive capabilities regionally and in parallel with kinetic conflict and expansionist efforts, often targeting critical infrastructure.³⁶ These tactics have increased in frequency and severity since 2007, in parallel with Russia's expansionist endeavors in Georgia, Crimea, and Ukraine.³⁷\nAnalysis of Russia’s near-abroad activity and outcomes show them to belong squarely to Choucri’s second category of cyber conflict; as a continuation of a larger strategy to “draft” power by degrading the capacity of their geopolitical region such that their relative power does not decline, despite their actual power doing so inevitably. A particularly strong evidentiary strategy is the intensity of Russia’s diasporadical outreach and the volume of russo-nationalistic propaganda that comprises their cyberspace presence in the post-soviet region.

Globally, Russia utilizes low-level offensive strategies in cyberspace such as misinformation and espionage where more direct offenses would garner severe repercussions. The relative power of Russia’s targets in cyberspace also has a strong corollary with the chosen modes of cyber conflict.³⁹ The Agent.btz incursion is a perfect example of Russia’s selective conflict.\nIn 2008, an incursion of malware meant to locate and retrieve sensitive information from closed government sites was identified in networks around the world, including the U.S. Department of Defense’s classified intranet.⁴⁰ The incursion was named Agent.btz. The DoD determined that while no sensitive information was retrieved, the progenitor of the malware did have access to said information.\nThe brilliance of agent.btz was in its function: while it observed the network, it did not retrieve or send classified data at any point; operating more like a periscope into stored classified documents. Because of the quietness of the attack, it took US officials nearly five years to locate and attribute the malware, and only with the additional help of Dutch intelligence services. By that point, there was administrative disagreement on how to respond given that so much time had passed.\n³⁸ Gabuev, A. (2018, February 23).

Often, offenses are carried out by state-sponsored private actors and proxies, further confusing the ability to construct a strategic response. Utilizing sponsored non-state actors also creates jurisdictional barriers that must be overcome by victim states, in terms of seeking reparation.\nEven when malware such as this becomes attributable to Russia, it is specifically to groups that do not necessarily meet the standard of government authority for attribution; groups like the Dukes. CozyDuke, known officially as APT(Advanced Persistent Threat)29, is one such group that works to specifically target Executive offices of states opposed to Russia, including the White House and US State Department. Such groups are technically private actors, often financed anonymously and provided instructions through non-cyber backchannels, obscuring attributability further.\n## The United States\nThe ability to obscure attribution doesn’t only serve less powerful nations; it can also be of value to more powerful nations who find themselves in less favorable positions. This often happens to the United States. As the progenitor of the needed network infrastructure for cyberspace activities, the United States maintains a technical advantage as a unipole that must be iterated to be maintained as the conditions of cyberspace evolve.⁴¹ Access to the open web is steadily rising over time, and this advantageous factor is no longer prominent enough to prevent damaging cyber conflict involving the United States.⁴² Preservation of the interests of the United\n⁴¹ Yuan-kang Wang (2020) *The Durability of a Unipolar System: Lessons from East Asian History*, Security Studies, 29:5, 832-863, DOI: 10.1080/09636412.2020.1859127\n⁴² Brantly, Aaron F. “Entanglement in Cyberspace: Minding the Deterrence Gap.” Democracy and Security 16, no. 3 (2020): 210–33. https://doi.org/10.1080/17419166.2020.1773807.\nTurner 20\nStates as a unipole requires a strategy that acknowledges mere advantage as insufficient to generate complete deterrence, but a necessary component to maintain its interests in all three categories of cyber conflict described by Choucri. Currently, the United States' contentions over the architecture and management of cyberspace are more about maintaining norms than establishing new ones, and fostering passive technological advances that allow the maintenance of a dominant cyberspace presence. conditions of cyber conflict for political gain or profit indicate that a hyper-defensive \"Firewall\" approach similar to that of China would not provide the United States a full deterrence strategy.⁴³ Rather, The United States has explored possible responses to cyber conflict with certain conditions and responsibilities in mind: Non-escalation of the conflict itself, maintenance of its technological edge, and accurate and prompt attribution of internationally wrongful acts.⁴⁴ ⁴⁵ ⁴⁶\nUnfortunately, when the United States does itself engage in cyber conflict for political gain, it frequently does not follow these tendencies. This was the case with the Stuxnet virus. Stuxnet was a malware focused toward the industrial controls of Iranian nuclear research infrastructure, assumedly through a planted USB drive. The virus itself used pieces of code found earlier within the conficker virus, a \"worm\" type virus that originated in Romania.⁴⁷ What it did was effectively destroy Iranian nuclear research infrastructure without creating a nuclear crisis, or inserting a military force of any kind.

The debate on this question has been mostly delayed, due in part to the obfuscation of attributability.⁴⁸ While the attack has been all but traced back to the United States and its allies, clever use of cooperative regional proxies and obfuscatory tactics that the US had itself been victim of in the past has kept true accountability for Stuxnet out of reach.\nA major concern with the implementation of Stuxnet is that it may offer legitimacy to tactics that are ultimately harmful to a cooperative mitigation of cyber threats to national security. Lending credence to tactics that deny attribution is a high-risk strategy for the United States to undertake, and may not serve to maintain their current level of dominance in the cyber domain, given the relationship between these types of conflict and the national security threats they generate.\n## Legal Analysis of Case Activity\nDespite the many ways that cyberspace allows states in conflict to obfuscate attribution for damaging actions, the standards of attributing a wrongful act remain fairly clear. An internationally wrongful act can be attributed to a state when:\n(1) The actor has been empowered with government authority,\nand\n(2) when the act is taken as an exercise of that government authority.\nThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization CCDCOE Cyber Law Toolkit notes that\n⁴⁸ Marr, Carson (2019) \"Cyberwarfare and Applied Just War Theory: Assessing the Stuxnet Worm through Jus ad Bellum and Jus in Bello,\" Penn Journal of Philosophy, Politics &amp; Economics: Vol. 14: Iss. 1, Article 2. Available at: https://repository.upenn.edu/spice/vol14/iss1/2\nTurner 22\n\"An internationally wrongful act can be attributed to a state if it was carried out by organs of the state, persons or entities empowered to exercise elements of governmental authority on behalf of that state, or agents acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of the state; or where the state acknowledges and adopts the act as its own.\"⁴⁹ ⁵⁰\nCyberspace incentivizes the denial of attribution by altering the cost and effect of international activity in ways that allow states to acquire significant political and economic gain. To the concern of the security and of every nation, incomplete or undecided legal doctrine on cyber conflict provides room for states to block attributability of internationally wrongful acts, avoiding traditional repercussions. Many current standards of international law overlap conceptually with state activity in cyberspace, but do not adequately address how the nature of cyberspace itself affects decision making in this domain.\nThrough the national profiles of activity in cyberspace, it is clear that states are not necessarily incentivized to work together at the risk of revealing their own activities in cyberspace. Getting powerful nations to dedicate large amounts of resources to stopping cyber conflict will pose a challenge, even though a more stable cyberspace is a communal good. A possible incentive to join in cooperative responses through treaty and custom may be overall exposure to cyber conflicts. Further study on specific measurable variables that could trace a given state's exposure to cyber conflict of any or all types is available through Choucri's work, and developing these measurements could help tailor specific incentive options for nations to collaborate on treaties addressing cyber conflict attribution.\n⁴⁹ The Application of International Law to State Activity in Cyberspace New Zealand Office of Foreign Affairs (1 December 2020)\n⁵⁰ International cyber law: interactive toolkit. (2023, March 20). Attribution. International cyber law: interactive toolkit. https://cyberlaw.ccdcoe.org/wiki/Attribution\nTurner 23\nOne current recommendation is that these gaps may be managed through a heightened due diligence standard; holding states responsible as proxy legal-persons for the data their infrastructure transmits. The implications of heightened responsibility of due diligence standards contains its own compelling set of challenges.⁵¹ An alternative may be to expedite the attribution process by creating an enhanced standard of cooperation through heightened due diligence specifically toward transmitted data; not as a means of attribution for aiding and abetting data transfer, but instead as a means to accelerate the process of accurately attributing the origin state of the offending action. Agreements to share public TCP/IP data with friendly nations respects the Layer Principle and doesn’t interfere with the End-to-End argument. Sharing residual data only addresses the transport layer of TCP/IP, and can be done without inhibiting access or transmission.\nTreaties allowing for narrow and specific data access from partner states under certain conditions could serve the purpose of limiting international conflict. Additionally, robust data-sharing agreements could narrow the possible pathways malicious data might take to arrive at its target, creating overall narrower channels of deduction for the harmed state. Creating data openness between states narrows the pathways that malicious data can travel without detection, heightening the cost of generating harmful effects in cyberspace. Enough nations doing so can create a “dragnet” effect, accelerating the attribution of malicious actors who would utilize public networks. Such an effect could cool cyber conflicts overall, by addressing the core incentive toward cyber conflict by heightening the initial costs to actors who would hope to remain anonymous.\n⁵¹ Jensen, Eric Talbot and Watts, Sean and Watts, Sean, *A Cyber Duty of Due Diligence: Gentle Civilizer or Crude Destabilizer?* (July 13, 2017). 95 Texas Law Review 1555 (2017), BYU Law Research Paper No. 17-16, Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3002036\nTurner 24"
