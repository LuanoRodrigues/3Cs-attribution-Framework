INTRODUCTION\n\nAttribution in cyberspace is one of the most difficult questions facing policy makers, lawyers, and jurists. Indeed, the first question often asked in the wake of a cyber incident is “who did it?” The answer to this question is often critical when dealing with the application of international law because it will dictate the rights and responsibilities of States both from an offensive and defensive perspective. Without proper attribution, for example, a State’s responsive capabilities are limited. Making matters worse, attribution is difficult to establish factually. Non-State actors often mask their identity, and State actors often hide their true intentions. The degree to which the international rules governing State attribution apply in cyberspace is therefore a matter of great public importance.\n\nIt is widely accepted amongst States and scholars that the rules of international State responsibility generally apply in cyberspace. Those rules, reflective of the *lex generalis*, provide that the acts of a State’s *de jure* and *de facto* organs are generally attributable to the State.² The internationally wrongful acts of non-State actors (who are neither *de jure* nor *de facto* State organs) may also be imputed to the State if the non-State actors operate on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of the State.³ This general rule relative to non-State actors, commonly referred to as the “effective control”⁴ test, is widely recognized as the *lex generalis*\n\ngoverning imputed State responsibility for the internationally wrongful acts of non-State actors. Accordingly, as the *lex generalis*, the rule does not vary “with the nature of the wrongful act in question” unless there is a “clearly expressed lex specialis.”⁵ The “effective control” test, as the *lex generalis*, therefore applies in cyberspace.⁶\n\nThis paper posits that a new *lex specialis* is, in fact, forming that, if risen to the level of customary international law, would supplant the *lex generalis* “effective control” test and allow for imputed State responsibility for the internationally wrongful cyber operations of non-State actors even in the absence of express direction or control. This new test, which this paper calls the “control and capabilities” test, would allow for the attribution of non-State actor cyber activity based on a multi-factored test, examining: (1) the relationship between the non-State actor and the State, if any; (2) the cyber methods used by the non-State actor and whether those methods are similar to the State; (3) the motivations of the two parties, if known; (4) the similarity in technology and/or code used by the two parties; (5) the technical capabilities of the two parties; and (6) geographic location. In other words, direction and control are\n\n978-1-5386-2379-4/17/$31.00 ©2017 IEEE",

And if this test were to reach the level of customary international law, it would supplant the lex generalis rule of “effective control” and mark a significant shift in how actions may be attributed under the law of imputed State responsibility in cyberspace.7 Below is a summary of this developing test, and thoughts on how it may impact the overall corpus of international law in cyberspace.\n\n## II. ATTRIBUTION LEGAL FRAMEWORK\n\n### A. Law of State Responsibility\n\nThe law of State responsibility is premised on two elements: (1) whether the act or omission in question is internationally wrongful; and (2) whether the act or omission in question is attributable to the State.8 This paper only focuses on the latter as a normative question.9\n\n### B. Attribution Tests\n\n#### 1) Direct Attribution - De Jure and De Facto State Organs\n\nAs a general rule, a “State is responsible only for its own conduct, that is to say the conduct of persons acting, on whatever basis, on its behalf[.]”10 This includes acts:\n\ncarried out by [State] official organs, and also by persons or entities which are not formally recognized as official organs under internal law but which must nevertheless be equated with State organs because they are in a relationship of complete dependence on the State.11\n\nThese types of individuals and groups are commonly referred to as de jure and de facto State organs. Both are recognized under Articles 4-6 of the Articles on State Responsibility,12 and it is widely accepted that the conduct of de jure and de facto State organs are generally attributable to the State.13\n\n#### 2) Imputed Attribution - Control and Direction\n\nThe conduct of a non-State actor that is neither a de jure nor de facto State organ may also be attributable to the State\n\n“if the [non-State actor] is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, [the] State in carrying out the conduct[.]”14 This direction and control test, known as the “effective control” test, reflects the lex generalis as it pertains to imputed State responsibility for the conduct of non-State actors.\n\n##### a) Effective Control Test - Background\n\nThe “effective control” test was first outlined by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in its 1986 case concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua wherein the Court examined whether US control over Nicaraguan Contras was sufficient to impute the actions of the Contras to the US under international law. The Court made clear that the actions of non-State actors not totally dependent on the State (but who are nonetheless paid, financed and equipped by the State) would be attributed to the State only if it were established that the State “directed or enforced the perpetration” of the internationally wrongful acts in question.15 Under this “effective control” test, the Court determined that although the US was responsible for the general “planning, direction and support” given to the Contras, the US was not internationally responsible for the internationally wrongful actions of the Contras because “there [was] no clear evidence of the US having actually exercised such a degree of control in all fields as to justify treating the [Contras] as acting on its behalf.”16 This “effective control” test, reflected in Article 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility,17 was expressly endorsed by the International Group of Experts (IGE) in the recently published Tallinn Manual 2.0 as reflective of customary international law.18\n\n##### b) Overall Control Test Introduced\n\nThirteen years later, in 1999, a competing test known as the “overall control” test was introduced by the Appeals Chamber of the United Nations International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in its influential Tadić opinion. The tribunal rejected the “effective control” test, and instead applied an “overall control” test to determine the attribution of acts of hierarchically structured groups, such as a military unit or armed bands of irregulars or rebels under the jus in bello.19 In such circumstances, the tribunal noted, the State will be internationally responsible for the wrongful\n\n7 Nicaragua, note 4, at 109, 115; Congo, note 4, at 228; Bosnia Genocide, note 2, at 168-211.\n\n8 Articles on State Responsibility, note 3, at art. 2(a)-(b); Michael N.

The tribunal adopted this approach with hierarchically structured groups,²⁰ and limited its decision to the application of the jus in bello as it was determining the existence of an international armed conflict under the Fourth Geneva Convention of August 12, 1949.²¹ The “overall control” test is discussed in the commentaries to Article 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility, and is generally seen as a lower standard of attribution than the “effective control” test.²²\n\n## c) Effective Control Test Revisited\n\nThe ICJ revisited the “effective control” test in 2007 in the case concerning the Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. The Court criticized the ICTY’s “overall control” test as going beyond the ICTY’s jurisdiction, and being unsupported in State practice. The Court reaffirmed the customary status of the “effective control” test, and announced that the actions of the Republika Srpska and certain paramilitary groups known as the Scorpions, Red Berets, Tigers and White Eagles were not attributable to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) because there was insufficient evidence demonstrating that State instruction and direction was given with regard to each operation in which the alleged violations occurred, and not generally in respect of the overall actions taken by the persons or groups of persons having committed the violations.²³ Consequently, and controversially, the Court determined that the FRY could not be internationally responsible for the acts committed by the non-State actors in question, most notably for the massacres at Srebrenica.²⁴\n\n## d) Safe Harbor / Duty To Prevent\n\nThere has been additional State practice endorsing a theory for imputed State responsibility wherein the State in question harbors and provides material support to those who cause harm in another State. After the September 11, 2001 attacks, the US invoked its right to self-defense pursuant to Article 51 of the United Nations Charter on the premise that\n\nthe September 11 attacks constituted an “armed attack.”²⁵ The US attributed those attacks to the Taliban regime in Afghanistan because they were “made possible by the decision of the Taliban regime to allow the parts of Afghanistan that it controls to be used by this organization as a base of operation.”²⁶ The global community generally accepted the legality of this action.²⁷\n\nThis “safe harbor” principle is notable because it attributes the acts of a non-State actor to the State not based on direction or control, but based on an obligation otherwise understood as the duty to prevent trans-boundary harm and the “due diligence” principle as articulated in the 1941 Trial Smelter arbitration,²⁸ the ICJ’s Corfu Channel judgment,²⁹ the ICJ’s Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons,³⁰ and the ICJ’s Case Concerning Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project judgment.³¹ The “due diligence” principle has been applied to many areas of international law, including international environmental law,³² human rights law,³³ and State responsibility.³⁴ It is distinct from imputed State responsibility because due diligence is an “obligation of conduct rather than of result[.]”³⁵ The degree to\n\n²⁰ Ibid.\n\n²¹ Art. 2 of the Statute of the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991, S/RES/827 (1993) of 25 May 1993, Annex.\n\n²² Articles on State Responsibility, note 3, at art. 8, commentary (5) (noting it is a “matter for appreciation in each case whether particular conduct was or was not carried out under the control of a State, to such an extent that the conduct controlled should be attributed to it).\n\n²³ Bosnia Genocide, note 2, at 208.\n\n²⁴ Id. at 206-08.\n\n²⁵ UN Security Council, Letter Dated 7 October 2001 From the Permanent Representative of the United States of America to the United Nations Addressed to the President of the Security Council, UN Doc No S/2001/946 (2001).\n\n²⁶ Ibid.\n\n²⁷ See G.A.

The IGE recognized the tension between the “effective” and “overall” control tests in the 2013 Tallinn Manual when examining the *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello*,⁴⁰ but concluded the application of the “effective control” test in the context of peacetime operations in the revised 2017 Tallinn Manual 2.0.⁴¹ Specifically, Rule 17 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0, reflecting Article 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility, provides that cyber operations conducted by a non-State actor are attributable to a State when “engaged in pursuant to its instruction or under its direction or control[.].”⁴²\n\nBy this standard, the IGE notes that a State may, either by specific direction or by exercising control over a group, in effect assume responsibility for their conduct, with each case dependent on its own facts.⁴³ Instruction within this context “refers most typically to situations in which a non-State actor functions as a State’s auxiliary.”⁴⁴ And a State is in “effective control” of a particular cyber operation by a non-State actor whenever it is the State that “determines the execution and course of the specific operation and the cyber activity engaged in by the non-State actor is an ‘integral part of that operation.’ Effective control includes both the ability to cause constituent activities of the operation to occur, as well as the ability to order the cessation of those that are underway.”⁴⁵\n\n## III. THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CONTROL AND CAPABILITIES TEST\n\nIt is thus well accepted that the “effective control” test represents the *lex generalis* governing the attribution of internationally wrongful conduct of non-State actors to the State. As the *lex generalis*, this test applies in all situations unless there is an express *lex specialis* providing otherwise.⁴⁶\n\nAs explained below, a review of State practice since 2014 reveals that a new *lex specialis* has, in fact, begun to form that would, if risen to the level of customary international law, supplant the *lex generalis* “effective control” test in cyberspace. This state practice involves States that have publicly attributed the cyber operations of non-State actors to States on the basis the basis of a multitude of factors, including but not limited to (1) the relationship between the non-State actor and the State, if any; (2) the cyber methods used by the non-State actor and whether those methods are similar to the State; (3) the motivations of the two parties, if known; (4) the similarity in technology and/or code used by the two parties; (5) the technical capabilities of the two parties; and (6) geographic location. Direction and control have not been dispositive factors. Although the second element for the development of custom, that is opinio juris, has been lacking thus far, the development of the *actus* State practice is of note.\n\n## A.

State Practice Supporting The Control and Capabilities Test\n\n### 1) Pre-2014 Attribution Based on Control and Capabilities Test\n\nPrior to 2014, public attribution of internationally wrongful cyber operations was virtually non-existent. Private attribution, however, began to follow the control and capabilities factors set forth above as early as 2007. In 2007, after Estonia was hit with a wave of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks after deciding to remove a Soviet-era bronze soldier monument from its location in central Tallinn, Estonia, for example, a number of scholars and jurists privately attributed the attacks to Russia.⁵⁰ Evidence showed that the “hackers claimed to be Russian, the tools to hack and deface were contained in Russian websites and chatrooms, and the attacks picked a day of” significance to most Russians.⁵¹ Moreover, although the botnets used computers from different countries, at least some of the attacks “originated from Russian IP (internet protocol) addresses, including those of state institutions.”⁵²\n\nIn 2008, a similar scenario played out with Russia being privately blamed for carrying out a DDoS attack during its 2008 conflict with Georgia⁵³ wherein fifty-four “web sites in Georgia related to communications, finance, and the government” were attacked⁵⁴ “immediately before and continu[ing] throughout the armed conflict between” the two States.⁵⁵ All signs pointed to a Russian hacker community as\n\nthe responsible perpetrator,⁵⁶ including the fact that coordination for the attacks took place in the Russian language, and in Russian or Russia-related “fora.”⁵⁷\n\nLikewise, despite confirmation from State actors regarding the 2010 Stuxnet virus,⁵⁸ and although it has been reported that the Stuxnet virus was formally developed under US administrations,⁵⁹ no formal attribution was declared.\n\nAdditional pre-2014 activity included the 2013, and controversial Mandiant Report which attributed APT1 attacks to the Chinese State based on the geographic location of the bad actors, the methods and capabilities of the actors in question, and the motivations of the Chinese State.\n\n### 2) Sony 2014\n\nIt was not until 2014 that a State first publicly attributed what appeared to be a non-State actor’s unlawful cyber operations to a State. In 2014, Sony Pictures was hit with a highly publicized DDoS attack of unknown proportions after its computer systems were compromised by suspected North Korean tied hackers.⁶⁰ The attack surrounded the release of the movie “The Interview” about the fictional assassination of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. Prior to the movie’s release, the spokesperson for North Korea’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement “that the country would take ‘a decisive and merciless countermeasure’ if the United States’ government permitted Sony to make its planned Christmas release of the comedy.”⁶¹ In November, Sony’s computer systems were compromised, and embarrassing e-mail communications from its CEO were leaked online. A group calling itself the “Guardians of Peace” claimed responsibility for the attack.⁶²\n\nUnbeknownst to North Korea, years earlier US officials gained access to the North Korean cyber infrastructure and implanted malicious code to track North Korean operations, allowing them to identify certain IP addresses that were being\n\n⁴⁸ Lynn Loschin, *The Persistent Objector and Customary Human Rights Law: A Proposed Analytical Framework*, 2 U.C.

In response, the US imposed economic sanctions on North Korea, further reflecting the attribution of the attack to the North Korean State. North Korea also reportedly suffered widespread Internet outages in December 2014, raising the possibility that countermeasures were taken.\n\n## 3) Iran - 2016\n\nIn 2016, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) publicly attributed the cyber operations of private non-State actors to Iran based on a control and capabilities analysis.⁶⁷ In March 2016, a grand jury in the Southern District of New York criminally indicted seven Iranian individuals who were employed by two Iran-based computer companies, ITSec Team and Mersad Company. The individuals were charged with performing “work on behalf of the Iranian Government, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, on\n\ncomputer hacking charges related to their involvement in an extensive campaign of over 176 days of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.”⁶⁸ The seven individuals were alleged to have “launched DDoS attacks against 46 victims, primarily in the U.S. financial sector, between late 2011 and mid-2013.”⁶⁹ These attacks purportedly disabled victim bank websites, prevented customers from accessing their accounts online, and cost tens of millions of dollars in damage.⁷⁰ One of the defendants was also charged with obtaining unauthorized access into the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition systems of the Bowman Dam located in upstate New York in August and September 2013.⁷¹ In releasing the indictment, the US stated:\n\nLike past nation state-sponsored hackers, these defendants and their backers believed that they could attack our critical infrastructure without consequence, from behind a veil of cyber anonymity[.] This indictment once against shows there is no such veil - we can and will expose malicious cyber hackers engaging in unlawful acts that threaten our public safety and national security.⁷²\n\nIn the indictment, the US attributed the actions of the seven private individuals to the Iranian State because the individuals purportedly “performed work on behalf of” the Iranian Government, as evidenced by the scope and capabilities of their cyber operations.⁷³ In the press release accompanying the indictment, the US Department of Justice noted these individuals had “ties” to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard.⁷⁴ And without explaining the instruction from the State involved, the indictment alleged Ahmad Fathi, the purported leader of the defendants, was “responsible for managing computer intrusion and cyber projects being conducted on behalf of the Government of Iran.”⁷⁵ The indictment also alleged that defendant Amin Shokoh received credit for his work from the Iranian Government towards completion of his mandatory military service in Iran.⁷⁶ These allegations did not discuss direction or control, and instead focused on means and methods, capabilities, and motivations of the perpetrators in effectuating State attribution.\n\n## 4) Russia - 2016 / 2017\n\n⁶³ David E.

However, public attribution of these activities to [Russian civilian and military intelligence Services] is supported by technical indicators from the U.S. Intelligence Community, DHS, FBI, the private sector, and other entities.86\n\nAccording to the Joint Report, those “technical indicators” prove the threat actors are “likely associated” with the Russian State.87\n\nThe Joint Report was widely panned by industry experts for its purported failure to provide a “smoking gun” that showed Russian control or direction over the DNC intrusion, and for using false technical indicators linking the purported threat actors to the Russian State.88 But the focus of the Joint Report was not on express direction or control. It instead focused on capabilities, methods, motivations and technical indicators, reflecting the development of the control and capabilities test as the growing lex specialis for imputed State attribution for the unlawful cyber operations of non-State actors.\n\nb) US Attribution - Yahoo Breach\n\nIn March 2017, the US DOJ announced the indictments of five individuals, including two Russian officials, for “computer hacking, economic espionage and other criminal offenses in connection with a conspiracy, beginning in January 2014, to access Yahoo’s network and the contents of\n\n77 Dmitri Alperovitch, Bears in the Midst: Intrusion into the Democratic National Committee, CrowdStrike Blog (June 15, 2016), available at https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/bears-midst-intrusion-democratic-national-committee/.\n\n78 Ibid.\n\n79 Ibid.\n\n80 Ibid.\n\n81 Ibid.\n\n82 Director of National Intelligence, “Joint Statement from the Department of Homeland Security and Office of the Director of National Intelligence on Election Security,” Joint Statement (Oct. 7, 2016), available here https://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/215-press-releases-2016/1423-joint-dhs-odni-election-security-statement.\n\n83 Ibid.\n\n84 Ibid.\n\n85 Ibid.\n\n86 DHS &amp; FBI, “GRIZZLY STEPPE - Russian Malicious Cyber Activity”, Joint Analysis Report (Dec. 29, 2016), available here https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/JAR_16-20296A_GRIZZLY%20STEPPE-2016-1229.pdf.\n\n87 Ibid.\n\n88 See, e.g., Kelly Jackson Higgins, “DHS-FBI Report Shows Russian Attribution’s A Bear”, Dark Reading (Jan. 4, 2017), available at http://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/dhs-fbi-report-shows-russian-attributions-a-bear/d/d-id/1327828; Justin Raimodo, “The Evidence That Russia Hacked The DNC Is Collapsing”, Zero Hedge (Mar. 26, 2017), available at http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-03-25/; Shaun Waterman, “DHS slammed for report on Russian hackers”, Cyber Scoop (Jan. 6, 2017), available at https://www.cyberscoop.com/dhs-election-hacking-grizzly-steppe-iocs/.",

The United States warned French authorities that Russian-based hackers were targeting France's computer infrastructure in the run-up to the presidential election, a \"revelation likely to intensify speculation that Moscow was responsible for dumping a huge trove of hacked documents days before the election.\"98 One former intelligence official told Foreign Policy that the evidence relied upon by the United States may be \"signatures\" used by Russian hacking groups, such as \"pieces of malicious code or the use of a particular server.\"99 Sources also point to the motivations of the purported bad actors, a common factor in the control and capabilities test.

IMPACT OF TEST\n\nThe impact of the development State practice applying the control and capabilities test remains to be seen. There are, however, some demonstrable benefits and drawbacks to the control and capabilities approach. One benefit is easier attribution. By using the control and capabilities standard, as opposed to the effective control standard, offended States will have quicker recourse to attribution, and therefore quicker recourse to a lawful response. This benefit is also a downside. Quicker attribution can also lead to false positives. It is widely known within the cyber community that States can mask their true identity, and make it appear that the attack is originating in a separate State. This capability was recently disclosed in a set of Wikileaks disclosures called “Vault 7.”\n\nIt’s also unclear whether the State practice described above is being carried out with a sense of legal obligation, or political expediency. One drawback to the development of this test, and to attribution tests in cyberspace generally, has been the private nature in which States go about their research and attribution analysis. Without public statements of attribution, tied with statements of legal certainty, it will be difficult to have a conclusive determination as to whether the control and capabilities test has reached the level of customary international law.\n\nThat said, the effective control test is outdated as compared to the technological advances in cyberspace. States need to\n\nadopt a new standard in order to adapt with the tools available to States.\n\nV. CONCLUSION\n\nThe foregoing examples of State practice support the conclusion that imputed State responsibility for the unlawful cyber operations of non-State actors who are neither *de jure* nor *de facto* State organs is being assigned without rigid adherence to the “effective control” test. Again, this is just State practice demonstrating at least one element of determining State responsibility. State attribution under the new model is being assigned based on a control and capabilities test, examining motivations, geographic location, technical indicators, and relationship between the non-State actor and the State.\n\nThese State examples, of course, are not conclusive. This paper does not argue that such limited examples of State practice, alone, constitute a binding principle of customary international law. This State practice does, however, indicate that a *lex specialis* is forming that, if risen to the level of customary international law, would supplant the *lex generalis* “effective control” test, endorsed in Article 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility and Rule 17 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0. Such a change would radically alter the attribution models available in cyberspace.\n\n¹⁰² Ibid.\n\n¹⁰³ Joe Uchill, “Espionage group ‘aligned with Vietnamese state interests’: report”, *The Hill* (May 15, 2017), available at http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/333404-espionage-group-aligned-with-vietnamese-state-interests-report; Nick Carr, “Cyber Espionage is Alive and Well: APT32 and the Threat to Global Corporations,” *FireEye* (May 14, 2017), available at https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/05/cyber-espionage-apt32.html.\n\n¹⁰⁴ Carr, note 101.",

Stockburger, Esq.\nDentons US LLP\nSan Diego, CA (USA)\npeter.stockburger@dentons.com\nKeywords—attribution; cyber; lex specialis; lex generalis; effective control\n## I. INTRODUCTION\nAttribution in cyberspace is one of the most difficult questions facing policy makers, lawyers, and jurists. Indeed, the first question often asked in the wake of a cyber incident is “who did it?” The answer to this question is often critical when dealing with the application of international law because it will dictate the rights and responsibilities of States both from an offensive and defensive perspective. Without proper attribution, for example, a State’s responsive capabilities are limited. Making matters worse, attribution is difficult to establish factually. Non-State actors often mask their identity, and State actors often hide their true intentions. The degree to which the international rules governing State attribution apply in cyberspace is therefore a matter of great public importance.\nIt is widely accepted amongst States and scholars that the rules of international State responsibility generally apply in cyberspace. Those rules, reflective of the *lex generalis*, provide that the acts of a State’s *de jure* and *de facto* organs are generally attributable to the State.² The internationally wrongful acts of non-State actors (who are neither *de jure* nor *de facto* State organs) may also be imputed to the State if the non-State actors operate on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of the State.³ This general rule relative to non-State actors, commonly referred to as the “effective control”⁴ test, is widely recognized as the *lex generalis*\ngoverning imputed State responsibility for the internationally wrongful acts of non-State actors. Accordingly, as the *lex generalis*, the rule does not vary “with the nature of the wrongful act in question” unless there is a “clearly expressed lex specialis.”⁵ The “effective control” test, as the *lex generalis*, therefore applies in cyberspace.⁶\nThis paper posits that a new *lex specialis* is, in fact, forming that, if risen to the level of customary international law, would supplant the *lex generalis* “effective control” test and allow for imputed State responsibility for the internationally wrongful cyber operations of non-State actors even in the absence of express direction or control. This new test, which this paper calls the “control and capabilities” test, would allow for the attribution of non-State actor cyber activity based on a multi-factored test, examining: (1) the relationship between the non-State actor and the State, if any; (2) the cyber methods used by the non-State actor and whether those methods are similar to the State; (3) the motivations of the two parties, if known; (4) the similarity in technology and/or code used by the two parties; (5) the technical capabilities of the two parties; and (6) geographic location. In other words, direction and control are\n978-1-5386-2379-4/17/$31.00 ©2017 IEEE\nnot the dispositive factors. The evidence supporting the development of this test can be seen in the practice of interested States since 2014. And if this test were to reach the level of customary international law, it would supplant the lex generalis rule of “effective control” and mark a significant shift in how actions may be attributed under the law of imputed State responsibility in cyberspace.7 Below is a summary of this developing test, and thoughts on how it may impact the overall corpus of international law in cyberspace.\n## II. ATTRIBUTION LEGAL FRAMEWORK\n### A. Law of State Responsibility\nThe law of State responsibility is premised on two elements: (1) whether the act or omission in question is internationally wrongful; and (2) whether the act or omission in question is attributable to the State.8 This paper only focuses on the latter as a normative question.9\n### B. Attribution Tests\n#### 1) Direct Attribution - De Jure and De Facto State Organs\nAs a general rule, a “State is responsible only for its own conduct, that is to say the conduct of persons acting, on whatever basis, on its behalf[.]”10 This includes acts:\ncarried out by [State] official organs, and also by persons or entities which are not formally recognized as official organs under internal law but which must nevertheless be equated with State organs because they are in a relationship of complete dependence on the State.11\nThese types of individuals and groups are commonly referred to as de jure and de facto State organs. Both are recognized under Articles 4-6 of the Articles on State Responsibility,12 and it is widely accepted that the conduct of de jure and de facto State organs are generally attributable to the State.13\n#### 2) Imputed Attribution - Control and Direction\nThe conduct of a non-State actor that is neither a de jure nor de facto State organ may also be attributable to the State\n“if the [non-State actor] is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, [the] State in carrying out the conduct[.]”14 This direction and control test, known as the “effective control” test, reflects the lex generalis as it pertains to imputed State responsibility for the conduct of non-State actors.\n##### a) Effective Control Test - Background\nThe “effective control” test was first outlined by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in its 1986 case concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua wherein the Court examined whether US control over Nicaraguan Contras was sufficient to impute the actions of the Contras to the US under international law. The Court made clear that the actions of non-State actors not totally dependent on the State (but who are nonetheless paid, financed and equipped by the State) would be attributed to the State only if it were established that the State “directed or enforced the perpetration” of the internationally wrongful acts in question.15 Under this “effective control” test, the Court determined that although the US was responsible for the general “planning, direction and support” given to the Contras, the US was not internationally responsible for the internationally wrongful actions of the Contras because “there [was] no clear evidence of the US having actually exercised such a degree of control in all fields as to justify treating the [Contras] as acting on its behalf.”16 This “effective control” test, reflected in Article 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility,17 was expressly endorsed by the International Group of Experts (IGE) in the recently published Tallinn Manual 2.0 as reflective of customary international law.18\n##### b) Overall Control Test Introduced\nThirteen years later, in 1999, a competing test known as the “overall control” test was introduced by the Appeals Chamber of the United Nations International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in its influential Tadić opinion. The tribunal rejected the “effective control” test, and instead applied an “overall control” test to determine the attribution of acts of hierarchically structured groups, such as a military unit or armed bands of irregulars or rebels under the jus in bello.19 In such circumstances, the tribunal noted, the State will be internationally responsible for the wrongful\n7 Nicaragua, note 4, at 109, 115; Congo, note 4, at 228; Bosnia Genocide, note 2, at 168-211.\n8 Articles on State Responsibility, note 3, at art. 2(a)-(b); Michael N.

The tribunal adopted this approach with hierarchically structured groups,²⁰ and limited its decision to the application of the jus in bello as it was determining the existence of an international armed conflict under the Fourth Geneva Convention of August 12, 1949.²¹ The “overall control” test is discussed in the commentaries to Article 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility, and is generally seen as a lower standard of attribution than the “effective control” test.²²\n## c) Effective Control Test Revisited\nThe ICJ revisited the “effective control” test in 2007 in the case concerning the Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. The Court criticized the ICTY’s “overall control” test as going beyond the ICTY’s jurisdiction, and being unsupported in State practice. The Court reaffirmed the customary status of the “effective control” test, and announced that the actions of the Republika Srpska and certain paramilitary groups known as the Scorpions, Red Berets, Tigers and White Eagles were not attributable to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) because there was insufficient evidence demonstrating that State instruction and direction was given with regard to each operation in which the alleged violations occurred, and not generally in respect of the overall actions taken by the persons or groups of persons having committed the violations.²³ Consequently, and controversially, the Court determined that the FRY could not be internationally responsible for the acts committed by the non-State actors in question, most notably for the massacres at Srebrenica.²⁴\n## d) Safe Harbor / Duty To Prevent\nThere has been additional State practice endorsing a theory for imputed State responsibility wherein the State in question harbors and provides material support to those who cause harm in another State. After the September 11, 2001 attacks, the US invoked its right to self-defense pursuant to Article 51 of the United Nations Charter on the premise that\nthe September 11 attacks constituted an “armed attack.”²⁵ The US attributed those attacks to the Taliban regime in Afghanistan because they were “made possible by the decision of the Taliban regime to allow the parts of Afghanistan that it controls to be used by this organization as a base of operation.”²⁶ The global community generally accepted the legality of this action.²⁷\nThis “safe harbor” principle is notable because it attributes the acts of a non-State actor to the State not based on direction or control, but based on an obligation otherwise understood as the duty to prevent trans-boundary harm and the “due diligence” principle as articulated in the 1941 Trial Smelter arbitration,²⁸ the ICJ’s Corfu Channel judgment,²⁹ the ICJ’s Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons,³⁰ and the ICJ’s Case Concerning Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project judgment.³¹ The “due diligence” principle has been applied to many areas of international law, including international environmental law,³² human rights law,³³ and State responsibility.³⁴ It is distinct from imputed State responsibility because due diligence is an “obligation of conduct rather than of result[.]”³⁵ The degree to\n²⁰ Ibid.\n²¹ Art. 2 of the Statute of the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991, S/RES/827 (1993) of 25 May 1993, Annex.\n²² Articles on State Responsibility, note 3, at art. 8, commentary (5) (noting it is a “matter for appreciation in each case whether particular conduct was or was not carried out under the control of a State, to such an extent that the conduct controlled should be attributed to it).\n²³ Bosnia Genocide, note 2, at 208.\n²⁴ Id. at 206-08.\n²⁵ UN Security Council, Letter Dated 7 October 2001 From the Permanent Representative of the United States of America to the United Nations Addressed to the President of the Security Council, UN Doc No S/2001/946 (2001).\n²⁶ Ibid.\n²⁷ See G.A.

The IGE recognized the tension between the “effective” and “overall” control tests in the 2013 Tallinn Manual when examining the *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello*,⁴⁰ but concluded the application of the “effective control” test in the context of peacetime operations in the revised 2017 Tallinn Manual 2.0.⁴¹ Specifically, Rule 17 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0, reflecting Article 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility, provides that cyber operations conducted by a non-State actor are attributable to a State when “engaged in pursuant to its instruction or under its direction or control[.].”⁴²\nBy this standard, the IGE notes that a State may, either by specific direction or by exercising control over a group, in effect assume responsibility for their conduct, with each case dependent on its own facts.⁴³ Instruction within this context “refers most typically to situations in which a non-State actor functions as a State’s auxiliary.”⁴⁴ And a State is in “effective control” of a particular cyber operation by a non-State actor whenever it is the State that “determines the execution and course of the specific operation and the cyber activity engaged in by the non-State actor is an ‘integral part of that operation.’ Effective control includes both the ability to cause constituent activities of the operation to occur, as well as the ability to order the cessation of those that are underway.”⁴⁵\n## III. THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CONTROL AND CAPABILITIES TEST\nIt is thus well accepted that the “effective control” test represents the *lex generalis* governing the attribution of internationally wrongful conduct of non-State actors to the State. As the *lex generalis*, this test applies in all situations unless there is an express *lex specialis* providing otherwise.⁴⁶\nAs explained below, a review of State practice since 2014 reveals that a new *lex specialis* has, in fact, begun to form that would, if risen to the level of customary international law, supplant the *lex generalis* “effective control” test in cyberspace. This state practice involves States that have publicly attributed the cyber operations of non-State actors to States on the basis the basis of a multitude of factors, including but not limited to (1) the relationship between the non-State actor and the State, if any; (2) the cyber methods used by the non-State actor and whether those methods are similar to the State; (3) the motivations of the two parties, if known; (4) the similarity in technology and/or code used by the two parties; (5) the technical capabilities of the two parties; and (6) geographic location. Direction and control have not been dispositive factors. Although the second element for the development of custom, that is opinio juris, has been lacking thus far, the development of the *actus* State practice is of note.\n## A. Development of Custom\nCustomary international law is defined as the general practice of States accepted as law.⁴⁷ This definition comes from Article 38(1)(b) of the ICJ’s Statute, and encompasses two elements: (1) long-term, widespread practice by interested\n³⁵ David Freestone, *Advisory Opinion on the Seabed Disputes Chamber of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea on ‘Responsibilities and Obligations of States Sponsoring Persons and Entities with Respect to Activities in the Area*, 15 AMER.

State Practice Supporting The Control and Capabilities Test\n### 1) Pre-2014 Attribution Based on Control and Capabilities Test\nPrior to 2014, public attribution of internationally wrongful cyber operations was virtually non-existent. Private attribution, however, began to follow the control and capabilities factors set forth above as early as 2007. In 2007, after Estonia was hit with a wave of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks after deciding to remove a Soviet-era bronze soldier monument from its location in central Tallinn, Estonia, for example, a number of scholars and jurists privately attributed the attacks to Russia.⁵⁰ Evidence showed that the “hackers claimed to be Russian, the tools to hack and deface were contained in Russian websites and chatrooms, and the attacks picked a day of” significance to most Russians.⁵¹ Moreover, although the botnets used computers from different countries, at least some of the attacks “originated from Russian IP (internet protocol) addresses, including those of state institutions.”⁵²\nIn 2008, a similar scenario played out with Russia being privately blamed for carrying out a DDoS attack during its 2008 conflict with Georgia⁵³ wherein fifty-four “web sites in Georgia related to communications, finance, and the government” were attacked⁵⁴ “immediately before and continu[ing] throughout the armed conflict between” the two States.⁵⁵ All signs pointed to a Russian hacker community as\nthe responsible perpetrator,⁵⁶ including the fact that coordination for the attacks took place in the Russian language, and in Russian or Russia-related “fora.”⁵⁷\nLikewise, despite confirmation from State actors regarding the 2010 Stuxnet virus,⁵⁸ and although it has been reported that the Stuxnet virus was formally developed under US administrations,⁵⁹ no formal attribution was declared.\nAdditional pre-2014 activity included the 2013, and controversial Mandiant Report which attributed APT1 attacks to the Chinese State based on the geographic location of the bad actors, the methods and capabilities of the actors in question, and the motivations of the Chinese State.\n### 2) Sony 2014\nIt was not until 2014 that a State first publicly attributed what appeared to be a non-State actor’s unlawful cyber operations to a State. In 2014, Sony Pictures was hit with a highly publicized DDoS attack of unknown proportions after its computer systems were compromised by suspected North Korean tied hackers.⁶⁰ The attack surrounded the release of the movie “The Interview” about the fictional assassination of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. Prior to the movie’s release, the spokesperson for North Korea’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement “that the country would take ‘a decisive and merciless countermeasure’ if the United States’ government permitted Sony to make its planned Christmas release of the comedy.”⁶¹ In November, Sony’s computer systems were compromised, and embarrassing e-mail communications from its CEO were leaked online. A group calling itself the “Guardians of Peace” claimed responsibility for the attack.⁶²\nUnbeknownst to North Korea, years earlier US officials gained access to the North Korean cyber infrastructure and implanted malicious code to track North Korean operations, allowing them to identify certain IP addresses that were being\n⁴⁸ Lynn Loschin, *The Persistent Objector and Customary Human Rights Law: A Proposed Analytical Framework*, 2 U.C.

In response, the US imposed economic sanctions on North Korea, further reflecting the attribution of the attack to the North Korean State. North Korea also reportedly suffered widespread Internet outages in December 2014, raising the possibility that countermeasures were taken.\n## 3) Iran - 2016\nIn 2016, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) publicly attributed the cyber operations of private non-State actors to Iran based on a control and capabilities analysis.⁶⁷ In March 2016, a grand jury in the Southern District of New York criminally indicted seven Iranian individuals who were employed by two Iran-based computer companies, ITSec Team and Mersad Company. The individuals were charged with performing “work on behalf of the Iranian Government, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, on\ncomputer hacking charges related to their involvement in an extensive campaign of over 176 days of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.”⁶⁸ The seven individuals were alleged to have “launched DDoS attacks against 46 victims, primarily in the U.S. financial sector, between late 2011 and mid-2013.”⁶⁹ These attacks purportedly disabled victim bank websites, prevented customers from accessing their accounts online, and cost tens of millions of dollars in damage.⁷⁰ One of the defendants was also charged with obtaining unauthorized access into the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition systems of the Bowman Dam located in upstate New York in August and September 2013.⁷¹ In releasing the indictment, the US stated:\nLike past nation state-sponsored hackers, these defendants and their backers believed that they could attack our critical infrastructure without consequence, from behind a veil of cyber anonymity[.] This indictment once against shows there is no such veil - we can and will expose malicious cyber hackers engaging in unlawful acts that threaten our public safety and national security.⁷²\nIn the indictment, the US attributed the actions of the seven private individuals to the Iranian State because the individuals purportedly “performed work on behalf of” the Iranian Government, as evidenced by the scope and capabilities of their cyber operations.⁷³ In the press release accompanying the indictment, the US Department of Justice noted these individuals had “ties” to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard.⁷⁴ And without explaining the instruction from the State involved, the indictment alleged Ahmad Fathi, the purported leader of the defendants, was “responsible for managing computer intrusion and cyber projects being conducted on behalf of the Government of Iran.”⁷⁵ The indictment also alleged that defendant Amin Shokoh received credit for his work from the Iranian Government towards completion of his mandatory military service in Iran.⁷⁶ These allegations did not discuss direction or control, and instead focused on means and methods, capabilities, and motivations of the perpetrators in effectuating State attribution.\n## 4) Russia - 2016 / 2017\n⁶³ David E.

However, public attribution of these activities to [Russian civilian and military intelligence Services] is supported by technical indicators from the U.S. Intelligence Community, DHS, FBI, the private sector, and other entities.86\nAccording to the Joint Report, those “technical indicators” prove the threat actors are “likely associated” with the Russian State.87\nThe Joint Report was widely panned by industry experts for its purported failure to provide a “smoking gun” that showed Russian control or direction over the DNC intrusion, and for using false technical indicators linking the purported threat actors to the Russian State.88 But the focus of the Joint Report was not on express direction or control. It instead focused on capabilities, methods, motivations and technical indicators, reflecting the development of the control and capabilities test as the growing lex specialis for imputed State attribution for the unlawful cyber operations of non-State actors.\nb) US Attribution - Yahoo Breach\nIn March 2017, the US DOJ announced the indictments of five individuals, including two Russian officials, for “computer hacking, economic espionage and other criminal offenses in connection with a conspiracy, beginning in January 2014, to access Yahoo’s network and the contents of\n77 Dmitri Alperovitch, Bears in the Midst: Intrusion into the Democratic National Committee, CrowdStrike Blog (June 15, 2016), available at https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/bears-midst-intrusion-democratic-national-committee/.\n78 Ibid.\n79 Ibid.\n80 Ibid.\n81 Ibid.\n82 Director of National Intelligence, “Joint Statement from the Department of Homeland Security and Office of the Director of National Intelligence on Election Security,” Joint Statement (Oct. 7, 2016), available here https://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/215-press-releases-2016/1423-joint-dhs-odni-election-security-statement.\n83 Ibid.\n84 Ibid.\n85 Ibid.\n86 DHS &amp; FBI, “GRIZZLY STEPPE - Russian Malicious Cyber Activity”, Joint Analysis Report (Dec. 29, 2016), available here https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/JAR_16-20296A_GRIZZLY%20STEPPE-2016-1229.pdf.\n87 Ibid.\n88 See, e.g., Kelly Jackson Higgins, “DHS-FBI Report Shows Russian Attribution’s A Bear”, Dark Reading (Jan. 4, 2017), available at http://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/dhs-fbi-report-shows-russian-attributions-a-bear/d/d-id/1327828; Justin Raimodo, “The Evidence That Russia Hacked The DNC Is Collapsing”, Zero Hedge (Mar. 26, 2017), available at http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-03-25/; Shaun Waterman, “DHS slammed for report on Russian hackers”, Cyber Scoop (Jan. 6, 2017), available at https://www.cyberscoop.com/dhs-election-hacking-grizzly-steppe-iocs/.\nwebmail accounts.\"89 In the indictment, the DOJ alleged that \"officers of the Russian Federal Security Service\" and \"intelligence and law enforcement agency of the Russian Federation\" \"conspired together and with each other to protect, direct, facilitate, and pay criminal hackers to collect information through computer intrusions in the United States and elsewhere.\"90 The evidence cited to link the Russian officials to the \"criminal hackers\", however, was less than express direction and control: (1) the criminal hackers obtained evidence of \"information of predictable interest to the FSB\", including access to \"Russian journalists and politicians critical of the Russian government\" (i.e., motivations); (2) the geographic location of the criminal hackers; (3) the ability of the Russian State to \"arrest and prosecute\" the criminal hackers and its failure to do so; and (4) threadbare allegations that the Russian officials provided direction to the criminal hackers.91 The focus therefore was on motivations, capabilities and geographic proximity, in combination with conclusory allegations of State direction.

IMPACT OF TEST\nThe impact of the development State practice applying the control and capabilities test remains to be seen. There are, however, some demonstrable benefits and drawbacks to the control and capabilities approach. One benefit is easier attribution. By using the control and capabilities standard, as opposed to the effective control standard, offended States will have quicker recourse to attribution, and therefore quicker recourse to a lawful response. This benefit is also a downside. Quicker attribution can also lead to false positives. It is widely known within the cyber community that States can mask their true identity, and make it appear that the attack is originating in a separate State. This capability was recently disclosed in a set of Wikileaks disclosures called “Vault 7.”\nIt’s also unclear whether the State practice described above is being carried out with a sense of legal obligation, or political expediency. One drawback to the development of this test, and to attribution tests in cyberspace generally, has been the private nature in which States go about their research and attribution analysis. Without public statements of attribution, tied with statements of legal certainty, it will be difficult to have a conclusive determination as to whether the control and capabilities test has reached the level of customary international law.\nThat said, the effective control test is outdated as compared to the technological advances in cyberspace. States need to\nadopt a new standard in order to adapt with the tools available to States.\nV. CONCLUSION\nThe foregoing examples of State practice support the conclusion that imputed State responsibility for the unlawful cyber operations of non-State actors who are neither *de jure* nor *de facto* State organs is being assigned without rigid adherence to the “effective control” test. Again, this is just State practice demonstrating at least one element of determining State responsibility. State attribution under the new model is being assigned based on a control and capabilities test, examining motivations, geographic location, technical indicators, and relationship between the non-State actor and the State.\nThese State examples, of course, are not conclusive. This paper does not argue that such limited examples of State practice, alone, constitute a binding principle of customary international law. This State practice does, however, indicate that a *lex specialis* is forming that, if risen to the level of customary international law, would supplant the *lex generalis* “effective control” test, endorsed in Article 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility and Rule 17 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0. Such a change would radically alter the attribution models available in cyberspace.\n¹⁰² Ibid.\n¹⁰³ Joe Uchill, “Espionage group ‘aligned with Vietnamese state interests’: report”, *The Hill* (May 15, 2017), available at http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/333404-espionage-group-aligned-with-vietnamese-state-interests-report; Nick Carr, “Cyber Espionage is Alive and Well: APT32 and the Threat to Global Corporations,” *FireEye* (May 14, 2017), available at https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/05/cyber-espionage-apt32.html.\n¹⁰⁴ Carr, note 101.",

Stockburger, Esq.\nDentons US LLP\nSan Diego, CA (USA)\npeter.stockburger@dentons.com\nKeywords—attribution; cyber; lex specialis; lex generalis; effective control\n## I. INTRODUCTION\nAttribution in cyberspace is one of the most difficult questions facing policy makers, lawyers, and jurists. Indeed, the first question often asked in the wake of a cyber incident is “who did it?” The answer to this question is often critical when dealing with the application of international law because it will dictate the rights and responsibilities of States both from an offensive and defensive perspective. Without proper attribution, for example, a State’s responsive capabilities are limited. Making matters worse, attribution is difficult to establish factually. Non-State actors often mask their identity, and State actors often hide their true intentions. The degree to which the international rules governing State attribution apply in cyberspace is therefore a matter of great public importance.\nIt is widely accepted amongst States and scholars that the rules of international State responsibility generally apply in cyberspace. Those rules, reflective of the *lex generalis*, provide that the acts of a State’s *de jure* and *de facto* organs are generally attributable to the State. The internationally wrongful acts of non-State actors (who are neither *de jure* nor *de facto* State organs) may also be imputed to the State if the non-State actors operate on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of the State. This general rule relative to non-State actors, commonly referred to as the “effective control” test, is widely recognized as the *lex generalis*\ngoverning imputed State responsibility for the internationally wrongful acts of non-State actors. Accordingly, as the *lex generalis*, the rule does not vary “with the nature of the wrongful act in question” unless there is a “clearly expressed lex specialis.” The “effective control” test, as the *lex generalis*, therefore applies in cyberspace.\nThis paper posits that a new *lex specialis* is, in fact, forming that, if risen to the level of customary international law, would supplant the *lex generalis* “effective control” test and allow for imputed State responsibility for the internationally wrongful cyber operations of non-State actors even in the absence of express direction or control. This new test, which this paper calls the “control and capabilities” test, would allow for the attribution of non-State actor cyber activity based on a multi-factored test, examining: (1) the relationship between the non-State actor and the State, if any; (2) the cyber methods used by the non-State actor and whether those methods are similar to the State; (3) the motivations of the two parties, if known; (4) the similarity in technology and/or code used by the two parties; (5) the technical capabilities of the two parties; and (6) geographic location. In other words, direction and control are\n978-1-5386-2379-4/17/$31.00 ©2017 IEEE\nnot the dispositive factors. The evidence supporting the development of this test can be seen in the practice of interested States since 2014. And if this test were to reach the level of customary international law, it would supplant the lex generalis rule of “effective control” and mark a significant shift in how actions may be attributed under the law of imputed State responsibility in cyberspace.7 Below is a summary of this developing test, and thoughts on how it may impact the overall corpus of international law in cyberspace.\n## II. ATTRIBUTION LEGAL FRAMEWORK\n### A. Law of State Responsibility\nThe law of State responsibility is premised on two elements: (1) whether the act or omission in question is internationally wrongful; and (2) whether the act or omission in question is attributable to the State.8 This paper only focuses on the latter as a normative question.9\n### B. Attribution Tests\n#### 1) Direct Attribution - De Jure and De Facto State Organs\nAs a general rule, a “State is responsible only for its own conduct, that is to say the conduct of persons acting, on whatever basis, on its behalf[.]”10 This includes acts:\ncarried out by [State] official organs, and also by persons or entities which are not formally recognized as official organs under internal law but which must nevertheless be equated with State organs because they are in a relationship of complete dependence on the State.11\nThese types of individuals and groups are commonly referred to as de jure and de facto State organs. Both are recognized under Articles 4-6 of the Articles on State Responsibility,12 and it is widely accepted that the conduct of de jure and de facto State organs are generally attributable to the State.13\n#### 2) Imputed Attribution - Control and Direction\nThe conduct of a non-State actor that is neither a de jure nor de facto State organ may also be attributable to the State\n“if the [non-State actor] is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, [the] State in carrying out the conduct[.]”14 This direction and control test, known as the “effective control” test, reflects the lex generalis as it pertains to imputed State responsibility for the conduct of non-State actors.\n##### a) Effective Control Test - Background\nThe “effective control” test was first outlined by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in its 1986 case concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua wherein the Court examined whether US control over Nicaraguan Contras was sufficient to impute the actions of the Contras to the US under international law. The Court made clear that the actions of non-State actors not totally dependent on the State (but who are nonetheless paid, financed and equipped by the State) would be attributed to the State only if it were established that the State “directed or enforced the perpetration” of the internationally wrongful acts in question.15 Under this “effective control” test, the Court determined that although the US was responsible for the general “planning, direction and support” given to the Contras, the US was not internationally responsible for the internationally wrongful actions of the Contras because “there [was] no clear evidence of the US having actually exercised such a degree of control in all fields as to justify treating the [Contras] as acting on its behalf.”16 This “effective control” test, reflected in Article 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility,17 was expressly endorsed by the International Group of Experts (IGE) in the recently published Tallinn Manual 2.0 as reflective of customary international law.18\n##### b) Overall Control Test Introduced\nThirteen years later, in 1999, a competing test known as the “overall control” test was introduced by the Appeals Chamber of the United Nations International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in its influential Tadić opinion. The tribunal rejected the “effective control” test, and instead applied an “overall control” test to determine the attribution of acts of hierarchically structured groups, such as a military unit or armed bands of irregulars or rebels under the jus in bello.19 In such circumstances, the tribunal noted, the State will be internationally responsible for the wrongful\n\n## c) Effective Control Test Revisited\nThe ICJ revisited the “effective control” test in 2007 in the case concerning the Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. The Court criticized the ICTY’s “overall control” test as going beyond the ICTY’s jurisdiction, and being unsupported in State practice. The Court reaffirmed the customary status of the “effective control” test, and announced that the actions of the Republika Srpska and certain paramilitary groups known as the Scorpions, Red Berets, Tigers and White Eagles were not attributable to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) because there was insufficient evidence demonstrating that State instruction and direction was given with regard to each operation in which the alleged violations occurred, and not generally in respect of the overall actions taken by the persons or groups of persons having committed the violations. Consequently, and controversially, the Court determined that the FRY could not be internationally responsible for the acts committed by the non-State actors in question, most notably for the massacres at Srebrenica.\n## d) Safe Harbor / Duty To Prevent\nThere has been additional State practice endorsing a theory for imputed State responsibility wherein the State in question harbors and provides material support to those who cause harm in another State. After the September 11, 2001 attacks, the US invoked its right to self-defense pursuant to Article 51 of the United Nations Charter on the premise that\nthe September 11 attacks constituted an “armed attack.” The US attributed those attacks to the Taliban regime in Afghanistan because they were “made possible by the decision of the Taliban regime to allow the parts of Afghanistan that it controls to be used by this organization as a base of operation.” The global community generally accepted the legality of this action.\nThis “safe harbor” principle is notable because it attributes the acts of a non-State actor to the State not based on direction or control, but based on an obligation otherwise understood as the duty to prevent trans-boundary harm and the “due diligence” principle as articulated in the 1941 Trial Smelter arbitration, the ICJ’s Corfu Channel judgment, the ICJ’s Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, and the ICJ’s Case Concerning Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project judgment. The “due diligence” principle has been applied to many areas of international law, including international environmental law, human rights law, and State responsibility. It is distinct from imputed State responsibility because due diligence is an “obligation of conduct rather than of result[.]” The degree to\n Ibid.\n Art. 2 of the Statute of the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991, S/RES/827 (1993) of 25 May 1993, Annex.\n Articles on State Responsibility, note 3, at art. 8, commentary (5) (noting it is a “matter for appreciation in each case whether particular conduct was or was not carried out under the control of a State, to such an extent that the conduct controlled should be attributed to it).\n Bosnia Genocide, note 2, at 208.\n Id. at 206-08.\n UN Security Council, Letter Dated 7 October 2001 From the Permanent Representative of the United States of America to the United Nations Addressed to the President of the Security Council, UN Doc No S/2001/946 (2001).\n Ibid.\n See G.A.

The “overall” control test is discussed in the commentary to Article 8, which also provides that it is “a matter of appreciation in each case whether particular conduct was or was not carried out under the control of a State, to such an extent that the conduct controlled should be attributed to it.”\nArticle 55 of the Articles of State Responsibility is entitled “Lex specialis” and provides that the Articles of State Responsibility “do not apply where and to the extent that the conditions for the existence of an internationally wrongful act or the content or implementation of the international responsibility of a State are governed by special rules of international law.”\n## f) Tallinn Manual Recognition\nThe authors of the Tallinn Manual have also concluded that the “effective control” test is the *lex generalis* controlling imputed State responsibility for the conduct of non-State actors. The IGE recognized the tension between the “effective” and “overall” control tests in the 2013 Tallinn Manual when examining the *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello*, but concluded the application of the “effective control” test in the context of peacetime operations in the revised 2017 Tallinn Manual 2.0. Specifically, Rule 17 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0, reflecting Article 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility, provides that cyber operations conducted by a non-State actor are attributable to a State when “engaged in pursuant to its instruction or under its direction or control[.].”\nBy this standard, the IGE notes that a State may, either by specific direction or by exercising control over a group, in effect assume responsibility for their conduct, with each case dependent on its own facts. Instruction within this context “refers most typically to situations in which a non-State actor functions as a State’s auxiliary.” And a State is in “effective control” of a particular cyber operation by a non-State actor whenever it is the State that “determines the execution and course of the specific operation and the cyber activity engaged in by the non-State actor is an ‘integral part of that operation.’ Effective control includes both the ability to cause constituent activities of the operation to occur, as well as the ability to order the cessation of those that are underway.”\n## III. THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CONTROL AND CAPABILITIES TEST\nIt is thus well accepted that the “effective control” test represents the *lex generalis* governing the attribution of internationally wrongful conduct of non-State actors to the State. As the *lex generalis*, this test applies in all situations unless there is an express *lex specialis* providing otherwise.\nAs explained below, a review of State practice since 2014 reveals that a new *lex specialis* has, in fact, begun to form that would, if risen to the level of customary international law, supplant the *lex generalis* “effective control” test in cyberspace. This state practice involves States that have publicly attributed the cyber operations of non-State actors to States on the basis the basis of a multitude of factors, including but not limited to (1) the relationship between the non-State actor and the State, if any; (2) the cyber methods used by the non-State actor and whether those methods are similar to the State; (3) the motivations of the two parties, if known; (4) the similarity in technology and/or code used by the two parties; (5) the technical capabilities of the two parties; and (6) geographic location. Direction and control have not been dispositive factors. Although the second element for the development of custom, that is opinio juris, has been lacking thus far, the development of the *actus* State practice is of note.\n## A. Development of Custom\nCustomary international law is defined as the general practice of States accepted as law. This definition comes from Article 38(1)(b) of the ICJ’s Statute, and encompasses two elements: (1) long-term, widespread practice by interested\n David Freestone, *Advisory Opinion on the Seabed Disputes Chamber of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea on ‘Responsibilities and Obligations of States Sponsoring Persons and Entities with Respect to Activities in the Area*, 15 AMER.

State Practice Supporting The Control and Capabilities Test\n### 1) Pre-2014 Attribution Based on Control and Capabilities Test\nPrior to 2014, public attribution of internationally wrongful cyber operations was virtually non-existent. Private attribution, however, began to follow the control and capabilities factors set forth above as early as 2007. In 2007, after Estonia was hit with a wave of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks after deciding to remove a Soviet-era bronze soldier monument from its location in central Tallinn, Estonia, for example, a number of scholars and jurists privately attributed the attacks to Russia. Evidence showed that the “hackers claimed to be Russian, the tools to hack and deface were contained in Russian websites and chatrooms, and the attacks picked a day of” significance to most Russians. Moreover, although the botnets used computers from different countries, at least some of the attacks “originated from Russian IP (internet protocol) addresses, including those of state institutions.”\nIn 2008, a similar scenario played out with Russia being privately blamed for carrying out a DDoS attack during its 2008 conflict with Georgia wherein fifty-four “web sites in Georgia related to communications, finance, and the government” were attacked “immediately before and continu[ing] throughout the armed conflict between” the two States. All signs pointed to a Russian hacker community as\nthe responsible perpetrator, including the fact that coordination for the attacks took place in the Russian language, and in Russian or Russia-related “fora.”\nLikewise, despite confirmation from State actors regarding the 2010 Stuxnet virus, and although it has been reported that the Stuxnet virus was formally developed under US administrations, no formal attribution was declared.\nAdditional pre-2014 activity included the 2013, and controversial Mandiant Report which attributed APT1 attacks to the Chinese State based on the geographic location of the bad actors, the methods and capabilities of the actors in question, and the motivations of the Chinese State.\n### 2) Sony 2014\nIt was not until 2014 that a State first publicly attributed what appeared to be a non-State actor’s unlawful cyber operations to a State. In 2014, Sony Pictures was hit with a highly publicized DDoS attack of unknown proportions after its computer systems were compromised by suspected North Korean tied hackers. The attack surrounded the release of the movie “The Interview” about the fictional assassination of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. Prior to the movie’s release, the spokesperson for North Korea’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement “that the country would take ‘a decisive and merciless countermeasure’ if the United States’ government permitted Sony to make its planned Christmas release of the comedy.” In November, Sony’s computer systems were compromised, and embarrassing e-mail communications from its CEO were leaked online. A group calling itself the “Guardians of Peace” claimed responsibility for the attack.\nUnbeknownst to North Korea, years earlier US officials gained access to the North Korean cyber infrastructure and implanted malicious code to track North Korean operations, allowing them to identify certain IP addresses that were being\n Lynn Loschin, *The Persistent Objector and Customary Human Rights Law: A Proposed Analytical Framework*, 2 U.C.

This information about methods and capabilities led the US to publicly attribute the attack to North Korea without mention of any direction or control by the North Korean government. In response, the US imposed economic sanctions on North Korea, further reflecting the attribution of the attack to the North Korean State. North Korea also reportedly suffered widespread Internet outages in December 2014, raising the possibility that countermeasures were taken.\n## 3) Iran - 2016\nIn 2016, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) publicly attributed the cyber operations of private non-State actors to Iran based on a control and capabilities analysis. In March 2016, a grand jury in the Southern District of New York criminally indicted seven Iranian individuals who were employed by two Iran-based computer companies, ITSec Team and Mersad Company. The individuals were charged with performing “work on behalf of the Iranian Government, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, on\ncomputer hacking charges related to their involvement in an extensive campaign of over 176 days of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.” The seven individuals were alleged to have “launched DDoS attacks against 46 victims, primarily in the U.S. financial sector, between late 2011 and mid-2013.” These attacks purportedly disabled victim bank websites, prevented customers from accessing their accounts online, and cost tens of millions of dollars in damage. One of the defendants was also charged with obtaining unauthorized access into the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition systems of the Bowman Dam located in upstate New York in August and September 2013. In releasing the indictment, the US stated:\nLike past nation state-sponsored hackers, these defendants and their backers believed that they could attack our critical infrastructure without consequence, from behind a veil of cyber anonymity[.] This indictment once against shows there is no such veil - we can and will expose malicious cyber hackers engaging in unlawful acts that threaten our public safety and national security.\nIn the indictment, the US attributed the actions of the seven private individuals to the Iranian State because the individuals purportedly “performed work on behalf of” the Iranian Government, as evidenced by the scope and capabilities of their cyber operations. In the press release accompanying the indictment, the US Department of Justice noted these individuals had “ties” to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard. And without explaining the instruction from the State involved, the indictment alleged Ahmad Fathi, the purported leader of the defendants, was “responsible for managing computer intrusion and cyber projects being conducted on behalf of the Government of Iran.” The indictment also alleged that defendant Amin Shokoh received credit for his work from the Iranian Government towards completion of his mandatory military service in Iran. These allegations did not discuss direction or control, and instead focused on means and methods, capabilities, and motivations of the perpetrators in effectuating State attribution.\n## 4) Russia - 2016 / 2017\n David E.

However, public attribution of these activities to [Russian civilian and military intelligence Services] is supported by technical indicators from the U.S. Intelligence Community, DHS, FBI, the private sector, and other entities.86\nAccording to the Joint Report, those “technical indicators” prove the threat actors are “likely associated” with the Russian State.87\nThe Joint Report was widely panned by industry experts for its purported failure to provide a “smoking gun” that showed Russian control or direction over the DNC intrusion, and for using false technical indicators linking the purported threat actors to the Russian State.88 But the focus of the Joint Report was not on express direction or control. It instead focused on capabilities, methods, motivations and technical indicators, reflecting the development of the control and capabilities test as the growing lex specialis for imputed State attribution for the unlawful cyber operations of non-State actors.\nb) US Attribution - Yahoo Breach\nIn March 2017, the US DOJ announced the indictments of five individuals, including two Russian officials, for “computer hacking, economic espionage and other criminal offenses in connection with a conspiracy, beginning in January 2014, to access Yahoo’s network and the contents of\n\nwebmail accounts.\"89 In the indictment, the DOJ alleged that \"officers of the Russian Federal Security Service\" and \"intelligence and law enforcement agency of the Russian Federation\" \"conspired together and with each other to protect, direct, facilitate, and pay criminal hackers to collect information through computer intrusions in the United States and elsewhere.\"90 The evidence cited to link the Russian officials to the \"criminal hackers\", however, was less than express direction and control: (1) the criminal hackers obtained evidence of \"information of predictable interest to the FSB\", including access to \"Russian journalists and politicians critical of the Russian government\" (i.e., motivations); (2) the geographic location of the criminal hackers; (3) the ability of the Russian State to \"arrest and prosecute\" the criminal hackers and its failure to do so; and (4) threadbare allegations that the Russian officials provided direction to the criminal hackers.91 The focus therefore was on motivations, capabilities and geographic proximity, in combination with conclusory allegations of State direction. The test applied was not the \"effective control\" test. The DOJ focused on control and capabilities.\n## c) Ukraine Attribution - NotPetya Ransomware\nIn June 2017, a particularly devastating strain of ransomware began infecting PC's around the world.92 The \"blast radius\" of the attack was in Ukraine, where 60% of the infected machines were located.93 Other infected machines belonged to international companies that operate within Ukraine.94 A group called \"GoldenEye\" claimed responsibility for the attack.95\n\nUkraine's state security service, the SBU, publicly attributed the attack to the Russian State based on: (1) similar motivations between the suspected hackers and the Russian State; and (2) similar code used by the suspected hackers and other hackers Ukraine suspects are connected to the Russian State.96 The attribution was \"largely based on similarities in tools and techniques\" rather \"than any obvious, direct correlation.\"97\n## 5) Situations To Watch\n### a) French Election\nJust prior to the most recent French presidential election, a number of sensitive e-mails from the Macron campaign were disclosed online. The United States warned French authorities that Russian-based hackers were targeting France's computer infrastructure in the run-up to the presidential election, a \"revelation likely to intensify speculation that Moscow was responsible for dumping a huge trove of hacked documents days before the election.\"98 One former intelligence official told Foreign Policy that the evidence relied upon by the United States may be \"signatures\" used by Russian hacking groups, such as \"pieces of malicious code or the use of a particular server.\"99 Sources also point to the motivations of the purported bad actors, a common factor in the control and capabilities test. Whether the French State takes a similar approach that the US took in attributing the 2016 election interference to Russia based on \"technical indicators\" remains to be seen.\n### b) WannaCry Ransomware Attack\nIn May 2017, hundreds of thousands of computers were hijacked by a virus called \"WannaCry.\"100 The WannaCry virus acted as a ransomware, freezing computer files and demanding a ransom for their release. WannaCry impacted approximately 150 countries over the course of a weekend, and shut down hospitals in the United Kingdom.101 Analysts quickly noticed that a few lines of code used in the attack appeared in the hacking tools commonly used by the \"Lazarus\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2017/07/03/russia-suspect-in-ransomware-attacks-says-ukraine/#38e27e376b89.\n\ngroup,” the same group that the US blamed for the 2014 Sony attack. Whether States adopt this attribution analysis by private security firms, based on the same standard adopted by the US in 2014, will help determine if the control and capabilities test is, in fact, a developing *lex specialis*.\nc) APT 32\nResearches at cybersecurity company FireEye have identified an espionage group “aligned with Vietnamese state interests” as the “perpetrators of cyberattacks dating back as far as 2013[.]” This new report bases its loose attribution on the fact that APT32 has an interest in political influence and foreign governments, targets the private sector with ties to Vietnam, and has tactics that makes clear that APT32 operators are “well-resourced and supported as they use a large set of domains and IP addresses as command and control infrastructure.”\nIV. IMPACT OF TEST\nThe impact of the development State practice applying the control and capabilities test remains to be seen. There are, however, some demonstrable benefits and drawbacks to the control and capabilities approach. One benefit is easier attribution. By using the control and capabilities standard, as opposed to the effective control standard, offended States will have quicker recourse to attribution, and therefore quicker recourse to a lawful response. This benefit is also a downside. Quicker attribution can also lead to false positives. It is widely known within the cyber community that States can mask their true identity, and make it appear that the attack is originating in a separate State. This capability was recently disclosed in a set of Wikileaks disclosures called “Vault 7.”\nIt’s also unclear whether the State practice described above is being carried out with a sense of legal obligation, or political expediency. One drawback to the development of this test, and to attribution tests in cyberspace generally, has been the private nature in which States go about their research and attribution analysis. Without public statements of attribution, tied with statements of legal certainty, it will be difficult to have a conclusive determination as to whether the control and capabilities test has reached the level of customary international law.\nThat said, the effective control test is outdated as compared to the technological advances in cyberspace. States need to\nadopt a new standard in order to adapt with the tools available to States.\nV. CONCLUSION\nThe foregoing examples of State practice support the conclusion that imputed State responsibility for the unlawful cyber operations of non-State actors who are neither *de jure* nor *de facto* State organs is being assigned without rigid adherence to the “effective control” test. Again, this is just State practice demonstrating at least one element of determining State responsibility. State attribution under the new model is being assigned based on a control and capabilities test, examining motivations, geographic location, technical indicators, and relationship between the non-State actor and the State.\nThese State examples, of course, are not conclusive. This paper does not argue that such limited examples of State practice, alone, constitute a binding principle of customary international law. This State practice does, however, indicate that a *lex specialis* is forming that, if risen to the level of customary international law, would supplant the *lex generalis* “effective control” test, endorsed in Article 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility and Rule 17 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0. Such a change would radically alter the attribution models available in cyberspace.\n Ibid.\n Joe Uchill, “Espionage group ‘aligned with Vietnamese state interests’: report”, *The Hill* (May 15, 2017), available at http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/333404-espionage-group-aligned-with-vietnamese-state-interests-report; Nick Carr, “Cyber Espionage is Alive and Well: APT32 and the Threat to Global Corporations,” *FireEye* (May 14, 2017), available at https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/05/cyber-espionage-apt32.html.\n Carr, note 101.",

Stockburger, Esq.\nDentons US LLP\nSan Diego, CA (USA)\npeter.stockburger@dentons.com\nKeywords—attribution; cyber; lex specialis; lex generalis; effective control\n## I. INTRODUCTION\nAttribution in cyberspace is one of the most difficult questions facing policy makers, lawyers, and jurists. Indeed, the first question often asked in the wake of a cyber incident is “who did it?” The answer to this question is often critical when dealing with the application of international law because it will dictate the rights and responsibilities of States both from an offensive and defensive perspective. Without proper attribution, for example, a State’s responsive capabilities are limited. Making matters worse, attribution is difficult to establish factually. Non-State actors often mask their identity, and State actors often hide their true intentions. The degree to which the international rules governing State attribution apply in cyberspace is therefore a matter of great public importance.\nIt is widely accepted amongst States and scholars that the rules of international State responsibility generally apply in cyberspace. Those rules, reflective of the *lex generalis*, provide that the acts of a State’s *de jure* and *de facto* organs are generally attributable to the State. The internationally wrongful acts of non-State actors (who are neither *de jure* nor *de facto* State organs) may also be imputed to the State if the non-State actors operate on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of the State. This general rule relative to non-State actors, commonly referred to as the “effective control” test, is widely recognized as the *lex generalis*\ngoverning imputed State responsibility for the internationally wrongful acts of non-State actors. Accordingly, as the *lex generalis*, the rule does not vary “with the nature of the wrongful act in question” unless there is a “clearly expressed lex specialis.” The “effective control” test, as the *lex generalis*, therefore applies in cyberspace.\nThis paper posits that a new *lex specialis* is, in fact, forming that, if risen to the level of customary international law, would supplant the *lex generalis* “effective control” test and allow for imputed State responsibility for the internationally wrongful cyber operations of non-State actors even in the absence of express direction or control. This new test, which this paper calls the “control and capabilities” test, would allow for the attribution of non-State actor cyber activity based on a multi-factored test, examining: (1) the relationship between the non-State actor and the State, if any; (2) the cyber methods used by the non-State actor and whether those methods are similar to the State; (3) the motivations of the two parties, if known; (4) the similarity in technology and/or code used by the two parties; (5) the technical capabilities of the two parties; and (6) geographic location. In other words, direction and control are\n978-1-5386-2379-4/17/$31.00 ©2017 IEEE\nnot the dispositive factors. The evidence supporting the development of this test can be seen in the practice of interested States since 2014. And if this test were to reach the level of customary international law, it would supplant the lex generalis rule of “effective control” and mark a significant shift in how actions may be attributed under the law of imputed State responsibility in cyberspace.7 Below is a summary of this developing test, and thoughts on how it may impact the overall corpus of international law in cyberspace.\n## II. ATTRIBUTION LEGAL FRAMEWORK\n### A. Law of State Responsibility\nThe law of State responsibility is premised on two elements: (1) whether the act or omission in question is internationally wrongful; and (2) whether the act or omission in question is attributable to the State.8 This paper only focuses on the latter as a normative question.9\n### B. Attribution Tests\n#### 1) Direct Attribution - De Jure and De Facto State Organs\nAs a general rule, a “State is responsible only for its own conduct, that is to say the conduct of persons acting, on whatever basis, on its behalf[.]”10 This includes acts:\ncarried out by [State] official organs, and also by persons or entities which are not formally recognized as official organs under internal law but which must nevertheless be equated with State organs because they are in a relationship of complete dependence on the State.11\nThese types of individuals and groups are commonly referred to as de jure and de facto State organs. Both are recognized under Articles 4-6 of the Articles on State Responsibility,12 and it is widely accepted that the conduct of de jure and de facto State organs are generally attributable to the State.13\n#### 2) Imputed Attribution - Control and Direction\nThe conduct of a non-State actor that is neither a de jure nor de facto State organ may also be attributable to the State\n“if the [non-State actor] is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, [the] State in carrying out the conduct[.]”14 This direction and control test, known as the “effective control” test, reflects the lex generalis as it pertains to imputed State responsibility for the conduct of non-State actors.\n##### a) Effective Control Test - Background\nThe “effective control” test was first outlined by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in its 1986 case concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua wherein the Court examined whether US control over Nicaraguan Contras was sufficient to impute the actions of the Contras to the US under international law. The Court made clear that the actions of non-State actors not totally dependent on the State (but who are nonetheless paid, financed and equipped by the State) would be attributed to the State only if it were established that the State “directed or enforced the perpetration” of the internationally wrongful acts in question.15 Under this “effective control” test, the Court determined that although the US was responsible for the general “planning, direction and support” given to the Contras, the US was not internationally responsible for the internationally wrongful actions of the Contras because “there [was] no clear evidence of the US having actually exercised such a degree of control in all fields as to justify treating the [Contras] as acting on its behalf.”16 This “effective control” test, reflected in Article 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility,17 was expressly endorsed by the International Group of Experts (IGE) in the recently published Tallinn Manual 2.0 as reflective of customary international law.18\n##### b) Overall Control Test Introduced\nThirteen years later, in 1999, a competing test known as the “overall control” test was introduced by the Appeals Chamber of the United Nations International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in its influential Tadić opinion. The tribunal rejected the “effective control” test, and instead applied an “overall control” test to determine the attribution of acts of hierarchically structured groups, such as a military unit or armed bands of irregulars or rebels under the jus in bello.19 In such circumstances, the tribunal noted, the State will be internationally responsible for the wrongful\n\n## c) Effective Control Test Revisited\nThe ICJ revisited the “effective control” test in 2007 in the case concerning the Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. The Court criticized the ICTY’s “overall control” test as going beyond the ICTY’s jurisdiction, and being unsupported in State practice. The Court reaffirmed the customary status of the “effective control” test, and announced that the actions of the Republika Srpska and certain paramilitary groups known as the Scorpions, Red Berets, Tigers and White Eagles were not attributable to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) because there was insufficient evidence demonstrating that State instruction and direction was given with regard to each operation in which the alleged violations occurred, and not generally in respect of the overall actions taken by the persons or groups of persons having committed the violations. Consequently, and controversially, the Court determined that the FRY could not be internationally responsible for the acts committed by the non-State actors in question, most notably for the massacres at Srebrenica.\n## d) Safe Harbor / Duty To Prevent\nThere has been additional State practice endorsing a theory for imputed State responsibility wherein the State in question harbors and provides material support to those who cause harm in another State. After the September 11, 2001 attacks, the US invoked its right to self-defense pursuant to Article 51 of the United Nations Charter on the premise that\nthe September 11 attacks constituted an “armed attack.” The US attributed those attacks to the Taliban regime in Afghanistan because they were “made possible by the decision of the Taliban regime to allow the parts of Afghanistan that it controls to be used by this organization as a base of operation.” The global community generally accepted the legality of this action.\nThis “safe harbor” principle is notable because it attributes the acts of a non-State actor to the State not based on direction or control, but based on an obligation otherwise understood as the duty to prevent trans-boundary harm and the “due diligence” principle as articulated in the 1941 Trial Smelter arbitration, the ICJ’s Corfu Channel judgment, the ICJ’s Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, and the ICJ’s Case Concerning Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project judgment. The “due diligence” principle has been applied to many areas of international law, including international environmental law, human rights law, and State responsibility. It is distinct from imputed State responsibility because due diligence is an “obligation of conduct rather than of result[.]” The degree to\n Ibid.\n Art. 2 of the Statute of the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991, S/RES/827 (1993) of 25 May 1993, Annex.\n Articles on State Responsibility, note 3, at art. 8, commentary (5) (noting it is a “matter for appreciation in each case whether particular conduct was or was not carried out under the control of a State, to such an extent that the conduct controlled should be attributed to it).\n Bosnia Genocide, note 2, at 208.\n Id. at 206-08.\n UN Security Council, Letter Dated 7 October 2001 From the Permanent Representative of the United States of America to the United Nations Addressed to the President of the Security Council, UN Doc No S/2001/946 (2001).\n Ibid.\n See G.A.

The “overall” control test is discussed in the commentary to Article 8, which also provides that it is “a matter of appreciation in each case whether particular conduct was or was not carried out under the control of a State, to such an extent that the conduct controlled should be attributed to it.”\nArticle 55 of the Articles of State Responsibility is entitled “Lex specialis” and provides that the Articles of State Responsibility “do not apply where and to the extent that the conditions for the existence of an internationally wrongful act or the content or implementation of the international responsibility of a State are governed by special rules of international law.”\n## f) Tallinn Manual Recognition\nThe authors of the Tallinn Manual have also concluded that the “effective control” test is the *lex generalis* controlling imputed State responsibility for the conduct of non-State actors. The IGE recognized the tension between the “effective” and “overall” control tests in the 2013 Tallinn Manual when examining the *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello*, but concluded the application of the “effective control” test in the context of peacetime operations in the revised 2017 Tallinn Manual 2.0. Specifically, Rule 17 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0, reflecting Article 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility, provides that cyber operations conducted by a non-State actor are attributable to a State when “engaged in pursuant to its instruction or under its direction or control[.].”\nBy this standard, the IGE notes that a State may, either by specific direction or by exercising control over a group, in effect assume responsibility for their conduct, with each case dependent on its own facts. Instruction within this context “refers most typically to situations in which a non-State actor functions as a State’s auxiliary.” And a State is in “effective control” of a particular cyber operation by a non-State actor whenever it is the State that “determines the execution and course of the specific operation and the cyber activity engaged in by the non-State actor is an ‘integral part of that operation.’ Effective control includes both the ability to cause constituent activities of the operation to occur, as well as the ability to order the cessation of those that are underway.”\n## III. THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CONTROL AND CAPABILITIES TEST\nIt is thus well accepted that the “effective control” test represents the *lex generalis* governing the attribution of internationally wrongful conduct of non-State actors to the State. As the *lex generalis*, this test applies in all situations unless there is an express *lex specialis* providing otherwise.\nAs explained below, a review of State practice since 2014 reveals that a new *lex specialis* has, in fact, begun to form that would, if risen to the level of customary international law, supplant the *lex generalis* “effective control” test in cyberspace. This state practice involves States that have publicly attributed the cyber operations of non-State actors to States on the basis the basis of a multitude of factors, including but not limited to (1) the relationship between the non-State actor and the State, if any; (2) the cyber methods used by the non-State actor and whether those methods are similar to the State; (3) the motivations of the two parties, if known; (4) the similarity in technology and/or code used by the two parties; (5) the technical capabilities of the two parties; and (6) geographic location. Direction and control have not been dispositive factors. Although the second element for the development of custom, that is opinio juris, has been lacking thus far, the development of the *actus* State practice is of note.\n## A. Development of Custom\nCustomary international law is defined as the general practice of States accepted as law.

State Practice Supporting The Control and Capabilities Test\n### 1) Pre-2014 Attribution Based on Control and Capabilities Test\nPrior to 2014, public attribution of internationally wrongful cyber operations was virtually non-existent. Private attribution, however, began to follow the control and capabilities factors set forth above as early as 2007. In 2007, after Estonia was hit with a wave of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks after deciding to remove a Soviet-era bronze soldier monument from its location in central Tallinn, Estonia, for example, a number of scholars and jurists privately attributed the attacks to Russia. Evidence showed that the “hackers claimed to be Russian, the tools to hack and deface were contained in Russian websites and chatrooms, and the attacks picked a day of” significance to most Russians. Moreover, although the botnets used computers from different countries, at least some of the attacks “originated from Russian IP (internet protocol) addresses, including those of state institutions.”\nIn 2008, a similar scenario played out with Russia being privately blamed for carrying out a DDoS attack during its 2008 conflict with Georgia wherein fifty-four “web sites in Georgia related to communications, finance, and the government” were attacked “immediately before and continu[ing] throughout the armed conflict between” the two States. All signs pointed to a Russian hacker community as\nthe responsible perpetrator, including the fact that coordination for the attacks took place in the Russian language, and in Russian or Russia-related “fora.”\nLikewise, despite confirmation from State actors regarding the 2010 Stuxnet virus, and although it has been reported that the Stuxnet virus was formally developed under US administrations, no formal attribution was declared.\nAdditional pre-2014 activity included the 2013, and controversial Mandiant Report which attributed APT1 attacks to the Chinese State based on the geographic location of the bad actors, the methods and capabilities of the actors in question, and the motivations of the Chinese State.\n### 2) Sony 2014\nIt was not until 2014 that a State first publicly attributed what appeared to be a non-State actor’s unlawful cyber operations to a State. In 2014, Sony Pictures was hit with a highly publicized DDoS attack of unknown proportions after its computer systems were compromised by suspected North Korean tied hackers. The attack surrounded the release of the movie “The Interview” about the fictional assassination of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. Prior to the movie’s release, the spokesperson for North Korea’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement “that the country would take ‘a decisive and merciless countermeasure’ if the United States’ government permitted Sony to make its planned Christmas release of the comedy.” In November, Sony’s computer systems were compromised, and embarrassing e-mail communications from its CEO were leaked online. A group calling itself the “Guardians of Peace” claimed responsibility for the attack.\nUnbeknownst to North Korea, years earlier US officials gained access to the North Korean cyber infrastructure and implanted malicious code to track North Korean operations, allowing them to identify certain IP addresses that were being\n Lynn Loschin, *The Persistent Objector and Customary Human Rights Law: A Proposed Analytical Framework*, 2 U.C.

This information about methods and capabilities led the US to publicly attribute the attack to North Korea without mention of any direction or control by the North Korean government. In response, the US imposed economic sanctions on North Korea, further reflecting the attribution of the attack to the North Korean State. North Korea also reportedly suffered widespread Internet outages in December 2014, raising the possibility that countermeasures were taken.\n## 3) Iran - 2016\nIn 2016, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) publicly attributed the cyber operations of private non-State actors to Iran based on a control and capabilities analysis. In March 2016, a grand jury in the Southern District of New York criminally indicted seven Iranian individuals who were employed by two Iran-based computer companies, ITSec Team and Mersad Company. The individuals were charged with performing “work on behalf of the Iranian Government, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, on\ncomputer hacking charges related to their involvement in an extensive campaign of over 176 days of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.” The seven individuals were alleged to have “launched DDoS attacks against 46 victims, primarily in the U.S. financial sector, between late 2011 and mid-2013.” These attacks purportedly disabled victim bank websites, prevented customers from accessing their accounts online, and cost tens of millions of dollars in damage. One of the defendants was also charged with obtaining unauthorized access into the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition systems of the Bowman Dam located in upstate New York in August and September 2013. In releasing the indictment, the US stated:\nLike past nation state-sponsored hackers, these defendants and their backers believed that they could attack our critical infrastructure without consequence, from behind a veil of cyber anonymity[.] This indictment once against shows there is no such veil - we can and will expose malicious cyber hackers engaging in unlawful acts that threaten our public safety and national security.\nIn the indictment, the US attributed the actions of the seven private individuals to the Iranian State because the individuals purportedly “performed work on behalf of” the Iranian Government, as evidenced by the scope and capabilities of their cyber operations. In the press release accompanying the indictment, the US Department of Justice noted these individuals had “ties” to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard. And without explaining the instruction from the State involved, the indictment alleged Ahmad Fathi, the purported leader of the defendants, was “responsible for managing computer intrusion and cyber projects being conducted on behalf of the Government of Iran.” The indictment also alleged that defendant Amin Shokoh received credit for his work from the Iranian Government towards completion of his mandatory military service in Iran. These allegations did not discuss direction or control, and instead focused on means and methods, capabilities, and motivations of the perpetrators in effectuating State attribution.\n## 4) Russia - 2016 / 2017\n David E.

However, public attribution of these activities to [Russian civilian and military intelligence Services] is supported by technical indicators from the U.S. Intelligence Community, DHS, FBI, the private sector, and other entities.86\nAccording to the Joint Report, those “technical indicators” prove the threat actors are “likely associated” with the Russian State.87\nThe Joint Report was widely panned by industry experts for its purported failure to provide a “smoking gun” that showed Russian control or direction over the DNC intrusion, and for using false technical indicators linking the purported threat actors to the Russian State.88 But the focus of the Joint Report was not on express direction or control. It instead focused on capabilities, methods, motivations and technical indicators, reflecting the development of the control and capabilities test as the growing lex specialis for imputed State attribution for the unlawful cyber operations of non-State actors.\nb) US Attribution - Yahoo Breach\nIn March 2017, the US DOJ announced the indictments of five individuals, including two Russian officials, for “computer hacking, economic espionage and other criminal offenses in connection with a conspiracy, beginning in January 2014, to access Yahoo’s network and the contents of\n\nwebmail accounts.\"89 In the indictment, the DOJ alleged that \"officers of the Russian Federal Security Service\" and \"intelligence and law enforcement agency of the Russian Federation\" \"conspired together and with each other to protect, direct, facilitate, and pay criminal hackers to collect information through computer intrusions in the United States and elsewhere.\"90 The evidence cited to link the Russian officials to the \"criminal hackers\", however, was less than express direction and control: (1) the criminal hackers obtained evidence of \"information of predictable interest to the FSB\", including access to \"Russian journalists and politicians critical of the Russian government\" (i.e., motivations); (2) the geographic location of the criminal hackers; (3) the ability of the Russian State to \"arrest and prosecute\" the criminal hackers and its failure to do so; and (4) threadbare allegations that the Russian officials provided direction to the criminal hackers.91 The focus therefore was on motivations, capabilities and geographic proximity, in combination with conclusory allegations of State direction. The test applied was not the \"effective control\" test. The DOJ focused on control and capabilities.\n## c) Ukraine Attribution - NotPetya Ransomware\nIn June 2017, a particularly devastating strain of ransomware began infecting PC's around the world.92 The \"blast radius\" of the attack was in Ukraine, where 60% of the infected machines were located.93 Other infected machines belonged to international companies that operate within Ukraine.94 A group called \"GoldenEye\" claimed responsibility for the attack.95\n\nUkraine's state security service, the SBU, publicly attributed the attack to the Russian State based on: (1) similar motivations between the suspected hackers and the Russian State; and (2) similar code used by the suspected hackers and other hackers Ukraine suspects are connected to the Russian State.96 The attribution was \"largely based on similarities in tools and techniques\" rather \"than any obvious, direct correlation.\"97\n## 5) Situations To Watch\n### a) French Election\nJust prior to the most recent French presidential election, a number of sensitive e-mails from the Macron campaign were disclosed online. The United States warned French authorities that Russian-based hackers were targeting France's computer infrastructure in the run-up to the presidential election, a \"revelation likely to intensify speculation that Moscow was responsible for dumping a huge trove of hacked documents days before the election.\"98 One former intelligence official told Foreign Policy that the evidence relied upon by the United States may be \"signatures\" used by Russian hacking groups, such as \"pieces of malicious code or the use of a particular server.\"99 Sources also point to the motivations of the purported bad actors, a common factor in the control and capabilities test. Whether the French State takes a similar approach that the US took in attributing the 2016 election interference to Russia based on \"technical indicators\" remains to be seen.\n### b) WannaCry Ransomware Attack\nIn May 2017, hundreds of thousands of computers were hijacked by a virus called \"WannaCry.\"100 The WannaCry virus acted as a ransomware, freezing computer files and demanding a ransom for their release. WannaCry impacted approximately 150 countries over the course of a weekend, and shut down hospitals in the United Kingdom.101 Analysts quickly noticed that a few lines of code used in the attack appeared in the hacking tools commonly used by the \"Lazarus\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2017/07/03/russia-suspect-in-ransomware-attacks-says-ukraine/#38e27e376b89.\n\ngroup,” the same group that the US blamed for the 2014 Sony attack. Whether States adopt this attribution analysis by private security firms, based on the same standard adopted by the US in 2014, will help determine if the control and capabilities test is, in fact, a developing *lex specialis*.\nc) APT 32\nResearches at cybersecurity company FireEye have identified an espionage group “aligned with Vietnamese state interests” as the “perpetrators of cyberattacks dating back as far as 2013[.]” This new report bases its loose attribution on the fact that APT32 has an interest in political influence and foreign governments, targets the private sector with ties to Vietnam, and has tactics that makes clear that APT32 operators are “well-resourced and supported as they use a large set of domains and IP addresses as command and control infrastructure.”\nIV. IMPACT OF TEST\nThe impact of the development State practice applying the control and capabilities test remains to be seen. There are, however, some demonstrable benefits and drawbacks to the control and capabilities approach. One benefit is easier attribution. By using the control and capabilities standard, as opposed to the effective control standard, offended States will have quicker recourse to attribution, and therefore quicker recourse to a lawful response. This benefit is also a downside. Quicker attribution can also lead to false positives. It is widely known within the cyber community that States can mask their true identity, and make it appear that the attack is originating in a separate State. This capability was recently disclosed in a set of Wikileaks disclosures called “Vault 7.”\nIt’s also unclear whether the State practice described above is being carried out with a sense of legal obligation, or political expediency. One drawback to the development of this test, and to attribution tests in cyberspace generally, has been the private nature in which States go about their research and attribution analysis. Without public statements of attribution, tied with statements of legal certainty, it will be difficult to have a conclusive determination as to whether the control and capabilities test has reached the level of customary international law.\nThat said, the effective control test is outdated as compared to the technological advances in cyberspace. States need to\nadopt a new standard in order to adapt with the tools available to States.\nV. CONCLUSION\nThe foregoing examples of State practice support the conclusion that imputed State responsibility for the unlawful cyber operations of non-State actors who are neither *de jure* nor *de facto* State organs is being assigned without rigid adherence to the “effective control” test. Again, this is just State practice demonstrating at least one element of determining State responsibility. State attribution under the new model is being assigned based on a control and capabilities test, examining motivations, geographic location, technical indicators, and relationship between the non-State actor and the State.\nThese State examples, of course, are not conclusive. This paper does not argue that such limited examples of State practice, alone, constitute a binding principle of customary international law. This State practice does, however, indicate that a *lex specialis* is forming that, if risen to the level of customary international law, would supplant the *lex generalis* “effective control” test, endorsed in Article 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility and Rule 17 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0. Such a change would radically alter the attribution models available in cyberspace.\n Ibid.\n Joe Uchill, “Espionage group ‘aligned with Vietnamese state interests’: report”, *The Hill* (May 15, 2017), available at http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/333404-espionage-group-aligned-with-vietnamese-state-interests-report; Nick Carr, “Cyber Espionage is Alive and Well: APT32 and the Threat to Global Corporations,” *FireEye* (May 14, 2017), available at https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/05/cyber-espionage-apt32.html.\n Carr, note 101.",

Stockburger, Esq.\nDentons US LLP\nSan Diego, CA (USA)\npeter.stockburger@dentons.com\nKeywords—attribution; cyber; lex specialis; lex generalis; effective control\n## I. INTRODUCTION\nAttribution in cyberspace is one of the most difficult questions facing policy makers, lawyers, and jurists. Indeed, the first question often asked in the wake of a cyber incident is “who did it?” The answer to this question is often critical when dealing with the application of international law because it will dictate the rights and responsibilities of States both from an offensive and defensive perspective. Without proper attribution, for example, a State’s responsive capabilities are limited. Making matters worse, attribution is difficult to establish factually. Non-State actors often mask their identity, and State actors often hide their true intentions. The degree to which the international rules governing State attribution apply in cyberspace is therefore a matter of great public importance.\nIt is widely accepted amongst States and scholars that the rules of international State responsibility generally apply in cyberspace. Those rules, reflective of the *lex generalis*, provide that the acts of a State’s *de jure* and *de facto* organs are generally attributable to the State. The internationally wrongful acts of non-State actors (who are neither *de jure* nor *de facto* State organs) may also be imputed to the State if the non-State actors operate on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of the State. This general rule relative to non-State actors, commonly referred to as the “effective control” test, is widely recognized as the *lex generalis*\ngoverning imputed State responsibility for the internationally wrongful acts of non-State actors. Accordingly, as the *lex generalis*, the rule does not vary “with the nature of the wrongful act in question” unless there is a “clearly expressed lex specialis.” The “effective control” test, as the *lex generalis*, therefore applies in cyberspace.\nThis paper posits that a new *lex specialis* is, in fact, forming that, if risen to the level of customary international law, would supplant the *lex generalis* “effective control” test and allow for imputed State responsibility for the internationally wrongful cyber operations of non-State actors even in the absence of express direction or control. This new test, which this paper calls the “control and capabilities” test, would allow for the attribution of non-State actor cyber activity based on a multi-factored test, examining: (1) the relationship between the non-State actor and the State, if any; (2) the cyber methods used by the non-State actor and whether those methods are similar to the State; (3) the motivations of the two parties, if known; (4) the similarity in technology and/or code used by the two parties; (5) the technical capabilities of the two parties; and (6) geographic location. In other words, direction and control are\n978-1-5386-2379-4/17/$31.00 ©2017 IEEE\nnot the dispositive factors. The evidence supporting the development of this test can be seen in the practice of interested States since 2014. And if this test were to reach the level of customary international law, it would supplant the lex generalis rule of “effective control” and mark a significant shift in how actions may be attributed under the law of imputed State responsibility in cyberspace.7 Below is a summary of this developing test, and thoughts on how it may impact the overall corpus of international law in cyberspace.\n## II. ATTRIBUTION LEGAL FRAMEWORK\n### A. Law of State Responsibility\nThe law of State responsibility is premised on two elements: (1) whether the act or omission in question is internationally wrongful; and (2) whether the act or omission in question is attributable to the State.8 This paper only focuses on the latter as a normative question.9\n### B. Attribution Tests\n#### 1) Direct Attribution - De Jure and De Facto State Organs\nAs a general rule, a “State is responsible only for its own conduct, that is to say the conduct of persons acting, on whatever basis, on its behalf[.]”10 This includes acts:\ncarried out by [State] official organs, and also by persons or entities which are not formally recognized as official organs under internal law but which must nevertheless be equated with State organs because they are in a relationship of complete dependence on the State.11\nThese types of individuals and groups are commonly referred to as de jure and de facto State organs. Both are recognized under Articles 4-6 of the Articles on State Responsibility,12 and it is widely accepted that the conduct of de jure and de facto State organs are generally attributable to the State.13\n#### 2) Imputed Attribution - Control and Direction\nThe conduct of a non-State actor that is neither a de jure nor de facto State organ may also be attributable to the State\n“if the [non-State actor] is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, [the] State in carrying out the conduct[.]”14 This direction and control test, known as the “effective control” test, reflects the lex generalis as it pertains to imputed State responsibility for the conduct of non-State actors.\n##### a) Effective Control Test - Background\nThe “effective control” test was first outlined by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in its 1986 case concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua wherein the Court examined whether US control over Nicaraguan Contras was sufficient to impute the actions of the Contras to the US under international law. The Court made clear that the actions of non-State actors not totally dependent on the State (but who are nonetheless paid, financed and equipped by the State) would be attributed to the State only if it were established that the State “directed or enforced the perpetration” of the internationally wrongful acts in question.15 Under this “effective control” test, the Court determined that although the US was responsible for the general “planning, direction and support” given to the Contras, the US was not internationally responsible for the internationally wrongful actions of the Contras because “there [was] no clear evidence of the US having actually exercised such a degree of control in all fields as to justify treating the [Contras] as acting on its behalf.”16 This “effective control” test, reflected in Article 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility,17 was expressly endorsed by the International Group of Experts (IGE) in the recently published Tallinn Manual 2.0 as reflective of customary international law.18\n##### b) Overall Control Test Introduced\nThirteen years later, in 1999, a competing test known as the “overall control” test was introduced by the Appeals Chamber of the United Nations International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in its influential Tadić opinion. The tribunal rejected the “effective control” test, and instead applied an “overall control” test to determine the attribution of acts of hierarchically structured groups, such as a military unit or armed bands of irregulars or rebels under the jus in bello.19 In such circumstances, the tribunal noted, the State will be internationally responsible for the wrongful\n\n## c) Effective Control Test Revisited\nThe ICJ revisited the “effective control” test in 2007 in the case concerning the Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. The Court criticized the ICTY’s “overall control” test as going beyond the ICTY’s jurisdiction, and being unsupported in State practice. The Court reaffirmed the customary status of the “effective control” test, and announced that the actions of the Republika Srpska and certain paramilitary groups known as the Scorpions, Red Berets, Tigers and White Eagles were not attributable to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) because there was insufficient evidence demonstrating that State instruction and direction was given with regard to each operation in which the alleged violations occurred, and not generally in respect of the overall actions taken by the persons or groups of persons having committed the violations. Consequently, and controversially, the Court determined that the FRY could not be internationally responsible for the acts committed by the non-State actors in question, most notably for the massacres at Srebrenica.\n## d) Safe Harbor / Duty To Prevent\nThere has been additional State practice endorsing a theory for imputed State responsibility wherein the State in question harbors and provides material support to those who cause harm in another State. After the September 11, 2001 attacks, the US invoked its right to self-defense pursuant to Article 51 of the United Nations Charter on the premise that\nthe September 11 attacks constituted an “armed attack.” The US attributed those attacks to the Taliban regime in Afghanistan because they were “made possible by the decision of the Taliban regime to allow the parts of Afghanistan that it controls to be used by this organization as a base of operation.” The global community generally accepted the legality of this action.\nThis “safe harbor” principle is notable because it attributes the acts of a non-State actor to the State not based on direction or control, but based on an obligation otherwise understood as the duty to prevent trans-boundary harm and the “due diligence” principle as articulated in the 1941 Trial Smelter arbitration, the ICJ’s Corfu Channel judgment, the ICJ’s Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, and the ICJ’s Case Concerning Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project judgment. The “due diligence” principle has been applied to many areas of international law, including international environmental law, human rights law, and State responsibility. It is distinct from imputed State responsibility because due diligence is an “obligation of conduct rather than of result[.]” The degree to\n Ibid.\n Art. 2 of the Statute of the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991, S/RES/827 (1993) of 25 May 1993, Annex.\n Articles on State Responsibility, note 3, at art. 8, commentary (5) (noting it is a “matter for appreciation in each case whether particular conduct was or was not carried out under the control of a State, to such an extent that the conduct controlled should be attributed to it).\n Bosnia Genocide, note 2, at 208.\n Id. at 206-08.\n UN Security Council, Letter Dated 7 October 2001 From the Permanent Representative of the United States of America to the United Nations Addressed to the President of the Security Council, UN Doc No S/2001/946 (2001).\n Ibid.\n See G.A.

The “overall” control test is discussed in the commentary to Article 8, which also provides that it is “a matter of appreciation in each case whether particular conduct was or was not carried out under the control of a State, to such an extent that the conduct controlled should be attributed to it.”\nArticle 55 of the Articles of State Responsibility is entitled “Lex specialis” and provides that the Articles of State Responsibility “do not apply where and to the extent that the conditions for the existence of an internationally wrongful act or the content or implementation of the international responsibility of a State are governed by special rules of international law.”\n## f) Tallinn Manual Recognition\nThe authors of the Tallinn Manual have also concluded that the “effective control” test is the *lex generalis* controlling imputed State responsibility for the conduct of non-State actors. The IGE recognized the tension between the “effective” and “overall” control tests in the 2013 Tallinn Manual when examining the *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello*, but concluded the application of the “effective control” test in the context of peacetime operations in the revised 2017 Tallinn Manual 2.0. Specifically, Rule 17 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0, reflecting Article 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility, provides that cyber operations conducted by a non-State actor are attributable to a State when “engaged in pursuant to its instruction or under its direction or control[.].”\nBy this standard, the IGE notes that a State may, either by specific direction or by exercising control over a group, in effect assume responsibility for their conduct, with each case dependent on its own facts. Instruction within this context “refers most typically to situations in which a non-State actor functions as a State’s auxiliary.” And a State is in “effective control” of a particular cyber operation by a non-State actor whenever it is the State that “determines the execution and course of the specific operation and the cyber activity engaged in by the non-State actor is an ‘integral part of that operation.’ Effective control includes both the ability to cause constituent activities of the operation to occur, as well as the ability to order the cessation of those that are underway.”\n## III. THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CONTROL AND CAPABILITIES TEST\nIt is thus well accepted that the “effective control” test represents the *lex generalis* governing the attribution of internationally wrongful conduct of non-State actors to the State. As the *lex generalis*, this test applies in all situations unless there is an express *lex specialis* providing otherwise.\nAs explained below, a review of State practice since 2014 reveals that a new *lex specialis* has, in fact, begun to form that would, if risen to the level of customary international law, supplant the *lex generalis* “effective control” test in cyberspace. This state practice involves States that have publicly attributed the cyber operations of non-State actors to States on the basis the basis of a multitude of factors, including but not limited to (1) the relationship between the non-State actor and the State, if any; (2) the cyber methods used by the non-State actor and whether those methods are similar to the State; (3) the motivations of the two parties, if known; (4) the similarity in technology and/or code used by the two parties; (5) the technical capabilities of the two parties; and (6) geographic location. Direction and control have not been dispositive factors. Although the second element for the development of custom, that is opinio juris, has been lacking thus far, the development of the *actus* State practice is of note.\n## A. Development of Custom\nCustomary international law is defined as the general practice of States accepted as law.

State Practice Supporting The Control and Capabilities Test\n### 1) Pre-2014 Attribution Based on Control and Capabilities Test\nPrior to 2014, public attribution of internationally wrongful cyber operations was virtually non-existent. Private attribution, however, began to follow the control and capabilities factors set forth above as early as 2007. In 2007, after Estonia was hit with a wave of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks after deciding to remove a Soviet-era bronze soldier monument from its location in central Tallinn, Estonia, for example, a number of scholars and jurists privately attributed the attacks to Russia. Evidence showed that the “hackers claimed to be Russian, the tools to hack and deface were contained in Russian websites and chatrooms, and the attacks picked a day of” significance to most Russians. Moreover, although the botnets used computers from different countries, at least some of the attacks “originated from Russian IP (internet protocol) addresses, including those of state institutions.”\nIn 2008, a similar scenario played out with Russia being privately blamed for carrying out a DDoS attack during its 2008 conflict with Georgia wherein fifty-four “web sites in Georgia related to communications, finance, and the government” were attacked “immediately before and continu[ing] throughout the armed conflict between” the two States. All signs pointed to a Russian hacker community as\nthe responsible perpetrator, including the fact that coordination for the attacks took place in the Russian language, and in Russian or Russia-related “fora.”\nLikewise, despite confirmation from State actors regarding the 2010 Stuxnet virus, and although it has been reported that the Stuxnet virus was formally developed under US administrations, no formal attribution was declared.\nAdditional pre-2014 activity included the 2013, and controversial Mandiant Report which attributed APT1 attacks to the Chinese State based on the geographic location of the bad actors, the methods and capabilities of the actors in question, and the motivations of the Chinese State.\n### 2) Sony 2014\nIt was not until 2014 that a State first publicly attributed what appeared to be a non-State actor’s unlawful cyber operations to a State. In 2014, Sony Pictures was hit with a highly publicized DDoS attack of unknown proportions after its computer systems were compromised by suspected North Korean tied hackers. The attack surrounded the release of the movie “The Interview” about the fictional assassination of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. Prior to the movie’s release, the spokesperson for North Korea’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement “that the country would take ‘a decisive and merciless countermeasure’ if the United States’ government permitted Sony to make its planned Christmas release of the comedy.” In November, Sony’s computer systems were compromised, and embarrassing e-mail communications from its CEO were leaked online. A group calling itself the “Guardians of Peace” claimed responsibility for the attack.\nUnbeknownst to North Korea, years earlier US officials gained access to the North Korean cyber infrastructure and implanted malicious code to track North Korean operations, allowing them to identify certain IP addresses that were being\n Lynn Loschin, *The Persistent Objector and Customary Human Rights Law: A Proposed Analytical Framework*, 2 U.C.

This information about methods and capabilities led the US to publicly attribute the attack to North Korea without mention of any direction or control by the North Korean government. In response, the US imposed economic sanctions on North Korea, further reflecting the attribution of the attack to the North Korean State. North Korea also reportedly suffered widespread Internet outages in December 2014, raising the possibility that countermeasures were taken.\n## 3) Iran - 2016\nIn 2016, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) publicly attributed the cyber operations of private non-State actors to Iran based on a control and capabilities analysis. In March 2016, a grand jury in the Southern District of New York criminally indicted seven Iranian individuals who were employed by two Iran-based computer companies, ITSec Team and Mersad Company. The individuals were charged with performing “work on behalf of the Iranian Government, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, on\ncomputer hacking charges related to their involvement in an extensive campaign of over 176 days of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.” The seven individuals were alleged to have “launched DDoS attacks against 46 victims, primarily in the U.S. financial sector, between late 2011 and mid-2013.” These attacks purportedly disabled victim bank websites, prevented customers from accessing their accounts online, and cost tens of millions of dollars in damage. One of the defendants was also charged with obtaining unauthorized access into the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition systems of the Bowman Dam located in upstate New York in August and September 2013. In releasing the indictment, the US stated:\nLike past nation state-sponsored hackers, these defendants and their backers believed that they could attack our critical infrastructure without consequence, from behind a veil of cyber anonymity[.] This indictment once against shows there is no such veil - we can and will expose malicious cyber hackers engaging in unlawful acts that threaten our public safety and national security.\nIn the indictment, the US attributed the actions of the seven private individuals to the Iranian State because the individuals purportedly “performed work on behalf of” the Iranian Government, as evidenced by the scope and capabilities of their cyber operations. In the press release accompanying the indictment, the US Department of Justice noted these individuals had “ties” to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard. And without explaining the instruction from the State involved, the indictment alleged Ahmad Fathi, the purported leader of the defendants, was “responsible for managing computer intrusion and cyber projects being conducted on behalf of the Government of Iran.” The indictment also alleged that defendant Amin Shokoh received credit for his work from the Iranian Government towards completion of his mandatory military service in Iran. These allegations did not discuss direction or control, and instead focused on means and methods, capabilities, and motivations of the perpetrators in effectuating State attribution.\n## 4) Russia - 2016 / 2017\n David E.

However, public attribution of these activities to [Russian civilian and military intelligence Services] is supported by technical indicators from the U.S. Intelligence Community, DHS, FBI, the private sector, and other entities.86\nAccording to the Joint Report, those “technical indicators” prove the threat actors are “likely associated” with the Russian State.87\nThe Joint Report was widely panned by industry experts for its purported failure to provide a “smoking gun” that showed Russian control or direction over the DNC intrusion, and for using false technical indicators linking the purported threat actors to the Russian State.88 But the focus of the Joint Report was not on express direction or control. It instead focused on capabilities, methods, motivations and technical indicators, reflecting the development of the control and capabilities test as the growing lex specialis for imputed State attribution for the unlawful cyber operations of non-State actors.\nb) US Attribution - Yahoo Breach\nIn March 2017, the US DOJ announced the indictments of five individuals, including two Russian officials, for “computer hacking, economic espionage and other criminal offenses in connection with a conspiracy, beginning in January 2014, to access Yahoo’s network and the contents of\n\nwebmail accounts.\"89 In the indictment, the DOJ alleged that \"officers of the Russian Federal Security Service\" and \"intelligence and law enforcement agency of the Russian Federation\" \"conspired together and with each other to protect, direct, facilitate, and pay criminal hackers to collect information through computer intrusions in the United States and elsewhere.\"90 The evidence cited to link the Russian officials to the \"criminal hackers\", however, was less than express direction and control: (1) the criminal hackers obtained evidence of \"information of predictable interest to the FSB\", including access to \"Russian journalists and politicians critical of the Russian government\" (i.e., motivations); (2) the geographic location of the criminal hackers; (3) the ability of the Russian State to \"arrest and prosecute\" the criminal hackers and its failure to do so; and (4) threadbare allegations that the Russian officials provided direction to the criminal hackers.91 The focus therefore was on motivations, capabilities and geographic proximity, in combination with conclusory allegations of State direction. The test applied was not the \"effective control\" test. The DOJ focused on control and capabilities.\n## c) Ukraine Attribution - NotPetya Ransomware\nIn June 2017, a particularly devastating strain of ransomware began infecting PC's around the world.92 The \"blast radius\" of the attack was in Ukraine, where 60% of the infected machines were located.93 Other infected machines belonged to international companies that operate within Ukraine.94 A group called \"GoldenEye\" claimed responsibility for the attack.95\n\nUkraine's state security service, the SBU, publicly attributed the attack to the Russian State based on: (1) similar motivations between the suspected hackers and the Russian State; and (2) similar code used by the suspected hackers and other hackers Ukraine suspects are connected to the Russian State.96 The attribution was \"largely based on similarities in tools and techniques\" rather \"than any obvious, direct correlation.\"97\n## 5) Situations To Watch\n### a) French Election\nJust prior to the most recent French presidential election, a number of sensitive e-mails from the Macron campaign were disclosed online. The United States warned French authorities that Russian-based hackers were targeting France's computer infrastructure in the run-up to the presidential election, a \"revelation likely to intensify speculation that Moscow was responsible for dumping a huge trove of hacked documents days before the election.\"98 One former intelligence official told Foreign Policy that the evidence relied upon by the United States may be \"signatures\" used by Russian hacking groups, such as \"pieces of malicious code or the use of a particular server.\"99 Sources also point to the motivations of the purported bad actors, a common factor in the control and capabilities test. Whether the French State takes a similar approach that the US took in attributing the 2016 election interference to Russia based on \"technical indicators\" remains to be seen.\n### b) WannaCry Ransomware Attack\nIn May 2017, hundreds of thousands of computers were hijacked by a virus called \"WannaCry.\"100 The WannaCry virus acted as a ransomware, freezing computer files and demanding a ransom for their release. WannaCry impacted approximately 150 countries over the course of a weekend, and shut down hospitals in the United Kingdom.101 Analysts quickly noticed that a few lines of code used in the attack appeared in the hacking tools commonly used by the \"Lazarus\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2017/07/03/russia-suspect-in-ransomware-attacks-says-ukraine/#38e27e376b89.\n\ngroup,” the same group that the US blamed for the 2014 Sony attack. Whether States adopt this attribution analysis by private security firms, based on the same standard adopted by the US in 2014, will help determine if the control and capabilities test is, in fact, a developing *lex specialis*.\nc) APT 32\nResearches at cybersecurity company FireEye have identified an espionage group “aligned with Vietnamese state interests” as the “perpetrators of cyberattacks dating back as far as 2013[.]” This new report bases its loose attribution on the fact that APT32 has an interest in political influence and foreign governments, targets the private sector with ties to Vietnam, and has tactics that makes clear that APT32 operators are “well-resourced and supported as they use a large set of domains and IP addresses as command and control infrastructure.”\nIV. IMPACT OF TEST\nThe impact of the development State practice applying the control and capabilities test remains to be seen. There are, however, some demonstrable benefits and drawbacks to the control and capabilities approach. One benefit is easier attribution. By using the control and capabilities standard, as opposed to the effective control standard, offended States will have quicker recourse to attribution, and therefore quicker recourse to a lawful response. This benefit is also a downside. Quicker attribution can also lead to false positives. It is widely known within the cyber community that States can mask their true identity, and make it appear that the attack is originating in a separate State. This capability was recently disclosed in a set of Wikileaks disclosures called “Vault 7.”\nIt’s also unclear whether the State practice described above is being carried out with a sense of legal obligation, or political expediency. One drawback to the development of this test, and to attribution tests in cyberspace generally, has been the private nature in which States go about their research and attribution analysis. Without public statements of attribution, tied with statements of legal certainty, it will be difficult to have a conclusive determination as to whether the control and capabilities test has reached the level of customary international law.\nThat said, the effective control test is outdated as compared to the technological advances in cyberspace. States need to\nadopt a new standard in order to adapt with the tools available to States.\nV. CONCLUSION\nThe foregoing examples of State practice support the conclusion that imputed State responsibility for the unlawful cyber operations of non-State actors who are neither *de jure* nor *de facto* State organs is being assigned without rigid adherence to the “effective control” test. Again, this is just State practice demonstrating at least one element of determining State responsibility. State attribution under the new model is being assigned based on a control and capabilities test, examining motivations, geographic location, technical indicators, and relationship between the non-State actor and the State.\nThese State examples, of course, are not conclusive. This paper does not argue that such limited examples of State practice, alone, constitute a binding principle of customary international law. This State practice does, however, indicate that a *lex specialis* is forming that, if risen to the level of customary international law, would supplant the *lex generalis* “effective control” test, endorsed in Article 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility and Rule 17 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0. Such a change would radically alter the attribution models available in cyberspace.\n Ibid.\n Joe Uchill, “Espionage group ‘aligned with Vietnamese state interests’: report”, *The Hill* (May 15, 2017), available at http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/333404-espionage-group-aligned-with-vietnamese-state-interests-report; Nick Carr, “Cyber Espionage is Alive and Well: APT32 and the Threat to Global Corporations,” *FireEye* (May 14, 2017), available at https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/05/cyber-espionage-apt32.html.\n Carr, note 101."

Stockburger, Esq.\nDentons US LLP\nSan Diego, CA (USA)\npeter.stockburger@dentons.com\nKeywords—attribution; cyber; lex specialis; lex generalis; effective control\n## I. INTRODUCTION\nAttribution in cyberspace is one of the most difficult questions facing policy makers, lawyers, and jurists. Indeed, the first question often asked in the wake of a cyber incident is “who did it?” The answer to this question is often critical when dealing with the application of international law because it will dictate the rights and responsibilities of States both from an offensive and defensive perspective. Without proper attribution, for example, a State’s responsive capabilities are limited. Making matters worse, attribution is difficult to establish factually. Non-State actors often mask their identity, and State actors often hide their true intentions. The degree to which the international rules governing State attribution apply in cyberspace is therefore a matter of great public importance.\nIt is widely accepted amongst States and scholars that the rules of international State responsibility generally apply in cyberspace. Those rules, reflective of the *lex generalis*, provide that the acts of a State’s *de jure* and *de facto* organs are generally attributable to the State.² The internationally wrongful acts of non-State actors (who are neither *de jure* nor *de facto* State organs) may also be imputed to the State if the non-State actors operate on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of the State.³ This general rule relative to non-State actors, commonly referred to as the “effective control”⁴ test, is widely recognized as the *lex generalis*\ngoverning imputed State responsibility for the internationally wrongful acts of non-State actors. Accordingly, as the *lex generalis*, the rule does not vary “with the nature of the wrongful act in question” unless there is a “clearly expressed lex specialis.”⁵ The “effective control” test, as the *lex generalis*, therefore applies in cyberspace.⁶\nThis paper posits that a new *lex specialis* is, in fact, forming that, if risen to the level of customary international law, would supplant the *lex generalis* “effective control” test and allow for imputed State responsibility for the internationally wrongful cyber operations of non-State actors even in the absence of express direction or control. This new test, which this paper calls the “control and capabilities” test, would allow for the attribution of non-State actor cyber activity based on a multi-factored test, examining: (1) the relationship between the non-State actor and the State, if any; (2) the cyber methods used by the non-State actor and whether those methods are similar to the State; (3) the motivations of the two parties, if known; (4) the similarity in technology and/or code used by the two parties; (5) the technical capabilities of the two parties; and (6) geographic location. In other words, direction and control are\n978-1-5386-2379-4/17/$31.00 ©2017 IEEE\nnot the dispositive factors. The evidence supporting the development of this test can be seen in the practice of interested States since 2014. And if this test were to reach the level of customary international law, it would supplant the lex generalis rule of “effective control” and mark a significant shift in how actions may be attributed under the law of imputed State responsibility in cyberspace.7 Below is a summary of this developing test, and thoughts on how it may impact the overall corpus of international law in cyberspace.\n## II. ATTRIBUTION LEGAL FRAMEWORK\n### A. Law of State Responsibility\nThe law of State responsibility is premised on two elements: (1) whether the act or omission in question is internationally wrongful; and (2) whether the act or omission in question is attributable to the State.8 This paper only focuses on the latter as a normative question.9\n### B. Attribution Tests\n#### 1) Direct Attribution - De Jure and De Facto State Organs\nAs a general rule, a “State is responsible only for its own conduct, that is to say the conduct of persons acting, on whatever basis, on its behalf[.]”10 This includes acts:\ncarried out by [State] official organs, and also by persons or entities which are not formally recognized as official organs under internal law but which must nevertheless be equated with State organs because they are in a relationship of complete dependence on the State.11\nThese types of individuals and groups are commonly referred to as de jure and de facto State organs. Both are recognized under Articles 4-6 of the Articles on State Responsibility,12 and it is widely accepted that the conduct of de jure and de facto State organs are generally attributable to the State.13\n#### 2) Imputed Attribution - Control and Direction\nThe conduct of a non-State actor that is neither a de jure nor de facto State organ may also be attributable to the State\n“if the [non-State actor] is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, [the] State in carrying out the conduct[.]”14 This direction and control test, known as the “effective control” test, reflects the lex generalis as it pertains to imputed State responsibility for the conduct of non-State actors.\n##### a) Effective Control Test - Background\nThe “effective control” test was first outlined by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in its 1986 case concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua wherein the Court examined whether US control over Nicaraguan Contras was sufficient to impute the actions of the Contras to the US under international law. The Court made clear that the actions of non-State actors not totally dependent on the State (but who are nonetheless paid, financed and equipped by the State) would be attributed to the State only if it were established that the State “directed or enforced the perpetration” of the internationally wrongful acts in question.15 Under this “effective control” test, the Court determined that although the US was responsible for the general “planning, direction and support” given to the Contras, the US was not internationally responsible for the internationally wrongful actions of the Contras because “there [was] no clear evidence of the US having actually exercised such a degree of control in all fields as to justify treating the [Contras] as acting on its behalf.”16 This “effective control” test, reflected in Article 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility,17 was expressly endorsed by the International Group of Experts (IGE) in the recently published Tallinn Manual 2.0 as reflective of customary international law.18\n##### b) Overall Control Test Introduced\nThirteen years later, in 1999, a competing test known as the “overall control” test was introduced by the Appeals Chamber of the United Nations International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in its influential Tadić opinion. The tribunal rejected the “effective control” test, and instead applied an “overall control” test to determine the attribution of acts of hierarchically structured groups, such as a military unit or armed bands of irregulars or rebels under the jus in bello.19 In such circumstances, the tribunal noted, the State will be internationally responsible for the wrongful\n7 Nicaragua, note 4, at 109, 115; Congo, note 4, at 228; Bosnia Genocide, note 2, at 168-211.\n8 Articles on State Responsibility, note 3, at art. 2(a)-(b); Michael N.

The tribunal adopted this approach with hierarchically structured groups,²⁰ and limited its decision to the application of the jus in bello as it was determining the existence of an international armed conflict under the Fourth Geneva Convention of August 12, 1949.²¹ The “overall control” test is discussed in the commentaries to Article 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility, and is generally seen as a lower standard of attribution than the “effective control” test.²²\n## c) Effective Control Test Revisited\nThe ICJ revisited the “effective control” test in 2007 in the case concerning the Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. The Court criticized the ICTY’s “overall control” test as going beyond the ICTY’s jurisdiction, and being unsupported in State practice. The Court reaffirmed the customary status of the “effective control” test, and announced that the actions of the Republika Srpska and certain paramilitary groups known as the Scorpions, Red Berets, Tigers and White Eagles were not attributable to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) because there was insufficient evidence demonstrating that State instruction and direction was given with regard to each operation in which the alleged violations occurred, and not generally in respect of the overall actions taken by the persons or groups of persons having committed the violations.²³ Consequently, and controversially, the Court determined that the FRY could not be internationally responsible for the acts committed by the non-State actors in question, most notably for the massacres at Srebrenica.²⁴\n## d) Safe Harbor / Duty To Prevent\nThere has been additional State practice endorsing a theory for imputed State responsibility wherein the State in question harbors and provides material support to those who cause harm in another State. After the September 11, 2001 attacks, the US invoked its right to self-defense pursuant to Article 51 of the United Nations Charter on the premise that\nthe September 11 attacks constituted an “armed attack.”²⁵ The US attributed those attacks to the Taliban regime in Afghanistan because they were “made possible by the decision of the Taliban regime to allow the parts of Afghanistan that it controls to be used by this organization as a base of operation.”²⁶ The global community generally accepted the legality of this action.²⁷\nThis “safe harbor” principle is notable because it attributes the acts of a non-State actor to the State not based on direction or control, but based on an obligation otherwise understood as the duty to prevent trans-boundary harm and the “due diligence” principle as articulated in the 1941 Trial Smelter arbitration,²⁸ the ICJ’s Corfu Channel judgment,²⁹ the ICJ’s Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons,³⁰ and the ICJ’s Case Concerning Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project judgment.³¹ The “due diligence” principle has been applied to many areas of international law, including international environmental law,³² human rights law,³³ and State responsibility.³⁴ It is distinct from imputed State responsibility because due diligence is an “obligation of conduct rather than of result[.]”³⁵ The degree to\n²⁰ Ibid.\n²¹ Art. 2 of the Statute of the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991, S/RES/827 (1993) of 25 May 1993, Annex.\n²² Articles on State Responsibility, note 3, at art. 8, commentary (5) (noting it is a “matter for appreciation in each case whether particular conduct was or was not carried out under the control of a State, to such an extent that the conduct controlled should be attributed to it).\n²³ Bosnia Genocide, note 2, at 208.\n²⁴ Id. at 206-08.\n²⁵ UN Security Council, Letter Dated 7 October 2001 From the Permanent Representative of the United States of America to the United Nations Addressed to the President of the Security Council, UN Doc No S/2001/946 (2001).\n²⁶ Ibid.\n²⁷ See G.A.

The IGE recognized the tension between the “effective” and “overall” control tests in the 2013 Tallinn Manual when examining the *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello*,⁴⁰ but concluded the application of the “effective control” test in the context of peacetime operations in the revised 2017 Tallinn Manual 2.0.⁴¹ Specifically, Rule 17 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0, reflecting Article 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility, provides that cyber operations conducted by a non-State actor are attributable to a State when “engaged in pursuant to its instruction or under its direction or control[.].”⁴²\nBy this standard, the IGE notes that a State may, either by specific direction or by exercising control over a group, in effect assume responsibility for their conduct, with each case dependent on its own facts.⁴³ Instruction within this context “refers most typically to situations in which a non-State actor functions as a State’s auxiliary.”⁴⁴ And a State is in “effective control” of a particular cyber operation by a non-State actor whenever it is the State that “determines the execution and course of the specific operation and the cyber activity engaged in by the non-State actor is an ‘integral part of that operation.’ Effective control includes both the ability to cause constituent activities of the operation to occur, as well as the ability to order the cessation of those that are underway.”⁴⁵\n## III. THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CONTROL AND CAPABILITIES TEST\nIt is thus well accepted that the “effective control” test represents the *lex generalis* governing the attribution of internationally wrongful conduct of non-State actors to the State. As the *lex generalis*, this test applies in all situations unless there is an express *lex specialis* providing otherwise.⁴⁶\nAs explained below, a review of State practice since 2014 reveals that a new *lex specialis* has, in fact, begun to form that would, if risen to the level of customary international law, supplant the *lex generalis* “effective control” test in cyberspace. This state practice involves States that have publicly attributed the cyber operations of non-State actors to States on the basis the basis of a multitude of factors, including but not limited to (1) the relationship between the non-State actor and the State, if any; (2) the cyber methods used by the non-State actor and whether those methods are similar to the State; (3) the motivations of the two parties, if known; (4) the similarity in technology and/or code used by the two parties; (5) the technical capabilities of the two parties; and (6) geographic location. Direction and control have not been dispositive factors. Although the second element for the development of custom, that is opinio juris, has been lacking thus far, the development of the *actus* State practice is of note.\n## A. Development of Custom\nCustomary international law is defined as the general practice of States accepted as law.⁴⁷ This definition comes from Article 38(1)(b) of the ICJ’s Statute, and encompasses two elements: (1) long-term, widespread practice by interested\n³⁵ David Freestone, *Advisory Opinion on the Seabed Disputes Chamber of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea on ‘Responsibilities and Obligations of States Sponsoring Persons and Entities with Respect to Activities in the Area*, 15 AMER.

State Practice Supporting The Control and Capabilities Test\n### 1) Pre-2014 Attribution Based on Control and Capabilities Test\nPrior to 2014, public attribution of internationally wrongful cyber operations was virtually non-existent. Private attribution, however, began to follow the control and capabilities factors set forth above as early as 2007. In 2007, after Estonia was hit with a wave of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks after deciding to remove a Soviet-era bronze soldier monument from its location in central Tallinn, Estonia, for example, a number of scholars and jurists privately attributed the attacks to Russia.⁵⁰ Evidence showed that the “hackers claimed to be Russian, the tools to hack and deface were contained in Russian websites and chatrooms, and the attacks picked a day of” significance to most Russians.⁵¹ Moreover, although the botnets used computers from different countries, at least some of the attacks “originated from Russian IP (internet protocol) addresses, including those of state institutions.”⁵²\nIn 2008, a similar scenario played out with Russia being privately blamed for carrying out a DDoS attack during its 2008 conflict with Georgia⁵³ wherein fifty-four “web sites in Georgia related to communications, finance, and the government” were attacked⁵⁴ “immediately before and continu[ing] throughout the armed conflict between” the two States.⁵⁵ All signs pointed to a Russian hacker community as\nthe responsible perpetrator,⁵⁶ including the fact that coordination for the attacks took place in the Russian language, and in Russian or Russia-related “fora.”⁵⁷\nLikewise, despite confirmation from State actors regarding the 2010 Stuxnet virus,⁵⁸ and although it has been reported that the Stuxnet virus was formally developed under US administrations,⁵⁹ no formal attribution was declared.\nAdditional pre-2014 activity included the 2013, and controversial Mandiant Report which attributed APT1 attacks to the Chinese State based on the geographic location of the bad actors, the methods and capabilities of the actors in question, and the motivations of the Chinese State.\n### 2) Sony 2014\nIt was not until 2014 that a State first publicly attributed what appeared to be a non-State actor’s unlawful cyber operations to a State. In 2014, Sony Pictures was hit with a highly publicized DDoS attack of unknown proportions after its computer systems were compromised by suspected North Korean tied hackers.⁶⁰ The attack surrounded the release of the movie “The Interview” about the fictional assassination of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. Prior to the movie’s release, the spokesperson for North Korea’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement “that the country would take ‘a decisive and merciless countermeasure’ if the United States’ government permitted Sony to make its planned Christmas release of the comedy.”⁶¹ In November, Sony’s computer systems were compromised, and embarrassing e-mail communications from its CEO were leaked online.

In response, the US imposed economic sanctions on North Korea, further reflecting the attribution of the attack to the North Korean State. North Korea also reportedly suffered widespread Internet outages in December 2014, raising the possibility that countermeasures were taken.\n## 3) Iran - 2016\nIn 2016, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) publicly attributed the cyber operations of private non-State actors to Iran based on a control and capabilities analysis.⁶⁷ In March 2016, a grand jury in the Southern District of New York criminally indicted seven Iranian individuals who were employed by two Iran-based computer companies, ITSec Team and Mersad Company. The individuals were charged with performing “work on behalf of the Iranian Government, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, on\ncomputer hacking charges related to their involvement in an extensive campaign of over 176 days of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.”⁶⁸ The seven individuals were alleged to have “launched DDoS attacks against 46 victims, primarily in the U.S. financial sector, between late 2011 and mid-2013.”⁶⁹ These attacks purportedly disabled victim bank websites, prevented customers from accessing their accounts online, and cost tens of millions of dollars in damage.⁷⁰ One of the defendants was also charged with obtaining unauthorized access into the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition systems of the Bowman Dam located in upstate New York in August and September 2013.⁷¹ In releasing the indictment, the US stated:\nLike past nation state-sponsored hackers, these defendants and their backers believed that they could attack our critical infrastructure without consequence, from behind a veil of cyber anonymity[.] This indictment once against shows there is no such veil - we can and will expose malicious cyber hackers engaging in unlawful acts that threaten our public safety and national security.⁷²\nIn the indictment, the US attributed the actions of the seven private individuals to the Iranian State because the individuals purportedly “performed work on behalf of” the Iranian Government, as evidenced by the scope and capabilities of their cyber operations.⁷³ In the press release accompanying the indictment, the US Department of Justice noted these individuals had “ties” to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard.⁷⁴ And without explaining the instruction from the State involved, the indictment alleged Ahmad Fathi, the purported leader of the defendants, was “responsible for managing computer intrusion and cyber projects being conducted on behalf of the Government of Iran.”⁷⁵ The indictment also alleged that defendant Amin Shokoh received credit for his work from the Iranian Government towards completion of his mandatory military service in Iran.⁷⁶ These allegations did not discuss direction or control, and instead focused on means and methods, capabilities, and motivations of the perpetrators in effectuating State attribution.\n## 4) Russia - 2016 / 2017\n⁶³ David E.

However, public attribution of these activities to [Russian civilian and military intelligence Services] is supported by technical indicators from the U.S. Intelligence Community, DHS, FBI, the private sector, and other entities.86\nAccording to the Joint Report, those “technical indicators” prove the threat actors are “likely associated” with the Russian State.87\nThe Joint Report was widely panned by industry experts for its purported failure to provide a “smoking gun” that showed Russian control or direction over the DNC intrusion, and for using false technical indicators linking the purported threat actors to the Russian State.88 But the focus of the Joint Report was not on express direction or control. It instead focused on capabilities, methods, motivations and technical indicators, reflecting the development of the control and capabilities test as the growing lex specialis for imputed State attribution for the unlawful cyber operations of non-State actors.\nb) US Attribution - Yahoo Breach\nIn March 2017, the US DOJ announced the indictments of five individuals, including two Russian officials, for “computer hacking, economic espionage and other criminal offenses in connection with a conspiracy, beginning in January 2014, to access Yahoo’s network and the contents of\n77 Dmitri Alperovitch, Bears in the Midst: Intrusion into the Democratic National Committee, CrowdStrike Blog (June 15, 2016), available at https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/bears-midst-intrusion-democratic-national-committee/.\n78 Ibid.\n79 Ibid.\n80 Ibid.\n81 Ibid.\n82 Director of National Intelligence, “Joint Statement from the Department of Homeland Security and Office of the Director of National Intelligence on Election Security,” Joint Statement (Oct. 7, 2016), available here https://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/215-press-releases-2016/1423-joint-dhs-odni-election-security-statement.\n83 Ibid.\n84 Ibid.\n85 Ibid.\n86 DHS &amp; FBI, “GRIZZLY STEPPE - Russian Malicious Cyber Activity”, Joint Analysis Report (Dec. 29, 2016), available here https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/JAR_16-20296A_GRIZZLY%20STEPPE-2016-1229.pdf.\n87 Ibid.\n88 See, e.g., Kelly Jackson Higgins, “DHS-FBI Report Shows Russian Attribution’s A Bear”, Dark Reading (Jan. 4, 2017), available at http://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/dhs-fbi-report-shows-russian-attributions-a-bear/d/d-id/1327828; Justin Raimodo, “The Evidence That Russia Hacked The DNC Is Collapsing”, Zero Hedge (Mar. 26, 2017), available at http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-03-25/; Shaun Waterman, “DHS slammed for report on Russian hackers”, Cyber Scoop (Jan. 6, 2017), available at https://www.cyberscoop.com/dhs-election-hacking-grizzly-steppe-iocs/.\nwebmail accounts.\"89 In the indictment, the DOJ alleged that \"officers of the Russian Federal Security Service\" and \"intelligence and law enforcement agency of the Russian Federation\" \"conspired together and with each other to protect, direct, facilitate, and pay criminal hackers to collect information through computer intrusions in the United States and elsewhere.\"90 The evidence cited to link the Russian officials to the \"criminal hackers\", however, was less than express direction and control: (1) the criminal hackers obtained evidence of \"information of predictable interest to the FSB\", including access to \"Russian journalists and politicians critical of the Russian government\" (i.e., motivations); (2) the geographic location of the criminal hackers; (3) the ability of the Russian State to \"arrest and prosecute\" the criminal hackers and its failure to do so; and (4) threadbare allegations that the Russian officials provided direction to the criminal hackers.91 The focus therefore was on motivations, capabilities and geographic proximity, in combination with conclusory allegations of State direction. The test applied was not the \"effective control\" test. The DOJ focused on control and capabilities.\n## c) Ukraine Attribution - NotPetya Ransomware\nIn June 2017, a particularly devastating strain of ransomware began infecting PC's around the world.92 The \"blast radius\" of the attack was in Ukraine, where 60% of the infected machines were located.93 Other infected machines belonged to international companies that operate within Ukraine.94 A group called \"GoldenEye\" claimed responsibility for the attack.95\n89 US Dep't of Justice, \"U.S. Charges Russian FSB Officers and Their Criminal Conspirators for Hacking Yahoo and Millions of Email Accounts: FSB Officers Protected, Directed, Facilitated and Paid Criminal Hackers\", Press Release (Mar. 15, 2017), available at https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-charges-russian-fsb-officers-and-their-criminal-conspirators-hacking-yahoo-and-millions; Ellen Nakashima, \"Justice Department charges Russian spies and criminal hackers in Yahoo intrusion\", The Washington Post (Mar. 15, 2017) available at https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/justice-department-charging-russian-spies-and-criminal-hackers-for-yahoo-intrusion/2017/03/15/64b98e32-0911-11e7-93dc-00f9bdd74ed1_story.html?utm_term=.d0a7e78e2d2d.\n90 United States of America v.

The United States warned French authorities that Russian-based hackers were targeting France's computer infrastructure in the run-up to the presidential election, a \"revelation likely to intensify speculation that Moscow was responsible for dumping a huge trove of hacked documents days before the election.\"98 One former intelligence official told Foreign Policy that the evidence relied upon by the United States may be \"signatures\" used by Russian hacking groups, such as \"pieces of malicious code or the use of a particular server.\"99 Sources also point to the motivations of the purported bad actors, a common factor in the control and capabilities test. Whether the French State takes a similar approach that the US took in attributing the 2016 election interference to Russia based on \"technical indicators\" remains to be seen.\n### b) WannaCry Ransomware Attack\nIn May 2017, hundreds of thousands of computers were hijacked by a virus called \"WannaCry.\"100 The WannaCry virus acted as a ransomware, freezing computer files and demanding a ransom for their release.

IMPACT OF TEST\nThe impact of the development State practice applying the control and capabilities test remains to be seen. There are, however, some demonstrable benefits and drawbacks to the control and capabilities approach. One benefit is easier attribution. By using the control and capabilities standard, as opposed to the effective control standard, offended States will have quicker recourse to attribution, and therefore quicker recourse to a lawful response. This benefit is also a downside. Quicker attribution can also lead to false positives. It is widely known within the cyber community that States can mask their true identity, and make it appear that the attack is originating in a separate State. This capability was recently disclosed in a set of Wikileaks disclosures called “Vault 7.”\nIt’s also unclear whether the State practice described above is being carried out with a sense of legal obligation, or political expediency. One drawback to the development of this test, and to attribution tests in cyberspace generally, has been the private nature in which States go about their research and attribution analysis. Without public statements of attribution, tied with statements of legal certainty, it will be difficult to have a conclusive determination as to whether the control and capabilities test has reached the level of customary international law.\nThat said, the effective control test is outdated as compared to the technological advances in cyberspace. States need to\nadopt a new standard in order to adapt with the tools available to States.\nV. CONCLUSION\nThe foregoing examples of State practice support the conclusion that imputed State responsibility for the unlawful cyber operations of non-State actors who are neither *de jure* nor *de facto* State organs is being assigned without rigid adherence to the “effective control” test. Again, this is just State practice demonstrating at least one element of determining State responsibility. State attribution under the new model is being assigned based on a control and capabilities test, examining motivations, geographic location, technical indicators, and relationship between the non-State actor and the State.\nThese State examples, of course, are not conclusive. This paper does not argue that such limited examples of State practice, alone, constitute a binding principle of customary international law. This State practice does, however, indicate that a *lex specialis* is forming that, if risen to the level of customary international law, would supplant the *lex generalis* “effective control” test, endorsed in Article 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility and Rule 17 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0. Such a change would radically alter the attribution models available in cyberspace.\n¹⁰² Ibid.\n¹⁰³ Joe Uchill, “Espionage group ‘aligned with Vietnamese state interests’: report”, *The Hill* (May 15, 2017), available at http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/333404-espionage-group-aligned-with-vietnamese-state-interests-report; Nick Carr, “Cyber Espionage is Alive and Well: APT32 and the Threat to Global Corporations,” *FireEye* (May 14, 2017), available at https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/05/cyber-espionage-apt32.html.\n¹⁰⁴ Carr, note 101."

Stockburger, Esq.\nDentons US LLP\nSan Diego, CA (USA)\npeter.stockburger@dentons.com\nKeywords—attribution; cyber; lex specialis; lex generalis; effective control\n## I. INTRODUCTION\nAttribution in cyberspace is one of the most difficult questions facing policy makers, lawyers, and jurists. Indeed, the first question often asked in the wake of a cyber incident is “who did it?” The answer to this question is often critical when dealing with the application of international law because it will dictate the rights and responsibilities of States both from an offensive and defensive perspective. Without proper attribution, for example, a State’s responsive capabilities are limited. Making matters worse, attribution is difficult to establish factually. Non-State actors often mask their identity, and State actors often hide their true intentions. The degree to which the international rules governing State attribution apply in cyberspace is therefore a matter of great public importance.\nIt is widely accepted amongst States and scholars that the rules of international State responsibility generally apply in cyberspace. Those rules, reflective of the *lex generalis*, provide that the acts of a State’s *de jure* and *de facto* organs are generally attributable to the State.² The internationally wrongful acts of non-State actors (who are neither *de jure* nor *de facto* State organs) may also be imputed to the State if the non-State actors operate on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of the State.³ This general rule relative to non-State actors, commonly referred to as the “effective control”⁴ test, is widely recognized as the *lex generalis*\ngoverning imputed State responsibility for the internationally wrongful acts of non-State actors. Accordingly, as the *lex generalis*, the rule does not vary “with the nature of the wrongful act in question” unless there is a “clearly expressed lex specialis.”⁵ The “effective control” test, as the *lex generalis*, therefore applies in cyberspace.⁶\nThis paper posits that a new *lex specialis* is, in fact, forming that, if risen to the level of customary international law, would supplant the *lex generalis* “effective control” test and allow for imputed State responsibility for the internationally wrongful cyber operations of non-State actors even in the absence of express direction or control. This new test, which this paper calls the “control and capabilities” test, would allow for the attribution of non-State actor cyber activity based on a multi-factored test, examining: (1) the relationship between the non-State actor and the State, if any; (2) the cyber methods used by the non-State actor and whether those methods are similar to the State; (3) the motivations of the two parties, if known; (4) the similarity in technology and/or code used by the two parties; (5) the technical capabilities of the two parties; and (6) geographic location. In other words, direction and control are\n978-1-5386-2379-4/17/$31.00 ©2017 IEEE\nnot the dispositive factors. The evidence supporting the development of this test can be seen in the practice of interested States since 2014. And if this test were to reach the level of customary international law, it would supplant the lex generalis rule of “effective control” and mark a significant shift in how actions may be attributed under the law of imputed State responsibility in cyberspace.7 Below is a summary of this developing test, and thoughts on how it may impact the overall corpus of international law in cyberspace.\n## II. ATTRIBUTION LEGAL FRAMEWORK\n### A. Law of State Responsibility\nThe law of State responsibility is premised on two elements: (1) whether the act or omission in question is internationally wrongful; and (2) whether the act or omission in question is attributable to the State.8 This paper only focuses on the latter as a normative question.9\n### B. Attribution Tests\n#### 1) Direct Attribution - De Jure and De Facto State Organs\nAs a general rule, a “State is responsible only for its own conduct, that is to say the conduct of persons acting, on whatever basis, on its behalf[.]”10 This includes acts:\ncarried out by [State] official organs, and also by persons or entities which are not formally recognized as official organs under internal law but which must nevertheless be equated with State organs because they are in a relationship of complete dependence on the State.11\nThese types of individuals and groups are commonly referred to as de jure and de facto State organs. Both are recognized under Articles 4-6 of the Articles on State Responsibility,12 and it is widely accepted that the conduct of de jure and de facto State organs are generally attributable to the State.13\n#### 2) Imputed Attribution - Control and Direction\nThe conduct of a non-State actor that is neither a de jure nor de facto State organ may also be attributable to the State\n“if the [non-State actor] is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, [the] State in carrying out the conduct[.]”14 This direction and control test, known as the “effective control” test, reflects the lex generalis as it pertains to imputed State responsibility for the conduct of non-State actors.\n##### a) Effective Control Test - Background\nThe “effective control” test was first outlined by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in its 1986 case concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua wherein the Court examined whether US control over Nicaraguan Contras was sufficient to impute the actions of the Contras to the US under international law. The Court made clear that the actions of non-State actors not totally dependent on the State (but who are nonetheless paid, financed and equipped by the State) would be attributed to the State only if it were established that the State “directed or enforced the perpetration” of the internationally wrongful acts in question.15 Under this “effective control” test, the Court determined that although the US was responsible for the general “planning, direction and support” given to the Contras, the US was not internationally responsible for the internationally wrongful actions of the Contras because “there [was] no clear evidence of the US having actually exercised such a degree of control in all fields as to justify treating the [Contras] as acting on its behalf.”16 This “effective control” test, reflected in Article 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility,17 was expressly endorsed by the International Group of Experts (IGE) in the recently published Tallinn Manual 2.0 as reflective of customary international law.18\n##### b) Overall Control Test Introduced\nThirteen years later, in 1999, a competing test known as the “overall control” test was introduced by the Appeals Chamber of the United Nations International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in its influential Tadić opinion. The tribunal rejected the “effective control” test, and instead applied an “overall control” test to determine the attribution of acts of hierarchically structured groups, such as a military unit or armed bands of irregulars or rebels under the jus in bello.19 In such circumstances, the tribunal noted, the State will be internationally responsible for the wrongful\n\n## c) Effective Control Test Revisited\nThe ICJ revisited the “effective control” test in 2007 in the case concerning the Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. The Court criticized the ICTY’s “overall control” test as going beyond the ICTY’s jurisdiction, and being unsupported in State practice. The Court reaffirmed the customary status of the “effective control” test, and announced that the actions of the Republika Srpska and certain paramilitary groups known as the Scorpions, Red Berets, Tigers and White Eagles were not attributable to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) because there was insufficient evidence demonstrating that State instruction and direction was given with regard to each operation in which the alleged violations occurred, and not generally in respect of the overall actions taken by the persons or groups of persons having committed the violations.²³ Consequently, and controversially, the Court determined that the FRY could not be internationally responsible for the acts committed by the non-State actors in question, most notably for the massacres at Srebrenica.²⁴\n## d) Safe Harbor / Duty To Prevent\nThere has been additional State practice endorsing a theory for imputed State responsibility wherein the State in question harbors and provides material support to those who cause harm in another State. After the September 11, 2001 attacks, the US invoked its right to self-defense pursuant to Article 51 of the United Nations Charter on the premise that\nthe September 11 attacks constituted an “armed attack.”²⁵ The US attributed those attacks to the Taliban regime in Afghanistan because they were “made possible by the decision of the Taliban regime to allow the parts of Afghanistan that it controls to be used by this organization as a base of operation.”²⁶ The global community generally accepted the legality of this action.²⁷\nThis “safe harbor” principle is notable because it attributes the acts of a non-State actor to the State not based on direction or control, but based on an obligation otherwise understood as the duty to prevent trans-boundary harm and the “due diligence” principle as articulated in the 1941 Trial Smelter arbitration,²⁸ the ICJ’s Corfu Channel judgment,²⁹ the ICJ’s Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons,³⁰ and the ICJ’s Case Concerning Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project judgment.³¹ The “due diligence” principle has been applied to many areas of international law, including international environmental law,³² human rights law,³³ and State responsibility.³⁴ It is distinct from imputed State responsibility because due diligence is an “obligation of conduct rather than of result[.]”³⁵ The degree to\n²⁰ Ibid.\n²¹ Art. 2 of the Statute of the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991, S/RES/827 (1993) of 25 May 1993, Annex.\n²² Articles on State Responsibility, note 3, at art. 8, commentary (5) (noting it is a “matter for appreciation in each case whether particular conduct was or was not carried out under the control of a State, to such an extent that the conduct controlled should be attributed to it).\n²³ Bosnia Genocide, note 2, at 208.\n²⁴ Id. at 206-08.\n²⁵ UN Security Council, Letter Dated 7 October 2001 From the Permanent Representative of the United States of America to the United Nations Addressed to the President of the Security Council, UN Doc No S/2001/946 (2001).\n²⁶ Ibid.\n²⁷ See G.A.

The IGE recognized the tension between the “effective” and “overall” control tests in the 2013 Tallinn Manual when examining the *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello*,⁴⁰ but concluded the application of the “effective control” test in the context of peacetime operations in the revised 2017 Tallinn Manual 2.0.⁴¹ Specifically, Rule 17 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0, reflecting Article 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility, provides that cyber operations conducted by a non-State actor are attributable to a State when “engaged in pursuant to its instruction or under its direction or control[.].”⁴²\nBy this standard, the IGE notes that a State may, either by specific direction or by exercising control over a group, in effect assume responsibility for their conduct, with each case dependent on its own facts.⁴³ Instruction within this context “refers most typically to situations in which a non-State actor functions as a State’s auxiliary.”⁴⁴ And a State is in “effective control” of a particular cyber operation by a non-State actor whenever it is the State that “determines the execution and course of the specific operation and the cyber activity engaged in by the non-State actor is an ‘integral part of that operation.’ Effective control includes both the ability to cause constituent activities of the operation to occur, as well as the ability to order the cessation of those that are underway.”⁴⁵\n## III. THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CONTROL AND CAPABILITIES TEST\nIt is thus well accepted that the “effective control” test represents the *lex generalis* governing the attribution of internationally wrongful conduct of non-State actors to the State. As the *lex generalis*, this test applies in all situations unless there is an express *lex specialis* providing otherwise.⁴⁶\nAs explained below, a review of State practice since 2014 reveals that a new *lex specialis* has, in fact, begun to form that would, if risen to the level of customary international law, supplant the *lex generalis* “effective control” test in cyberspace. This state practice involves States that have publicly attributed the cyber operations of non-State actors to States on the basis the basis of a multitude of factors, including but not limited to (1) the relationship between the non-State actor and the State, if any; (2) the cyber methods used by the non-State actor and whether those methods are similar to the State; (3) the motivations of the two parties, if known; (4) the similarity in technology and/or code used by the two parties; (5) the technical capabilities of the two parties; and (6) geographic location. Direction and control have not been dispositive factors. Although the second element for the development of custom, that is opinio juris, has been lacking thus far, the development of the *actus* State practice is of note.\n## A. Development of Custom\nCustomary international law is defined as the general practice of States accepted as law.⁴⁷ This definition comes from Article 38(1)(b) of the ICJ’s Statute, and encompasses two elements: (1) long-term, widespread practice by interested\n³⁵ David Freestone, *Advisory Opinion on the Seabed Disputes Chamber of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea on ‘Responsibilities and Obligations of States Sponsoring Persons and Entities with Respect to Activities in the Area*, 15 AMER.

State Practice Supporting The Control and Capabilities Test\n### 1) Pre-2014 Attribution Based on Control and Capabilities Test\nPrior to 2014, public attribution of internationally wrongful cyber operations was virtually non-existent. Private attribution, however, began to follow the control and capabilities factors set forth above as early as 2007. In 2007, after Estonia was hit with a wave of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks after deciding to remove a Soviet-era bronze soldier monument from its location in central Tallinn, Estonia, for example, a number of scholars and jurists privately attributed the attacks to Russia.⁵⁰ Evidence showed that the “hackers claimed to be Russian, the tools to hack and deface were contained in Russian websites and chatrooms, and the attacks picked a day of” significance to most Russians.⁵¹ Moreover, although the botnets used computers from different countries, at least some of the attacks “originated from Russian IP (internet protocol) addresses, including those of state institutions.”⁵²\nIn 2008, a similar scenario played out with Russia being privately blamed for carrying out a DDoS attack during its 2008 conflict with Georgia⁵³ wherein fifty-four “web sites in Georgia related to communications, finance, and the government” were attacked⁵⁴ “immediately before and continu[ing] throughout the armed conflict between” the two States.⁵⁵ All signs pointed to a Russian hacker community as\nthe responsible perpetrator,⁵⁶ including the fact that coordination for the attacks took place in the Russian language, and in Russian or Russia-related “fora.”⁵⁷\nLikewise, despite confirmation from State actors regarding the 2010 Stuxnet virus,⁵⁸ and although it has been reported that the Stuxnet virus was formally developed under US administrations,⁵⁹ no formal attribution was declared.\nAdditional pre-2014 activity included the 2013, and controversial Mandiant Report which attributed APT1 attacks to the Chinese State based on the geographic location of the bad actors, the methods and capabilities of the actors in question, and the motivations of the Chinese State.\n### 2) Sony 2014\nIt was not until 2014 that a State first publicly attributed what appeared to be a non-State actor’s unlawful cyber operations to a State. In 2014, Sony Pictures was hit with a highly publicized DDoS attack of unknown proportions after its computer systems were compromised by suspected North Korean tied hackers.⁶⁰ The attack surrounded the release of the movie “The Interview” about the fictional assassination of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. Prior to the movie’s release, the spokesperson for North Korea’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement “that the country would take ‘a decisive and merciless countermeasure’ if the United States’ government permitted Sony to make its planned Christmas release of the comedy.”⁶¹ In November, Sony’s computer systems were compromised, and embarrassing e-mail communications from its CEO were leaked online. A group calling itself the “Guardians of Peace” claimed responsibility for the attack.⁶²\nUnbeknownst to North Korea, years earlier US officials gained access to the North Korean cyber infrastructure and implanted malicious code to track North Korean operations, allowing them to identify certain IP addresses that were being\n⁴⁸ Lynn Loschin, *The Persistent Objector and Customary Human Rights Law: A Proposed Analytical Framework*, 2 U.C.

In response, the US imposed economic sanctions on North Korea, further reflecting the attribution of the attack to the North Korean State. North Korea also reportedly suffered widespread Internet outages in December 2014, raising the possibility that countermeasures were taken.\n## 3) Iran - 2016 In 2016, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) publicly attributed the cyber operations of private non-State actors to Iran based on a control and capabilities analysis.⁶⁷ In March 2016, a grand jury in the Southern District of New York criminally indicted seven Iranian individuals who were employed by two Iran-based computer companies, ITSec Team and Mersad Company. The individuals were charged with performing “work on behalf of the Iranian Government, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, on computer hacking charges related to their involvement in an extensive campaign of over 176 days of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.”⁶⁸ The seven individuals were alleged to have “launched DDoS attacks against 46 victims, primarily in the U.S. financial sector, between late 2011 and mid-2013.”⁶⁹ These attacks purportedly disabled victim bank websites, prevented customers from accessing their accounts online, and cost tens of millions of dollars in damage.⁷⁰ One of the defendants was also charged with obtaining unauthorized access into the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition systems of the Bowman Dam located in upstate New York in August and September 2013.⁷¹ In releasing the indictment, the US stated: Like past nation state-sponsored hackers, these defendants and their backers believed that they could attack our critical infrastructure without consequence, from behind a veil of cyber anonymity[.] This indictment once against shows there is no such veil - we can and will expose malicious cyber hackers engaging in unlawful acts that threaten our public safety and national security.⁷² In the indictment, the US attributed the actions of the seven private individuals to the Iranian State because the individuals purportedly “performed work on behalf of” the Iranian Government, as evidenced by the scope and capabilities of their cyber operations.⁷³ In the press release accompanying the indictment, the US Department of Justice noted these individuals had “ties” to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard.⁷⁴ And without explaining the instruction from the State involved, the indictment alleged Ahmad Fathi, the purported leader of the defendants, was “responsible for managing computer intrusion and cyber projects being conducted on behalf of the Government of Iran.”⁷⁵ The indictment also alleged that defendant Amin Shokoh received credit for his work from the Iranian Government towards completion of his mandatory military service in Iran.⁷⁶ These allegations did not discuss direction or control, and instead focused on means and methods, capabilities, and motivations of the perpetrators in effectuating State attribution.\n## 4) Russia - 2016 / 2017 ⁶³ David E.

However, public attribution of these activities to [Russian civilian and military intelligence Services] is supported by technical indicators from the U.S. Intelligence Community, DHS, FBI, the private sector, and other entities.86 According to the Joint Report, those “technical indicators” prove the threat actors are “likely associated” with the Russian State.87 The Joint Report was widely panned by industry experts for its purported failure to provide a “smoking gun” that showed Russian control or direction over the DNC intrusion, and for using false technical indicators linking the purported threat actors to the Russian State.88 But the focus of the Joint Report was not on express direction or control. It instead focused on capabilities, methods, motivations and technical indicators, reflecting the development of the control and capabilities test as the growing lex specialis for imputed State attribution for the unlawful cyber operations of non-State actors.\nb) US Attribution - Yahoo Breach In March 2017, the US DOJ announced the indictments of five individuals, including two Russian officials, for “computer hacking, economic espionage and other criminal offenses in connection with a conspiracy, beginning in January 2014, to access Yahoo’s network and the contents of webmail accounts.\"89 In the indictment, the DOJ alleged that\"officers of the Russian Federal Security Service\"and\"intelligence and law enforcement agency of the Russian Federation\"\"conspired together and with each other to protect, direct, facilitate, and pay criminal hackers to collect information through computer intrusions in the United States and elsewhere.\"90 The evidence cited to link the Russian officials to the\"criminal hackers\", however, was less than express direction and control: (1) the criminal hackers obtained evidence of\"information of predictable interest to the FSB\", including access to\"Russian journalists and politicians critical of the Russian government\"(i.e., motivations); (2) the geographic location of the criminal hackers; (3) the ability of the Russian State to\"arrest and prosecute\"the criminal hackers and its failure to do so; and (4) threadbare allegations that the Russian officials provided direction to the criminal hackers.91 The focus therefore was on motivations, capabilities and geographic proximity, in combination with conclusory allegations of State direction. The test applied was not the\"effective control\"test. The DOJ focused on control and capabilities.\n## c) Ukraine Attribution - NotPetya Ransomware In June 2017, a particularly devastating strain of ransomware began infecting PC's around the world.92 The\"blast radius\"of the attack was in Ukraine, where 60% of the infected machines were located.93 Other infected machines belonged to international companies that operate within Ukraine.94 A group called\"GoldenEye\"claimed responsibility for the attack.95 Ukraine's state security service, the SBU, publicly attributed the attack to the Russian State based on: (1) similar motivations between the suspected hackers and the Russian State; and (2) similar code used by the suspected hackers and other hackers Ukraine suspects are connected to the Russian State.96 The attribution was\"largely based on similarities in tools and techniques\"rather\"than any obvious, direct correlation.\"97 ## 5) Situations To Watch ### a) French Election Just prior to the most recent French presidential election, a number of sensitive e-mails from the Macron campaign were disclosed online. The United States warned French authorities that Russian-based hackers were targeting France's computer infrastructure in the run-up to the presidential election, a\"revelation likely to intensify speculation that Moscow was responsible for dumping a huge trove of hacked documents days before the election.\"98 One former intelligence official told Foreign Policy that the evidence relied upon by the United States may be\"signatures\"used by Russian hacking groups, such as\"pieces of malicious code or the use of a particular server.\"99 Sources also point to the motivations of the purported bad actors, a common factor in the control and capabilities test. Whether the French State takes a similar approach that the US took in attributing the 2016 election interference to Russia based on\"technical indicators\"remains to be seen.\n### b) WannaCry Ransomware Attack In May 2017, hundreds of thousands of computers were hijacked by a virus called\"WannaCry.\"100 The WannaCry virus acted as a ransomware, freezing computer files and demanding a ransom for their release. WannaCry impacted approximately 150 countries over the course of a weekend, and shut down hospitals in the United Kingdom.101 Analysts quickly noticed that a few lines of code used in the attack appeared in the hacking tools commonly used by the\"Lazarus https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2017/07/03/russia-suspect-in-ransomware-attacks-says-ukraine/#38e27e376b89.\n\ngroup,” the same group that the US blamed for the 2014 Sony attack.¹⁰² Whether States adopt this attribution analysis by private security firms, based on the same standard adopted by the US in 2014, will help determine if the control and capabilities test is, in fact, a developing *lex specialis*.\nc) APT 32 Researches at cybersecurity company FireEye have identified an espionage group “aligned with Vietnamese state interests” as the “perpetrators of cyberattacks dating back as far as 2013[.]”¹⁰³ This new report bases its loose attribution on the fact that APT32 has an interest in political influence and foreign governments, targets the private sector with ties to Vietnam, and has tactics that makes clear that APT32 operators are “well-resourced and supported as they use a large set of domains and IP addresses as command and control infrastructure.”¹⁰⁴ IV. IMPACT OF TEST The impact of the development State practice applying the control and capabilities test remains to be seen. There are, however, some demonstrable benefits and drawbacks to the control and capabilities approach. One benefit is easier attribution. By using the control and capabilities standard, as opposed to the effective control standard, offended States will have quicker recourse to attribution, and therefore quicker recourse to a lawful response. This benefit is also a downside. Quicker attribution can also lead to false positives. It is widely known within the cyber community that States can mask their true identity, and make it appear that the attack is originating in a separate State. This capability was recently disclosed in a set of Wikileaks disclosures called “Vault 7.”\nIt’s also unclear whether the State practice described above is being carried out with a sense of legal obligation, or political expediency. One drawback to the development of this test, and to attribution tests in cyberspace generally, has been the private nature in which States go about their research and attribution analysis. Without public statements of attribution, tied with statements of legal certainty, it will be difficult to have a conclusive determination as to whether the control and capabilities test has reached the level of customary international law.\nThat said, the effective control test is outdated as compared to the technological advances in cyberspace. States need to adopt a new standard in order to adapt with the tools available to States.\nV. CONCLUSION The foregoing examples of State practice support the conclusion that imputed State responsibility for the unlawful cyber operations of non-State actors who are neither *de jure* nor *de facto* State organs is being assigned without rigid adherence to the “effective control” test. Again, this is just State practice demonstrating at least one element of determining State responsibility. State attribution under the new model is being assigned based on a control and capabilities test, examining motivations, geographic location, technical indicators, and relationship between the non-State actor and the State.\nThese State examples, of course, are not conclusive. This paper does not argue that such limited examples of State practice, alone, constitute a binding principle of customary international law. This State practice does, however, indicate that a *lex specialis* is forming that, if risen to the level of customary international law, would supplant the *lex generalis* “effective control” test, endorsed in Article 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility and Rule 17 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0. Such a change would radically alter the attribution models available in cyberspace.\n¹⁰² Ibid.\n¹⁰³ Joe Uchill, “Espionage group ‘aligned with Vietnamese state interests’: report”, *The Hill* (May 15, 2017), available at http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/333404-espionage-group-aligned-with-vietnamese-state-interests-report; Nick Carr, “Cyber Espionage is Alive and Well: APT32 and the Threat to Global Corporations,” *FireEye* (May 14, 2017), available at https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/05/cyber-espionage-apt32.html.\n¹⁰⁴ Carr, note 101."
