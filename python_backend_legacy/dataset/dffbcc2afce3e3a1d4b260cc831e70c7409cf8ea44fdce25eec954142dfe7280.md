This paper revisits one of the most complex, most significant, and most mysterious digital covert actions of our time: a 2015 hack-and-leak case known among investigators as 'WikiSaudiLeaks' that so far has evaded attribution. We argue that WikiSaudiLeaks was not a stand-alone event, but a puzzle piece in a larger covert action campaign that involved advanced computer network exploitation, computer network attack, persistent deception, and a creative influence and disinformation effort. By disintegrating the larger event into its components, limited attribution becomes possible. We present the most detailed and comprehensive investigation of this case to date, attribute at least one component of the larger event to Iranian intelligence, and draw conceptional conclusions.\n## Introduction\nWhat was WikiSaudiLeaks and why was it so hard to attribute? This paper revisits one of the most complex, most significant, and most mysterious hack-and-leak puzzles of our time, a 2015 case known among investigators as ‘WikiSaudiLeaks'. The name refers to a mysterious website that surfaced and disseminated a major trove of files taken from the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The site's operators curiously claimed to have given the stolen documents to WikiLeaks, which claimed to have published 122,619 files by year's end.1 Subsequently, the material received high profile press coverage2 and became known as ‘The Saudi Cables'.\nWikiSaudiLeaks is an early example of a fundamental yet neglected attribution challenge.3 The event was not unified. The leak was part of a larger covert action campaign that involved advanced computer network exploitation, computer network attack, persistent deception, and a creative influence and disinformation effort.4 Yet so far neither scholars nor investigators from public or private sector have been able to conclusively attribute WikiSaudiLeaks to a specific threat actor -- in sharp contrast to most other comparable high-profile cases. Why? Because the leak does nothing less than challenge the established attribution paradigm. Hack-and-leak events are not widely discussed, and existing scholarship tends to focus on the interplay between intrusion and influence, while neglecting the consequences for attribution.5 What if a single attribution statement for digital covert action is not possible in the first place?\nWikiSaudiLeaks happened just as the goldilocks moment of digital covert action was ending: about a year before the Russian election interference in the United States, when bulk leaks were still seen as innocent expressions of transparency activism; and just two years after Mandiant's APT1 report,6 when the public attribution debate and capabilities were still in their infancy. Later events have motivated prolific scholarship, most prominently the Democratic National Committee (DNC) hack-and-leak.7 Yet some of the earliest and most significant instances of digital covert action remain\nunderstudied. It is time to revise the WikiSaudiLeaks case, and with it our understanding of attributing covert action.\nDigital covert action was on the rise throughout the 2010s, with hack-and-leak operations making up a significant share. This rise is enabled, but insufficiently explained, by technological change. A list of the major hits would include the late 2000s campaign known as Stuxnet; various wiping attacks against Iranian targets in 2011; the 2012 attack against Saudi Aramco and Rasgas; the neglected 2013 Britam Defence leak; the 2014 Sony Pictures Entertainment breach-and-leak;; two remarkable blackouts in Kiev in 2015 and 2016 as well as numerous other operations in Ukraine; the series of breach-and-leak operations against the US election in 2016; the mysterious series of Shadow Brokers leaks; the ransomware attacks known as Wannacry and NotPetya in 2017, one executed poorly, the other deceptively; the Viasat sabotage at the outset of the Ukraine War in 2022, and several more, some of them subtle, others as yet not publicly discussed. The continuous and dynamic nature of such offensive activity helped give rise to the concepts of ‘persistent engagement' and ‘defend forward' in the U.S. government, in which attribution played a key role. Indeed all these major cases had one core feature in common: governments, and in many cases independent researchers, have attributed them with high confidence or even certainty to specific adversaries.\nYet WikiSaudiLeaks stands out: not only has it not been attributed with confidence, the case is also curiously understudied. Both absences are all the more remarkable given that the covert action has generated an extraordinary amount of media coverage, with hundreds of press stories. The ensuing leak is also infamous as one of the most unethical and extreme so far, releasing unredacted cables that included full names and passport numbers of victims of torture and sexual abuse.\nWhy was the campaign not attributed so far? What can this curious case tell us about the past and future of attributing computer network operations in general and covert action specifically? And, of course: who was responsible for WikiSaudiLeaks?\nWe argue that by breaking down the larger event into its components, limited attribution becomes possible. To understand the saga that is Wikisaudileaks, investigators must first deconstruct what appears to be one coherent event into its constituent components: collection, disclosure, and amplification. Each component, counterintuitively, may not only come with a specific confidence level; it may also lead to diverging and separate attribution assessments. What looks like one operation at a first glance, with closer inspection may, in fact, collapse into multiple operations. The limited scholarship on this case has entertained the possibility of Russian involvement. We attribute at least one component of the larger covert action to Iran.\nAttribution is what states make of it. The outcome of an attributive investigation into a major computer network breach is determined by resources and political priorities, both on the side of the victim and on the side of the perpetrator. The perpetrator plans and equips a clandestine or covert operation to sustain deniability -- the victim plans and equips investigative and analytical outfits to take deniability away. The decision to publicly attribute, however, is correlated with such factors as incident severity, geopolitical circumstances, the intelligence available on the case, technical and operational capacity, and the political will of those involved in the attribution process. The WikiSaudiLeaks event puts the interaction of these indicators to test and underscores several gaps in the attribution process.\nThe paper proceeds in four steps. First we provide context to hack-and-leak operations in the Middle East by revisiting a neglected case from 2013, the earliest known instance of a hack-and-leak. We then offer a granular analysis of the WikiSaudiLeaks event, unmasking a related disinformation campaign that so far has not been covered in public or confidential reporting on the case. The third section reviews competing hypotheses in the attribution of WikiSaudiLeaks, followed by a framework for attribution of different stages of the covert action. We close by discussing the challenges of attribution of this particular case and, more broadly, digital covert action.\n##\nPrelude\nHack-and-leak operations have become ever more common since 2013, globally and especially in the Middle East. Around that time, a number of still mysterious leaks appeared that, in hindsight, could have been the work of intelligence agencies or contractors. The rise of the Anonymous movement as well as WikiLeaks offered unprecedented and obvious opportunities for covert operations. For a few years before the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the wider public and most journalists saw leaks as something positive first and foremost, as a way to create transparency and accountability -- not as an ideal cover for dirty tricks.\nThe breaches that enable the subsequent disclosure of stolen files may be initially done for espionage purposes, or the targeting may be driven by covert action objectives. The offenders' precise intentions are likely to remain obscure in the absence of direct intelligence access or declassified archival records. Historically, however, it was often ‘throwaway' -- files that no longer served a narrow intelligence purpose -- that were used to furnish the content for targeted leaks. Particularly noteworthy in this context were the Shaltai Boltai disclosures in Russia, and, a few months after WikiSaudiLeaks, in October 2015, the unattributed and fairly obscure ‘Turok' FSB leak. These operations often seek to undermine an adversary's decision-making, political cohesion, domestic public opinion, leaders, reputation, and alliances.\nWhat follows is a prelude to the WikiSaudiLeaks event, similarly involving a regional conflict in the Middle East, equally neglected, and inconclusively attributed.\n### Britam defense\nThe earliest known major case of hack-and-leak operations in the Middle East dates back to the early 2010s. The context for the case was the civil war in Syria. In July 2012, the Syrian government acknowledged that it had chemical weapons in its possession though it would never deploy such weapons against its own citizens but only against foreign intervention. In August, then-President Barack Obama warned the Bashar al-Assad regime that any use of chemical weapons in Syria would significantly change his calculus on a U.S. military response. The prospect of a U.S. strike in Syria concerned Assad's key allies, Iran and Russia, who have remained staunch supporters of the Syrian government since the beginning of the conflict in early 2011.\nThe first allegation of use of chemical weapons in Syria was reported in the city of Homs on 23 December 2012. The news rippled through the region and beyond. On 15 January 2013, an anonymous source alleged to Foreign Policy that the State Department had compelling evidence to attribute the chemical attack to the Syrian military. These unverified, controversial claims raised speculations that a U.S. military strike in Syria might be imminent.\nThen, on 22 January, a mysterious post appeared on Pastebin, a widely used disclosure and documentation platform, titled ‘Millitary server hacked. Confidential data!‘ An entity calling itself ‘JAsIrX' posted a short note in broken English, about 130 words, with no fewer than 51 URLs to file-sharing sites. The note was crude, and claimed that Britam Defence, a UK-based military contractor, ‘killed Arabs in Iraq and plans to invade in Iran and Syria'.\nShortly after, around 24 January, a report appeared on the obscure site cyberwarnews[.]info, claiming that Britam had been hacked. On 28 January 2013, conspiracy theory websites started covering the leak. The niche site whatdoesitmean[.]com headlined: ‘Obama Plan for World War III Stuns Russia'. That same day Infowars titled: ‘Hacked Emails Reveal “Washington-Approved” Plan to Stage Chemical Weapons Attack in Syria'.\nThe following day the story went mainstream. The Daily Mail, one of the UK's most-read tabloids, blasted: ‘U.S. “backed plan to launch chemical weapon attack on Syria and blame it on Assad's regime”'. The report in the Mail cited an email exchange from the previous month, allegedly among a group of senior managers at Britam. The exchange suspiciously mentioned a proposal that Britam would supply chemical weapons to Syria, while posing as Russian mercenaries, in exchange\nfor a significant amount of money. The Daily Mail in turn linked to the initial report in Cyber War News that took the leak at face value.\nBritam, in fact, was targeted by a successful hack-leak-forge operation. An unknown attacker had breached Britam's email, likely in November 2012. On January 22 the perpetrators, calling themselves ‘JAsIrX', started posting internal documents from Britam on Pastebin. One email exchange from October 2012 purported to link Britam to a military training project in Saudi Arabia to increase readiness for a possible strike by Iran. Another exchange claimed a U.S.-backed proposal to Britam to ‘deliver a CW to Homs' and deploy its Ukrainian personnel to pose as Russian mercenaries\nThe fabricated incriminating emails appeared to have been sent two months apart from one another; yet both digital artefacts shared the same unique message identity number, and had the exact same ‘sent' timestamp, at 23:57:18. Similarly, the documents pertaining to the Saudi military project were created and modified in short succession on Friday, 18 January 2013 at 12:00 GMT. The suspicious content, combined with the suspicious metadata, makes it highly likely that these forged documents sought to falsely incriminate the company in a plot against the United States and Saudi Arabia.\nThe story immediately appeared on Press TV, the English language branch of the state-run broadcaster, Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB). Press TV took a hard anti-Western position, noting the timing as ‘the Syrian army forces have managed to clear the capital, Damascus and its surrounding areas of the militants and restore security'. Seeking renewed attention to the case, Fars News, a key media affiliate of Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), republished the allegations in August 2013, citing whatdoesitmean. Other Iranian hardliner news sites, notably Mehr News, echoed the recycled article, but the story did not gain much attention.\nAttribution in the case of the Britam hack-leak-forge remained vague. A Sunday Times article entertained the possibility of Iran's involvement, but offered no solid sourcing or evidence. There is limited public technical forensics available about the attack. But contextual and operational cues, such as Iran's high stakes in Syria and the unusual media coverage by state-affiliated outlets, support the Iran hypothesis.\nEither way, the incident was the first major hack-and-leak operation that involved a variety of state and nonstate actors in Middle East politics. Whoever was behind the operation had a vested interest in implicating the United States in the use of chemical weapons in Syria, and in detracting from the truth. The event unfolded in multiple stages. The perpetrator conducted a network intrusion and collected data on the target ahead of time, manipulated the data to take advantage of geopolitical developments in the region, and promptly released the stolen (and forged) materials to maximise the believability of the plot. These same features were also on display in the WikiSaudiLeaks operation that hit Saudi Arabia two years later. Similarly, both cases remain shrouded in mystery with no conclusive attribution.\nIn both events, adversarial actors were only beginning to flex technical resources to advance geopolitical motives through digital covert action. Inconclusive attribution in those early days extended the opportunity to the perpetrators to seek to subvert more significant targets. It was only a matter of time until major Western powers began to feel the burn at home.\n## WikiSaudiLeaks\nThe Yemen civil war was still fresh in March 2015. The Shi'ite Houthi rebels had taken over the capital city of Sanaa and ousted the Saudi-backed President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and its allies had launched a military offensive, Operation Decisive Storm, to counter the Iran-backed Houthi militias. Between March 26 and April 22, the Saudi-led airstrikes caused civil casualties and massive destruction across Yemen. The Saudi and Iranian interventions were, in some ways, only one episode in a long lineage of foreign interference in Yemen's affairs, some overt, others covert. Yet the escalating civil war offered the context for a new, unprecedented form of outside intervention -- one that remained shrouded in mystery for years.\nWikiSaudiLeaks unfolded in three episodes. First, a series of hacking incidents targeted both Iranian and Saudi-affiliated media outlets, suggesting patriotic hacker skirmishes on the margins of the Yemen conflict. The network intrusion soon reached the Saudi Ministry of Foreign affairs. Before long, in the second phase, troves of confidential cables from the Ministry were leaked to the public via WikiLeaks and other platforms. The third, and previously undiscussed, stage involved a disinformation campaign against a United Nations expert that Iran-affiliated media broadly promoted. The following sections offer a deep dive into these stages, outlining the technical, operational, and political context to each layer.\n### The hacks\nIn March and April 2015, a series of hacking incidents started drawing attention to the unfolding conflict in Yemen. On April 12, defacements appeared on the English Twitter and YouTube accounts of Iran's state-backed, Arabic news channel Al-Alam. The defacements included images of Saudi leadership, messages in support of Operation Decisive Storm, and a false claim that the Iran-backed Houthi leader was dead. Other tweets sent from Al-Alam's Twitter account disclosed a purported list of correspondents of Al-Alam. Both Al-Alam and SaharTV, another Iranian state-backed television channel, confirmed the incident and blamed it on Saudi hackers.\nAn anonymous, self-described hacking entity, @Cyber__Emotion claimed responsibility for the attacks on Twitter. The entity's earliest publicly-known activities date back to 2014, when an actor with the same handle took over official Twitter accounts of Saudi ministries of justice and finance, questioning these institutions' lack of concern for cybersecurity. In 2016, the group allegedly compromised the official account of the Saudi Minister of Education, criticising his performance and demanding improvement in the national educational system.\nOnly a day after the Al-Alam defacements, a previously unheard of hacking group Yemen Cyber Army defaced the Saudi-owned Arabic news site Al-Hayat on April 13. The defacement announcement displayed a picture of the Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and a provocative pro-Shi'ite message against the kingdom and its allies, threatening that their time would soon be up. In addition to the defacement, the attackers leaked the names, email addresses, and hashed passwords of Al-Hayat users and subscribers.\nIran's semi-official news agency, Fars News, was among the first outlets to react to the incident. Fars News published an ‘exclusive' coverage of the Al-Hayat defacement, attributing the attack to Yemen Cyber Army without offering any evidence about the identity or background of the group. Fars News also linked to the Yemen Cyber Army's announcements and files on Pastebin, which is frequently used by hackers to claim responsibility for website defacements.\nThe only posts disseminating the Pastebin announcements came from @QuickLeakOrg, the associated Twitter account of QuickLeak[.]net. QuickLeak is a fringe, now-defunct whistleblowing site used in 2013 by an Iranian hacker group Parastoo to promote their defacements activities. QuickLeak.net was registered under an Iranian name -- the same person had also registered Zone-hc, another now-defunct Iranian site modelled after another defacement forum, Zone-H. The IP address of QuickLeak and its associated network of domains, including quickleak[.]org and Wikileak[.]ir, was hosted by Iran's main Internet Service Provider (ISP), Telecommunication Company of Iran (TCI). These details are circumstantial evidence that link the Al-Hayat defacement to an entity in Iran.\nThe Al-Alam and Al-Hayat intrusions resembled patriotic hacktivist skirmishes on the margins of an unfolding geopolitical regional conflict. However, subsequent events, circumstantial evidence, and other technical indicators led some investigators to Iran, with the Yemen Cyber Army as a possible front.\nThe Saudi-led Operation Decisive Storm in Yemen ended on April 22. It was immediately followed by Operation Restoring Hope, which purportedly sought to reduce the use of force in Yemen and\nmove toward a political solution for the conflict.66 The Yemen Cyber Army, however, was not to let go of the feud as easily.\nAbout a month after the defacement of Al-Hayat, the Yemen Cyber Army defaced the website of Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) on May 20. The MOFA homepage displayed an animated image that announced the launch of Operation Hussein Badreddin al-Houthi, named after the assassinated leader of the Houthi insurgency. The image content was familiar. Similar to the Al-Hayat defacement, it included anti-Saudi messages and strong pro-Shi'ite imagery, including pictures of Iran's Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, and Hassan Nasrallah, secretary general of Lebanon's Hezbollah militia. The announcement also featured a Guy Fawkes-masked face, the uncanny symbol of hacking collective Anonymous, and Anonymous' famous slogan ‘We Don't Forget, We Don't Forgive'.\nThe Yemen Cyber Army promised to release a trove of encrypted data on Saudi diplomats, agents, and citizens, stolen from 3000 MOFA computers. That week, Yemen Cyber Army released two tranches of private information of citizens and MOFA personnel on Pastebin as password-protected files, the password included as well.67 In the Pastebin announcement perpetrators identified as ‘Cutting Sword of Justice', the same actor behind the 2012 attack on Saudi's national oil company, Aramco. The destructive attack against Aramco, dubbed ‘Shamoon', involved automated wiping of 30,000 business devices. U.S. intelligence community and cybersecurity researchers attributed the incident to Iranian state-affiliated actors.68\nThe day after the Pastebin announcement, on May 21, Iran's Fars News published yet another exclusive report on the hack, crediting the ominous Yemen Cyber Army.69 A subsequent report on May 21 included a Word file attachment that contained links to the leaked documents on several file-sharing sites and passwords to decompress encrypted files.70 Fars News branded these exclusive reports as ‘Saudileaks'. This was the first time that the term was used as far as public records show. Between May and August 2015, Fars News published 32 pieces on Saudi Leaks in the English language.\nAgain, @QuickLeakOrg sought to promote the Pastebin announcement and Fars News exclusives, aiming for maximum public attention to the intrusion. These tweets did not generate much engagement, however.71 Efforts by journalists to confirm the identity of the Yemen Cyber Army did not yield much information as the group refused to disclose their location or even speak Arabic to the press.72\nThe magnitude, format, and timing of the intrusion, coupled with other circumstantial evidence, suggested that the perpetrators, whoever they were, had pro-Houthi aspirations and were publicly challenging Saudis' ambitions in the Yemen conflict. For its part, the Saudi MOFA confirmed the attack on its website but downplayed the impact. The Ministry also warned against using and publishing any leaked material, describing the breach as a ‘plot of the nation's enemies' and promising legal action against perpetrators.73\n### The leaks\nAgainst the warnings of the Saudi government, however, two substantive leaks put the MOFA hack on the spotlight, challenging Saudi foreign policy and practices.\nOn 19 June 2015, WikiLeaks published over sixty thousand documents, titled as Saudi Cables, and promised half a million more to follow.74 These cables comprised more than confidential diplomatic correspondences, however. They also contained personal medical and legal records of survivors of sexual abuse, sick children, and the mentally ill, among others. The mixed nature of these cables raised concerns about WikiLeaks' precarious handling of private citizen information and prompted debates about the ethics of responsible leaks.75\nWikiLeaks had previously released several controversial document sets from states and private companies. Though the whistleblowing platform had been relatively dormant for a couple of years before it published the Saudi Cables in 2015. In its press release, WikiLeaks acknowledged the Yemen\nCyber Army as the initial source of ‘valuable sample documents' but did not disclose the source of the fresh trove, leaving the question of attribution unanswered. Upon the release of Saudi Cables, the Yemen Cyber Army went quiet and quit responding to media inquiries about their connection with the whistleblowing platform.\nThe Yemen Cyber Army partially came out of the dark on June 26 with the launch of their social media accounts and two now-defunct websites: Yemenica[.]com and wikisaleaks[.]com. Yemenica was a single-page site with a declaration from the group, describing itself as a ‘Yemeni youth community' united against the Saudi regime. Again, the description flashed back to a second group that claimed responsibility for the 2012 Shamoon attack, posing as Arab Youth Group. Notably, Yemenica had a Google Plus account, which at the time was the most popular social networking site among Iranian conservatives and was unaffected by Iran's infamous censorship practices.\nWikiSaudiLeaks presented an even more aggressive anti-Saudi manifesto: subtitled as Cyber Decisive Storm, the website header showed images of bombing of Yemen by Saudi-led forces in Operation Decisive Storm. It characterised the developments, in English, as a ‘barbaric Saudi-American aggression, with which the Israelites also stand'.\nWikiSaudiLeaks was likely an additional outlet to maximise attention to the leaked materials. The documents on the site were mostly in Arabic and had already been included in the WikiLeaks release. They were classified based on countries, regions, and international organisations such as the United Nations. The list began with old and current allies of the kingdom, including Qatar, the United States, Bahrain and Turkey. WikiSaudiLeaks also contained a dedicated category for ‘Persian Gulf Countries' -- a term that Iran has zealously used throughout the naming dispute with some Arab countries who have opted for alternatives such as ‘Arabian Gulf' or ‘Gulf'. These cues shed further light on the interests and motives of those behind WikiSaudiLeaks.\nWhoever spearheaded these leaks sought to alienate Saudi's allies, influence international audiences, and disrupt Saudi's strategic plans in Yemen. Several media partners of WikiLeaks, including the free press advocacy group Reporters Without Border, published selected materials and analyses about Saudi engagements internationally. While Western media broadly reported on the cables, the regional media remained divided on the matter according to traditional political lines. Pro-Saudi media, including Al-Hayat, reiterated the state warnings and refrained from circulating the leaked materials. The Iran-owned Al-Alam, on the other hand, extensively covered the cables. In the end, many Arabic language outlets chose not to cover Saudi Cables, presumably out of concern for legal and political retribution, leaving the regional impact of the leak rather unclear.\n### The sham\nThe public attention to Saudi Cables was already subsiding when a fabricated news article briefly brought SaudiLeaks back to some headlines. On July 27, Another Western Dawn News (AWDNews), a fringe news site, published an article in English, accusing a United Nations (UN) official of receiving bribes for biased reporting against the Islamic Republic of Iran. According to the article, the Saudi embassy in Kuwait had allegedly paid Dr. Ahmad Shaheed, then UN Special Rapporteur for the Situation of Human Rights in Iran, 10 million dollars to increase international pressure on Iran for its violation of human rights. The report cited a scanned copy of a top secret document purportedly from the Saudi Cables on WikiLeaks. Contrary to the AWDNews claim, however, the ‘source' document in Arabic mentioned a million dollar -- not ten -- paid to Shaheed.\nRegardless of the discrepancy, the article prompted strong reactions inside and outside Iran. Human rights groups characterised the allegation as a sophisticated, state-directed smear campaign against Shaheed and critics of Iran's record of human rights. For years, the Islamic Republic has refused to collaborate with the UN Special Rapporteurs, accusing them of plotting with Iran's adversaries, including Saudi Arabia, for biased or fabricated reporting about the situation of human rights in Iran. This article, if true, would have been\nthe perfect evidence for Iran's enduring righteousness. The bribery claim also aligned well with Saudi's previous attempts to grow its influence in the international human rights system. According to the WikiLeaks documents, in 2014 Saudi Arabia bartered votes with the United Kingdom and Russia to gain a seat at the UN Human Rights Council, despite its nefarious record at home.\nThe article rapidly circulated on other fringe news sites such as Al-Waqt and the Middle East Press. Iran's conservative media reacted immediately and amplified the news in Persian and Arabic languages, with some citing the original source site Al-Waie News. Among those were the Young Journalists Club, which is run by the IRIB, the state-owned broadcaster, and Tasnim News, another media affiliate of the IRGC. All of these platforms promoted the one-million-dollar bribe accusation.\nAmid public confusion and media inquiries, WikiLeaks refuted the claim that the document was one of the original Saudi Cables. In a tweet to online news site Iran Front Page, WikiLeaks challenged the authenticity of the alleged document. WikiLeaks stated: ‘@IranFrontPage Please Show Which Cable This Claim Is Based on. You Fail to Link to One of Our Cables in the Article', thus adding forgery to the puzzle of Saudi Leaks. Shaheed, for his part, personally thanked WikiLeaks for the clarification.\nIt took some time for attributive leads to emerge. Three years later, in August 2018, Facebook and Twitter announced their first takedown of state-linked assets from Iran. Among the 770 Iranian Twitter accounts removed were AWDNews, Al-Waie News, Al-Waqt, and Middle East Press, all of which had played a part in the smear campaign against the UN Special Rapporteur. In November 2020, U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) issued a warrant for seizure of 29 domains for being part of the Liberty Front Press network, the same media network that Meta, Twitter, FireEye, and ClearSky had previously attributed to Iran. In an accompanying affidavit, the DOJ asserted that each of the seized domains was ‘fraudulently registered' due to each being used by or on behalf of the IRGC. AWDNews[.]com was among the seized domains.\nDid the perpetrators behind the MOFA breach and the subsequent leak plan the forgery and disinformation campaign ahead of time, or was it an afterthought? The answer is unclear. But the disinformation campaign demonstrates how hack-and-leak events can catalyse cultivating false information to new and existing audiences. Once a breach happens and secrets spill into the public domain, related but fabricated stories become more believable and harder to debunk. Actors with no stake in the previous events may also seize the opportunity to harvest the outcome of hack-and-leaks.\nThe same actor(s) may not have been behind the three stages of Saudi Leaks. The forgery may have been devised on the fly. What is established, however, is that Iran's IRGC was behind the disinformation campaign. The manipulation of leaked material signals Iran's interest and capacity in leveraging the output of hack-and-leak events for influencing domestic and international audiences and antagonising Saudi allies.\n## Competing hypotheses: a framework for analysis\nThe multi-stage nature of the WikiSaudiLeaks event calls for a multi-stage attribution. Thus far, there is only decisive evidence for attributing the forgery to Iran based on Twitter and Facebook takedowns and DOJ's attribution. Yemen Cyber Army's lack of any historical background has bolstered speculations that it was a front for other prominent actors with resources, motives, and ambitions for such an undertaking. The attribution of the MOFA hack and the leaks has remained divergent. As the following passages indicate, existing research points to Iran and Russia as the two main culprits. Other possibilities include Yemeni hackers or a collaboration among different actors. This section considers possible hints for attributing the breach into the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs network and the leaks that ensued.\nThe breach\nThere are two possibilities with regard to the breach of the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The first hypothesis is that Iran breached the ministry's networks. This scenario would be in-line with Iran's involvement in a wider espionage operation that targeted government, military, and critical infrastructure targets across the Middle East between 2013 and 2015.\nIn June 2015, cybersecurity firm ClearSky published a report on an operation that had been in progress since mid 2014. ClearSky dubbed the alleged campaign ‘Thamar Reservoir' and pointed out a variety of targets of high interest to Iranian politics. These targets included international relations and defence professionals from Saudi Arabia, Israel, and elsewhere in the Middle East. The campaign utilised a range of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), including social engineering and spear phishing, mostly through Google services. ClearSky attributed Thamar Reservoir with high confidence to Iranian actors due to its considerable similarities of TTPs and overlapping infrastructure with previous operations also attributed to Iranian actors like Rocket Kitten and AjaxTeam.\nAnother cybersecurity company, Cylance, dubbed a related campaign ‘Operation Cleaver'. Cleaver included targets from Saudi Arabia's oil and gas and transportation industries in 2013--14. Among the TTPs used in Operation Cleaver, one particularly stands out. The threat actor predominantly used spear phishing to deceive targets to visit a job search website and submit their resumes. The scheme used an imposter of a legitimate professional development service winresume[.]com and its Easy Resume Creator Pro service to lure job candidates to download and install malware TinyZBot. The threat actor attempted to deceive its targets by convincing them they had a pending job opportunity at the industrial group Teledyne, through fake domains such as Teledyne-Jobs[.]com. To know more about the opportunity, the target had to use the malicious resume submission service. One of the Saudi cables later released by WikiLeaks suggests that a threat actor had used this very tactic to breach the Saudi MOFA network months before the May 2015 intrusion.\nIn January 2015, Saudi MOFA internally circulated a 14-page incident response report, describing an attack on the ministry's network that had started on 20 July 2014 (10 months before the May 2015 attack). The report, which is included in one of the Saudi cables, indicates that the system administrator of MOFA had received a targeted email with a job opportunity from the fictitious employer Teledyne. The target fell for the scheme and his machine was infected with the TinyZBot malware, which prompted data exfiltration from his device.\nThe ministry, however, only noticed the compromise in November 2014, when it detected failed proxy connections between the system admin computer and a suspicious server. 88.150.214.166 was the IP address of the server, which corresponds to that of the malicious domain Teledyne-Jobs[.]com, reportedly created by Iranian hackers. Outed by Cylance's Operation Cleaver report on 2 December 2014, the fake website stopped working on the same day. The MOFA report does not identify the extent of data exfiltration and network impact. But the document repeatedly cites Operation Cleaver, expressly attributing the attack to Iranian actors.\nThe public-facing WikiSaudiLeaks event started only in April 2015, but these technical reports put forward an alternative possibility. That is the attackers may have exfiltrated the diplomatic cables from the MOFA network earlier but held onto them until the Yemen conflict began to complicate regional geopolitics. This tactic resembles the hacking of Britam Defense. The company was hacked in November 2012 but the perpetrators held onto the stolen material until January 2013, when a U.S. military strike in Syria seemed looming. This significant time-delay is another indication of a professional intelligence agency tradecraft, as activists or militants likely would have acted more swiftly on a whim.\n## Russia\nThe Saudi MOFA was of interest to the Russian actors, too. Russia is known to have engaged in reconnaissance and espionage activities against Middle Eastern targets in the spring of 2015.\nFANCY BEAR, also known as Sofacy or APT 28, a unit of Russia's military intelligence agency (GRU), reportedly breached the Saudi embassy in Ukraine in February 2015. The exclusive use of this vulnerability by FANCY BEAR until April 2015 has led researchers to entertain the possibility that Russia may also be responsible for the breach of the Saudi MOFA's network in the WikiSaudiLeaks event.\nThe attack infrastructure in the GRU campaign also contains noteworthy overlaps with the ominous Yemen Cyber Army. Wikisaleaks, the website ostensibly run by Yemen Cyber Army, was registered on the same range of IP addresses linked to FANCY BEAR in 2015. The address is part of a range of 256 at Lithuanian hosting provider UAB DUOMENU CENTRAS, leased to an intermediary company, MonoVM. The company offers a range of services, including dedicated servers and web hosting. In May 2015, it still accepted a variety of crypto currencies, such as Bitcoin and Skrill, to process transactions. These decentralised methods of payment have been appealing to Russian actors for purchasing the infrastructure for hacking operations. The domain MonoVM[.]com has been registered with a Dubai address, but it appears to be owned or managed by Iranian individuals. The registrant details also include information about another hosting company, Azar Online, registered under the same Persian names. Azar Online appears to be an ISP in Tabriz, the capital of Eastern Azerbaijan province in Iran.\nLater disclosures established even more links between MonoVM and Iran. In December 2020, amid then-President Trump and his close allies' allegations of election fraud, a new website emerged with a hit list of U.S. officials that refuted Trump's claims. *Enemies of the People* sought to incite violence and wreak havoc in the United States. The Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) quickly attributed this operation to Iran. One of the associated domains of Enemies of the People website was hosted on MonoVM.\nIt is possible that FANCY BEAR used MonoVM, likely an Iranian company, for its espionage operations while masquerading as Yemen Cyber Army. FANCY BEAR has utilised the same technique, known as false flag, with other fronts such as the CyberBerkut and CyberCaliphate -- two GRU front groups that emerged in 2014. An alternative possibility, however, is that other actors, including Iranians, utilised MonoVM services for their purposes around the same time, thus creating a false flag, likely unintentionally.\nLater events suggested a third hypothesis. In 2019, another Russian actor, Turla (aka Snake), identified as Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), was detected to have hijacked the technical infrastructure of OilRig, an Iranian threat actor, for espionage attacks in 2017 and early 2018. In October 2019, US and UK intelligence services confirmed that Turla had exploited the command and control and operational infrastructure of Iranian actors to expand its network of victims.\nTurla had previously targeted entities in 45 countries in 2015, including governments, military organisations, and research institutions. Most of these victims were located in the Middle East and Europe. There is no evidence for such hijacking of infrastructure prior to 2017. Though it is possible that Turla, or other Russian actors, might have co-opted TTPs of Iranian actors in an effort to further obfuscate attribution for WikiSaudiLeaks. For example, Turla has used a variant of Mimikatz, a commonplace hacking tool used extensively by different actors, which was also previously used by Iranian actors in Operation Cleaver. A fourth possibility could be that the two groups, Iranians and Russians, may have been collaborating in some capacity.\n### The leaks\nAttribution of the leaks remains challenging, in large part due to limited evidence available on the details of the transfer of Saudi Cables to WikiLeaks and WikiSaudiLeaks websites. This gap is perpetuated by three factors. First, wikisaleaks[.]com was registered on the same IP range as the Russian C2 infrastructure in 2015. Second, yemenica[.]com, the other website of the Yemen Cyber Army, was registered with an email address from the Russian webmail provider, Yandex.\na report from 2019^{120} suggests that two weeks after the release of Saudi Cables in June 2015, WikiLeaks moved its web hosting infrastructure to a new server in Russia. Prior to the transfer, however, the same IP address hosted a fake domain that had been associated with phishing attacks by the Iranian Rocket Kitten until May 2015.^{121} This suggests that WikiLeaks may have collaborated with the Iranian hackers for the intrusion of Saudi MOFA, or coordinated for the transfer of stolen documents. It could also entirely be a coincidence. As with MonoVM, different actors may have used the same infrastructure for their preferred setup and reliability.\n## Five vectors for a deconstructed approach to attribution\nOur analysis of competing hypotheses illustrates that evidence on the technical, operational, and political aspects of the WikiSaudiLeaks events point to more than a single suspect. In entertaining these hypotheses, we consider a multi-factor framework that includes the history of different actors in undertaking hack-and-leak operations, motivation, messaging, capabilities (technical and otherwise), and infrastructure.^{122} Together, these indicators pave the ground for addressing the question of ‘who did it', with Iran, Russia, or the Yemen Cyber Army as the most likely culprits.\n### History\nIn assessing a threat actor's history, we first consider past behaviour that tracks with the tradecraft used in the case in question. Out of the three likely culprits, Iran and Russia had previously engaged in computer network exploitation (CNE) against a variety of adversaries, in particular diplomatic targets from the Middle East. Moreover, they both had previously used fictitious fronts in CNE and computer network attack (CNA) operations. Iranian Charming Kitten (APT33) had targeted Saudi Aramco in 2012, posing as the Cutting Sword of Justice and Arab Youth Group.^{123} Russia, too, has a history of using front groups for active measures.^{124} Cyber Berkut was a Russian scheme, posing as an anti-Ukraine hacktivist group to target the websites of NATO and several German officials in March 2014^{125} and January 2015,^{126} respectively. CyberCaliphate, a seemingly ISIS-associated group, breached TV5 Monde, a major French television network with global coverage, resulting in network disruption for hours in April 2015.^{127} The ominous Yemen Cyber Army, however, lacks any history prior to WikiSaudiLeaks, which bolsters the possibility of a front for other more established actors, like Iran or Russia.\n### Motivation\nSecond, we investigate the motivation which refers to a perpetrator's interest in conducting certain actions in a geopolitical context. WikiSaudiLeaks was a retaliatory response to the Saudis for their intervention in the Yemen conflict. In principle, the Houthi rebels and Iran would have both benefited from the collapse of the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen. While Russia has taken an intermediary role in Yemen to avoid direct conflict, the failure of a key US ally would still serve Russia's political and economic objectives in the region. Moreover, Iran and Russia's decisive intervention in Syria in support of the Assad regime has been met with unwavering opposition from Saudi Arabia and the United States, with either side accusing the other of supporting ‘terrorists'.^{128} The humiliating hack-and-leak events of WikiSaudiLeaks thus serve both Iran and Russia's vengeance toward Saudi Arabia.\n### Messaging\nThird, we turn to messaging which relates to the semantics and semiotics of the behaviour. The language, signs, and other cues used to communicate with the audience often contain clues about the actor. The WikiSaudiLeaks operators used a consistent anti-Saudi tone in all stages: the hacking of Al-Hayat and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, promoting the leaked material, and the\ndisinformation campaign. They conveyed resistance to the Saudi intervention in Yemen, with an obvious emphasis on pro-Iranian and pro-Shi'ite sentiments. In addition, the Iranian state media network was the first to systematically cover ‘Saudileaks' in English, weeks before WikiLeaks and other outlets did. At the very least, the zealous communication underscores Iran's vested interest in the incident. This is not to say that the same operators were behind the publication of the leaked material. However, these considerations along with the history and motivation factors skew the attribution assessment toward Iran. Admittedly, some of these details can be manipulated to falsely point in a certain direction and obfuscate attribution. Using a geopolitical cover makes attribution of a false flag operation particularly challenging.^{129}\n### Capability\nFourth, capability entails the technical expertise, economic and human resources, and enterprising networks of operators and media affiliates that enable a malicious operation. The WikiSaudiLeaks event suggests coordination among a network of operators on different levels, each marshalling a variety of skill sets. Each stage required capabilities that both Iran and Russia demonstrated before. Yet these factors seem far less viable for the Yemen Cyber Army due to its lack of history.\n### Infrastructure\nLastly, the infrastructure factor concerns the foundations for physical and virtual communication used to deliver a technical capability or maintain the command and control of capabilities.^{130} These structures include electronic devices, servers, domain tools, online services, and social media accounts, to name a few, that attackers can buy, lease, share, compromise, and repurpose to develop their infrastructure. In hack-and-leak operations, the infrastructure for the intrusion may not be the same as what is used for the leak. It is also possible that different actors use the same infrastructure at different points in time.^{131}\nAs with WikiSaudiLeaks, possible overlap of infrastructures can significantly impede detection and attribution. The wikisaleaks[.]com domain, one of the websites affiliated with Yemen Cyber Army, was registered at an IP address from likely-Iranian hosting company MonoVM. The IP address also intersected with the Russian infrastructure used to target the Saudi embassy in Ukraine in early 2015. It is entirely plausible, then, that Iranian and Russian actors were using web services offered by the same provider around the same time, hence the overlapping IP addresses. However, it is not possible to determine whether this infrastructure switch was intentional or merely a coincidence.\nConsidered together, history, motivation, messaging, capability, and infrastructure provide a framework for examining the competing hypotheses about attribution. Proper synthesis of these details is not possible with the same level of certainty across the WikiSaudiLeaks event. In attributing a multi-stage incident, we propose to assess each stage (the hack and the leak) against these five indicators. Tables 1 and 2 summarise the degree to which each stage of the WikiSaudiLeaks event can be attributed to three likely perpetrators: Yemen Cyber Army, Iran, and Russia.^{132}\nAs Tables 1 and 2 indicate, the Yemen Cyber Army has the lowest chance of being a real culprit. Lack of history and information about the group increases the possibility that it may have been a fictitious front for other perpetrators. The network intrusion can be attributed to Iran and Russia with varying degrees of confidence. Attributing the leak is not as straightforward, however. There is limited evidence of politically motivated leaks by Iranian actors unless Iran was indeed behind the attack on Britam Defence in 2013. While Russia has a long history of leaks during the Cold War and the pre-Internet days, there is limited credible evidence on Russia's involvement in cyber-enabled leaks prior to the attack on the DNC in 2016. Other indicators -- such as pro-Iran messaging, subtle cues from wikisaleaks[.]com, and the extensive coverage of the leaks by state-affiliated media early on -- can be taken as the involvement of Iran on some level. Last but not least, Iran is responsible for the forgery and disinformation campaign that came out of the WikiSaudiLeaks event. Overall, Iran scores higher on all three stages than other possible culprits.\nINTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY\n793\nTable 1.

Possible forgeries among the leaked data and plausible false flags add to the complications of attribution. The same actor(s) may not be behind seemingly related events. Distinguishing these actors from one another also comes with particular complexities. In this context, de-layering the attribution process and investigating each layer separately facilitate the assessment. The outcome may be varying degrees of confidence in the attribution of each stage, which in turn helps to identify the gaps in the attribution of digital covert action. The case of WikiSaudiLeaks captures these nuances.\nOn the strategic level, attribution remains a political decision based on information collated by intelligence and security agencies or influenced by foreign policy considerations.¹³⁴ It delineates red lines and weighs a set of legitimate responses to the attack.¹³⁵ In the case of WikiSaudiLeaks, affected state parties did not publicly attribute this case. Saudi officials offered little public communication regarding the source of the intrusion. Nor did allies of the kingdom with prominent cyber capabilities, such as the United States, release high level technical or intelligence assessments about WikiSaudiLeaks. Instead, speculative attribution was done by cyber security firms and individual researchers, who lack the authority and means to collect the signal and human intelligence necessary to reliably attribute an attack to a state.¹³⁶\nStrategic attribution comes at a cost, politically and logistically. It requires multiple government agencies and often private sector firms working together, often across borders, utilising their intelligence sources and methods. While there is no consistent approach to attributing cyber attacks among states, an incident is more likely to invoke attribution by states if it passes a two-fold test of significance: (1) the nature and severity of the attack, and (2) the affected parties and implications for their national security. In other words, who is targeted and how they are targeted are the key questions that can invoke an attribution response by states and their allies. The closer an attack hits one's home, the more likely that the state gets involved. Thus, the target and severity of cyber-enabled covert action affect the decision to expend resources on public attribution. WikiSaudiLeaks may not have passed this test.\nWhy was the campaign not conclusively attributed? First, the forensic evidence did not unambiguously point to a single adversary at any given moment.¹³⁷ Second, the entire event, it appears, was not consequential enough at any given moment in time for the Saudi government to initiate a more determined investigation and response. Lastly, although the attack was politically embarrassing, it seems that it did not constitute a sufficiently severe national security threat to Saudi Arabia to escalate to an international investigation with support from more experienced and capable allies.\nYet WikiSaudiLeaks set an internationally consequential precedent. It was highly likely the first state-enabled hack-and-leak operation that utilised WikiLeaks as an amplifying platform, a tactic that was most notably used just one year later in the most tectonic digital covert campaign of our times, the DNC hack-and-leak. In hindsight, it may have been a strategic shortcoming on the part of the US and UK intelligence communities not to have partnered with Saudi intelligence for a more robust response to WikiSaudiLeaks. Both countries, after all, became the target of Russian and Iranian active measures in the 2016, 2018, and 2019 elections, respectively. The episode nevertheless underscores the significance of coalitions and partnerships, especially if a targeted government does not possess mature capabilities and experience in attribution. WikiSaudiLeaks came before the consolidation of such theories as persistent engagement and defend forward in U.S. cyber strategy. With the benefit of hindsight, the same attack on an ally's integrity today may -- and should -- prompt a more mature response from FiveEyes partners and other open societies.\n## Conclusion\nCovert action is a political instrument. Hack-and-leak incidents may be designed to mess with regional and international politics by ‘inflaming existing contradictions', to use the old Soviet terminology once honed by KGB's Service A, history's most advanced disinformation bureaucracy. Hack-and-leak operations are only technically upgraded iterations of Cold War collect-and-leak operations. Since at least 2013, predominantly authoritarian governments have deployed hack-and-leak operations amid geopolitical crises against a range of adversaries. WikiSaudiLeaks is the pivotal historic example.\nThe multi-stage nature of digital covert action requires a multi-stage attribution process. This process extends across technical, operational, and strategic levels. Such all-source analysis must still cut across often hardwearing disciplinary boundaries between the kind of digital forensics commonly used in incident response and threat intelligence reporting and the kind of digital forensics commonly used to investigate influence operations (IO) and disinformation. Moreover, a single confidence score may not be appropriate for multi-stage events. That is, analysis of one stage may produce a degree of confidence that differs from other components of the same event. Worse, in extreme cases different components of what might appear as one campaign can be perpetrated by different actors, even unbeknownst to each other.\nWikiSaudiLeaks was strategically designed to inflame contradictions in Saudi Arabia, a party to the Yemen conflict, to wedge open its alliances, and rally international public opinion against the kingdom. The evidence available to us does not allow for definitive attribution for the entire WikiSaudiLeaks event. Instead, a multi-stage all-source investigation offers more details about each component. Each stage requires exploring a different set of forensic artefacts, as well as considering separate tactical, operational, and strategic aspects. The Saudi MOFA-related intrusions could be attributed, based on circumstantial evidence, to either Iran or Russia, possibly even both. The lack of forensic evidence about the provenance of the leaks adds to the challenge of attributing the campaign's exposure stage. However, Iran and Russia remain the most likely culprits, with some circumstantial evidence pointing to Iran. The final stage, the digital disinformation and amplification campaign, can be confidently attributed to Iran, given the abundant evidence exposed by social media companies. A multi-stage event, therefore, requires a multi-stage attribution process -- one that allows for gradients of attribution within each stage.\nThere are three non-exclusive explanations for why WikiSaudiLeaks was not attributed with high confidence to a specific adversary. First, the target, in this case Saudi Arabia, did not have sufficient political determination to perform public attribution. Amid the Yemen conflict, the kingdom was intent on minimising attention to the Saudi Cables and staying on message about the unravelling proxy war with Iran. Second, Saudi Arabia and interested third parties -- including the United States -- likely had insufficient incentive to unlock the attributive resources required to link the campaign to a specific adversary. Access to attributive capabilities consists of both access to a range of forensic\nartefacts and access to the skills and experience necessary to acquire, develop, cross-reference, process, analyse, contextualise, and interpret relevant signals and artefacts. Finally, the WikiSaudiLeaks campaign exhibited features that made the overall event exceptionally hard to attribute to one specific adversary. It is highly likely that these features were partly intended by at least one adversary, and partly unintended.\nMinimising uncertainty is the primary undertaking of attribution. Yet it is a highly complex and nuanced process. Technical forensic artefacts, if inconclusive, must be considered together with other data, obtained from a variety of sources, collected both passively and actively. The delayed nature of attribution further complicates the task. Additional useful details may only become available months or even years later, as our case illustrates, thus rendering early judgements incomplete. False flags, or suspicion thereof, and other challenges can significantly complicate attribution and the response it may require.\nAttributing twenty-first century covert action -- integrated campaigns that have a CNE, CNA, and possibly an IO component -- in a nutshell, is an art and a science and, above all, an all-source enterprise and as such vastly different from attributing narrow computer network breaches. In this attribution process, analysts will have to be ready to disentangle some campaigns, assessing, analysing and attributing their respective components -- the hack, forge, leak, amplify -- on their own merits. Attributing one or multiple components may be easy or hard, linking them together is a separate challenge yet. Adversaries, in turn, may take advantage of this layered attribution challenge.\nWikiSaudiLeaks came before its time, as the analytic toolsets and the strategic and investigative approaches necessary to understand and attribute this event have continued to mature after the fact. After all, it was only around 2016 that security firms started seriously integrating CNE and IO in their public-facing investigative work, with Mandiant among the first,^{142} and Microsoft^{143} and later Google^{144} following suit. Nor did the US government adopt the strategies of persistent engagement and defend forward until 2018,^{145} three years after WikiSaudiLeaks.\nSaudi Cables, in hindsight, was a chameleon that appeared as a different thing against different backdrops: seen in the WikiLeaks context, it appeared as innocent transparency activism; in the website defacement context, it appeared as patriot hacker skirmishes; and viewed against the foil of expanding digital covert action, it appeared as a campaign of at least one authoritarian intelligence agency.",

This paper revisits one of the most complex, most significant, and most mysterious digital covert actions of our time: a 2015 hack-and-leak case known among investigators as 'WikiSaudiLeaks' that so far has evaded attribution. We argue that WikiSaudiLeaks was not a stand-alone event, but a puzzle piece in a larger covert action campaign that involved advanced computer network exploitation, computer network attack, persistent deception, and a creative influence and disinformation effort. By disintegrating the larger event into its components, limited attribution becomes possible. We present the most detailed and comprehensive investigation of this case to date, attribute at least one component of the larger event to Iranian intelligence, and draw conceptional conclusions.\n## Introduction What was WikiSaudiLeaks and why was it so hard to attribute? This paper revisits one of the most complex, most significant, and most mysterious hack-and-leak puzzles of our time, a 2015 case known among investigators as ‘WikiSaudiLeaks'. The name refers to a mysterious website that surfaced and disseminated a major trove of files taken from the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The site's operators curiously claimed to have given the stolen documents to WikiLeaks, which claimed to have published 122,619 files by year's end.1 Subsequently, the material received high profile press coverage2 and became known as ‘The Saudi Cables'.\nWikiSaudiLeaks is an early example of a fundamental yet neglected attribution challenge.3 The event was not unified. The leak was part of a larger covert action campaign that involved advanced computer network exploitation, computer network attack, persistent deception, and a creative influence and disinformation effort.4 Yet so far neither scholars nor investigators from public or private sector have been able to conclusively attribute WikiSaudiLeaks to a specific threat actor -- in sharp contrast to most other comparable high-profile cases. Why? Because the leak does nothing less than challenge the established attribution paradigm. Hack-and-leak events are not widely discussed, and existing scholarship tends to focus on the interplay between intrusion and influence, while neglecting the consequences for attribution.5 What if a single attribution statement for digital covert action is not possible in the first place?\nWikiSaudiLeaks happened just as the goldilocks moment of digital covert action was ending: about a year before the Russian election interference in the United States, when bulk leaks were still seen as innocent expressions of transparency activism; and just two years after Mandiant's APT1 report,6 when the public attribution debate and capabilities were still in their infancy. Later events have motivated prolific scholarship, most prominently the Democratic National Committee (DNC) hack-and-leak.7 Yet some of the earliest and most significant instances of digital covert action remain understudied. It is time to revise the WikiSaudiLeaks case, and with it our understanding of attributing covert action.\nDigital covert action was on the rise throughout the 2010s, with hack-and-leak operations making up a significant share. This rise is enabled, but insufficiently explained, by technological change. A list of the major hits would include the late 2000s campaign known as Stuxnet; various wiping attacks against Iranian targets in 2011; the 2012 attack against Saudi Aramco and Rasgas; the neglected 2013 Britam Defence leak; the 2014 Sony Pictures Entertainment breach-and-leak;; two remarkable blackouts in Kiev in 2015 and 2016 as well as numerous other operations in Ukraine; the series of breach-and-leak operations against the US election in 2016; the mysterious series of Shadow Brokers leaks; the ransomware attacks known as Wannacry and NotPetya in 2017, one executed poorly, the other deceptively; the Viasat sabotage at the outset of the Ukraine War in 2022, and several more, some of them subtle, others as yet not publicly discussed. The continuous and dynamic nature of such offensive activity helped give rise to the concepts of ‘persistent engagement' and ‘defend forward' in the U.S. government, in which attribution played a key role. Indeed all these major cases had one core feature in common: governments, and in many cases independent researchers, have attributed them with high confidence or even certainty to specific adversaries.\nYet WikiSaudiLeaks stands out: not only has it not been attributed with confidence, the case is also curiously understudied. Both absences are all the more remarkable given that the covert action has generated an extraordinary amount of media coverage, with hundreds of press stories. The ensuing leak is also infamous as one of the most unethical and extreme so far, releasing unredacted cables that included full names and passport numbers of victims of torture and sexual abuse.\nWhy was the campaign not attributed so far? What can this curious case tell us about the past and future of attributing computer network operations in general and covert action specifically? And, of course: who was responsible for WikiSaudiLeaks?\nWe argue that by breaking down the larger event into its components, limited attribution becomes possible. To understand the saga that is Wikisaudileaks, investigators must first deconstruct what appears to be one coherent event into its constituent components: collection, disclosure, and amplification. Each component, counterintuitively, may not only come with a specific confidence level; it may also lead to diverging and separate attribution assessments. What looks like one operation at a first glance, with closer inspection may, in fact, collapse into multiple operations. The limited scholarship on this case has entertained the possibility of Russian involvement. We attribute at least one component of the larger covert action to Iran.\nAttribution is what states make of it. The outcome of an attributive investigation into a major computer network breach is determined by resources and political priorities, both on the side of the victim and on the side of the perpetrator. The perpetrator plans and equips a clandestine or covert operation to sustain deniability -- the victim plans and equips investigative and analytical outfits to take deniability away. The decision to publicly attribute, however, is correlated with such factors as incident severity, geopolitical circumstances, the intelligence available on the case, technical and operational capacity, and the political will of those involved in the attribution process. The WikiSaudiLeaks event puts the interaction of these indicators to test and underscores several gaps in the attribution process.\nThe paper proceeds in four steps. First we provide context to hack-and-leak operations in the Middle East by revisiting a neglected case from 2013, the earliest known instance of a hack-and-leak. We then offer a granular analysis of the WikiSaudiLeaks event, unmasking a related disinformation campaign that so far has not been covered in public or confidential reporting on the case. The third section reviews competing hypotheses in the attribution of WikiSaudiLeaks, followed by a framework for attribution of different stages of the covert action. We close by discussing the challenges of attribution of this particular case and, more broadly, digital covert action.\n## Prelude Hack-and-leak operations have become ever more common since 2013, globally and especially in the Middle East. Around that time, a number of still mysterious leaks appeared that, in hindsight, could have been the work of intelligence agencies or contractors. The rise of the Anonymous movement as well as WikiLeaks offered unprecedented and obvious opportunities for covert operations. For a few years before the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the wider public and most journalists saw leaks as something positive first and foremost, as a way to create transparency and accountability -- not as an ideal cover for dirty tricks.\nThe breaches that enable the subsequent disclosure of stolen files may be initially done for espionage purposes, or the targeting may be driven by covert action objectives. The offenders' precise intentions are likely to remain obscure in the absence of direct intelligence access or declassified archival records. Historically, however, it was often ‘throwaway' -- files that no longer served a narrow intelligence purpose -- that were used to furnish the content for targeted leaks. Particularly noteworthy in this context were the Shaltai Boltai disclosures in Russia, and, a few months after WikiSaudiLeaks, in October 2015, the unattributed and fairly obscure ‘Turok' FSB leak. These operations often seek to undermine an adversary's decision-making, political cohesion, domestic public opinion, leaders, reputation, and alliances.\nWhat follows is a prelude to the WikiSaudiLeaks event, similarly involving a regional conflict in the Middle East, equally neglected, and inconclusively attributed.\n### Britam defense The earliest known major case of hack-and-leak operations in the Middle East dates back to the early 2010s. The context for the case was the civil war in Syria. In July 2012, the Syrian government acknowledged that it had chemical weapons in its possession though it would never deploy such weapons against its own citizens but only against foreign intervention. In August, then-President Barack Obama warned the Bashar al-Assad regime that any use of chemical weapons in Syria would significantly change his calculus on a U.S. military response. The prospect of a U.S. strike in Syria concerned Assad's key allies, Iran and Russia, who have remained staunch supporters of the Syrian government since the beginning of the conflict in early 2011.\nThe first allegation of use of chemical weapons in Syria was reported in the city of Homs on 23 December 2012. The news rippled through the region and beyond. On 15 January 2013, an anonymous source alleged to Foreign Policy that the State Department had compelling evidence to attribute the chemical attack to the Syrian military. These unverified, controversial claims raised speculations that a U.S. military strike in Syria might be imminent.\nThen, on 22 January, a mysterious post appeared on Pastebin, a widely used disclosure and documentation platform, titled ‘Millitary server hacked. Confidential data!‘ An entity calling itself ‘JAsIrX' posted a short note in broken English, about 130 words, with no fewer than 51 URLs to file-sharing sites. The note was crude, and claimed that Britam Defence, a UK-based military contractor, ‘killed Arabs in Iraq and plans to invade in Iran and Syria'.\nShortly after, around 24 January, a report appeared on the obscure site cyberwarnews[.]info, claiming that Britam had been hacked. On 28 January 2013, conspiracy theory websites started covering the leak. The niche site whatdoesitmean[.]com headlined: ‘Obama Plan for World War III Stuns Russia'. That same day Infowars titled: ‘Hacked Emails Reveal “Washington-Approved” Plan to Stage Chemical Weapons Attack in Syria'.\nThe following day the story went mainstream. The Daily Mail, one of the UK's most-read tabloids, blasted: ‘U.S. “backed plan to launch chemical weapon attack on Syria and blame it on Assad's regime”'. The report in the Mail cited an email exchange from the previous month, allegedly among a group of senior managers at Britam. The exchange suspiciously mentioned a proposal that Britam would supply chemical weapons to Syria, while posing as Russian mercenaries, in exchange for a significant amount of money. The Daily Mail in turn linked to the initial report in Cyber War News that took the leak at face value.\nBritam, in fact, was targeted by a successful hack-leak-forge operation. An unknown attacker had breached Britam's email, likely in November 2012. On January 22 the perpetrators, calling themselves ‘JAsIrX', started posting internal documents from Britam on Pastebin. One email exchange from October 2012 purported to link Britam to a military training project in Saudi Arabia to increase readiness for a possible strike by Iran. Another exchange claimed a U.S.-backed proposal to Britam to ‘deliver a CW to Homs' and deploy its Ukrainian personnel to pose as Russian mercenaries The fabricated incriminating emails appeared to have been sent two months apart from one another; yet both digital artefacts shared the same unique message identity number, and had the exact same ‘sent' timestamp, at 23:57:18. Similarly, the documents pertaining to the Saudi military project were created and modified in short succession on Friday, 18 January 2013 at 12:00 GMT. The suspicious content, combined with the suspicious metadata, makes it highly likely that these forged documents sought to falsely incriminate the company in a plot against the United States and Saudi Arabia.\nThe story immediately appeared on Press TV, the English language branch of the state-run broadcaster, Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB). Press TV took a hard anti-Western position, noting the timing as ‘the Syrian army forces have managed to clear the capital, Damascus and its surrounding areas of the militants and restore security'. Seeking renewed attention to the case, Fars News, a key media affiliate of Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), republished the allegations in August 2013, citing whatdoesitmean. Other Iranian hardliner news sites, notably Mehr News, echoed the recycled article, but the story did not gain much attention.\nAttribution in the case of the Britam hack-leak-forge remained vague. A Sunday Times article entertained the possibility of Iran's involvement, but offered no solid sourcing or evidence. There is limited public technical forensics available about the attack. But contextual and operational cues, such as Iran's high stakes in Syria and the unusual media coverage by state-affiliated outlets, support the Iran hypothesis.\nEither way, the incident was the first major hack-and-leak operation that involved a variety of state and nonstate actors in Middle East politics. Whoever was behind the operation had a vested interest in implicating the United States in the use of chemical weapons in Syria, and in detracting from the truth. The event unfolded in multiple stages. The perpetrator conducted a network intrusion and collected data on the target ahead of time, manipulated the data to take advantage of geopolitical developments in the region, and promptly released the stolen (and forged) materials to maximise the believability of the plot. These same features were also on display in the WikiSaudiLeaks operation that hit Saudi Arabia two years later. Similarly, both cases remain shrouded in mystery with no conclusive attribution.\nIn both events, adversarial actors were only beginning to flex technical resources to advance geopolitical motives through digital covert action. Inconclusive attribution in those early days extended the opportunity to the perpetrators to seek to subvert more significant targets. It was only a matter of time until major Western powers began to feel the burn at home.\n## WikiSaudiLeaks The Yemen civil war was still fresh in March 2015. The Shi'ite Houthi rebels had taken over the capital city of Sanaa and ousted the Saudi-backed President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and its allies had launched a military offensive, Operation Decisive Storm, to counter the Iran-backed Houthi militias. Between March 26 and April 22, the Saudi-led airstrikes caused civil casualties and massive destruction across Yemen. The Saudi and Iranian interventions were, in some ways, only one episode in a long lineage of foreign interference in Yemen's affairs, some overt, others covert. Yet the escalating civil war offered the context for a new, unprecedented form of outside intervention -- one that remained shrouded in mystery for years.\nWikiSaudiLeaks unfolded in three episodes. First, a series of hacking incidents targeted both Iranian and Saudi-affiliated media outlets, suggesting patriotic hacker skirmishes on the margins of the Yemen conflict. The network intrusion soon reached the Saudi Ministry of Foreign affairs. Before long, in the second phase, troves of confidential cables from the Ministry were leaked to the public via WikiLeaks and other platforms. The third, and previously undiscussed, stage involved a disinformation campaign against a United Nations expert that Iran-affiliated media broadly promoted. The following sections offer a deep dive into these stages, outlining the technical, operational, and political context to each layer.\n### The hacks In March and April 2015, a series of hacking incidents started drawing attention to the unfolding conflict in Yemen. On April 12, defacements appeared on the English Twitter and YouTube accounts of Iran's state-backed, Arabic news channel Al-Alam. The defacements included images of Saudi leadership, messages in support of Operation Decisive Storm, and a false claim that the Iran-backed Houthi leader was dead. Other tweets sent from Al-Alam's Twitter account disclosed a purported list of correspondents of Al-Alam. Both Al-Alam and SaharTV, another Iranian state-backed television channel, confirmed the incident and blamed it on Saudi hackers.\nAn anonymous, self-described hacking entity, @Cyber__Emotion claimed responsibility for the attacks on Twitter. The entity's earliest publicly-known activities date back to 2014, when an actor with the same handle took over official Twitter accounts of Saudi ministries of justice and finance, questioning these institutions' lack of concern for cybersecurity. In 2016, the group allegedly compromised the official account of the Saudi Minister of Education, criticising his performance and demanding improvement in the national educational system.\nOnly a day after the Al-Alam defacements, a previously unheard of hacking group Yemen Cyber Army defaced the Saudi-owned Arabic news site Al-Hayat on April 13. The defacement announcement displayed a picture of the Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and a provocative pro-Shi'ite message against the kingdom and its allies, threatening that their time would soon be up. In addition to the defacement, the attackers leaked the names, email addresses, and hashed passwords of Al-Hayat users and subscribers.\nIran's semi-official news agency, Fars News, was among the first outlets to react to the incident. Fars News published an ‘exclusive' coverage of the Al-Hayat defacement, attributing the attack to Yemen Cyber Army without offering any evidence about the identity or background of the group. Fars News also linked to the Yemen Cyber Army's announcements and files on Pastebin, which is frequently used by hackers to claim responsibility for website defacements.\nThe only posts disseminating the Pastebin announcements came from @QuickLeakOrg, the associated Twitter account of QuickLeak[.]net. QuickLeak is a fringe, now-defunct whistleblowing site used in 2013 by an Iranian hacker group Parastoo to promote their defacements activities. QuickLeak.net was registered under an Iranian name -- the same person had also registered Zone-hc, another now-defunct Iranian site modelled after another defacement forum, Zone-H. The IP address of QuickLeak and its associated network of domains, including quickleak[.]org and Wikileak[.]ir, was hosted by Iran's main Internet Service Provider (ISP), Telecommunication Company of Iran (TCI). These details are circumstantial evidence that link the Al-Hayat defacement to an entity in Iran.\nThe Al-Alam and Al-Hayat intrusions resembled patriotic hacktivist skirmishes on the margins of an unfolding geopolitical regional conflict. However, subsequent events, circumstantial evidence, and other technical indicators led some investigators to Iran, with the Yemen Cyber Army as a possible front.\nThe Saudi-led Operation Decisive Storm in Yemen ended on April 22. It was immediately followed by Operation Restoring Hope, which purportedly sought to reduce the use of force in Yemen and move toward a political solution for the conflict.66 The Yemen Cyber Army, however, was not to let go of the feud as easily.\nAbout a month after the defacement of Al-Hayat, the Yemen Cyber Army defaced the website of Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) on May 20. The MOFA homepage displayed an animated image that announced the launch of Operation Hussein Badreddin al-Houthi, named after the assassinated leader of the Houthi insurgency. The image content was familiar. Similar to the Al-Hayat defacement, it included anti-Saudi messages and strong pro-Shi'ite imagery, including pictures of Iran's Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, and Hassan Nasrallah, secretary general of Lebanon's Hezbollah militia. The announcement also featured a Guy Fawkes-masked face, the uncanny symbol of hacking collective Anonymous, and Anonymous' famous slogan ‘We Don't Forget, We Don't Forgive'.\nThe Yemen Cyber Army promised to release a trove of encrypted data on Saudi diplomats, agents, and citizens, stolen from 3000 MOFA computers. That week, Yemen Cyber Army released two tranches of private information of citizens and MOFA personnel on Pastebin as password-protected files, the password included as well.67 In the Pastebin announcement perpetrators identified as ‘Cutting Sword of Justice', the same actor behind the 2012 attack on Saudi's national oil company, Aramco. The destructive attack against Aramco, dubbed ‘Shamoon', involved automated wiping of 30,000 business devices. U.S. intelligence community and cybersecurity researchers attributed the incident to Iranian state-affiliated actors.68 The day after the Pastebin announcement, on May 21, Iran's Fars News published yet another exclusive report on the hack, crediting the ominous Yemen Cyber Army.69 A subsequent report on May 21 included a Word file attachment that contained links to the leaked documents on several file-sharing sites and passwords to decompress encrypted files.70 Fars News branded these exclusive reports as ‘Saudileaks'. This was the first time that the term was used as far as public records show. Between May and August 2015, Fars News published 32 pieces on Saudi Leaks in the English language.\nAgain, @QuickLeakOrg sought to promote the Pastebin announcement and Fars News exclusives, aiming for maximum public attention to the intrusion. These tweets did not generate much engagement, however.71 Efforts by journalists to confirm the identity of the Yemen Cyber Army did not yield much information as the group refused to disclose their location or even speak Arabic to the press.72 The magnitude, format, and timing of the intrusion, coupled with other circumstantial evidence, suggested that the perpetrators, whoever they were, had pro-Houthi aspirations and were publicly challenging Saudis' ambitions in the Yemen conflict. For its part, the Saudi MOFA confirmed the attack on its website but downplayed the impact. The Ministry also warned against using and publishing any leaked material, describing the breach as a ‘plot of the nation's enemies' and promising legal action against perpetrators.73 ### The leaks Against the warnings of the Saudi government, however, two substantive leaks put the MOFA hack on the spotlight, challenging Saudi foreign policy and practices.\nOn 19 June 2015, WikiLeaks published over sixty thousand documents, titled as Saudi Cables, and promised half a million more to follow.74 These cables comprised more than confidential diplomatic correspondences, however. They also contained personal medical and legal records of survivors of sexual abuse, sick children, and the mentally ill, among others. The mixed nature of these cables raised concerns about WikiLeaks' precarious handling of private citizen information and prompted debates about the ethics of responsible leaks.75 WikiLeaks had previously released several controversial document sets from states and private companies. Though the whistleblowing platform had been relatively dormant for a couple of years before it published the Saudi Cables in 2015. In its press release, WikiLeaks acknowledged the Yemen Cyber Army as the initial source of ‘valuable sample documents' but did not disclose the source of the fresh trove, leaving the question of attribution unanswered. Upon the release of Saudi Cables, the Yemen Cyber Army went quiet and quit responding to media inquiries about their connection with the whistleblowing platform.\nThe Yemen Cyber Army partially came out of the dark on June 26 with the launch of their social media accounts and two now-defunct websites: Yemenica[.]com and wikisaleaks[.]com. Yemenica was a single-page site with a declaration from the group, describing itself as a ‘Yemeni youth community' united against the Saudi regime. Again, the description flashed back to a second group that claimed responsibility for the 2012 Shamoon attack, posing as Arab Youth Group. Notably, Yemenica had a Google Plus account, which at the time was the most popular social networking site among Iranian conservatives and was unaffected by Iran's infamous censorship practices.\nWikiSaudiLeaks presented an even more aggressive anti-Saudi manifesto: subtitled as Cyber Decisive Storm, the website header showed images of bombing of Yemen by Saudi-led forces in Operation Decisive Storm. It characterised the developments, in English, as a ‘barbaric Saudi-American aggression, with which the Israelites also stand'.\nWikiSaudiLeaks was likely an additional outlet to maximise attention to the leaked materials. The documents on the site were mostly in Arabic and had already been included in the WikiLeaks release. They were classified based on countries, regions, and international organisations such as the United Nations. The list began with old and current allies of the kingdom, including Qatar, the United States, Bahrain and Turkey. WikiSaudiLeaks also contained a dedicated category for ‘Persian Gulf Countries' -- a term that Iran has zealously used throughout the naming dispute with some Arab countries who have opted for alternatives such as ‘Arabian Gulf' or ‘Gulf'. These cues shed further light on the interests and motives of those behind WikiSaudiLeaks.\nWhoever spearheaded these leaks sought to alienate Saudi's allies, influence international audiences, and disrupt Saudi's strategic plans in Yemen. Several media partners of WikiLeaks, including the free press advocacy group Reporters Without Border, published selected materials and analyses about Saudi engagements internationally. While Western media broadly reported on the cables, the regional media remained divided on the matter according to traditional political lines. Pro-Saudi media, including Al-Hayat, reiterated the state warnings and refrained from circulating the leaked materials. The Iran-owned Al-Alam, on the other hand, extensively covered the cables. In the end, many Arabic language outlets chose not to cover Saudi Cables, presumably out of concern for legal and political retribution, leaving the regional impact of the leak rather unclear.\n### The sham The public attention to Saudi Cables was already subsiding when a fabricated news article briefly brought SaudiLeaks back to some headlines. On July 27, Another Western Dawn News (AWDNews), a fringe news site, published an article in English, accusing a United Nations (UN) official of receiving bribes for biased reporting against the Islamic Republic of Iran. According to the article, the Saudi embassy in Kuwait had allegedly paid Dr. Ahmad Shaheed, then UN Special Rapporteur for the Situation of Human Rights in Iran, 10 million dollars to increase international pressure on Iran for its violation of human rights. The report cited a scanned copy of a top secret document purportedly from the Saudi Cables on WikiLeaks. Contrary to the AWDNews claim, however, the ‘source' document in Arabic mentioned a million dollar -- not ten -- paid to Shaheed.\nRegardless of the discrepancy, the article prompted strong reactions inside and outside Iran. Human rights groups characterised the allegation as a sophisticated, state-directed smear campaign against Shaheed and critics of Iran's record of human rights. For years, the Islamic Republic has refused to collaborate with the UN Special Rapporteurs, accusing them of plotting with Iran's adversaries, including Saudi Arabia, for biased or fabricated reporting about the situation of human rights in Iran. This article, if true, would have been the perfect evidence for Iran's enduring righteousness. The bribery claim also aligned well with Saudi's previous attempts to grow its influence in the international human rights system. According to the WikiLeaks documents, in 2014 Saudi Arabia bartered votes with the United Kingdom and Russia to gain a seat at the UN Human Rights Council, despite its nefarious record at home.\nThe article rapidly circulated on other fringe news sites such as Al-Waqt and the Middle East Press. Iran's conservative media reacted immediately and amplified the news in Persian and Arabic languages, with some citing the original source site Al-Waie News. Among those were the Young Journalists Club, which is run by the IRIB, the state-owned broadcaster, and Tasnim News, another media affiliate of the IRGC. All of these platforms promoted the one-million-dollar bribe accusation.\nAmid public confusion and media inquiries, WikiLeaks refuted the claim that the document was one of the original Saudi Cables. In a tweet to online news site Iran Front Page, WikiLeaks challenged the authenticity of the alleged document. WikiLeaks stated: ‘@IranFrontPage Please Show Which Cable This Claim Is Based on. You Fail to Link to One of Our Cables in the Article', thus adding forgery to the puzzle of Saudi Leaks. Shaheed, for his part, personally thanked WikiLeaks for the clarification.\nIt took some time for attributive leads to emerge. Three years later, in August 2018, Facebook and Twitter announced their first takedown of state-linked assets from Iran. Among the 770 Iranian Twitter accounts removed were AWDNews, Al-Waie News, Al-Waqt, and Middle East Press, all of which had played a part in the smear campaign against the UN Special Rapporteur. In November 2020, U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) issued a warrant for seizure of 29 domains for being part of the Liberty Front Press network, the same media network that Meta, Twitter, FireEye, and ClearSky had previously attributed to Iran. In an accompanying affidavit, the DOJ asserted that each of the seized domains was ‘fraudulently registered' due to each being used by or on behalf of the IRGC. AWDNews[.]com was among the seized domains.\nDid the perpetrators behind the MOFA breach and the subsequent leak plan the forgery and disinformation campaign ahead of time, or was it an afterthought? The answer is unclear. But the disinformation campaign demonstrates how hack-and-leak events can catalyse cultivating false information to new and existing audiences. Once a breach happens and secrets spill into the public domain, related but fabricated stories become more believable and harder to debunk. Actors with no stake in the previous events may also seize the opportunity to harvest the outcome of hack-and-leaks.\nThe same actor(s) may not have been behind the three stages of Saudi Leaks. The forgery may have been devised on the fly. What is established, however, is that Iran's IRGC was behind the disinformation campaign. The manipulation of leaked material signals Iran's interest and capacity in leveraging the output of hack-and-leak events for influencing domestic and international audiences and antagonising Saudi allies.\n## Competing hypotheses: a framework for analysis The multi-stage nature of the WikiSaudiLeaks event calls for a multi-stage attribution. Thus far, there is only decisive evidence for attributing the forgery to Iran based on Twitter and Facebook takedowns and DOJ's attribution. Yemen Cyber Army's lack of any historical background has bolstered speculations that it was a front for other prominent actors with resources, motives, and ambitions for such an undertaking. The attribution of the MOFA hack and the leaks has remained divergent. As the following passages indicate, existing research points to Iran and Russia as the two main culprits. Other possibilities include Yemeni hackers or a collaboration among different actors. This section considers possible hints for attributing the breach into the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs network and the leaks that ensued.\nThe breach There are two possibilities with regard to the breach of the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The first hypothesis is that Iran breached the ministry's networks. This scenario would be in-line with Iran's involvement in a wider espionage operation that targeted government, military, and critical infrastructure targets across the Middle East between 2013 and 2015.\nIn June 2015, cybersecurity firm ClearSky published a report on an operation that had been in progress since mid 2014. ClearSky dubbed the alleged campaign ‘Thamar Reservoir' and pointed out a variety of targets of high interest to Iranian politics. These targets included international relations and defence professionals from Saudi Arabia, Israel, and elsewhere in the Middle East. The campaign utilised a range of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), including social engineering and spear phishing, mostly through Google services. ClearSky attributed Thamar Reservoir with high confidence to Iranian actors due to its considerable similarities of TTPs and overlapping infrastructure with previous operations also attributed to Iranian actors like Rocket Kitten and AjaxTeam.\nAnother cybersecurity company, Cylance, dubbed a related campaign ‘Operation Cleaver'. Cleaver included targets from Saudi Arabia's oil and gas and transportation industries in 2013--14. Among the TTPs used in Operation Cleaver, one particularly stands out. The threat actor predominantly used spear phishing to deceive targets to visit a job search website and submit their resumes. The scheme used an imposter of a legitimate professional development service winresume[.]com and its Easy Resume Creator Pro service to lure job candidates to download and install malware TinyZBot. The threat actor attempted to deceive its targets by convincing them they had a pending job opportunity at the industrial group Teledyne, through fake domains such as Teledyne-Jobs[.]com. To know more about the opportunity, the target had to use the malicious resume submission service. One of the Saudi cables later released by WikiLeaks suggests that a threat actor had used this very tactic to breach the Saudi MOFA network months before the May 2015 intrusion.\nIn January 2015, Saudi MOFA internally circulated a 14-page incident response report, describing an attack on the ministry's network that had started on 20 July 2014 (10 months before the May 2015 attack). The report, which is included in one of the Saudi cables, indicates that the system administrator of MOFA had received a targeted email with a job opportunity from the fictitious employer Teledyne. The target fell for the scheme and his machine was infected with the TinyZBot malware, which prompted data exfiltration from his device.\nThe ministry, however, only noticed the compromise in November 2014, when it detected failed proxy connections between the system admin computer and a suspicious server. 88.150.214.166 was the IP address of the server, which corresponds to that of the malicious domain Teledyne-Jobs[.]com, reportedly created by Iranian hackers. Outed by Cylance's Operation Cleaver report on 2 December 2014, the fake website stopped working on the same day. The MOFA report does not identify the extent of data exfiltration and network impact. But the document repeatedly cites Operation Cleaver, expressly attributing the attack to Iranian actors.\nThe public-facing WikiSaudiLeaks event started only in April 2015, but these technical reports put forward an alternative possibility. That is the attackers may have exfiltrated the diplomatic cables from the MOFA network earlier but held onto them until the Yemen conflict began to complicate regional geopolitics. This tactic resembles the hacking of Britam Defense. The company was hacked in November 2012 but the perpetrators held onto the stolen material until January 2013, when a U.S. military strike in Syria seemed looming. This significant time-delay is another indication of a professional intelligence agency tradecraft, as activists or militants likely would have acted more swiftly on a whim.\n## Russia The Saudi MOFA was of interest to the Russian actors, too. Russia is known to have engaged in reconnaissance and espionage activities against Middle Eastern targets in the spring of 2015.\nFANCY BEAR, also known as Sofacy or APT 28, a unit of Russia's military intelligence agency (GRU), reportedly breached the Saudi embassy in Ukraine in February 2015. The exclusive use of this vulnerability by FANCY BEAR until April 2015 has led researchers to entertain the possibility that Russia may also be responsible for the breach of the Saudi MOFA's network in the WikiSaudiLeaks event.\nThe attack infrastructure in the GRU campaign also contains noteworthy overlaps with the ominous Yemen Cyber Army. Wikisaleaks, the website ostensibly run by Yemen Cyber Army, was registered on the same range of IP addresses linked to FANCY BEAR in 2015. The address is part of a range of 256 at Lithuanian hosting provider UAB DUOMENU CENTRAS, leased to an intermediary company, MonoVM. The company offers a range of services, including dedicated servers and web hosting. In May 2015, it still accepted a variety of crypto currencies, such as Bitcoin and Skrill, to process transactions. These decentralised methods of payment have been appealing to Russian actors for purchasing the infrastructure for hacking operations. The domain MonoVM[.]com has been registered with a Dubai address, but it appears to be owned or managed by Iranian individuals. The registrant details also include information about another hosting company, Azar Online, registered under the same Persian names. Azar Online appears to be an ISP in Tabriz, the capital of Eastern Azerbaijan province in Iran.\nLater disclosures established even more links between MonoVM and Iran. In December 2020, amid then-President Trump and his close allies' allegations of election fraud, a new website emerged with a hit list of U.S. officials that refuted Trump's claims. *Enemies of the People* sought to incite violence and wreak havoc in the United States. The Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) quickly attributed this operation to Iran. One of the associated domains of Enemies of the People website was hosted on MonoVM.\nIt is possible that FANCY BEAR used MonoVM, likely an Iranian company, for its espionage operations while masquerading as Yemen Cyber Army. FANCY BEAR has utilised the same technique, known as false flag, with other fronts such as the CyberBerkut and CyberCaliphate -- two GRU front groups that emerged in 2014. An alternative possibility, however, is that other actors, including Iranians, utilised MonoVM services for their purposes around the same time, thus creating a false flag, likely unintentionally.\nLater events suggested a third hypothesis. In 2019, another Russian actor, Turla (aka Snake), identified as Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), was detected to have hijacked the technical infrastructure of OilRig, an Iranian threat actor, for espionage attacks in 2017 and early 2018. In October 2019, US and UK intelligence services confirmed that Turla had exploited the command and control and operational infrastructure of Iranian actors to expand its network of victims.\nTurla had previously targeted entities in 45 countries in 2015, including governments, military organisations, and research institutions. Most of these victims were located in the Middle East and Europe. There is no evidence for such hijacking of infrastructure prior to 2017. Though it is possible that Turla, or other Russian actors, might have co-opted TTPs of Iranian actors in an effort to further obfuscate attribution for WikiSaudiLeaks. For example, Turla has used a variant of Mimikatz, a commonplace hacking tool used extensively by different actors, which was also previously used by Iranian actors in Operation Cleaver. A fourth possibility could be that the two groups, Iranians and Russians, may have been collaborating in some capacity.\n### The leaks Attribution of the leaks remains challenging, in large part due to limited evidence available on the details of the transfer of Saudi Cables to WikiLeaks and WikiSaudiLeaks websites. This gap is perpetuated by three factors. First, wikisaleaks[.]com was registered on the same IP range as the Russian C2 infrastructure in 2015. Second, yemenica[.]com, the other website of the Yemen Cyber Army, was registered with an email address from the Russian webmail provider, Yandex.\na report from 2019 suggests that two weeks after the release of Saudi Cables in June 2015, WikiLeaks moved its web hosting infrastructure to a new server in Russia. Prior to the transfer, however, the same IP address hosted a fake domain that had been associated with phishing attacks by the Iranian Rocket Kitten until May 2015. This suggests that WikiLeaks may have collaborated with the Iranian hackers for the intrusion of Saudi MOFA, or coordinated for the transfer of stolen documents. It could also entirely be a coincidence. As with MonoVM, different actors may have used the same infrastructure for their preferred setup and reliability.\n## Five vectors for a deconstructed approach to attribution Our analysis of competing hypotheses illustrates that evidence on the technical, operational, and political aspects of the WikiSaudiLeaks events point to more than a single suspect. In entertaining these hypotheses, we consider a multi-factor framework that includes the history of different actors in undertaking hack-and-leak operations, motivation, messaging, capabilities (technical and otherwise), and infrastructure. Together, these indicators pave the ground for addressing the question of ‘who did it', with Iran, Russia, or the Yemen Cyber Army as the most likely culprits.\n### History In assessing a threat actor's history, we first consider past behaviour that tracks with the tradecraft used in the case in question. Out of the three likely culprits, Iran and Russia had previously engaged in computer network exploitation (CNE) against a variety of adversaries, in particular diplomatic targets from the Middle East. Moreover, they both had previously used fictitious fronts in CNE and computer network attack (CNA) operations. Iranian Charming Kitten (APT33) had targeted Saudi Aramco in 2012, posing as the Cutting Sword of Justice and Arab Youth Group. Russia, too, has a history of using front groups for active measures. Cyber Berkut was a Russian scheme, posing as an anti-Ukraine hacktivist group to target the websites of NATO and several German officials in March 2014 and January 2015, respectively. CyberCaliphate, a seemingly ISIS-associated group, breached TV5 Monde, a major French television network with global coverage, resulting in network disruption for hours in April 2015. The ominous Yemen Cyber Army, however, lacks any history prior to WikiSaudiLeaks, which bolsters the possibility of a front for other more established actors, like Iran or Russia.\n### Motivation Second, we investigate the motivation which refers to a perpetrator's interest in conducting certain actions in a geopolitical context. WikiSaudiLeaks was a retaliatory response to the Saudis for their intervention in the Yemen conflict. In principle, the Houthi rebels and Iran would have both benefited from the collapse of the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen. While Russia has taken an intermediary role in Yemen to avoid direct conflict, the failure of a key US ally would still serve Russia's political and economic objectives in the region. Moreover, Iran and Russia's decisive intervention in Syria in support of the Assad regime has been met with unwavering opposition from Saudi Arabia and the United States, with either side accusing the other of supporting ‘terrorists'. The humiliating hack-and-leak events of WikiSaudiLeaks thus serve both Iran and Russia's vengeance toward Saudi Arabia.\n### Messaging Third, we turn to messaging which relates to the semantics and semiotics of the behaviour. The language, signs, and other cues used to communicate with the audience often contain clues about the actor. The WikiSaudiLeaks operators used a consistent anti-Saudi tone in all stages: the hacking of Al-Hayat and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, promoting the leaked material, and the disinformation campaign. They conveyed resistance to the Saudi intervention in Yemen, with an obvious emphasis on pro-Iranian and pro-Shi'ite sentiments. In addition, the Iranian state media network was the first to systematically cover ‘Saudileaks' in English, weeks before WikiLeaks and other outlets did. At the very least, the zealous communication underscores Iran's vested interest in the incident. This is not to say that the same operators were behind the publication of the leaked material. However, these considerations along with the history and motivation factors skew the attribution assessment toward Iran. Admittedly, some of these details can be manipulated to falsely point in a certain direction and obfuscate attribution. Using a geopolitical cover makes attribution of a false flag operation particularly challenging.\n### Capability Fourth, capability entails the technical expertise, economic and human resources, and enterprising networks of operators and media affiliates that enable a malicious operation. The WikiSaudiLeaks event suggests coordination among a network of operators on different levels, each marshalling a variety of skill sets. Each stage required capabilities that both Iran and Russia demonstrated before. Yet these factors seem far less viable for the Yemen Cyber Army due to its lack of history.\n### Infrastructure Lastly, the infrastructure factor concerns the foundations for physical and virtual communication used to deliver a technical capability or maintain the command and control of capabilities. These structures include electronic devices, servers, domain tools, online services, and social media accounts, to name a few, that attackers can buy, lease, share, compromise, and repurpose to develop their infrastructure. In hack-and-leak operations, the infrastructure for the intrusion may not be the same as what is used for the leak. It is also possible that different actors use the same infrastructure at different points in time.\nAs with WikiSaudiLeaks, possible overlap of infrastructures can significantly impede detection and attribution. The wikisaleaks[.]com domain, one of the websites affiliated with Yemen Cyber Army, was registered at an IP address from likely-Iranian hosting company MonoVM. The IP address also intersected with the Russian infrastructure used to target the Saudi embassy in Ukraine in early 2015. It is entirely plausible, then, that Iranian and Russian actors were using web services offered by the same provider around the same time, hence the overlapping IP addresses. However, it is not possible to determine whether this infrastructure switch was intentional or merely a coincidence.\nConsidered together, history, motivation, messaging, capability, and infrastructure provide a framework for examining the competing hypotheses about attribution. Proper synthesis of these details is not possible with the same level of certainty across the WikiSaudiLeaks event. In attributing a multi-stage incident, we propose to assess each stage (the hack and the leak) against these five indicators. Tables 1 and 2 summarise the degree to which each stage of the WikiSaudiLeaks event can be attributed to three likely perpetrators: Yemen Cyber Army, Iran, and Russia.\nAs Tables 1 and 2 indicate, the Yemen Cyber Army has the lowest chance of being a real culprit. Lack of history and information about the group increases the possibility that it may have been a fictitious front for other perpetrators. The network intrusion can be attributed to Iran and Russia with varying degrees of confidence. Attributing the leak is not as straightforward, however. There is limited evidence of politically motivated leaks by Iranian actors unless Iran was indeed behind the attack on Britam Defence in 2013. While Russia has a long history of leaks during the Cold War and the pre-Internet days, there is limited credible evidence on Russia's involvement in cyber-enabled leaks prior to the attack on the DNC in 2016. Other indicators -- such as pro-Iran messaging, subtle cues from wikisaleaks[.]com, and the extensive coverage of the leaks by state-affiliated media early on -- can be taken as the involvement of Iran on some level. Last but not least, Iran is responsible for the forgery and disinformation campaign that came out of the WikiSaudiLeaks event.

Possible forgeries among the leaked data and plausible false flags add to the complications of attribution. The same actor(s) may not be behind seemingly related events. Distinguishing these actors from one another also comes with particular complexities. In this context, de-layering the attribution process and investigating each layer separately facilitate the assessment. The outcome may be varying degrees of confidence in the attribution of each stage, which in turn helps to identify the gaps in the attribution of digital covert action. The case of WikiSaudiLeaks captures these nuances.\nOn the strategic level, attribution remains a political decision based on information collated by intelligence and security agencies or influenced by foreign policy considerations.¹³⁴ It delineates red lines and weighs a set of legitimate responses to the attack.¹³⁵ In the case of WikiSaudiLeaks, affected state parties did not publicly attribute this case. Saudi officials offered little public communication regarding the source of the intrusion. Nor did allies of the kingdom with prominent cyber capabilities, such as the United States, release high level technical or intelligence assessments about WikiSaudiLeaks. Instead, speculative attribution was done by cyber security firms and individual researchers, who lack the authority and means to collect the signal and human intelligence necessary to reliably attribute an attack to a state.¹³⁶\nStrategic attribution comes at a cost, politically and logistically. It requires multiple government agencies and often private sector firms working together, often across borders, utilising their intelligence sources and methods. While there is no consistent approach to attributing cyber attacks among states, an incident is more likely to invoke attribution by states if it passes a two-fold test of significance: (1) the nature and severity of the attack, and (2) the affected parties and implications for their national security. In other words, who is targeted and how they are targeted are the key questions that can invoke an attribution response by states and their allies. The closer an attack hits one's home, the more likely that the state gets involved. Thus, the target and severity of cyber-enabled covert action affect the decision to expend resources on public attribution. WikiSaudiLeaks may not have passed this test.\nWhy was the campaign not conclusively attributed? First, the forensic evidence did not unambiguously point to a single adversary at any given moment.¹³⁷ Second, the entire event, it appears, was not consequential enough at any given moment in time for the Saudi government to initiate a more determined investigation and response. Lastly, although the attack was politically embarrassing, it seems that it did not constitute a sufficiently severe national security threat to Saudi Arabia to escalate to an international investigation with support from more experienced and capable allies.\nYet WikiSaudiLeaks set an internationally consequential precedent. It was highly likely the first state-enabled hack-and-leak operation that utilised WikiLeaks as an amplifying platform, a tactic that was most notably used just one year later in the most tectonic digital covert campaign of our times, the DNC hack-and-leak. In hindsight, it may have been a strategic shortcoming on the part of the US and UK intelligence communities not to have partnered with Saudi intelligence for a more robust response to WikiSaudiLeaks. Both countries, after all, became the target of Russian and Iranian active measures in the 2016, 2018, and 2019 elections, respectively. The episode nevertheless underscores the significance of coalitions and partnerships, especially if a targeted government does not possess mature capabilities and experience in attribution. WikiSaudiLeaks came before the consolidation of such theories as persistent engagement and defend forward in U.S. cyber strategy. With the benefit of hindsight, the same attack on an ally's integrity today may -- and should -- prompt a more mature response from FiveEyes partners and other open societies.\n## Conclusion\nCovert action is a political instrument. Hack-and-leak incidents may be designed to mess with regional and international politics by ‘inflaming existing contradictions', to use the old Soviet terminology once honed by KGB's Service A, history's most advanced disinformation bureaucracy. Hack-and-leak operations are only technically upgraded iterations of Cold War collect-and-leak operations. Since at least 2013, predominantly authoritarian governments have deployed hack-and-leak operations amid geopolitical crises against a range of adversaries. WikiSaudiLeaks is the pivotal historic example.\nThe multi-stage nature of digital covert action requires a multi-stage attribution process. This process extends across technical, operational, and strategic levels. Such all-source analysis must still cut across often hardwearing disciplinary boundaries between the kind of digital forensics commonly used in incident response and threat intelligence reporting and the kind of digital forensics commonly used to investigate influence operations (IO) and disinformation. Moreover, a single confidence score may not be appropriate for multi-stage events. That is, analysis of one stage may produce a degree of confidence that differs from other components of the same event. Worse, in extreme cases different components of what might appear as one campaign can be perpetrated by different actors, even unbeknownst to each other.\nWikiSaudiLeaks was strategically designed to inflame contradictions in Saudi Arabia, a party to the Yemen conflict, to wedge open its alliances, and rally international public opinion against the kingdom. The evidence available to us does not allow for definitive attribution for the entire WikiSaudiLeaks event. Instead, a multi-stage all-source investigation offers more details about each component. Each stage requires exploring a different set of forensic artefacts, as well as considering separate tactical, operational, and strategic aspects. The Saudi MOFA-related intrusions could be attributed, based on circumstantial evidence, to either Iran or Russia, possibly even both. The lack of forensic evidence about the provenance of the leaks adds to the challenge of attributing the campaign's exposure stage. However, Iran and Russia remain the most likely culprits, with some circumstantial evidence pointing to Iran. The final stage, the digital disinformation and amplification campaign, can be confidently attributed to Iran, given the abundant evidence exposed by social media companies. A multi-stage event, therefore, requires a multi-stage attribution process -- one that allows for gradients of attribution within each stage.\nThere are three non-exclusive explanations for why WikiSaudiLeaks was not attributed with high confidence to a specific adversary. First, the target, in this case Saudi Arabia, did not have sufficient political determination to perform public attribution. Amid the Yemen conflict, the kingdom was intent on minimising attention to the Saudi Cables and staying on message about the unravelling proxy war with Iran. Second, Saudi Arabia and interested third parties -- including the United States -- likely had insufficient incentive to unlock the attributive resources required to link the campaign to a specific adversary. Access to attributive capabilities consists of both access to a range of forensic\nartefacts and access to the skills and experience necessary to acquire, develop, cross-reference, process, analyse, contextualise, and interpret relevant signals and artefacts. Finally, the WikiSaudiLeaks campaign exhibited features that made the overall event exceptionally hard to attribute to one specific adversary. It is highly likely that these features were partly intended by at least one adversary, and partly unintended.\nMinimising uncertainty is the primary undertaking of attribution. Yet it is a highly complex and nuanced process. Technical forensic artefacts, if inconclusive, must be considered together with other data, obtained from a variety of sources, collected both passively and actively. The delayed nature of attribution further complicates the task. Additional useful details may only become available months or even years later, as our case illustrates, thus rendering early judgements incomplete. False flags, or suspicion thereof, and other challenges can significantly complicate attribution and the response it may require.\nAttributing twenty-first century covert action -- integrated campaigns that have a CNE, CNA, and possibly an IO component -- in a nutshell, is an art and a science and, above all, an all-source enterprise and as such vastly different from attributing narrow computer network breaches. In this attribution process, analysts will have to be ready to disentangle some campaigns, assessing, analysing and attributing their respective components -- the hack, forge, leak, amplify -- on their own merits. Attributing one or multiple components may be easy or hard, linking them together is a separate challenge yet. Adversaries, in turn, may take advantage of this layered attribution challenge.\nWikiSaudiLeaks came before its time, as the analytic toolsets and the strategic and investigative approaches necessary to understand and attribute this event have continued to mature after the fact. After all, it was only around 2016 that security firms started seriously integrating CNE and IO in their public-facing investigative work, with Mandiant among the first,^{142} and Microsoft^{143} and later Google^{144} following suit. Nor did the US government adopt the strategies of persistent engagement and defend forward until 2018,^{145} three years after WikiSaudiLeaks.\nSaudi Cables, in hindsight, was a chameleon that appeared as a different thing against different backdrops: seen in the WikiLeaks context, it appeared as innocent transparency activism; in the website defacement context, it appeared as patriot hacker skirmishes; and viewed against the foil of expanding digital covert action, it appeared as a campaign of at least one authoritarian intelligence agency.",

    "## Introduction What was WikiSaudiLeaks and why was it so hard to attribute? This paper revisits one of the most complex, most significant, and most mysterious hack-and-leak puzzles of our time, a 2015 case known among investigators as ‘WikiSaudiLeaks'. The name refers to a mysterious website that surfaced and disseminated a major trove of files taken from the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The site's operators curiously claimed to have given the stolen documents to WikiLeaks, which claimed to have published 122,619 files by year's end.1 Subsequently, the material received high profile press coverage2 and became known as ‘The Saudi Cables'.": "WikiSaudiLeaks is an early example of a fundamental yet neglected attribution challenge.3 The event was not unified. The leak was part of a larger covert action campaign that involved advanced computer network exploitation, computer network attack, persistent deception, and a creative influence and disinformation effort.4 Yet so far neither scholars nor investigators from public or private sector have been able to conclusively attribute WikiSaudiLeaks to a specific threat actor -- in sharp contrast to most other comparable high-profile cases. Why? Because the leak does nothing less than challenge the established attribution paradigm. Hack-and-leak events are not widely discussed, and existing scholarship tends to focus on the interplay between intrusion and influence, while neglecting the consequences for attribution.5 What if a single attribution statement for digital covert action is not possible in the first place?\nWikiSaudiLeaks happened just as the goldilocks moment of digital covert action was ending: about a year before the Russian election interference in the United States, when bulk leaks were still seen as innocent expressions of transparency activism; and just two years after Mandiant's APT1 report,6 when the public attribution debate and capabilities were still in their infancy. Later events have motivated prolific scholarship, most prominently the Democratic National Committee (DNC) hack-and-leak.7 Yet some of the earliest and most significant instances of digital covert action remain understudied. It is time to revise the WikiSaudiLeaks case, and with it our understanding of attributing covert action.\nDigital covert action was on the rise throughout the 2010s, with hack-and-leak operations making up a significant share. This rise is enabled, but insufficiently explained, by technological change. A list of the major hits would include the late 2000s campaign known as Stuxnet; various wiping attacks against Iranian targets in 2011; the 2012 attack against Saudi Aramco and Rasgas; the neglected 2013 Britam Defence leak; the 2014 Sony Pictures Entertainment breach-and-leak;; two remarkable blackouts in Kiev in 2015 and 2016 as well as numerous other operations in Ukraine; the series of breach-and-leak operations against the US election in 2016; the mysterious series of Shadow Brokers leaks; the ransomware attacks known as Wannacry and NotPetya in 2017, one executed poorly, the other deceptively; the Viasat sabotage at the outset of the Ukraine War in 2022, and several more, some of them subtle, others as yet not publicly discussed. The continuous and dynamic nature of such offensive activity helped give rise to the concepts of ‘persistent engagement' and ‘defend forward' in the U.S. government, in which attribution played a key role. Indeed all these major cases had one core feature in common: governments, and in many cases independent researchers, have attributed them with high confidence or even certainty to specific adversaries.\nYet WikiSaudiLeaks stands out: not only has it not been attributed with confidence, the case is also curiously understudied. Both absences are all the more remarkable given that the covert action has generated an extraordinary amount of media coverage, with hundreds of press stories. The ensuing leak is also infamous as one of the most unethical and extreme so far, releasing unredacted cables that included full names and passport numbers of victims of torture and sexual abuse.\nWhy was the campaign not attributed so far? What can this curious case tell us about the past and future of attributing computer network operations in general and covert action specifically? And, of course: who was responsible for WikiSaudiLeaks?\nWe argue that by breaking down the larger event into its components, limited attribution becomes possible. To understand the saga that is Wikisaudileaks, investigators must first deconstruct what appears to be one coherent event into its constituent components: collection, disclosure, and amplification. Each component, counterintuitively, may not only come with a specific confidence level; it may also lead to diverging and separate attribution assessments. What looks like one operation at a first glance, with closer inspection may, in fact, collapse into multiple operations. The limited scholarship on this case has entertained the possibility of Russian involvement. We attribute at least one component of the larger covert action to Iran.\nAttribution is what states make of it. The outcome of an attributive investigation into a major computer network breach is determined by resources and political priorities, both on the side of the victim and on the side of the perpetrator. The perpetrator plans and equips a clandestine or covert operation to sustain deniability -- the victim plans and equips investigative and analytical outfits to take deniability away. The decision to publicly attribute, however, is correlated with such factors as incident severity, geopolitical circumstances, the intelligence available on the case, technical and operational capacity, and the political will of those involved in the attribution process. The WikiSaudiLeaks event puts the interaction of these indicators to test and underscores several gaps in the attribution process.\nThe paper proceeds in four steps. First we provide context to hack-and-leak operations in the Middle East by revisiting a neglected case from 2013, the earliest known instance of a hack-and-leak. We then offer a granular analysis of the WikiSaudiLeaks event, unmasking a related disinformation campaign that so far has not been covered in public or confidential reporting on the case. The third section reviews competing hypotheses in the attribution of WikiSaudiLeaks, followed by a framework for attribution of different stages of the covert action. We close by discussing the challenges of attribution of this particular case and, more broadly, digital covert action.",
    "## Prelude Hack-and-leak operations have become ever more common since 2013, globally and especially in the Middle East.

The offenders' precise intentions are likely to remain obscure in the absence of direct intelligence access or declassified archival records. Historically, however, it was often ‘throwaway' -- files that no longer served a narrow intelligence purpose -- that were used to furnish the content for targeted leaks. Particularly noteworthy in this context were the Shaltai Boltai disclosures in Russia, and, a few months after WikiSaudiLeaks, in October 2015, the unattributed and fairly obscure ‘Turok' FSB leak. These operations often seek to undermine an adversary's decision-making, political cohesion, domestic public opinion, leaders, reputation, and alliances.\nWhat follows is a prelude to the WikiSaudiLeaks event, similarly involving a regional conflict in the Middle East, equally neglected, and inconclusively attributed.\n### Britam defense The earliest known major case of hack-and-leak operations in the Middle East dates back to the early 2010s. The context for the case was the civil war in Syria. In July 2012, the Syrian government acknowledged that it had chemical weapons in its possession though it would never deploy such weapons against its own citizens but only against foreign intervention. In August, then-President Barack Obama warned the Bashar al-Assad regime that any use of chemical weapons in Syria would significantly change his calculus on a U.S. military response. The prospect of a U.S. strike in Syria concerned Assad's key allies, Iran and Russia, who have remained staunch supporters of the Syrian government since the beginning of the conflict in early 2011.\nThe first allegation of use of chemical weapons in Syria was reported in the city of Homs on 23 December 2012. The news rippled through the region and beyond. On 15 January 2013, an anonymous source alleged to Foreign Policy that the State Department had compelling evidence to attribute the chemical attack to the Syrian military. These unverified, controversial claims raised speculations that a U.S. military strike in Syria might be imminent.\nThen, on 22 January, a mysterious post appeared on Pastebin, a widely used disclosure and documentation platform, titled ‘Millitary server hacked. Confidential data!‘ An entity calling itself ‘JAsIrX' posted a short note in broken English, about 130 words, with no fewer than 51 URLs to file-sharing sites. The note was crude, and claimed that Britam Defence, a UK-based military contractor, ‘killed Arabs in Iraq and plans to invade in Iran and Syria'.\nShortly after, around 24 January, a report appeared on the obscure site cyberwarnews[.]info, claiming that Britam had been hacked. On 28 January 2013, conspiracy theory websites started covering the leak. The niche site whatdoesitmean[.]com headlined: ‘Obama Plan for World War III Stuns Russia'. That same day Infowars titled: ‘Hacked Emails Reveal “Washington-Approved” Plan to Stage Chemical Weapons Attack in Syria'.\nThe following day the story went mainstream. The Daily Mail, one of the UK's most-read tabloids, blasted: ‘U.S. “backed plan to launch chemical weapon attack on Syria and blame it on Assad's regime”'. The report in the Mail cited an email exchange from the previous month, allegedly among a group of senior managers at Britam. The exchange suspiciously mentioned a proposal that Britam would supply chemical weapons to Syria, while posing as Russian mercenaries, in exchange for a significant amount of money. The Daily Mail in turn linked to the initial report in Cyber War News that took the leak at face value.\nBritam, in fact, was targeted by a successful hack-leak-forge operation. An unknown attacker had breached Britam's email, likely in November 2012. On January 22 the perpetrators, calling themselves ‘JAsIrX', started posting internal documents from Britam on Pastebin. One email exchange from October 2012 purported to link Britam to a military training project in Saudi Arabia to increase readiness for a possible strike by Iran. Another exchange claimed a U.S.-backed proposal to Britam to ‘deliver a CW to Homs' and deploy its Ukrainian personnel to pose as Russian mercenaries The fabricated incriminating emails appeared to have been sent two months apart from one another; yet both digital artefacts shared the same unique message identity number, and had the exact same ‘sent' timestamp, at 23:57:18. Similarly, the documents pertaining to the Saudi military project were created and modified in short succession on Friday, 18 January 2013 at 12:00 GMT. The suspicious content, combined with the suspicious metadata, makes it highly likely that these forged documents sought to falsely incriminate the company in a plot against the United States and Saudi Arabia.\nThe story immediately appeared on Press TV, the English language branch of the state-run broadcaster, Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB). Press TV took a hard anti-Western position, noting the timing as ‘the Syrian army forces have managed to clear the capital, Damascus and its surrounding areas of the militants and restore security'. Seeking renewed attention to the case, Fars News, a key media affiliate of Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), republished the allegations in August 2013, citing whatdoesitmean. Other Iranian hardliner news sites, notably Mehr News, echoed the recycled article, but the story did not gain much attention.\nAttribution in the case of the Britam hack-leak-forge remained vague. A Sunday Times article entertained the possibility of Iran's involvement, but offered no solid sourcing or evidence. There is limited public technical forensics available about the attack. But contextual and operational cues, such as Iran's high stakes in Syria and the unusual media coverage by state-affiliated outlets, support the Iran hypothesis.\nEither way, the incident was the first major hack-and-leak operation that involved a variety of state and nonstate actors in Middle East politics. Whoever was behind the operation had a vested interest in implicating the United States in the use of chemical weapons in Syria, and in detracting from the truth. The event unfolded in multiple stages. The perpetrator conducted a network intrusion and collected data on the target ahead of time, manipulated the data to take advantage of geopolitical developments in the region, and promptly released the stolen (and forged) materials to maximise the believability of the plot. These same features were also on display in the WikiSaudiLeaks operation that hit Saudi Arabia two years later. Similarly, both cases remain shrouded in mystery with no conclusive attribution.\nIn both events, adversarial actors were only beginning to flex technical resources to advance geopolitical motives through digital covert action. Inconclusive attribution in those early days extended the opportunity to the perpetrators to seek to subvert more significant targets. It was only a matter of time until major Western powers began to feel the burn at home.",
    "## WikiSaudiLeaks The Yemen civil war was still fresh in March 2015. The Shi'ite Houthi rebels had taken over the capital city of Sanaa and ousted the Saudi-backed President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and its allies had launched a military offensive, Operation Decisive Storm, to counter the Iran-backed Houthi militias. Between March 26 and April 22, the Saudi-led airstrikes caused civil casualties and massive destruction across Yemen. The Saudi and Iranian interventions were, in some ways, only one episode in a long lineage of foreign interference in Yemen's affairs, some overt, others covert. Yet the escalating civil war offered the context for a new, unprecedented form of outside intervention -- one that remained shrouded in mystery for years.": "WikiSaudiLeaks unfolded in three episodes. First, a series of hacking incidents targeted both Iranian and Saudi-affiliated media outlets, suggesting patriotic hacker skirmishes on the margins of the Yemen conflict. The network intrusion soon reached the Saudi Ministry of Foreign affairs. Before long, in the second phase, troves of confidential cables from the Ministry were leaked to the public via WikiLeaks and other platforms. The third, and previously undiscussed, stage involved a disinformation campaign against a United Nations expert that Iran-affiliated media broadly promoted. The following sections offer a deep dive into these stages, outlining the technical, operational, and political context to each layer.\n### The hacks In March and April 2015, a series of hacking incidents started drawing attention to the unfolding conflict in Yemen. On April 12, defacements appeared on the English Twitter and YouTube accounts of Iran's state-backed, Arabic news channel Al-Alam. The defacements included images of Saudi leadership, messages in support of Operation Decisive Storm, and a false claim that the Iran-backed Houthi leader was dead. Other tweets sent from Al-Alam's Twitter account disclosed a purported list of correspondents of Al-Alam. Both Al-Alam and SaharTV, another Iranian state-backed television channel, confirmed the incident and blamed it on Saudi hackers.\nAn anonymous, self-described hacking entity, @Cyber__Emotion claimed responsibility for the attacks on Twitter. The entity's earliest publicly-known activities date back to 2014, when an actor with the same handle took over official Twitter accounts of Saudi ministries of justice and finance, questioning these institutions' lack of concern for cybersecurity. In 2016, the group allegedly compromised the official account of the Saudi Minister of Education, criticising his performance and demanding improvement in the national educational system.\nOnly a day after the Al-Alam defacements, a previously unheard of hacking group Yemen Cyber Army defaced the Saudi-owned Arabic news site Al-Hayat on April 13. The defacement announcement displayed a picture of the Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and a provocative pro-Shi'ite message against the kingdom and its allies, threatening that their time would soon be up. In addition to the defacement, the attackers leaked the names, email addresses, and hashed passwords of Al-Hayat users and subscribers.\nIran's semi-official news agency, Fars News, was among the first outlets to react to the incident. Fars News published an ‘exclusive' coverage of the Al-Hayat defacement, attributing the attack to Yemen Cyber Army without offering any evidence about the identity or background of the group. Fars News also linked to the Yemen Cyber Army's announcements and files on Pastebin, which is frequently used by hackers to claim responsibility for website defacements.\nThe only posts disseminating the Pastebin announcements came from @QuickLeakOrg, the associated Twitter account of QuickLeak[.]net. QuickLeak is a fringe, now-defunct whistleblowing site used in 2013 by an Iranian hacker group Parastoo to promote their defacements activities. QuickLeak.net was registered under an Iranian name -- the same person had also registered Zone-hc, another now-defunct Iranian site modelled after another defacement forum, Zone-H. The IP address of QuickLeak and its associated network of domains, including quickleak[.]org and Wikileak[.]ir, was hosted by Iran's main Internet Service Provider (ISP), Telecommunication Company of Iran (TCI). These details are circumstantial evidence that link the Al-Hayat defacement to an entity in Iran.\nThe Al-Alam and Al-Hayat intrusions resembled patriotic hacktivist skirmishes on the margins of an unfolding geopolitical regional conflict. However, subsequent events, circumstantial evidence, and other technical indicators led some investigators to Iran, with the Yemen Cyber Army as a possible front.\nThe Saudi-led Operation Decisive Storm in Yemen ended on April 22. It was immediately followed by Operation Restoring Hope, which purportedly sought to reduce the use of force in Yemen and move toward a political solution for the conflict.66 The Yemen Cyber Army, however, was not to let go of the feud as easily.\nAbout a month after the defacement of Al-Hayat, the Yemen Cyber Army defaced the website of Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) on May 20. The MOFA homepage displayed an animated image that announced the launch of Operation Hussein Badreddin al-Houthi, named after the assassinated leader of the Houthi insurgency. The image content was familiar. Similar to the Al-Hayat defacement, it included anti-Saudi messages and strong pro-Shi'ite imagery, including pictures of Iran's Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, and Hassan Nasrallah, secretary general of Lebanon's Hezbollah militia. The announcement also featured a Guy Fawkes-masked face, the uncanny symbol of hacking collective Anonymous, and Anonymous' famous slogan ‘We Don't Forget, We Don't Forgive'.\nThe Yemen Cyber Army promised to release a trove of encrypted data on Saudi diplomats, agents, and citizens, stolen from 3000 MOFA computers. That week, Yemen Cyber Army released two tranches of private information of citizens and MOFA personnel on Pastebin as password-protected files, the password included as well.67 In the Pastebin announcement perpetrators identified as ‘Cutting Sword of Justice', the same actor behind the 2012 attack on Saudi's national oil company, Aramco. The destructive attack against Aramco, dubbed ‘Shamoon', involved automated wiping of 30,000 business devices. U.S. intelligence community and cybersecurity researchers attributed the incident to Iranian state-affiliated actors.68 The day after the Pastebin announcement, on May 21, Iran's Fars News published yet another exclusive report on the hack, crediting the ominous Yemen Cyber Army.69 A subsequent report on May 21 included a Word file attachment that contained links to the leaked documents on several file-sharing sites and passwords to decompress encrypted files.70 Fars News branded these exclusive reports as ‘Saudileaks'. This was the first time that the term was used as far as public records show. Between May and August 2015, Fars News published 32 pieces on Saudi Leaks in the English language.\nAgain, @QuickLeakOrg sought to promote the Pastebin announcement and Fars News exclusives, aiming for maximum public attention to the intrusion. These tweets did not generate much engagement, however.71 Efforts by journalists to confirm the identity of the Yemen Cyber Army did not yield much information as the group refused to disclose their location or even speak Arabic to the press.72 The magnitude, format, and timing of the intrusion, coupled with other circumstantial evidence, suggested that the perpetrators, whoever they were, had pro-Houthi aspirations and were publicly challenging Saudis' ambitions in the Yemen conflict. For its part, the Saudi MOFA confirmed the attack on its website but downplayed the impact. The Ministry also warned against using and publishing any leaked material, describing the breach as a ‘plot of the nation's enemies' and promising legal action against perpetrators.73 ### The leaks Against the warnings of the Saudi government, however, two substantive leaks put the MOFA hack on the spotlight, challenging Saudi foreign policy and practices.\nOn 19 June 2015, WikiLeaks published over sixty thousand documents, titled as Saudi Cables, and promised half a million more to follow.74 These cables comprised more than confidential diplomatic correspondences, however. They also contained personal medical and legal records of survivors of sexual abuse, sick children, and the mentally ill, among others. The mixed nature of these cables raised concerns about WikiLeaks' precarious handling of private citizen information and prompted debates about the ethics of responsible leaks.75 WikiLeaks had previously released several controversial document sets from states and private companies. Though the whistleblowing platform had been relatively dormant for a couple of years before it published the Saudi Cables in 2015. In its press release, WikiLeaks acknowledged the Yemen Cyber Army as the initial source of ‘valuable sample documents' but did not disclose the source of the fresh trove, leaving the question of attribution unanswered. Upon the release of Saudi Cables, the Yemen Cyber Army went quiet and quit responding to media inquiries about their connection with the whistleblowing platform.\nThe Yemen Cyber Army partially came out of the dark on June 26 with the launch of their social media accounts and two now-defunct websites: Yemenica[.]com and wikisaleaks[.]com. Yemenica was a single-page site with a declaration from the group, describing itself as a ‘Yemeni youth community' united against the Saudi regime. Again, the description flashed back to a second group that claimed responsibility for the 2012 Shamoon attack, posing as Arab Youth Group. Notably, Yemenica had a Google Plus account, which at the time was the most popular social networking site among Iranian conservatives and was unaffected by Iran's infamous censorship practices.\nWikiSaudiLeaks presented an even more aggressive anti-Saudi manifesto: subtitled as Cyber Decisive Storm, the website header showed images of bombing of Yemen by Saudi-led forces in Operation Decisive Storm. It characterised the developments, in English, as a ‘barbaric Saudi-American aggression, with which the Israelites also stand'.\nWikiSaudiLeaks was likely an additional outlet to maximise attention to the leaked materials. The documents on the site were mostly in Arabic and had already been included in the WikiLeaks release. They were classified based on countries, regions, and international organisations such as the United Nations. The list began with old and current allies of the kingdom, including Qatar, the United States, Bahrain and Turkey. WikiSaudiLeaks also contained a dedicated category for ‘Persian Gulf Countries' -- a term that Iran has zealously used throughout the naming dispute with some Arab countries who have opted for alternatives such as ‘Arabian Gulf' or ‘Gulf'. These cues shed further light on the interests and motives of those behind WikiSaudiLeaks.\nWhoever spearheaded these leaks sought to alienate Saudi's allies, influence international audiences, and disrupt Saudi's strategic plans in Yemen. Several media partners of WikiLeaks, including the free press advocacy group Reporters Without Border, published selected materials and analyses about Saudi engagements internationally. While Western media broadly reported on the cables, the regional media remained divided on the matter according to traditional political lines. Pro-Saudi media, including Al-Hayat, reiterated the state warnings and refrained from circulating the leaked materials. The Iran-owned Al-Alam, on the other hand, extensively covered the cables. In the end, many Arabic language outlets chose not to cover Saudi Cables, presumably out of concern for legal and political retribution, leaving the regional impact of the leak rather unclear.\n### The sham The public attention to Saudi Cables was already subsiding when a fabricated news article briefly brought SaudiLeaks back to some headlines. On July 27, Another Western Dawn News (AWDNews), a fringe news site, published an article in English, accusing a United Nations (UN) official of receiving bribes for biased reporting against the Islamic Republic of Iran. According to the article, the Saudi embassy in Kuwait had allegedly paid Dr. Ahmad Shaheed, then UN Special Rapporteur for the Situation of Human Rights in Iran, 10 million dollars to increase international pressure on Iran for its violation of human rights. The report cited a scanned copy of a top secret document purportedly from the Saudi Cables on WikiLeaks. Contrary to the AWDNews claim, however, the ‘source' document in Arabic mentioned a million dollar -- not ten -- paid to Shaheed.\nRegardless of the discrepancy, the article prompted strong reactions inside and outside Iran. Human rights groups characterised the allegation as a sophisticated, state-directed smear campaign against Shaheed and critics of Iran's record of human rights. For years, the Islamic Republic has refused to collaborate with the UN Special Rapporteurs, accusing them of plotting with Iran's adversaries, including Saudi Arabia, for biased or fabricated reporting about the situation of human rights in Iran. This article, if true, would have been the perfect evidence for Iran's enduring righteousness. The bribery claim also aligned well with Saudi's previous attempts to grow its influence in the international human rights system. According to the WikiLeaks documents, in 2014 Saudi Arabia bartered votes with the United Kingdom and Russia to gain a seat at the UN Human Rights Council, despite its nefarious record at home.\nThe article rapidly circulated on other fringe news sites such as Al-Waqt and the Middle East Press. Iran's conservative media reacted immediately and amplified the news in Persian and Arabic languages, with some citing the original source site Al-Waie News. Among those were the Young Journalists Club, which is run by the IRIB, the state-owned broadcaster, and Tasnim News, another media affiliate of the IRGC. All of these platforms promoted the one-million-dollar bribe accusation.\nAmid public confusion and media inquiries, WikiLeaks refuted the claim that the document was one of the original Saudi Cables. In a tweet to online news site Iran Front Page, WikiLeaks challenged the authenticity of the alleged document. WikiLeaks stated: ‘@IranFrontPage Please Show Which Cable This Claim Is Based on. You Fail to Link to One of Our Cables in the Article', thus adding forgery to the puzzle of Saudi Leaks. Shaheed, for his part, personally thanked WikiLeaks for the clarification.\nIt took some time for attributive leads to emerge. Three years later, in August 2018, Facebook and Twitter announced their first takedown of state-linked assets from Iran. Among the 770 Iranian Twitter accounts removed were AWDNews, Al-Waie News, Al-Waqt, and Middle East Press, all of which had played a part in the smear campaign against the UN Special Rapporteur. In November 2020, U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) issued a warrant for seizure of 29 domains for being part of the Liberty Front Press network, the same media network that Meta, Twitter, FireEye, and ClearSky had previously attributed to Iran. In an accompanying affidavit, the DOJ asserted that each of the seized domains was ‘fraudulently registered' due to each being used by or on behalf of the IRGC. AWDNews[.]com was among the seized domains.\nDid the perpetrators behind the MOFA breach and the subsequent leak plan the forgery and disinformation campaign ahead of time, or was it an afterthought? The answer is unclear. But the disinformation campaign demonstrates how hack-and-leak events can catalyse cultivating false information to new and existing audiences. Once a breach happens and secrets spill into the public domain, related but fabricated stories become more believable and harder to debunk. Actors with no stake in the previous events may also seize the opportunity to harvest the outcome of hack-and-leaks.\nThe same actor(s) may not have been behind the three stages of Saudi Leaks. The forgery may have been devised on the fly. What is established, however, is that Iran's IRGC was behind the disinformation campaign. The manipulation of leaked material signals Iran's interest and capacity in leveraging the output of hack-and-leak events for influencing domestic and international audiences and antagonising Saudi allies.",
    "## Competing hypotheses: a framework for analysis The multi-stage nature of the WikiSaudiLeaks event calls for a multi-stage attribution. Thus far, there is only decisive evidence for attributing the forgery to Iran based on Twitter and Facebook takedowns and DOJ's attribution. Yemen Cyber Army's lack of any historical background has bolstered speculations that it was a front for other prominent actors with resources, motives, and ambitions for such an undertaking. The attribution of the MOFA hack and the leaks has remained divergent. As the following passages indicate, existing research points to Iran and Russia as the two main culprits. Other possibilities include Yemeni hackers or a collaboration among different actors. This section considers possible hints for attributing the breach into the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs network and the leaks that ensued.": "The breach There are two possibilities with regard to the breach of the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The first hypothesis is that Iran breached the ministry's networks. This scenario would be in-line with Iran's involvement in a wider espionage operation that targeted government, military, and critical infrastructure targets across the Middle East between 2013 and 2015.\nIn June 2015, cybersecurity firm ClearSky published a report on an operation that had been in progress since mid 2014. ClearSky dubbed the alleged campaign ‘Thamar Reservoir' and pointed out a variety of targets of high interest to Iranian politics. These targets included international relations and defence professionals from Saudi Arabia, Israel, and elsewhere in the Middle East. The campaign utilised a range of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), including social engineering and spear phishing, mostly through Google services. ClearSky attributed Thamar Reservoir with high confidence to Iranian actors due to its considerable similarities of TTPs and overlapping infrastructure with previous operations also attributed to Iranian actors like Rocket Kitten and AjaxTeam.\nAnother cybersecurity company, Cylance, dubbed a related campaign ‘Operation Cleaver'. Cleaver included targets from Saudi Arabia's oil and gas and transportation industries in 2013--14. Among the TTPs used in Operation Cleaver, one particularly stands out. The threat actor predominantly used spear phishing to deceive targets to visit a job search website and submit their resumes. The scheme used an imposter of a legitimate professional development service winresume[.]com and its Easy Resume Creator Pro service to lure job candidates to download and install malware TinyZBot. The threat actor attempted to deceive its targets by convincing them they had a pending job opportunity at the industrial group Teledyne, through fake domains such as Teledyne-Jobs[.]com. To know more about the opportunity, the target had to use the malicious resume submission service. One of the Saudi cables later released by WikiLeaks suggests that a threat actor had used this very tactic to breach the Saudi MOFA network months before the May 2015 intrusion.\nIn January 2015, Saudi MOFA internally circulated a 14-page incident response report, describing an attack on the ministry's network that had started on 20 July 2014 (10 months before the May 2015 attack). The report, which is included in one of the Saudi cables, indicates that the system administrator of MOFA had received a targeted email with a job opportunity from the fictitious employer Teledyne. The target fell for the scheme and his machine was infected with the TinyZBot malware, which prompted data exfiltration from his device.\nThe ministry, however, only noticed the compromise in November 2014, when it detected failed proxy connections between the system admin computer and a suspicious server. 88.150.214.166 was the IP address of the server, which corresponds to that of the malicious domain Teledyne-Jobs[.]com, reportedly created by Iranian hackers. Outed by Cylance's Operation Cleaver report on 2 December 2014, the fake website stopped working on the same day. The MOFA report does not identify the extent of data exfiltration and network impact. But the document repeatedly cites Operation Cleaver, expressly attributing the attack to Iranian actors.\nThe public-facing WikiSaudiLeaks event started only in April 2015, but these technical reports put forward an alternative possibility. That is the attackers may have exfiltrated the diplomatic cables from the MOFA network earlier but held onto them until the Yemen conflict began to complicate regional geopolitics. This tactic resembles the hacking of Britam Defense. The company was hacked in November 2012 but the perpetrators held onto the stolen material until January 2013, when a U.S. military strike in Syria seemed looming. This significant time-delay is another indication of a professional intelligence agency tradecraft, as activists or militants likely would have acted more swiftly on a whim.",
    "## Russia The Saudi MOFA was of interest to the Russian actors, too. Russia is known to have engaged in reconnaissance and espionage activities against Middle Eastern targets in the spring of 2015.": "FANCY BEAR, also known as Sofacy or APT 28, a unit of Russia's military intelligence agency (GRU), reportedly breached the Saudi embassy in Ukraine in February 2015. The exclusive use of this vulnerability by FANCY BEAR until April 2015 has led researchers to entertain the possibility that Russia may also be responsible for the breach of the Saudi MOFA's network in the WikiSaudiLeaks event.\nThe attack infrastructure in the GRU campaign also contains noteworthy overlaps with the ominous Yemen Cyber Army. Wikisaleaks, the website ostensibly run by Yemen Cyber Army, was registered on the same range of IP addresses linked to FANCY BEAR in 2015. The address is part of a range of 256 at Lithuanian hosting provider UAB DUOMENU CENTRAS, leased to an intermediary company, MonoVM. The company offers a range of services, including dedicated servers and web hosting. In May 2015, it still accepted a variety of crypto currencies, such as Bitcoin and Skrill, to process transactions. These decentralised methods of payment have been appealing to Russian actors for purchasing the infrastructure for hacking operations. The domain MonoVM[.]com has been registered with a Dubai address, but it appears to be owned or managed by Iranian individuals. The registrant details also include information about another hosting company, Azar Online, registered under the same Persian names. Azar Online appears to be an ISP in Tabriz, the capital of Eastern Azerbaijan province in Iran.\nLater disclosures established even more links between MonoVM and Iran. In December 2020, amid then-President Trump and his close allies' allegations of election fraud, a new website emerged with a hit list of U.S. officials that refuted Trump's claims. *Enemies of the People* sought to incite violence and wreak havoc in the United States. The Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) quickly attributed this operation to Iran. One of the associated domains of Enemies of the People website was hosted on MonoVM.\nIt is possible that FANCY BEAR used MonoVM, likely an Iranian company, for its espionage operations while masquerading as Yemen Cyber Army. FANCY BEAR has utilised the same technique, known as false flag, with other fronts such as the CyberBerkut and CyberCaliphate -- two GRU front groups that emerged in 2014. An alternative possibility, however, is that other actors, including Iranians, utilised MonoVM services for their purposes around the same time, thus creating a false flag, likely unintentionally.\nLater events suggested a third hypothesis. In 2019, another Russian actor, Turla (aka Snake), identified as Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), was detected to have hijacked the technical infrastructure of OilRig, an Iranian threat actor, for espionage attacks in 2017 and early 2018. In October 2019, US and UK intelligence services confirmed that Turla had exploited the command and control and operational infrastructure of Iranian actors to expand its network of victims.\nTurla had previously targeted entities in 45 countries in 2015, including governments, military organisations, and research institutions. Most of these victims were located in the Middle East and Europe. There is no evidence for such hijacking of infrastructure prior to 2017. Though it is possible that Turla, or other Russian actors, might have co-opted TTPs of Iranian actors in an effort to further obfuscate attribution for WikiSaudiLeaks. For example, Turla has used a variant of Mimikatz, a commonplace hacking tool used extensively by different actors, which was also previously used by Iranian actors in Operation Cleaver. A fourth possibility could be that the two groups, Iranians and Russians, may have been collaborating in some capacity.\n### The leaks Attribution of the leaks remains challenging, in large part due to limited evidence available on the details of the transfer of Saudi Cables to WikiLeaks and WikiSaudiLeaks websites. This gap is perpetuated by three factors. First, wikisaleaks[.]com was registered on the same IP range as the Russian C2 infrastructure in 2015. Second, yemenica[.]com, the other website of the Yemen Cyber Army, was registered with an email address from the Russian webmail provider, Yandex.\na report from 2019 suggests that two weeks after the release of Saudi Cables in June 2015, WikiLeaks moved its web hosting infrastructure to a new server in Russia. Prior to the transfer, however, the same IP address hosted a fake domain that had been associated with phishing attacks by the Iranian Rocket Kitten until May 2015. This suggests that WikiLeaks may have collaborated with the Iranian hackers for the intrusion of Saudi MOFA, or coordinated for the transfer of stolen documents. It could also entirely be a coincidence. As with MonoVM, different actors may have used the same infrastructure for their preferred setup and reliability.",
    "## Five vectors for a deconstructed approach to attribution Our analysis of competing hypotheses illustrates that evidence on the technical, operational, and political aspects of the WikiSaudiLeaks events point to more than a single suspect. In entertaining these hypotheses, we consider a multi-factor framework that includes the history of different actors in undertaking hack-and-leak operations, motivation, messaging, capabilities (technical and otherwise), and infrastructure. Together, these indicators pave the ground for addressing the question of ‘who did it', with Iran, Russia, or the Yemen Cyber Army as the most likely culprits.": "### History In assessing a threat actor's history, we first consider past behaviour that tracks with the tradecraft used in the case in question. Out of the three likely culprits, Iran and Russia had previously engaged in computer network exploitation (CNE) against a variety of adversaries, in particular diplomatic targets from the Middle East. Moreover, they both had previously used fictitious fronts in CNE and computer network attack (CNA) operations. Iranian Charming Kitten (APT33) had targeted Saudi Aramco in 2012, posing as the Cutting Sword of Justice and Arab Youth Group. Russia, too, has a history of using front groups for active measures. Cyber Berkut was a Russian scheme, posing as an anti-Ukraine hacktivist group to target the websites of NATO and several German officials in March 2014 and January 2015, respectively. CyberCaliphate, a seemingly ISIS-associated group, breached TV5 Monde, a major French television network with global coverage, resulting in network disruption for hours in April 2015. The ominous Yemen Cyber Army, however, lacks any history prior to WikiSaudiLeaks, which bolsters the possibility of a front for other more established actors, like Iran or Russia.\n### Motivation Second, we investigate the motivation which refers to a perpetrator's interest in conducting certain actions in a geopolitical context. WikiSaudiLeaks was a retaliatory response to the Saudis for their intervention in the Yemen conflict. In principle, the Houthi rebels and Iran would have both benefited from the collapse of the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen. While Russia has taken an intermediary role in Yemen to avoid direct conflict, the failure of a key US ally would still serve Russia's political and economic objectives in the region. Moreover, Iran and Russia's decisive intervention in Syria in support of the Assad regime has been met with unwavering opposition from Saudi Arabia and the United States, with either side accusing the other of supporting ‘terrorists'. The humiliating hack-and-leak events of WikiSaudiLeaks thus serve both Iran and Russia's vengeance toward Saudi Arabia.\n### Messaging Third, we turn to messaging which relates to the semantics and semiotics of the behaviour. The language, signs, and other cues used to communicate with the audience often contain clues about the actor. The WikiSaudiLeaks operators used a consistent anti-Saudi tone in all stages: the hacking of Al-Hayat and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, promoting the leaked material, and the disinformation campaign. They conveyed resistance to the Saudi intervention in Yemen, with an obvious emphasis on pro-Iranian and pro-Shi'ite sentiments. In addition, the Iranian state media network was the first to systematically cover ‘Saudileaks' in English, weeks before WikiLeaks and other outlets did. At the very least, the zealous communication underscores Iran's vested interest in the incident. This is not to say that the same operators were behind the publication of the leaked material. However, these considerations along with the history and motivation factors skew the attribution assessment toward Iran. Admittedly, some of these details can be manipulated to falsely point in a certain direction and obfuscate attribution. Using a geopolitical cover makes attribution of a false flag operation particularly challenging.\n### Capability Fourth, capability entails the technical expertise, economic and human resources, and enterprising networks of operators and media affiliates that enable a malicious operation. The WikiSaudiLeaks event suggests coordination among a network of operators on different levels, each marshalling a variety of skill sets. Each stage required capabilities that both Iran and Russia demonstrated before. Yet these factors seem far less viable for the Yemen Cyber Army due to its lack of history.\n### Infrastructure Lastly, the infrastructure factor concerns the foundations for physical and virtual communication used to deliver a technical capability or maintain the command and control of capabilities. These structures include electronic devices, servers, domain tools, online services, and social media accounts, to name a few, that attackers can buy, lease, share, compromise, and repurpose to develop their infrastructure. In hack-and-leak operations, the infrastructure for the intrusion may not be the same as what is used for the leak. It is also possible that different actors use the same infrastructure at different points in time.\nAs with WikiSaudiLeaks, possible overlap of infrastructures can significantly impede detection and attribution. The wikisaleaks[.]com domain, one of the websites affiliated with Yemen Cyber Army, was registered at an IP address from likely-Iranian hosting company MonoVM. The IP address also intersected with the Russian infrastructure used to target the Saudi embassy in Ukraine in early 2015. It is entirely plausible, then, that Iranian and Russian actors were using web services offered by the same provider around the same time, hence the overlapping IP addresses. However, it is not possible to determine whether this infrastructure switch was intentional or merely a coincidence.\nConsidered together, history, motivation, messaging, capability, and infrastructure provide a framework for examining the competing hypotheses about attribution. Proper synthesis of these details is not possible with the same level of certainty across the WikiSaudiLeaks event. In attributing a multi-stage incident, we propose to assess each stage (the hack and the leak) against these five indicators. Tables 1 and 2 summarise the degree to which each stage of the WikiSaudiLeaks event can be attributed to three likely perpetrators: Yemen Cyber Army, Iran, and Russia.\nAs Tables 1 and 2 indicate, the Yemen Cyber Army has the lowest chance of being a real culprit. Lack of history and information about the group increases the possibility that it may have been a fictitious front for other perpetrators. The network intrusion can be attributed to Iran and Russia with varying degrees of confidence. Attributing the leak is not as straightforward, however. There is limited evidence of politically motivated leaks by Iranian actors unless Iran was indeed behind the attack on Britam Defence in 2013. While Russia has a long history of leaks during the Cold War and the pre-Internet days, there is limited credible evidence on Russia's involvement in cyber-enabled leaks prior to the attack on the DNC in 2016. Other indicators -- such as pro-Iran messaging, subtle cues from wikisaleaks[.]com, and the extensive coverage of the leaks by state-affiliated media early on -- can be taken as the involvement of Iran on some level. Last but not least, Iran is responsible for the forgery and disinformation campaign that came out of the WikiSaudiLeaks event. Overall, Iran scores higher on all three stages than other possible culprits.\nINTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY\n|   | Yemen Cyber Army | Iran-affiliated Actors | Russia-affiliated Actors  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  History | No | Yes | Yes  |\n|  Motivation | Yes | Yes | Possibly  |\n|  Messaging | Yes | Yes | No  |\n|  Capability | * | Yes | Yes  |\n|  Infrastructure | * | Yes | Yes  |\nTable 2.

    "## Challenges of attributing digital covert action": "Establishing attribution for covert action in the digital age entails unique challenges.¹³³ Evidence on a hack may not yield a conclusion about a leak, and vice versa. Possible forgeries among the leaked data and plausible false flags add to the complications of attribution. The same actor(s) may not be behind seemingly related events. Distinguishing these actors from one another also comes with particular complexities. In this context, de-layering the attribution process and investigating each layer separately facilitate the assessment. The outcome may be varying degrees of confidence in the attribution of each stage, which in turn helps to identify the gaps in the attribution of digital covert action. The case of WikiSaudiLeaks captures these nuances.\nOn the strategic level, attribution remains a political decision based on information collated by intelligence and security agencies or influenced by foreign policy considerations.¹³⁴ It delineates red lines and weighs a set of legitimate responses to the attack.¹³⁵ In the case of WikiSaudiLeaks, affected state parties did not publicly attribute this case. Saudi officials offered little public communication regarding the source of the intrusion. Nor did allies of the kingdom with prominent cyber capabilities, such as the United States, release high level technical or intelligence assessments about WikiSaudiLeaks. Instead, speculative attribution was done by cyber security firms and individual researchers, who lack the authority and means to collect the signal and human intelligence necessary to reliably attribute an attack to a state.¹³⁶\nStrategic attribution comes at a cost, politically and logistically. It requires multiple government agencies and often private sector firms working together, often across borders, utilising their intelligence sources and methods. While there is no consistent approach to attributing cyber attacks among states, an incident is more likely to invoke attribution by states if it passes a two-fold test of significance: (1) the nature and severity of the attack, and (2) the affected parties and implications for their national security. In other words, who is targeted and how they are targeted are the key questions that can invoke an attribution response by states and their allies. The closer an attack hits one's home, the more likely that the state gets involved. Thus, the target and severity of cyber-enabled covert action affect the decision to expend resources on public attribution. WikiSaudiLeaks may not have passed this test.\nWhy was the campaign not conclusively attributed? First, the forensic evidence did not unambiguously point to a single adversary at any given moment.¹³⁷ Second, the entire event, it appears, was not consequential enough at any given moment in time for the Saudi government to initiate a more determined investigation and response. Lastly, although the attack was politically embarrassing, it seems that it did not constitute a sufficiently severe national security threat to Saudi Arabia to escalate to an international investigation with support from more experienced and capable allies.\nYet WikiSaudiLeaks set an internationally consequential precedent. It was highly likely the first state-enabled hack-and-leak operation that utilised WikiLeaks as an amplifying platform, a tactic that was most notably used just one year later in the most tectonic digital covert campaign of our times, the DNC hack-and-leak. In hindsight, it may have been a strategic shortcoming on the part of the US and UK intelligence communities not to have partnered with Saudi intelligence for a more robust response to WikiSaudiLeaks. Both countries, after all, became the target of Russian and Iranian active measures in the 2016, 2018, and 2019 elections, respectively. The episode nevertheless underscores the significance of coalitions and partnerships, especially if a targeted government does not possess mature capabilities and experience in attribution. WikiSaudiLeaks came before the consolidation of such theories as persistent engagement and defend forward in U.S. cyber strategy. With the benefit of hindsight, the same attack on an ally's integrity today may -- and should -- prompt a more mature response from FiveEyes partners and other open societies.",
    "## Conclusion": "Covert action is a political instrument. Hack-and-leak incidents may be designed to mess with regional and international politics by ‘inflaming existing contradictions', to use the old Soviet terminology once honed by KGB's Service A, history's most advanced disinformation bureaucracy. Hack-and-leak operations are only technically upgraded iterations of Cold War collect-and-leak operations. Since at least 2013, predominantly authoritarian governments have deployed hack-and-leak operations amid geopolitical crises against a range of adversaries. WikiSaudiLeaks is the pivotal historic example.\nThe multi-stage nature of digital covert action requires a multi-stage attribution process. This process extends across technical, operational, and strategic levels. Such all-source analysis must still cut across often hardwearing disciplinary boundaries between the kind of digital forensics commonly used in incident response and threat intelligence reporting and the kind of digital forensics commonly used to investigate influence operations (IO) and disinformation. Moreover, a single confidence score may not be appropriate for multi-stage events. That is, analysis of one stage may produce a degree of confidence that differs from other components of the same event. Worse, in extreme cases different components of what might appear as one campaign can be perpetrated by different actors, even unbeknownst to each other.\nWikiSaudiLeaks was strategically designed to inflame contradictions in Saudi Arabia, a party to the Yemen conflict, to wedge open its alliances, and rally international public opinion against the kingdom. The evidence available to us does not allow for definitive attribution for the entire WikiSaudiLeaks event. Instead, a multi-stage all-source investigation offers more details about each component. Each stage requires exploring a different set of forensic artefacts, as well as considering separate tactical, operational, and strategic aspects. The Saudi MOFA-related intrusions could be attributed, based on circumstantial evidence, to either Iran or Russia, possibly even both. The lack of forensic evidence about the provenance of the leaks adds to the challenge of attributing the campaign's exposure stage. However, Iran and Russia remain the most likely culprits, with some circumstantial evidence pointing to Iran. The final stage, the digital disinformation and amplification campaign, can be confidently attributed to Iran, given the abundant evidence exposed by social media companies. A multi-stage event, therefore, requires a multi-stage attribution process -- one that allows for gradients of attribution within each stage.\nThere are three non-exclusive explanations for why WikiSaudiLeaks was not attributed with high confidence to a specific adversary. First, the target, in this case Saudi Arabia, did not have sufficient political determination to perform public attribution. Amid the Yemen conflict, the kingdom was intent on minimising attention to the Saudi Cables and staying on message about the unravelling proxy war with Iran. Second, Saudi Arabia and interested third parties -- including the United States -- likely had insufficient incentive to unlock the attributive resources required to link the campaign to a specific adversary. Access to attributive capabilities consists of both access to a range of forensic\nartefacts and access to the skills and experience necessary to acquire, develop, cross-reference, process, analyse, contextualise, and interpret relevant signals and artefacts. Finally, the WikiSaudiLeaks campaign exhibited features that made the overall event exceptionally hard to attribute to one specific adversary. It is highly likely that these features were partly intended by at least one adversary, and partly unintended.\nMinimising uncertainty is the primary undertaking of attribution. Yet it is a highly complex and nuanced process. Technical forensic artefacts, if inconclusive, must be considered together with other data, obtained from a variety of sources, collected both passively and actively. The delayed nature of attribution further complicates the task. Additional useful details may only become available months or even years later, as our case illustrates, thus rendering early judgements incomplete. False flags, or suspicion thereof, and other challenges can significantly complicate attribution and the response it may require.\nAttributing twenty-first century covert action -- integrated campaigns that have a CNE, CNA, and possibly an IO component -- in a nutshell, is an art and a science and, above all, an all-source enterprise and as such vastly different from attributing narrow computer network breaches. In this attribution process, analysts will have to be ready to disentangle some campaigns, assessing, analysing and attributing their respective components -- the hack, forge, leak, amplify -- on their own merits. Attributing one or multiple components may be easy or hard, linking them together is a separate challenge yet. Adversaries, in turn, may take advantage of this layered attribution challenge.\nWikiSaudiLeaks came before its time, as the analytic toolsets and the strategic and investigative approaches necessary to understand and attribute this event have continued to mature after the fact. After all, it was only around 2016 that security firms started seriously integrating CNE and IO in their public-facing investigative work, with Mandiant among the first,^{142} and Microsoft^{143} and later Google^{144} following suit. Nor did the US government adopt the strategies of persistent engagement and defend forward until 2018,^{145} three years after WikiSaudiLeaks.\nSaudi Cables, in hindsight, was a chameleon that appeared as a different thing against different backdrops: seen in the WikiLeaks context, it appeared as innocent transparency activism; in the website defacement context, it appeared as patriot hacker skirmishes; and viewed against the foil of expanding digital covert action, it appeared as a campaign of at least one authoritarian intelligence agency."

For instance, see Black, “Saudi Arabia Tells Citizens to Ignore Latest WikiLeaks Release.” The Guardian, June 21, 2015.\n3. The event also is an early example of what Joshua Rovner called an ‘intelligence contest', see Joshua Rovner, “What is an Intelligence Contest?” 114--120; Chesney and Smeets, Deter, Disrupt, or Deceive: Assessing Cyber Conflict as an Intelligence Contest.\n4. For an early reflection of deception in cyber-operations, see Gartzke and Lindsay, “Weaving Tangled Webs: Offense, Defense, and Deception in Cyberspace,” 316--348.\n5.

One may argue that the Viasat destructive intrusion via the ACIDRAIN/SKYFALL malware was not covert action, but rather unacknowledged traditional military fires.

This paper revisits one of the most complex, most significant, and most mysterious digital covert actions of our time: a 2015 hack-and-leak case known among investigators as 'WikiSaudiLeaks' that so far has evaded attribution. We argue that WikiSaudiLeaks was not a stand-alone event, but a puzzle piece in a larger covert action campaign that involved advanced computer network exploitation, computer network attack, persistent deception, and a creative influence and disinformation effort. By disintegrating the larger event into its components, limited attribution becomes possible. We present the most detailed and comprehensive investigation of this case to date, attribute at least one component of the larger event to Iranian intelligence, and draw conceptional conclusions.\n## Introduction What was WikiSaudiLeaks and why was it so hard to attribute? This paper revisits one of the most complex, most significant, and most mysterious hack-and-leak puzzles of our time, a 2015 case known among investigators as ‘WikiSaudiLeaks'. The name refers to a mysterious website that surfaced and disseminated a major trove of files taken from the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The site's operators curiously claimed to have given the stolen documents to WikiLeaks, which claimed to have published 122,619 files by year's end.1 Subsequently, the material received high profile press coverage2 and became known as ‘The Saudi Cables'.\nWikiSaudiLeaks is an early example of a fundamental yet neglected attribution challenge.3 The event was not unified. The leak was part of a larger covert action campaign that involved advanced computer network exploitation, computer network attack, persistent deception, and a creative influence and disinformation effort.4 Yet so far neither scholars nor investigators from public or private sector have been able to conclusively attribute WikiSaudiLeaks to a specific threat actor -- in sharp contrast to most other comparable high-profile cases. Why? Because the leak does nothing less than challenge the established attribution paradigm. Hack-and-leak events are not widely discussed, and existing scholarship tends to focus on the interplay between intrusion and influence, while neglecting the consequences for attribution.5 What if a single attribution statement for digital covert action is not possible in the first place?\nWikiSaudiLeaks happened just as the goldilocks moment of digital covert action was ending: about a year before the Russian election interference in the United States, when bulk leaks were still seen as innocent expressions of transparency activism; and just two years after Mandiant's APT1 report,6 when the public attribution debate and capabilities were still in their infancy. Later events have motivated prolific scholarship, most prominently the Democratic National Committee (DNC) hack-and-leak.7 Yet some of the earliest and most significant instances of digital covert action remain understudied. It is time to revise the WikiSaudiLeaks case, and with it our understanding of attributing covert action.\nDigital covert action was on the rise throughout the 2010s, with hack-and-leak operations making up a significant share. This rise is enabled, but insufficiently explained, by technological change. A list of the major hits would include the late 2000s campaign known as Stuxnet; various wiping attacks against Iranian targets in 2011; the 2012 attack against Saudi Aramco and Rasgas; the neglected 2013 Britam Defence leak; the 2014 Sony Pictures Entertainment breach-and-leak;; two remarkable blackouts in Kiev in 2015 and 2016 as well as numerous other operations in Ukraine; the series of breach-and-leak operations against the US election in 2016; the mysterious series of Shadow Brokers leaks; the ransomware attacks known as Wannacry and NotPetya in 2017, one executed poorly, the other deceptively; the Viasat sabotage at the outset of the Ukraine War in 2022, and several more, some of them subtle, others as yet not publicly discussed. The continuous and dynamic nature of such offensive activity helped give rise to the concepts of ‘persistent engagement' and ‘defend forward' in the U.S. government, in which attribution played a key role. Indeed all these major cases had one core feature in common: governments, and in many cases independent researchers, have attributed them with high confidence or even certainty to specific adversaries.\nYet WikiSaudiLeaks stands out: not only has it not been attributed with confidence, the case is also curiously understudied. Both absences are all the more remarkable given that the covert action has generated an extraordinary amount of media coverage, with hundreds of press stories. The ensuing leak is also infamous as one of the most unethical and extreme so far, releasing unredacted cables that included full names and passport numbers of victims of torture and sexual abuse.\nWhy was the campaign not attributed so far? What can this curious case tell us about the past and future of attributing computer network operations in general and covert action specifically? And, of course: who was responsible for WikiSaudiLeaks?\nWe argue that by breaking down the larger event into its components, limited attribution becomes possible. To understand the saga that is Wikisaudileaks, investigators must first deconstruct what appears to be one coherent event into its constituent components: collection, disclosure, and amplification. Each component, counterintuitively, may not only come with a specific confidence level; it may also lead to diverging and separate attribution assessments. What looks like one operation at a first glance, with closer inspection may, in fact, collapse into multiple operations. The limited scholarship on this case has entertained the possibility of Russian involvement. We attribute at least one component of the larger covert action to Iran.\nAttribution is what states make of it. The outcome of an attributive investigation into a major computer network breach is determined by resources and political priorities, both on the side of the victim and on the side of the perpetrator. The perpetrator plans and equips a clandestine or covert operation to sustain deniability -- the victim plans and equips investigative and analytical outfits to take deniability away. The decision to publicly attribute, however, is correlated with such factors as incident severity, geopolitical circumstances, the intelligence available on the case, technical and operational capacity, and the political will of those involved in the attribution process. The WikiSaudiLeaks event puts the interaction of these indicators to test and underscores several gaps in the attribution process.\nThe paper proceeds in four steps. First we provide context to hack-and-leak operations in the Middle East by revisiting a neglected case from 2013, the earliest known instance of a hack-and-leak. We then offer a granular analysis of the WikiSaudiLeaks event, unmasking a related disinformation campaign that so far has not been covered in public or confidential reporting on the case. The third section reviews competing hypotheses in the attribution of WikiSaudiLeaks, followed by a framework for attribution of different stages of the covert action. We close by discussing the challenges of attribution of this particular case and, more broadly, digital covert action.\n## Prelude Hack-and-leak operations have become ever more common since 2013, globally and especially in the Middle East. Around that time, a number of still mysterious leaks appeared that, in hindsight, could have been the work of intelligence agencies or contractors. The rise of the Anonymous movement as well as WikiLeaks offered unprecedented and obvious opportunities for covert operations. For a few years before the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the wider public and most journalists saw leaks as something positive first and foremost, as a way to create transparency and accountability -- not as an ideal cover for dirty tricks.\nThe breaches that enable the subsequent disclosure of stolen files may be initially done for espionage purposes, or the targeting may be driven by covert action objectives. The offenders' precise intentions are likely to remain obscure in the absence of direct intelligence access or declassified archival records. Historically, however, it was often ‘throwaway' -- files that no longer served a narrow intelligence purpose -- that were used to furnish the content for targeted leaks. Particularly noteworthy in this context were the Shaltai Boltai disclosures in Russia, and, a few months after WikiSaudiLeaks, in October 2015, the unattributed and fairly obscure ‘Turok' FSB leak. These operations often seek to undermine an adversary's decision-making, political cohesion, domestic public opinion, leaders, reputation, and alliances.\nWhat follows is a prelude to the WikiSaudiLeaks event, similarly involving a regional conflict in the Middle East, equally neglected, and inconclusively attributed.\n### Britam defense The earliest known major case of hack-and-leak operations in the Middle East dates back to the early 2010s. The context for the case was the civil war in Syria. In July 2012, the Syrian government acknowledged that it had chemical weapons in its possession though it would never deploy such weapons against its own citizens but only against foreign intervention. In August, then-President Barack Obama warned the Bashar al-Assad regime that any use of chemical weapons in Syria would significantly change his calculus on a U.S. military response. The prospect of a U.S. strike in Syria concerned Assad's key allies, Iran and Russia, who have remained staunch supporters of the Syrian government since the beginning of the conflict in early 2011.\nThe first allegation of use of chemical weapons in Syria was reported in the city of Homs on 23 December 2012. The news rippled through the region and beyond. On 15 January 2013, an anonymous source alleged to Foreign Policy that the State Department had compelling evidence to attribute the chemical attack to the Syrian military. These unverified, controversial claims raised speculations that a U.S. military strike in Syria might be imminent.\nThen, on 22 January, a mysterious post appeared on Pastebin, a widely used disclosure and documentation platform, titled ‘Millitary server hacked. Confidential data!‘ An entity calling itself ‘JAsIrX' posted a short note in broken English, about 130 words, with no fewer than 51 URLs to file-sharing sites. The note was crude, and claimed that Britam Defence, a UK-based military contractor, ‘killed Arabs in Iraq and plans to invade in Iran and Syria'.\nShortly after, around 24 January, a report appeared on the obscure site cyberwarnews[.]info, claiming that Britam had been hacked. On 28 January 2013, conspiracy theory websites started covering the leak. The niche site whatdoesitmean[.]com headlined: ‘Obama Plan for World War III Stuns Russia'. That same day Infowars titled: ‘Hacked Emails Reveal “Washington-Approved” Plan to Stage Chemical Weapons Attack in Syria'.\nThe following day the story went mainstream. The Daily Mail, one of the UK's most-read tabloids, blasted: ‘U.S. “backed plan to launch chemical weapon attack on Syria and blame it on Assad's regime”'. The report in the Mail cited an email exchange from the previous month, allegedly among a group of senior managers at Britam. The exchange suspiciously mentioned a proposal that Britam would supply chemical weapons to Syria, while posing as Russian mercenaries, in exchange for a significant amount of money. The Daily Mail in turn linked to the initial report in Cyber War News that took the leak at face value.\nBritam, in fact, was targeted by a successful hack-leak-forge operation. An unknown attacker had breached Britam's email, likely in November 2012. On January 22 the perpetrators, calling themselves ‘JAsIrX', started posting internal documents from Britam on Pastebin. One email exchange from October 2012 purported to link Britam to a military training project in Saudi Arabia to increase readiness for a possible strike by Iran. Another exchange claimed a U.S.-backed proposal to Britam to ‘deliver a CW to Homs' and deploy its Ukrainian personnel to pose as Russian mercenaries The fabricated incriminating emails appeared to have been sent two months apart from one another; yet both digital artefacts shared the same unique message identity number, and had the exact same ‘sent' timestamp, at 23:57:18. Similarly, the documents pertaining to the Saudi military project were created and modified in short succession on Friday, 18 January 2013 at 12:00 GMT. The suspicious content, combined with the suspicious metadata, makes it highly likely that these forged documents sought to falsely incriminate the company in a plot against the United States and Saudi Arabia.\nThe story immediately appeared on Press TV, the English language branch of the state-run broadcaster, Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB). Press TV took a hard anti-Western position, noting the timing as ‘the Syrian army forces have managed to clear the capital, Damascus and its surrounding areas of the militants and restore security'. Seeking renewed attention to the case, Fars News, a key media affiliate of Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), republished the allegations in August 2013, citing whatdoesitmean. Other Iranian hardliner news sites, notably Mehr News, echoed the recycled article, but the story did not gain much attention.\nAttribution in the case of the Britam hack-leak-forge remained vague. A Sunday Times article entertained the possibility of Iran's involvement, but offered no solid sourcing or evidence. There is limited public technical forensics available about the attack. But contextual and operational cues, such as Iran's high stakes in Syria and the unusual media coverage by state-affiliated outlets, support the Iran hypothesis.\nEither way, the incident was the first major hack-and-leak operation that involved a variety of state and nonstate actors in Middle East politics. Whoever was behind the operation had a vested interest in implicating the United States in the use of chemical weapons in Syria, and in detracting from the truth. The event unfolded in multiple stages. The perpetrator conducted a network intrusion and collected data on the target ahead of time, manipulated the data to take advantage of geopolitical developments in the region, and promptly released the stolen (and forged) materials to maximise the believability of the plot. These same features were also on display in the WikiSaudiLeaks operation that hit Saudi Arabia two years later. Similarly, both cases remain shrouded in mystery with no conclusive attribution.\nIn both events, adversarial actors were only beginning to flex technical resources to advance geopolitical motives through digital covert action. Inconclusive attribution in those early days extended the opportunity to the perpetrators to seek to subvert more significant targets. It was only a matter of time until major Western powers began to feel the burn at home.\n## WikiSaudiLeaks The Yemen civil war was still fresh in March 2015. The Shi'ite Houthi rebels had taken over the capital city of Sanaa and ousted the Saudi-backed President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and its allies had launched a military offensive, Operation Decisive Storm, to counter the Iran-backed Houthi militias. Between March 26 and April 22, the Saudi-led airstrikes caused civil casualties and massive destruction across Yemen. The Saudi and Iranian interventions were, in some ways, only one episode in a long lineage of foreign interference in Yemen's affairs, some overt, others covert. Yet the escalating civil war offered the context for a new, unprecedented form of outside intervention -- one that remained shrouded in mystery for years.\nWikiSaudiLeaks unfolded in three episodes. First, a series of hacking incidents targeted both Iranian and Saudi-affiliated media outlets, suggesting patriotic hacker skirmishes on the margins of the Yemen conflict. The network intrusion soon reached the Saudi Ministry of Foreign affairs. Before long, in the second phase, troves of confidential cables from the Ministry were leaked to the public via WikiLeaks and other platforms. The third, and previously undiscussed, stage involved a disinformation campaign against a United Nations expert that Iran-affiliated media broadly promoted. The following sections offer a deep dive into these stages, outlining the technical, operational, and political context to each layer.\n### The hacks In March and April 2015, a series of hacking incidents started drawing attention to the unfolding conflict in Yemen. On April 12, defacements appeared on the English Twitter and YouTube accounts of Iran's state-backed, Arabic news channel Al-Alam. The defacements included images of Saudi leadership, messages in support of Operation Decisive Storm, and a false claim that the Iran-backed Houthi leader was dead. Other tweets sent from Al-Alam's Twitter account disclosed a purported list of correspondents of Al-Alam. Both Al-Alam and SaharTV, another Iranian state-backed television channel, confirmed the incident and blamed it on Saudi hackers.\nAn anonymous, self-described hacking entity, @Cyber__Emotion claimed responsibility for the attacks on Twitter. The entity's earliest publicly-known activities date back to 2014, when an actor with the same handle took over official Twitter accounts of Saudi ministries of justice and finance, questioning these institutions' lack of concern for cybersecurity. In 2016, the group allegedly compromised the official account of the Saudi Minister of Education, criticising his performance and demanding improvement in the national educational system.\nOnly a day after the Al-Alam defacements, a previously unheard of hacking group Yemen Cyber Army defaced the Saudi-owned Arabic news site Al-Hayat on April 13. The defacement announcement displayed a picture of the Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and a provocative pro-Shi'ite message against the kingdom and its allies, threatening that their time would soon be up. In addition to the defacement, the attackers leaked the names, email addresses, and hashed passwords of Al-Hayat users and subscribers.\nIran's semi-official news agency, Fars News, was among the first outlets to react to the incident. Fars News published an ‘exclusive' coverage of the Al-Hayat defacement, attributing the attack to Yemen Cyber Army without offering any evidence about the identity or background of the group. Fars News also linked to the Yemen Cyber Army's announcements and files on Pastebin, which is frequently used by hackers to claim responsibility for website defacements.\nThe only posts disseminating the Pastebin announcements came from @QuickLeakOrg, the associated Twitter account of QuickLeak[.]net. QuickLeak is a fringe, now-defunct whistleblowing site used in 2013 by an Iranian hacker group Parastoo to promote their defacements activities. QuickLeak.net was registered under an Iranian name -- the same person had also registered Zone-hc, another now-defunct Iranian site modelled after another defacement forum, Zone-H. The IP address of QuickLeak and its associated network of domains, including quickleak[.]org and Wikileak[.]ir, was hosted by Iran's main Internet Service Provider (ISP), Telecommunication Company of Iran (TCI). These details are circumstantial evidence that link the Al-Hayat defacement to an entity in Iran.\nThe Al-Alam and Al-Hayat intrusions resembled patriotic hacktivist skirmishes on the margins of an unfolding geopolitical regional conflict. However, subsequent events, circumstantial evidence, and other technical indicators led some investigators to Iran, with the Yemen Cyber Army as a possible front.\nThe Saudi-led Operation Decisive Storm in Yemen ended on April 22. It was immediately followed by Operation Restoring Hope, which purportedly sought to reduce the use of force in Yemen and move toward a political solution for the conflict.66 The Yemen Cyber Army, however, was not to let go of the feud as easily.\nAbout a month after the defacement of Al-Hayat, the Yemen Cyber Army defaced the website of Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) on May 20. The MOFA homepage displayed an animated image that announced the launch of Operation Hussein Badreddin al-Houthi, named after the assassinated leader of the Houthi insurgency. The image content was familiar. Similar to the Al-Hayat defacement, it included anti-Saudi messages and strong pro-Shi'ite imagery, including pictures of Iran's Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, and Hassan Nasrallah, secretary general of Lebanon's Hezbollah militia. The announcement also featured a Guy Fawkes-masked face, the uncanny symbol of hacking collective Anonymous, and Anonymous' famous slogan ‘We Don't Forget, We Don't Forgive'.\nThe Yemen Cyber Army promised to release a trove of encrypted data on Saudi diplomats, agents, and citizens, stolen from 3000 MOFA computers. That week, Yemen Cyber Army released two tranches of private information of citizens and MOFA personnel on Pastebin as password-protected files, the password included as well.67 In the Pastebin announcement perpetrators identified as ‘Cutting Sword of Justice', the same actor behind the 2012 attack on Saudi's national oil company, Aramco. The destructive attack against Aramco, dubbed ‘Shamoon', involved automated wiping of 30,000 business devices. U.S. intelligence community and cybersecurity researchers attributed the incident to Iranian state-affiliated actors.68 The day after the Pastebin announcement, on May 21, Iran's Fars News published yet another exclusive report on the hack, crediting the ominous Yemen Cyber Army.69 A subsequent report on May 21 included a Word file attachment that contained links to the leaked documents on several file-sharing sites and passwords to decompress encrypted files.70 Fars News branded these exclusive reports as ‘Saudileaks'. This was the first time that the term was used as far as public records show. Between May and August 2015, Fars News published 32 pieces on Saudi Leaks in the English language.\nAgain, @QuickLeakOrg sought to promote the Pastebin announcement and Fars News exclusives, aiming for maximum public attention to the intrusion. These tweets did not generate much engagement, however.71 Efforts by journalists to confirm the identity of the Yemen Cyber Army did not yield much information as the group refused to disclose their location or even speak Arabic to the press.72 The magnitude, format, and timing of the intrusion, coupled with other circumstantial evidence, suggested that the perpetrators, whoever they were, had pro-Houthi aspirations and were publicly challenging Saudis' ambitions in the Yemen conflict. For its part, the Saudi MOFA confirmed the attack on its website but downplayed the impact. The Ministry also warned against using and publishing any leaked material, describing the breach as a ‘plot of the nation's enemies' and promising legal action against perpetrators.73 ### The leaks Against the warnings of the Saudi government, however, two substantive leaks put the MOFA hack on the spotlight, challenging Saudi foreign policy and practices.\nOn 19 June 2015, WikiLeaks published over sixty thousand documents, titled as Saudi Cables, and promised half a million more to follow.74 These cables comprised more than confidential diplomatic correspondences, however. They also contained personal medical and legal records of survivors of sexual abuse, sick children, and the mentally ill, among others. The mixed nature of these cables raised concerns about WikiLeaks' precarious handling of private citizen information and prompted debates about the ethics of responsible leaks.75 WikiLeaks had previously released several controversial document sets from states and private companies. Though the whistleblowing platform had been relatively dormant for a couple of years before it published the Saudi Cables in 2015. In its press release, WikiLeaks acknowledged the Yemen Cyber Army as the initial source of ‘valuable sample documents' but did not disclose the source of the fresh trove, leaving the question of attribution unanswered. Upon the release of Saudi Cables, the Yemen Cyber Army went quiet and quit responding to media inquiries about their connection with the whistleblowing platform.\nThe Yemen Cyber Army partially came out of the dark on June 26 with the launch of their social media accounts and two now-defunct websites: Yemenica[.]com and wikisaleaks[.]com. Yemenica was a single-page site with a declaration from the group, describing itself as a ‘Yemeni youth community' united against the Saudi regime. Again, the description flashed back to a second group that claimed responsibility for the 2012 Shamoon attack, posing as Arab Youth Group. Notably, Yemenica had a Google Plus account, which at the time was the most popular social networking site among Iranian conservatives and was unaffected by Iran's infamous censorship practices.\nWikiSaudiLeaks presented an even more aggressive anti-Saudi manifesto: subtitled as Cyber Decisive Storm, the website header showed images of bombing of Yemen by Saudi-led forces in Operation Decisive Storm. It characterised the developments, in English, as a ‘barbaric Saudi-American aggression, with which the Israelites also stand'.\nWikiSaudiLeaks was likely an additional outlet to maximise attention to the leaked materials. The documents on the site were mostly in Arabic and had already been included in the WikiLeaks release. They were classified based on countries, regions, and international organisations such as the United Nations. The list began with old and current allies of the kingdom, including Qatar, the United States, Bahrain and Turkey. WikiSaudiLeaks also contained a dedicated category for ‘Persian Gulf Countries' -- a term that Iran has zealously used throughout the naming dispute with some Arab countries who have opted for alternatives such as ‘Arabian Gulf' or ‘Gulf'. These cues shed further light on the interests and motives of those behind WikiSaudiLeaks.\nWhoever spearheaded these leaks sought to alienate Saudi's allies, influence international audiences, and disrupt Saudi's strategic plans in Yemen. Several media partners of WikiLeaks, including the free press advocacy group Reporters Without Border, published selected materials and analyses about Saudi engagements internationally. While Western media broadly reported on the cables, the regional media remained divided on the matter according to traditional political lines. Pro-Saudi media, including Al-Hayat, reiterated the state warnings and refrained from circulating the leaked materials. The Iran-owned Al-Alam, on the other hand, extensively covered the cables. In the end, many Arabic language outlets chose not to cover Saudi Cables, presumably out of concern for legal and political retribution, leaving the regional impact of the leak rather unclear.\n### The sham The public attention to Saudi Cables was already subsiding when a fabricated news article briefly brought SaudiLeaks back to some headlines. On July 27, Another Western Dawn News (AWDNews), a fringe news site, published an article in English, accusing a United Nations (UN) official of receiving bribes for biased reporting against the Islamic Republic of Iran. According to the article, the Saudi embassy in Kuwait had allegedly paid Dr. Ahmad Shaheed, then UN Special Rapporteur for the Situation of Human Rights in Iran, 10 million dollars to increase international pressure on Iran for its violation of human rights. The report cited a scanned copy of a top secret document purportedly from the Saudi Cables on WikiLeaks. Contrary to the AWDNews claim, however, the ‘source' document in Arabic mentioned a million dollar -- not ten -- paid to Shaheed.\nRegardless of the discrepancy, the article prompted strong reactions inside and outside Iran. Human rights groups characterised the allegation as a sophisticated, state-directed smear campaign against Shaheed and critics of Iran's record of human rights. For years, the Islamic Republic has refused to collaborate with the UN Special Rapporteurs, accusing them of plotting with Iran's adversaries, including Saudi Arabia, for biased or fabricated reporting about the situation of human rights in Iran. This article, if true, would have been the perfect evidence for Iran's enduring righteousness. The bribery claim also aligned well with Saudi's previous attempts to grow its influence in the international human rights system. According to the WikiLeaks documents, in 2014 Saudi Arabia bartered votes with the United Kingdom and Russia to gain a seat at the UN Human Rights Council, despite its nefarious record at home.\nThe article rapidly circulated on other fringe news sites such as Al-Waqt and the Middle East Press. Iran's conservative media reacted immediately and amplified the news in Persian and Arabic languages, with some citing the original source site Al-Waie News. Among those were the Young Journalists Club, which is run by the IRIB, the state-owned broadcaster, and Tasnim News, another media affiliate of the IRGC. All of these platforms promoted the one-million-dollar bribe accusation.\nAmid public confusion and media inquiries, WikiLeaks refuted the claim that the document was one of the original Saudi Cables. In a tweet to online news site Iran Front Page, WikiLeaks challenged the authenticity of the alleged document. WikiLeaks stated: ‘@IranFrontPage Please Show Which Cable This Claim Is Based on. You Fail to Link to One of Our Cables in the Article', thus adding forgery to the puzzle of Saudi Leaks. Shaheed, for his part, personally thanked WikiLeaks for the clarification.\nIt took some time for attributive leads to emerge. Three years later, in August 2018, Facebook and Twitter announced their first takedown of state-linked assets from Iran. Among the 770 Iranian Twitter accounts removed were AWDNews, Al-Waie News, Al-Waqt, and Middle East Press, all of which had played a part in the smear campaign against the UN Special Rapporteur. In November 2020, U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) issued a warrant for seizure of 29 domains for being part of the Liberty Front Press network, the same media network that Meta, Twitter, FireEye, and ClearSky had previously attributed to Iran. In an accompanying affidavit, the DOJ asserted that each of the seized domains was ‘fraudulently registered' due to each being used by or on behalf of the IRGC. AWDNews[.]com was among the seized domains.\nDid the perpetrators behind the MOFA breach and the subsequent leak plan the forgery and disinformation campaign ahead of time, or was it an afterthought? The answer is unclear. But the disinformation campaign demonstrates how hack-and-leak events can catalyse cultivating false information to new and existing audiences. Once a breach happens and secrets spill into the public domain, related but fabricated stories become more believable and harder to debunk. Actors with no stake in the previous events may also seize the opportunity to harvest the outcome of hack-and-leaks.\nThe same actor(s) may not have been behind the three stages of Saudi Leaks. The forgery may have been devised on the fly. What is established, however, is that Iran's IRGC was behind the disinformation campaign. The manipulation of leaked material signals Iran's interest and capacity in leveraging the output of hack-and-leak events for influencing domestic and international audiences and antagonising Saudi allies.\n## Competing hypotheses: a framework for analysis The multi-stage nature of the WikiSaudiLeaks event calls for a multi-stage attribution. Thus far, there is only decisive evidence for attributing the forgery to Iran based on Twitter and Facebook takedowns and DOJ's attribution. Yemen Cyber Army's lack of any historical background has bolstered speculations that it was a front for other prominent actors with resources, motives, and ambitions for such an undertaking. The attribution of the MOFA hack and the leaks has remained divergent. As the following passages indicate, existing research points to Iran and Russia as the two main culprits. Other possibilities include Yemeni hackers or a collaboration among different actors. This section considers possible hints for attributing the breach into the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs network and the leaks that ensued.\nThe breach There are two possibilities with regard to the breach of the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The first hypothesis is that Iran breached the ministry's networks. This scenario would be in-line with Iran's involvement in a wider espionage operation that targeted government, military, and critical infrastructure targets across the Middle East between 2013 and 2015.\nIn June 2015, cybersecurity firm ClearSky published a report on an operation that had been in progress since mid 2014. ClearSky dubbed the alleged campaign ‘Thamar Reservoir' and pointed out a variety of targets of high interest to Iranian politics. These targets included international relations and defence professionals from Saudi Arabia, Israel, and elsewhere in the Middle East. The campaign utilised a range of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), including social engineering and spear phishing, mostly through Google services. ClearSky attributed Thamar Reservoir with high confidence to Iranian actors due to its considerable similarities of TTPs and overlapping infrastructure with previous operations also attributed to Iranian actors like Rocket Kitten and AjaxTeam.\nAnother cybersecurity company, Cylance, dubbed a related campaign ‘Operation Cleaver'. Cleaver included targets from Saudi Arabia's oil and gas and transportation industries in 2013--14. Among the TTPs used in Operation Cleaver, one particularly stands out. The threat actor predominantly used spear phishing to deceive targets to visit a job search website and submit their resumes. The scheme used an imposter of a legitimate professional development service winresume[.]com and its Easy Resume Creator Pro service to lure job candidates to download and install malware TinyZBot. The threat actor attempted to deceive its targets by convincing them they had a pending job opportunity at the industrial group Teledyne, through fake domains such as Teledyne-Jobs[.]com. To know more about the opportunity, the target had to use the malicious resume submission service. One of the Saudi cables later released by WikiLeaks suggests that a threat actor had used this very tactic to breach the Saudi MOFA network months before the May 2015 intrusion.\nIn January 2015, Saudi MOFA internally circulated a 14-page incident response report, describing an attack on the ministry's network that had started on 20 July 2014 (10 months before the May 2015 attack). The report, which is included in one of the Saudi cables, indicates that the system administrator of MOFA had received a targeted email with a job opportunity from the fictitious employer Teledyne. The target fell for the scheme and his machine was infected with the TinyZBot malware, which prompted data exfiltration from his device.\nThe ministry, however, only noticed the compromise in November 2014, when it detected failed proxy connections between the system admin computer and a suspicious server. 88.150.214.166 was the IP address of the server, which corresponds to that of the malicious domain Teledyne-Jobs[.]com, reportedly created by Iranian hackers. Outed by Cylance's Operation Cleaver report on 2 December 2014, the fake website stopped working on the same day. The MOFA report does not identify the extent of data exfiltration and network impact. But the document repeatedly cites Operation Cleaver, expressly attributing the attack to Iranian actors.\nThe public-facing WikiSaudiLeaks event started only in April 2015, but these technical reports put forward an alternative possibility. That is the attackers may have exfiltrated the diplomatic cables from the MOFA network earlier but held onto them until the Yemen conflict began to complicate regional geopolitics. This tactic resembles the hacking of Britam Defense. The company was hacked in November 2012 but the perpetrators held onto the stolen material until January 2013, when a U.S. military strike in Syria seemed looming. This significant time-delay is another indication of a professional intelligence agency tradecraft, as activists or militants likely would have acted more swiftly on a whim.\n## Russia The Saudi MOFA was of interest to the Russian actors, too. Russia is known to have engaged in reconnaissance and espionage activities against Middle Eastern targets in the spring of 2015.\nFANCY BEAR, also known as Sofacy or APT 28, a unit of Russia's military intelligence agency (GRU), reportedly breached the Saudi embassy in Ukraine in February 2015. The exclusive use of this vulnerability by FANCY BEAR until April 2015 has led researchers to entertain the possibility that Russia may also be responsible for the breach of the Saudi MOFA's network in the WikiSaudiLeaks event.\nThe attack infrastructure in the GRU campaign also contains noteworthy overlaps with the ominous Yemen Cyber Army. Wikisaleaks, the website ostensibly run by Yemen Cyber Army, was registered on the same range of IP addresses linked to FANCY BEAR in 2015. The address is part of a range of 256 at Lithuanian hosting provider UAB DUOMENU CENTRAS, leased to an intermediary company, MonoVM. The company offers a range of services, including dedicated servers and web hosting. In May 2015, it still accepted a variety of crypto currencies, such as Bitcoin and Skrill, to process transactions. These decentralised methods of payment have been appealing to Russian actors for purchasing the infrastructure for hacking operations. The domain MonoVM[.]com has been registered with a Dubai address, but it appears to be owned or managed by Iranian individuals. The registrant details also include information about another hosting company, Azar Online, registered under the same Persian names. Azar Online appears to be an ISP in Tabriz, the capital of Eastern Azerbaijan province in Iran.\nLater disclosures established even more links between MonoVM and Iran. In December 2020, amid then-President Trump and his close allies' allegations of election fraud, a new website emerged with a hit list of U.S. officials that refuted Trump's claims. *Enemies of the People* sought to incite violence and wreak havoc in the United States. The Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) quickly attributed this operation to Iran. One of the associated domains of Enemies of the People website was hosted on MonoVM.\nIt is possible that FANCY BEAR used MonoVM, likely an Iranian company, for its espionage operations while masquerading as Yemen Cyber Army. FANCY BEAR has utilised the same technique, known as false flag, with other fronts such as the CyberBerkut and CyberCaliphate -- two GRU front groups that emerged in 2014. An alternative possibility, however, is that other actors, including Iranians, utilised MonoVM services for their purposes around the same time, thus creating a false flag, likely unintentionally.\nLater events suggested a third hypothesis. In 2019, another Russian actor, Turla (aka Snake), identified as Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), was detected to have hijacked the technical infrastructure of OilRig, an Iranian threat actor, for espionage attacks in 2017 and early 2018. In October 2019, US and UK intelligence services confirmed that Turla had exploited the command and control and operational infrastructure of Iranian actors to expand its network of victims.\nTurla had previously targeted entities in 45 countries in 2015, including governments, military organisations, and research institutions. Most of these victims were located in the Middle East and Europe. There is no evidence for such hijacking of infrastructure prior to 2017. Though it is possible that Turla, or other Russian actors, might have co-opted TTPs of Iranian actors in an effort to further obfuscate attribution for WikiSaudiLeaks. For example, Turla has used a variant of Mimikatz, a commonplace hacking tool used extensively by different actors, which was also previously used by Iranian actors in Operation Cleaver. A fourth possibility could be that the two groups, Iranians and Russians, may have been collaborating in some capacity.\n### The leaks Attribution of the leaks remains challenging, in large part due to limited evidence available on the details of the transfer of Saudi Cables to WikiLeaks and WikiSaudiLeaks websites. This gap is perpetuated by three factors. First, wikisaleaks[.]com was registered on the same IP range as the Russian C2 infrastructure in 2015. Second, yemenica[.]com, the other website of the Yemen Cyber Army, was registered with an email address from the Russian webmail provider, Yandex.\na report from 2019 suggests that two weeks after the release of Saudi Cables in June 2015, WikiLeaks moved its web hosting infrastructure to a new server in Russia. Prior to the transfer, however, the same IP address hosted a fake domain that had been associated with phishing attacks by the Iranian Rocket Kitten until May 2015. This suggests that WikiLeaks may have collaborated with the Iranian hackers for the intrusion of Saudi MOFA, or coordinated for the transfer of stolen documents. It could also entirely be a coincidence. As with MonoVM, different actors may have used the same infrastructure for their preferred setup and reliability.\n## Five vectors for a deconstructed approach to attribution Our analysis of competing hypotheses illustrates that evidence on the technical, operational, and political aspects of the WikiSaudiLeaks events point to more than a single suspect. In entertaining these hypotheses, we consider a multi-factor framework that includes the history of different actors in undertaking hack-and-leak operations, motivation, messaging, capabilities (technical and otherwise), and infrastructure. Together, these indicators pave the ground for addressing the question of ‘who did it', with Iran, Russia, or the Yemen Cyber Army as the most likely culprits.\n### History In assessing a threat actor's history, we first consider past behaviour that tracks with the tradecraft used in the case in question. Out of the three likely culprits, Iran and Russia had previously engaged in computer network exploitation (CNE) against a variety of adversaries, in particular diplomatic targets from the Middle East. Moreover, they both had previously used fictitious fronts in CNE and computer network attack (CNA) operations. Iranian Charming Kitten (APT33) had targeted Saudi Aramco in 2012, posing as the Cutting Sword of Justice and Arab Youth Group. Russia, too, has a history of using front groups for active measures. Cyber Berkut was a Russian scheme, posing as an anti-Ukraine hacktivist group to target the websites of NATO and several German officials in March 2014 and January 2015, respectively. CyberCaliphate, a seemingly ISIS-associated group, breached TV5 Monde, a major French television network with global coverage, resulting in network disruption for hours in April 2015. The ominous Yemen Cyber Army, however, lacks any history prior to WikiSaudiLeaks, which bolsters the possibility of a front for other more established actors, like Iran or Russia.\n### Motivation Second, we investigate the motivation which refers to a perpetrator's interest in conducting certain actions in a geopolitical context. WikiSaudiLeaks was a retaliatory response to the Saudis for their intervention in the Yemen conflict. In principle, the Houthi rebels and Iran would have both benefited from the collapse of the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen. While Russia has taken an intermediary role in Yemen to avoid direct conflict, the failure of a key US ally would still serve Russia's political and economic objectives in the region. Moreover, Iran and Russia's decisive intervention in Syria in support of the Assad regime has been met with unwavering opposition from Saudi Arabia and the United States, with either side accusing the other of supporting ‘terrorists'. The humiliating hack-and-leak events of WikiSaudiLeaks thus serve both Iran and Russia's vengeance toward Saudi Arabia.\n### Messaging Third, we turn to messaging which relates to the semantics and semiotics of the behaviour. The language, signs, and other cues used to communicate with the audience often contain clues about the actor. The WikiSaudiLeaks operators used a consistent anti-Saudi tone in all stages: the hacking of Al-Hayat and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, promoting the leaked material, and the disinformation campaign. They conveyed resistance to the Saudi intervention in Yemen, with an obvious emphasis on pro-Iranian and pro-Shi'ite sentiments. In addition, the Iranian state media network was the first to systematically cover ‘Saudileaks' in English, weeks before WikiLeaks and other outlets did. At the very least, the zealous communication underscores Iran's vested interest in the incident. This is not to say that the same operators were behind the publication of the leaked material. However, these considerations along with the history and motivation factors skew the attribution assessment toward Iran. Admittedly, some of these details can be manipulated to falsely point in a certain direction and obfuscate attribution. Using a geopolitical cover makes attribution of a false flag operation particularly challenging.\n### Capability Fourth, capability entails the technical expertise, economic and human resources, and enterprising networks of operators and media affiliates that enable a malicious operation. The WikiSaudiLeaks event suggests coordination among a network of operators on different levels, each marshalling a variety of skill sets. Each stage required capabilities that both Iran and Russia demonstrated before. Yet these factors seem far less viable for the Yemen Cyber Army due to its lack of history.\n### Infrastructure Lastly, the infrastructure factor concerns the foundations for physical and virtual communication used to deliver a technical capability or maintain the command and control of capabilities. These structures include electronic devices, servers, domain tools, online services, and social media accounts, to name a few, that attackers can buy, lease, share, compromise, and repurpose to develop their infrastructure. In hack-and-leak operations, the infrastructure for the intrusion may not be the same as what is used for the leak. It is also possible that different actors use the same infrastructure at different points in time.\nAs with WikiSaudiLeaks, possible overlap of infrastructures can significantly impede detection and attribution. The wikisaleaks[.]com domain, one of the websites affiliated with Yemen Cyber Army, was registered at an IP address from likely-Iranian hosting company MonoVM. The IP address also intersected with the Russian infrastructure used to target the Saudi embassy in Ukraine in early 2015. It is entirely plausible, then, that Iranian and Russian actors were using web services offered by the same provider around the same time, hence the overlapping IP addresses. However, it is not possible to determine whether this infrastructure switch was intentional or merely a coincidence.\nConsidered together, history, motivation, messaging, capability, and infrastructure provide a framework for examining the competing hypotheses about attribution. Proper synthesis of these details is not possible with the same level of certainty across the WikiSaudiLeaks event. In attributing a multi-stage incident, we propose to assess each stage (the hack and the leak) against these five indicators. Tables 1 and 2 summarise the degree to which each stage of the WikiSaudiLeaks event can be attributed to three likely perpetrators: Yemen Cyber Army, Iran, and Russia.\nAs Tables 1 and 2 indicate, the Yemen Cyber Army has the lowest chance of being a real culprit. Lack of history and information about the group increases the possibility that it may have been a fictitious front for other perpetrators. The network intrusion can be attributed to Iran and Russia with varying degrees of confidence. Attributing the leak is not as straightforward, however. There is limited evidence of politically motivated leaks by Iranian actors unless Iran was indeed behind the attack on Britam Defence in 2013. While Russia has a long history of leaks during the Cold War and the pre-Internet days, there is limited credible evidence on Russia's involvement in cyber-enabled leaks prior to the attack on the DNC in 2016. Other indicators -- such as pro-Iran messaging, subtle cues from wikisaleaks[.]com, and the extensive coverage of the leaks by state-affiliated media early on -- can be taken as the involvement of Iran on some level. Last but not least, Iran is responsible for the forgery and disinformation campaign that came out of the WikiSaudiLeaks event. Overall, Iran scores higher on all three stages than other possible culprits.\nINTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY\n\n|   | Yemen Cyber Army | Iran-affiliated Actors | Russia-affiliated Actors  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  History | No | Yes | Yes  |\n|  Motivation | Yes | Yes | Possibly  |\n|  Messaging | Yes | Yes | No  |\n|  Capability | * | Yes | Yes  |\n|  Infrastructure | * | Yes | Yes  |\nTable 2.

Possible forgeries among the leaked data and plausible false flags add to the complications of attribution. The same actor(s) may not be behind seemingly related events. Distinguishing these actors from one another also comes with particular complexities. In this context, de-layering the attribution process and investigating each layer separately facilitate the assessment. The outcome may be varying degrees of confidence in the attribution of each stage, which in turn helps to identify the gaps in the attribution of digital covert action. The case of WikiSaudiLeaks captures these nuances.\nOn the strategic level, attribution remains a political decision based on information collated by intelligence and security agencies or influenced by foreign policy considerations.¹³⁴ It delineates red lines and weighs a set of legitimate responses to the attack.¹³⁵ In the case of WikiSaudiLeaks, affected state parties did not publicly attribute this case. Saudi officials offered little public communication regarding the source of the intrusion. Nor did allies of the kingdom with prominent cyber capabilities, such as the United States, release high level technical or intelligence assessments about WikiSaudiLeaks. Instead, speculative attribution was done by cyber security firms and individual researchers, who lack the authority and means to collect the signal and human intelligence necessary to reliably attribute an attack to a state.¹³⁶\nStrategic attribution comes at a cost, politically and logistically. It requires multiple government agencies and often private sector firms working together, often across borders, utilising their intelligence sources and methods. While there is no consistent approach to attributing cyber attacks among states, an incident is more likely to invoke attribution by states if it passes a two-fold test of significance: (1) the nature and severity of the attack, and (2) the affected parties and implications for their national security. In other words, who is targeted and how they are targeted are the key questions that can invoke an attribution response by states and their allies. The closer an attack hits one's home, the more likely that the state gets involved. Thus, the target and severity of cyber-enabled covert action affect the decision to expend resources on public attribution. WikiSaudiLeaks may not have passed this test.\nWhy was the campaign not conclusively attributed? First, the forensic evidence did not unambiguously point to a single adversary at any given moment.¹³⁷ Second, the entire event, it appears, was not consequential enough at any given moment in time for the Saudi government to initiate a more determined investigation and response. Lastly, although the attack was politically embarrassing, it seems that it did not constitute a sufficiently severe national security threat to Saudi Arabia to escalate to an international investigation with support from more experienced and capable allies.\nYet WikiSaudiLeaks set an internationally consequential precedent. It was highly likely the first state-enabled hack-and-leak operation that utilised WikiLeaks as an amplifying platform, a tactic that was most notably used just one year later in the most tectonic digital covert campaign of our times, the DNC hack-and-leak. In hindsight, it may have been a strategic shortcoming on the part of the US and UK intelligence communities not to have partnered with Saudi intelligence for a more robust response to WikiSaudiLeaks. Both countries, after all, became the target of Russian and Iranian active measures in the 2016, 2018, and 2019 elections, respectively. The episode nevertheless underscores the significance of coalitions and partnerships, especially if a targeted government does not possess mature capabilities and experience in attribution. WikiSaudiLeaks came before the consolidation of such theories as persistent engagement and defend forward in U.S. cyber strategy. With the benefit of hindsight, the same attack on an ally's integrity today may -- and should -- prompt a more mature response from FiveEyes partners and other open societies.\n## Conclusion\nCovert action is a political instrument. Hack-and-leak incidents may be designed to mess with regional and international politics by ‘inflaming existing contradictions', to use the old Soviet terminology once honed by KGB's Service A, history's most advanced disinformation bureaucracy. Hack-and-leak operations are only technically upgraded iterations of Cold War collect-and-leak operations. Since at least 2013, predominantly authoritarian governments have deployed hack-and-leak operations amid geopolitical crises against a range of adversaries. WikiSaudiLeaks is the pivotal historic example.\nThe multi-stage nature of digital covert action requires a multi-stage attribution process. This process extends across technical, operational, and strategic levels. Such all-source analysis must still cut across often hardwearing disciplinary boundaries between the kind of digital forensics commonly used in incident response and threat intelligence reporting and the kind of digital forensics commonly used to investigate influence operations (IO) and disinformation. Moreover, a single confidence score may not be appropriate for multi-stage events. That is, analysis of one stage may produce a degree of confidence that differs from other components of the same event. Worse, in extreme cases different components of what might appear as one campaign can be perpetrated by different actors, even unbeknownst to each other.\nWikiSaudiLeaks was strategically designed to inflame contradictions in Saudi Arabia, a party to the Yemen conflict, to wedge open its alliances, and rally international public opinion against the kingdom. The evidence available to us does not allow for definitive attribution for the entire WikiSaudiLeaks event. Instead, a multi-stage all-source investigation offers more details about each component. Each stage requires exploring a different set of forensic artefacts, as well as considering separate tactical, operational, and strategic aspects. The Saudi MOFA-related intrusions could be attributed, based on circumstantial evidence, to either Iran or Russia, possibly even both. The lack of forensic evidence about the provenance of the leaks adds to the challenge of attributing the campaign's exposure stage. However, Iran and Russia remain the most likely culprits, with some circumstantial evidence pointing to Iran. The final stage, the digital disinformation and amplification campaign, can be confidently attributed to Iran, given the abundant evidence exposed by social media companies. A multi-stage event, therefore, requires a multi-stage attribution process -- one that allows for gradients of attribution within each stage.\nThere are three non-exclusive explanations for why WikiSaudiLeaks was not attributed with high confidence to a specific adversary. First, the target, in this case Saudi Arabia, did not have sufficient political determination to perform public attribution. Amid the Yemen conflict, the kingdom was intent on minimising attention to the Saudi Cables and staying on message about the unravelling proxy war with Iran. Second, Saudi Arabia and interested third parties -- including the United States -- likely had insufficient incentive to unlock the attributive resources required to link the campaign to a specific adversary. Access to attributive capabilities consists of both access to a range of forensic\nartefacts and access to the skills and experience necessary to acquire, develop, cross-reference, process, analyse, contextualise, and interpret relevant signals and artefacts. Finally, the WikiSaudiLeaks campaign exhibited features that made the overall event exceptionally hard to attribute to one specific adversary. It is highly likely that these features were partly intended by at least one adversary, and partly unintended.\nMinimising uncertainty is the primary undertaking of attribution. Yet it is a highly complex and nuanced process. Technical forensic artefacts, if inconclusive, must be considered together with other data, obtained from a variety of sources, collected both passively and actively. The delayed nature of attribution further complicates the task. Additional useful details may only become available months or even years later, as our case illustrates, thus rendering early judgements incomplete. False flags, or suspicion thereof, and other challenges can significantly complicate attribution and the response it may require.\nAttributing twenty-first century covert action -- integrated campaigns that have a CNE, CNA, and possibly an IO component -- in a nutshell, is an art and a science and, above all, an all-source enterprise and as such vastly different from attributing narrow computer network breaches. In this attribution process, analysts will have to be ready to disentangle some campaigns, assessing, analysing and attributing their respective components -- the hack, forge, leak, amplify -- on their own merits. Attributing one or multiple components may be easy or hard, linking them together is a separate challenge yet. Adversaries, in turn, may take advantage of this layered attribution challenge.\nWikiSaudiLeaks came before its time, as the analytic toolsets and the strategic and investigative approaches necessary to understand and attribute this event have continued to mature after the fact. After all, it was only around 2016 that security firms started seriously integrating CNE and IO in their public-facing investigative work, with Mandiant among the first,^{142} and Microsoft^{143} and later Google^{144} following suit. Nor did the US government adopt the strategies of persistent engagement and defend forward until 2018,^{145} three years after WikiSaudiLeaks.\nSaudi Cables, in hindsight, was a chameleon that appeared as a different thing against different backdrops: seen in the WikiLeaks context, it appeared as innocent transparency activism; in the website defacement context, it appeared as patriot hacker skirmishes; and viewed against the foil of expanding digital covert action, it appeared as a campaign of at least one authoritarian intelligence agency.",

This paper revisits one of the most complex, most significant, and most mysterious digital covert actions of our time: a 2015 hack-and-leak case known among investigators as 'WikiSaudiLeaks' that so far has evaded attribution. We argue that WikiSaudiLeaks was not a stand-alone event, but a puzzle piece in a larger covert action campaign that involved advanced computer network exploitation, computer network attack, persistent deception, and a creative influence and disinformation effort. By disintegrating the larger event into its components, limited attribution becomes possible. We present the most detailed and comprehensive investigation of this case to date, attribute at least one component of the larger event to Iranian intelligence, and draw conceptional conclusions.\n## Introduction\nWhat was WikiSaudiLeaks and why was it so hard to attribute? This paper revisits one of the most complex, most significant, and most mysterious hack-and-leak puzzles of our time, a 2015 case known among investigators as ‘WikiSaudiLeaks'. The name refers to a mysterious website that surfaced and disseminated a major trove of files taken from the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The site's operators curiously claimed to have given the stolen documents to WikiLeaks, which claimed to have published 122,619 files by year's end.1 Subsequently, the material received high profile press coverage2 and became known as ‘The Saudi Cables'.\nWikiSaudiLeaks is an early example of a fundamental yet neglected attribution challenge.3 The event was not unified. The leak was part of a larger covert action campaign that involved advanced computer network exploitation, computer network attack, persistent deception, and a creative influence and disinformation effort.4 Yet so far neither scholars nor investigators from public or private sector have been able to conclusively attribute WikiSaudiLeaks to a specific threat actor -- in sharp contrast to most other comparable high-profile cases. Why? Because the leak does nothing less than challenge the established attribution paradigm. Hack-and-leak events are not widely discussed, and existing scholarship tends to focus on the interplay between intrusion and influence, while neglecting the consequences for attribution.5 What if a single attribution statement for digital covert action is not possible in the first place?\nWikiSaudiLeaks happened just as the goldilocks moment of digital covert action was ending: about a year before the Russian election interference in the United States, when bulk leaks were still seen as innocent expressions of transparency activism; and just two years after Mandiant's APT1 report,6 when the public attribution debate and capabilities were still in their infancy. Later events have motivated prolific scholarship, most prominently the Democratic National Committee (DNC) hack-and-leak.7 Yet some of the earliest and most significant instances of digital covert action remain\nunderstudied. It is time to revise the WikiSaudiLeaks case, and with it our understanding of attributing covert action.\nDigital covert action was on the rise throughout the 2010s, with hack-and-leak operations making up a significant share. This rise is enabled, but insufficiently explained, by technological change. A list of the major hits would include the late 2000s campaign known as Stuxnet; various wiping attacks against Iranian targets in 2011; the 2012 attack against Saudi Aramco and Rasgas; the neglected 2013 Britam Defence leak; the 2014 Sony Pictures Entertainment breach-and-leak;; two remarkable blackouts in Kiev in 2015 and 2016 as well as numerous other operations in Ukraine; the series of breach-and-leak operations against the US election in 2016; the mysterious series of Shadow Brokers leaks; the ransomware attacks known as Wannacry and NotPetya in 2017, one executed poorly, the other deceptively; the Viasat sabotage at the outset of the Ukraine War in 2022, and several more, some of them subtle, others as yet not publicly discussed. The continuous and dynamic nature of such offensive activity helped give rise to the concepts of ‘persistent engagement' and ‘defend forward' in the U.S. government, in which attribution played a key role. Indeed all these major cases had one core feature in common: governments, and in many cases independent researchers, have attributed them with high confidence or even certainty to specific adversaries.\nYet WikiSaudiLeaks stands out: not only has it not been attributed with confidence, the case is also curiously understudied. Both absences are all the more remarkable given that the covert action has generated an extraordinary amount of media coverage, with hundreds of press stories. The ensuing leak is also infamous as one of the most unethical and extreme so far, releasing unredacted cables that included full names and passport numbers of victims of torture and sexual abuse.\nWhy was the campaign not attributed so far? What can this curious case tell us about the past and future of attributing computer network operations in general and covert action specifically? And, of course: who was responsible for WikiSaudiLeaks?\nWe argue that by breaking down the larger event into its components, limited attribution becomes possible. To understand the saga that is Wikisaudileaks, investigators must first deconstruct what appears to be one coherent event into its constituent components: collection, disclosure, and amplification. Each component, counterintuitively, may not only come with a specific confidence level; it may also lead to diverging and separate attribution assessments. What looks like one operation at a first glance, with closer inspection may, in fact, collapse into multiple operations. The limited scholarship on this case has entertained the possibility of Russian involvement. We attribute at least one component of the larger covert action to Iran.\nAttribution is what states make of it. The outcome of an attributive investigation into a major computer network breach is determined by resources and political priorities, both on the side of the victim and on the side of the perpetrator. The perpetrator plans and equips a clandestine or covert operation to sustain deniability -- the victim plans and equips investigative and analytical outfits to take deniability away. The decision to publicly attribute, however, is correlated with such factors as incident severity, geopolitical circumstances, the intelligence available on the case, technical and operational capacity, and the political will of those involved in the attribution process. The WikiSaudiLeaks event puts the interaction of these indicators to test and underscores several gaps in the attribution process.\nThe paper proceeds in four steps. First we provide context to hack-and-leak operations in the Middle East by revisiting a neglected case from 2013, the earliest known instance of a hack-and-leak. We then offer a granular analysis of the WikiSaudiLeaks event, unmasking a related disinformation campaign that so far has not been covered in public or confidential reporting on the case. The third section reviews competing hypotheses in the attribution of WikiSaudiLeaks, followed by a framework for attribution of different stages of the covert action. We close by discussing the challenges of attribution of this particular case and, more broadly, digital covert action.\n##\nPrelude\nHack-and-leak operations have become ever more common since 2013, globally and especially in the Middle East. Around that time, a number of still mysterious leaks appeared that, in hindsight, could have been the work of intelligence agencies or contractors. The rise of the Anonymous movement as well as WikiLeaks offered unprecedented and obvious opportunities for covert operations. For a few years before the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the wider public and most journalists saw leaks as something positive first and foremost, as a way to create transparency and accountability -- not as an ideal cover for dirty tricks.\nThe breaches that enable the subsequent disclosure of stolen files may be initially done for espionage purposes, or the targeting may be driven by covert action objectives. The offenders' precise intentions are likely to remain obscure in the absence of direct intelligence access or declassified archival records. Historically, however, it was often ‘throwaway' -- files that no longer served a narrow intelligence purpose -- that were used to furnish the content for targeted leaks. Particularly noteworthy in this context were the Shaltai Boltai disclosures in Russia, and, a few months after WikiSaudiLeaks, in October 2015, the unattributed and fairly obscure ‘Turok' FSB leak. These operations often seek to undermine an adversary's decision-making, political cohesion, domestic public opinion, leaders, reputation, and alliances.\nWhat follows is a prelude to the WikiSaudiLeaks event, similarly involving a regional conflict in the Middle East, equally neglected, and inconclusively attributed.\n### Britam defense\nThe earliest known major case of hack-and-leak operations in the Middle East dates back to the early 2010s. The context for the case was the civil war in Syria. In July 2012, the Syrian government acknowledged that it had chemical weapons in its possession though it would never deploy such weapons against its own citizens but only against foreign intervention. In August, then-President Barack Obama warned the Bashar al-Assad regime that any use of chemical weapons in Syria would significantly change his calculus on a U.S. military response. The prospect of a U.S. strike in Syria concerned Assad's key allies, Iran and Russia, who have remained staunch supporters of the Syrian government since the beginning of the conflict in early 2011.\nThe first allegation of use of chemical weapons in Syria was reported in the city of Homs on 23 December 2012. The news rippled through the region and beyond. On 15 January 2013, an anonymous source alleged to Foreign Policy that the State Department had compelling evidence to attribute the chemical attack to the Syrian military. These unverified, controversial claims raised speculations that a U.S. military strike in Syria might be imminent.\nThen, on 22 January, a mysterious post appeared on Pastebin, a widely used disclosure and documentation platform, titled ‘Millitary server hacked. Confidential data!‘ An entity calling itself ‘JAsIrX' posted a short note in broken English, about 130 words, with no fewer than 51 URLs to file-sharing sites. The note was crude, and claimed that Britam Defence, a UK-based military contractor, ‘killed Arabs in Iraq and plans to invade in Iran and Syria'.\nShortly after, around 24 January, a report appeared on the obscure site cyberwarnews[.]info, claiming that Britam had been hacked. On 28 January 2013, conspiracy theory websites started covering the leak. The niche site whatdoesitmean[.]com headlined: ‘Obama Plan for World War III Stuns Russia'. That same day Infowars titled: ‘Hacked Emails Reveal “Washington-Approved” Plan to Stage Chemical Weapons Attack in Syria'.\nThe following day the story went mainstream. The Daily Mail, one of the UK's most-read tabloids, blasted: ‘U.S. “backed plan to launch chemical weapon attack on Syria and blame it on Assad's regime”'. The report in the Mail cited an email exchange from the previous month, allegedly among a group of senior managers at Britam. The exchange suspiciously mentioned a proposal that Britam would supply chemical weapons to Syria, while posing as Russian mercenaries, in exchange\nfor a significant amount of money. The Daily Mail in turn linked to the initial report in Cyber War News that took the leak at face value.\nBritam, in fact, was targeted by a successful hack-leak-forge operation. An unknown attacker had breached Britam's email, likely in November 2012. On January 22 the perpetrators, calling themselves ‘JAsIrX', started posting internal documents from Britam on Pastebin. One email exchange from October 2012 purported to link Britam to a military training project in Saudi Arabia to increase readiness for a possible strike by Iran. Another exchange claimed a U.S.-backed proposal to Britam to ‘deliver a CW to Homs' and deploy its Ukrainian personnel to pose as Russian mercenaries\nThe fabricated incriminating emails appeared to have been sent two months apart from one another; yet both digital artefacts shared the same unique message identity number, and had the exact same ‘sent' timestamp, at 23:57:18. Similarly, the documents pertaining to the Saudi military project were created and modified in short succession on Friday, 18 January 2013 at 12:00 GMT. The suspicious content, combined with the suspicious metadata, makes it highly likely that these forged documents sought to falsely incriminate the company in a plot against the United States and Saudi Arabia.\nThe story immediately appeared on Press TV, the English language branch of the state-run broadcaster, Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB). Press TV took a hard anti-Western position, noting the timing as ‘the Syrian army forces have managed to clear the capital, Damascus and its surrounding areas of the militants and restore security'. Seeking renewed attention to the case, Fars News, a key media affiliate of Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), republished the allegations in August 2013, citing whatdoesitmean. Other Iranian hardliner news sites, notably Mehr News, echoed the recycled article, but the story did not gain much attention.\nAttribution in the case of the Britam hack-leak-forge remained vague. A Sunday Times article entertained the possibility of Iran's involvement, but offered no solid sourcing or evidence. There is limited public technical forensics available about the attack. But contextual and operational cues, such as Iran's high stakes in Syria and the unusual media coverage by state-affiliated outlets, support the Iran hypothesis.\nEither way, the incident was the first major hack-and-leak operation that involved a variety of state and nonstate actors in Middle East politics. Whoever was behind the operation had a vested interest in implicating the United States in the use of chemical weapons in Syria, and in detracting from the truth. The event unfolded in multiple stages. The perpetrator conducted a network intrusion and collected data on the target ahead of time, manipulated the data to take advantage of geopolitical developments in the region, and promptly released the stolen (and forged) materials to maximise the believability of the plot. These same features were also on display in the WikiSaudiLeaks operation that hit Saudi Arabia two years later. Similarly, both cases remain shrouded in mystery with no conclusive attribution.\nIn both events, adversarial actors were only beginning to flex technical resources to advance geopolitical motives through digital covert action. Inconclusive attribution in those early days extended the opportunity to the perpetrators to seek to subvert more significant targets. It was only a matter of time until major Western powers began to feel the burn at home.\n## WikiSaudiLeaks\nThe Yemen civil war was still fresh in March 2015. The Shi'ite Houthi rebels had taken over the capital city of Sanaa and ousted the Saudi-backed President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and its allies had launched a military offensive, Operation Decisive Storm, to counter the Iran-backed Houthi militias. Between March 26 and April 22, the Saudi-led airstrikes caused civil casualties and massive destruction across Yemen. The Saudi and Iranian interventions were, in some ways, only one episode in a long lineage of foreign interference in Yemen's affairs, some overt, others covert. Yet the escalating civil war offered the context for a new, unprecedented form of outside intervention -- one that remained shrouded in mystery for years.\nWikiSaudiLeaks unfolded in three episodes. First, a series of hacking incidents targeted both Iranian and Saudi-affiliated media outlets, suggesting patriotic hacker skirmishes on the margins of the Yemen conflict. The network intrusion soon reached the Saudi Ministry of Foreign affairs. Before long, in the second phase, troves of confidential cables from the Ministry were leaked to the public via WikiLeaks and other platforms. The third, and previously undiscussed, stage involved a disinformation campaign against a United Nations expert that Iran-affiliated media broadly promoted. The following sections offer a deep dive into these stages, outlining the technical, operational, and political context to each layer.\n### The hacks\nIn March and April 2015, a series of hacking incidents started drawing attention to the unfolding conflict in Yemen. On April 12, defacements appeared on the English Twitter and YouTube accounts of Iran's state-backed, Arabic news channel Al-Alam. The defacements included images of Saudi leadership, messages in support of Operation Decisive Storm, and a false claim that the Iran-backed Houthi leader was dead. Other tweets sent from Al-Alam's Twitter account disclosed a purported list of correspondents of Al-Alam. Both Al-Alam and SaharTV, another Iranian state-backed television channel, confirmed the incident and blamed it on Saudi hackers.\nAn anonymous, self-described hacking entity, @Cyber__Emotion claimed responsibility for the attacks on Twitter. The entity's earliest publicly-known activities date back to 2014, when an actor with the same handle took over official Twitter accounts of Saudi ministries of justice and finance, questioning these institutions' lack of concern for cybersecurity. In 2016, the group allegedly compromised the official account of the Saudi Minister of Education, criticising his performance and demanding improvement in the national educational system.\nOnly a day after the Al-Alam defacements, a previously unheard of hacking group Yemen Cyber Army defaced the Saudi-owned Arabic news site Al-Hayat on April 13. The defacement announcement displayed a picture of the Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and a provocative pro-Shi'ite message against the kingdom and its allies, threatening that their time would soon be up. In addition to the defacement, the attackers leaked the names, email addresses, and hashed passwords of Al-Hayat users and subscribers.\nIran's semi-official news agency, Fars News, was among the first outlets to react to the incident. Fars News published an ‘exclusive' coverage of the Al-Hayat defacement, attributing the attack to Yemen Cyber Army without offering any evidence about the identity or background of the group. Fars News also linked to the Yemen Cyber Army's announcements and files on Pastebin, which is frequently used by hackers to claim responsibility for website defacements.\nThe only posts disseminating the Pastebin announcements came from @QuickLeakOrg, the associated Twitter account of QuickLeak[.]net. QuickLeak is a fringe, now-defunct whistleblowing site used in 2013 by an Iranian hacker group Parastoo to promote their defacements activities. QuickLeak.net was registered under an Iranian name -- the same person had also registered Zone-hc, another now-defunct Iranian site modelled after another defacement forum, Zone-H. The IP address of QuickLeak and its associated network of domains, including quickleak[.]org and Wikileak[.]ir, was hosted by Iran's main Internet Service Provider (ISP), Telecommunication Company of Iran (TCI). These details are circumstantial evidence that link the Al-Hayat defacement to an entity in Iran.\nThe Al-Alam and Al-Hayat intrusions resembled patriotic hacktivist skirmishes on the margins of an unfolding geopolitical regional conflict. However, subsequent events, circumstantial evidence, and other technical indicators led some investigators to Iran, with the Yemen Cyber Army as a possible front.\nThe Saudi-led Operation Decisive Storm in Yemen ended on April 22. It was immediately followed by Operation Restoring Hope, which purportedly sought to reduce the use of force in Yemen and\nmove toward a political solution for the conflict.66 The Yemen Cyber Army, however, was not to let go of the feud as easily.\nAbout a month after the defacement of Al-Hayat, the Yemen Cyber Army defaced the website of Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) on May 20. The MOFA homepage displayed an animated image that announced the launch of Operation Hussein Badreddin al-Houthi, named after the assassinated leader of the Houthi insurgency. The image content was familiar. Similar to the Al-Hayat defacement, it included anti-Saudi messages and strong pro-Shi'ite imagery, including pictures of Iran's Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, and Hassan Nasrallah, secretary general of Lebanon's Hezbollah militia. The announcement also featured a Guy Fawkes-masked face, the uncanny symbol of hacking collective Anonymous, and Anonymous' famous slogan ‘We Don't Forget, We Don't Forgive'.\nThe Yemen Cyber Army promised to release a trove of encrypted data on Saudi diplomats, agents, and citizens, stolen from 3000 MOFA computers. That week, Yemen Cyber Army released two tranches of private information of citizens and MOFA personnel on Pastebin as password-protected files, the password included as well.67 In the Pastebin announcement perpetrators identified as ‘Cutting Sword of Justice', the same actor behind the 2012 attack on Saudi's national oil company, Aramco. The destructive attack against Aramco, dubbed ‘Shamoon', involved automated wiping of 30,000 business devices. U.S. intelligence community and cybersecurity researchers attributed the incident to Iranian state-affiliated actors.68\nThe day after the Pastebin announcement, on May 21, Iran's Fars News published yet another exclusive report on the hack, crediting the ominous Yemen Cyber Army.69 A subsequent report on May 21 included a Word file attachment that contained links to the leaked documents on several file-sharing sites and passwords to decompress encrypted files.70 Fars News branded these exclusive reports as ‘Saudileaks'. This was the first time that the term was used as far as public records show. Between May and August 2015, Fars News published 32 pieces on Saudi Leaks in the English language.\nAgain, @QuickLeakOrg sought to promote the Pastebin announcement and Fars News exclusives, aiming for maximum public attention to the intrusion. These tweets did not generate much engagement, however.71 Efforts by journalists to confirm the identity of the Yemen Cyber Army did not yield much information as the group refused to disclose their location or even speak Arabic to the press.72\nThe magnitude, format, and timing of the intrusion, coupled with other circumstantial evidence, suggested that the perpetrators, whoever they were, had pro-Houthi aspirations and were publicly challenging Saudis' ambitions in the Yemen conflict. For its part, the Saudi MOFA confirmed the attack on its website but downplayed the impact. The Ministry also warned against using and publishing any leaked material, describing the breach as a ‘plot of the nation's enemies' and promising legal action against perpetrators.73\n### The leaks\nAgainst the warnings of the Saudi government, however, two substantive leaks put the MOFA hack on the spotlight, challenging Saudi foreign policy and practices.\nOn 19 June 2015, WikiLeaks published over sixty thousand documents, titled as Saudi Cables, and promised half a million more to follow.74 These cables comprised more than confidential diplomatic correspondences, however. They also contained personal medical and legal records of survivors of sexual abuse, sick children, and the mentally ill, among others. The mixed nature of these cables raised concerns about WikiLeaks' precarious handling of private citizen information and prompted debates about the ethics of responsible leaks.75\nWikiLeaks had previously released several controversial document sets from states and private companies. Though the whistleblowing platform had been relatively dormant for a couple of years before it published the Saudi Cables in 2015. In its press release, WikiLeaks acknowledged the Yemen\nCyber Army as the initial source of ‘valuable sample documents' but did not disclose the source of the fresh trove, leaving the question of attribution unanswered. Upon the release of Saudi Cables, the Yemen Cyber Army went quiet and quit responding to media inquiries about their connection with the whistleblowing platform.\nThe Yemen Cyber Army partially came out of the dark on June 26 with the launch of their social media accounts and two now-defunct websites: Yemenica[.]com and wikisaleaks[.]com. Yemenica was a single-page site with a declaration from the group, describing itself as a ‘Yemeni youth community' united against the Saudi regime. Again, the description flashed back to a second group that claimed responsibility for the 2012 Shamoon attack, posing as Arab Youth Group. Notably, Yemenica had a Google Plus account, which at the time was the most popular social networking site among Iranian conservatives and was unaffected by Iran's infamous censorship practices.\nWikiSaudiLeaks presented an even more aggressive anti-Saudi manifesto: subtitled as Cyber Decisive Storm, the website header showed images of bombing of Yemen by Saudi-led forces in Operation Decisive Storm. It characterised the developments, in English, as a ‘barbaric Saudi-American aggression, with which the Israelites also stand'.\nWikiSaudiLeaks was likely an additional outlet to maximise attention to the leaked materials. The documents on the site were mostly in Arabic and had already been included in the WikiLeaks release. They were classified based on countries, regions, and international organisations such as the United Nations. The list began with old and current allies of the kingdom, including Qatar, the United States, Bahrain and Turkey. WikiSaudiLeaks also contained a dedicated category for ‘Persian Gulf Countries' -- a term that Iran has zealously used throughout the naming dispute with some Arab countries who have opted for alternatives such as ‘Arabian Gulf' or ‘Gulf'. These cues shed further light on the interests and motives of those behind WikiSaudiLeaks.\nWhoever spearheaded these leaks sought to alienate Saudi's allies, influence international audiences, and disrupt Saudi's strategic plans in Yemen. Several media partners of WikiLeaks, including the free press advocacy group Reporters Without Border, published selected materials and analyses about Saudi engagements internationally. While Western media broadly reported on the cables, the regional media remained divided on the matter according to traditional political lines. Pro-Saudi media, including Al-Hayat, reiterated the state warnings and refrained from circulating the leaked materials. The Iran-owned Al-Alam, on the other hand, extensively covered the cables. In the end, many Arabic language outlets chose not to cover Saudi Cables, presumably out of concern for legal and political retribution, leaving the regional impact of the leak rather unclear.\n### The sham\nThe public attention to Saudi Cables was already subsiding when a fabricated news article briefly brought SaudiLeaks back to some headlines. On July 27, Another Western Dawn News (AWDNews), a fringe news site, published an article in English, accusing a United Nations (UN) official of receiving bribes for biased reporting against the Islamic Republic of Iran. According to the article, the Saudi embassy in Kuwait had allegedly paid Dr. Ahmad Shaheed, then UN Special Rapporteur for the Situation of Human Rights in Iran, 10 million dollars to increase international pressure on Iran for its violation of human rights. The report cited a scanned copy of a top secret document purportedly from the Saudi Cables on WikiLeaks. Contrary to the AWDNews claim, however, the ‘source' document in Arabic mentioned a million dollar -- not ten -- paid to Shaheed.\nRegardless of the discrepancy, the article prompted strong reactions inside and outside Iran. Human rights groups characterised the allegation as a sophisticated, state-directed smear campaign against Shaheed and critics of Iran's record of human rights. For years, the Islamic Republic has refused to collaborate with the UN Special Rapporteurs, accusing them of plotting with Iran's adversaries, including Saudi Arabia, for biased or fabricated reporting about the situation of human rights in Iran. This article, if true, would have been\nthe perfect evidence for Iran's enduring righteousness. The bribery claim also aligned well with Saudi's previous attempts to grow its influence in the international human rights system. According to the WikiLeaks documents, in 2014 Saudi Arabia bartered votes with the United Kingdom and Russia to gain a seat at the UN Human Rights Council, despite its nefarious record at home.\nThe article rapidly circulated on other fringe news sites such as Al-Waqt and the Middle East Press. Iran's conservative media reacted immediately and amplified the news in Persian and Arabic languages, with some citing the original source site Al-Waie News. Among those were the Young Journalists Club, which is run by the IRIB, the state-owned broadcaster, and Tasnim News, another media affiliate of the IRGC. All of these platforms promoted the one-million-dollar bribe accusation.\nAmid public confusion and media inquiries, WikiLeaks refuted the claim that the document was one of the original Saudi Cables. In a tweet to online news site Iran Front Page, WikiLeaks challenged the authenticity of the alleged document. WikiLeaks stated: ‘@IranFrontPage Please Show Which Cable This Claim Is Based on. You Fail to Link to One of Our Cables in the Article', thus adding forgery to the puzzle of Saudi Leaks. Shaheed, for his part, personally thanked WikiLeaks for the clarification.\nIt took some time for attributive leads to emerge. Three years later, in August 2018, Facebook and Twitter announced their first takedown of state-linked assets from Iran. Among the 770 Iranian Twitter accounts removed were AWDNews, Al-Waie News, Al-Waqt, and Middle East Press, all of which had played a part in the smear campaign against the UN Special Rapporteur. In November 2020, U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) issued a warrant for seizure of 29 domains for being part of the Liberty Front Press network, the same media network that Meta, Twitter, FireEye, and ClearSky had previously attributed to Iran. In an accompanying affidavit, the DOJ asserted that each of the seized domains was ‘fraudulently registered' due to each being used by or on behalf of the IRGC. AWDNews[.]com was among the seized domains.\nDid the perpetrators behind the MOFA breach and the subsequent leak plan the forgery and disinformation campaign ahead of time, or was it an afterthought? The answer is unclear. But the disinformation campaign demonstrates how hack-and-leak events can catalyse cultivating false information to new and existing audiences. Once a breach happens and secrets spill into the public domain, related but fabricated stories become more believable and harder to debunk. Actors with no stake in the previous events may also seize the opportunity to harvest the outcome of hack-and-leaks.\nThe same actor(s) may not have been behind the three stages of Saudi Leaks. The forgery may have been devised on the fly. What is established, however, is that Iran's IRGC was behind the disinformation campaign. The manipulation of leaked material signals Iran's interest and capacity in leveraging the output of hack-and-leak events for influencing domestic and international audiences and antagonising Saudi allies.\n## Competing hypotheses: a framework for analysis\nThe multi-stage nature of the WikiSaudiLeaks event calls for a multi-stage attribution. Thus far, there is only decisive evidence for attributing the forgery to Iran based on Twitter and Facebook takedowns and DOJ's attribution. Yemen Cyber Army's lack of any historical background has bolstered speculations that it was a front for other prominent actors with resources, motives, and ambitions for such an undertaking. The attribution of the MOFA hack and the leaks has remained divergent. As the following passages indicate, existing research points to Iran and Russia as the two main culprits. Other possibilities include Yemeni hackers or a collaboration among different actors. This section considers possible hints for attributing the breach into the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs network and the leaks that ensued.\nThe breach\nThere are two possibilities with regard to the breach of the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The first hypothesis is that Iran breached the ministry's networks. This scenario would be in-line with Iran's involvement in a wider espionage operation that targeted government, military, and critical infrastructure targets across the Middle East between 2013 and 2015.\nIn June 2015, cybersecurity firm ClearSky published a report on an operation that had been in progress since mid 2014. ClearSky dubbed the alleged campaign ‘Thamar Reservoir' and pointed out a variety of targets of high interest to Iranian politics. These targets included international relations and defence professionals from Saudi Arabia, Israel, and elsewhere in the Middle East. The campaign utilised a range of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), including social engineering and spear phishing, mostly through Google services. ClearSky attributed Thamar Reservoir with high confidence to Iranian actors due to its considerable similarities of TTPs and overlapping infrastructure with previous operations also attributed to Iranian actors like Rocket Kitten and AjaxTeam.\nAnother cybersecurity company, Cylance, dubbed a related campaign ‘Operation Cleaver'. Cleaver included targets from Saudi Arabia's oil and gas and transportation industries in 2013--14. Among the TTPs used in Operation Cleaver, one particularly stands out. The threat actor predominantly used spear phishing to deceive targets to visit a job search website and submit their resumes. The scheme used an imposter of a legitimate professional development service winresume[.]com and its Easy Resume Creator Pro service to lure job candidates to download and install malware TinyZBot. The threat actor attempted to deceive its targets by convincing them they had a pending job opportunity at the industrial group Teledyne, through fake domains such as Teledyne-Jobs[.]com. To know more about the opportunity, the target had to use the malicious resume submission service. One of the Saudi cables later released by WikiLeaks suggests that a threat actor had used this very tactic to breach the Saudi MOFA network months before the May 2015 intrusion.\nIn January 2015, Saudi MOFA internally circulated a 14-page incident response report, describing an attack on the ministry's network that had started on 20 July 2014 (10 months before the May 2015 attack). The report, which is included in one of the Saudi cables, indicates that the system administrator of MOFA had received a targeted email with a job opportunity from the fictitious employer Teledyne. The target fell for the scheme and his machine was infected with the TinyZBot malware, which prompted data exfiltration from his device.\nThe ministry, however, only noticed the compromise in November 2014, when it detected failed proxy connections between the system admin computer and a suspicious server. 88.150.214.166 was the IP address of the server, which corresponds to that of the malicious domain Teledyne-Jobs[.]com, reportedly created by Iranian hackers. Outed by Cylance's Operation Cleaver report on 2 December 2014, the fake website stopped working on the same day. The MOFA report does not identify the extent of data exfiltration and network impact. But the document repeatedly cites Operation Cleaver, expressly attributing the attack to Iranian actors.\nThe public-facing WikiSaudiLeaks event started only in April 2015, but these technical reports put forward an alternative possibility. That is the attackers may have exfiltrated the diplomatic cables from the MOFA network earlier but held onto them until the Yemen conflict began to complicate regional geopolitics. This tactic resembles the hacking of Britam Defense. The company was hacked in November 2012 but the perpetrators held onto the stolen material until January 2013, when a U.S. military strike in Syria seemed looming. This significant time-delay is another indication of a professional intelligence agency tradecraft, as activists or militants likely would have acted more swiftly on a whim.\n## Russia\nThe Saudi MOFA was of interest to the Russian actors, too. Russia is known to have engaged in reconnaissance and espionage activities against Middle Eastern targets in the spring of 2015.\nFANCY BEAR, also known as Sofacy or APT 28, a unit of Russia's military intelligence agency (GRU), reportedly breached the Saudi embassy in Ukraine in February 2015. The exclusive use of this vulnerability by FANCY BEAR until April 2015 has led researchers to entertain the possibility that Russia may also be responsible for the breach of the Saudi MOFA's network in the WikiSaudiLeaks event.\nThe attack infrastructure in the GRU campaign also contains noteworthy overlaps with the ominous Yemen Cyber Army. Wikisaleaks, the website ostensibly run by Yemen Cyber Army, was registered on the same range of IP addresses linked to FANCY BEAR in 2015. The address is part of a range of 256 at Lithuanian hosting provider UAB DUOMENU CENTRAS, leased to an intermediary company, MonoVM. The company offers a range of services, including dedicated servers and web hosting. In May 2015, it still accepted a variety of crypto currencies, such as Bitcoin and Skrill, to process transactions. These decentralised methods of payment have been appealing to Russian actors for purchasing the infrastructure for hacking operations. The domain MonoVM[.]com has been registered with a Dubai address, but it appears to be owned or managed by Iranian individuals. The registrant details also include information about another hosting company, Azar Online, registered under the same Persian names. Azar Online appears to be an ISP in Tabriz, the capital of Eastern Azerbaijan province in Iran.\nLater disclosures established even more links between MonoVM and Iran. In December 2020, amid then-President Trump and his close allies' allegations of election fraud, a new website emerged with a hit list of U.S. officials that refuted Trump's claims. *Enemies of the People* sought to incite violence and wreak havoc in the United States. The Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) quickly attributed this operation to Iran. One of the associated domains of Enemies of the People website was hosted on MonoVM.\nIt is possible that FANCY BEAR used MonoVM, likely an Iranian company, for its espionage operations while masquerading as Yemen Cyber Army. FANCY BEAR has utilised the same technique, known as false flag, with other fronts such as the CyberBerkut and CyberCaliphate -- two GRU front groups that emerged in 2014. An alternative possibility, however, is that other actors, including Iranians, utilised MonoVM services for their purposes around the same time, thus creating a false flag, likely unintentionally.\nLater events suggested a third hypothesis. In 2019, another Russian actor, Turla (aka Snake), identified as Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), was detected to have hijacked the technical infrastructure of OilRig, an Iranian threat actor, for espionage attacks in 2017 and early 2018. In October 2019, US and UK intelligence services confirmed that Turla had exploited the command and control and operational infrastructure of Iranian actors to expand its network of victims.\nTurla had previously targeted entities in 45 countries in 2015, including governments, military organisations, and research institutions. Most of these victims were located in the Middle East and Europe. There is no evidence for such hijacking of infrastructure prior to 2017. Though it is possible that Turla, or other Russian actors, might have co-opted TTPs of Iranian actors in an effort to further obfuscate attribution for WikiSaudiLeaks. For example, Turla has used a variant of Mimikatz, a commonplace hacking tool used extensively by different actors, which was also previously used by Iranian actors in Operation Cleaver. A fourth possibility could be that the two groups, Iranians and Russians, may have been collaborating in some capacity.\n### The leaks\nAttribution of the leaks remains challenging, in large part due to limited evidence available on the details of the transfer of Saudi Cables to WikiLeaks and WikiSaudiLeaks websites. This gap is perpetuated by three factors. First, wikisaleaks[.]com was registered on the same IP range as the Russian C2 infrastructure in 2015. Second, yemenica[.]com, the other website of the Yemen Cyber Army, was registered with an email address from the Russian webmail provider, Yandex.\na report from 2019^{120} suggests that two weeks after the release of Saudi Cables in June 2015, WikiLeaks moved its web hosting infrastructure to a new server in Russia. Prior to the transfer, however, the same IP address hosted a fake domain that had been associated with phishing attacks by the Iranian Rocket Kitten until May 2015.^{121} This suggests that WikiLeaks may have collaborated with the Iranian hackers for the intrusion of Saudi MOFA, or coordinated for the transfer of stolen documents. It could also entirely be a coincidence. As with MonoVM, different actors may have used the same infrastructure for their preferred setup and reliability.\n## Five vectors for a deconstructed approach to attribution\nOur analysis of competing hypotheses illustrates that evidence on the technical, operational, and political aspects of the WikiSaudiLeaks events point to more than a single suspect. In entertaining these hypotheses, we consider a multi-factor framework that includes the history of different actors in undertaking hack-and-leak operations, motivation, messaging, capabilities (technical and otherwise), and infrastructure.^{122} Together, these indicators pave the ground for addressing the question of ‘who did it', with Iran, Russia, or the Yemen Cyber Army as the most likely culprits.\n### History\nIn assessing a threat actor's history, we first consider past behaviour that tracks with the tradecraft used in the case in question. Out of the three likely culprits, Iran and Russia had previously engaged in computer network exploitation (CNE) against a variety of adversaries, in particular diplomatic targets from the Middle East. Moreover, they both had previously used fictitious fronts in CNE and computer network attack (CNA) operations. Iranian Charming Kitten (APT33) had targeted Saudi Aramco in 2012, posing as the Cutting Sword of Justice and Arab Youth Group.^{123} Russia, too, has a history of using front groups for active measures.^{124} Cyber Berkut was a Russian scheme, posing as an anti-Ukraine hacktivist group to target the websites of NATO and several German officials in March 2014^{125} and January 2015,^{126} respectively. CyberCaliphate, a seemingly ISIS-associated group, breached TV5 Monde, a major French television network with global coverage, resulting in network disruption for hours in April 2015.^{127} The ominous Yemen Cyber Army, however, lacks any history prior to WikiSaudiLeaks, which bolsters the possibility of a front for other more established actors, like Iran or Russia.\n### Motivation\nSecond, we investigate the motivation which refers to a perpetrator's interest in conducting certain actions in a geopolitical context. WikiSaudiLeaks was a retaliatory response to the Saudis for their intervention in the Yemen conflict. In principle, the Houthi rebels and Iran would have both benefited from the collapse of the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen. While Russia has taken an intermediary role in Yemen to avoid direct conflict, the failure of a key US ally would still serve Russia's political and economic objectives in the region. Moreover, Iran and Russia's decisive intervention in Syria in support of the Assad regime has been met with unwavering opposition from Saudi Arabia and the United States, with either side accusing the other of supporting ‘terrorists'.^{128} The humiliating hack-and-leak events of WikiSaudiLeaks thus serve both Iran and Russia's vengeance toward Saudi Arabia.\n### Messaging\nThird, we turn to messaging which relates to the semantics and semiotics of the behaviour. The language, signs, and other cues used to communicate with the audience often contain clues about the actor. The WikiSaudiLeaks operators used a consistent anti-Saudi tone in all stages: the hacking of Al-Hayat and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, promoting the leaked material, and the\ndisinformation campaign. They conveyed resistance to the Saudi intervention in Yemen, with an obvious emphasis on pro-Iranian and pro-Shi'ite sentiments. In addition, the Iranian state media network was the first to systematically cover ‘Saudileaks' in English, weeks before WikiLeaks and other outlets did. At the very least, the zealous communication underscores Iran's vested interest in the incident. This is not to say that the same operators were behind the publication of the leaked material. However, these considerations along with the history and motivation factors skew the attribution assessment toward Iran. Admittedly, some of these details can be manipulated to falsely point in a certain direction and obfuscate attribution. Using a geopolitical cover makes attribution of a false flag operation particularly challenging.^{129}\n### Capability\nFourth, capability entails the technical expertise, economic and human resources, and enterprising networks of operators and media affiliates that enable a malicious operation. The WikiSaudiLeaks event suggests coordination among a network of operators on different levels, each marshalling a variety of skill sets. Each stage required capabilities that both Iran and Russia demonstrated before. Yet these factors seem far less viable for the Yemen Cyber Army due to its lack of history.\n### Infrastructure\nLastly, the infrastructure factor concerns the foundations for physical and virtual communication used to deliver a technical capability or maintain the command and control of capabilities.^{130} These structures include electronic devices, servers, domain tools, online services, and social media accounts, to name a few, that attackers can buy, lease, share, compromise, and repurpose to develop their infrastructure. In hack-and-leak operations, the infrastructure for the intrusion may not be the same as what is used for the leak. It is also possible that different actors use the same infrastructure at different points in time.^{131}\nAs with WikiSaudiLeaks, possible overlap of infrastructures can significantly impede detection and attribution. The wikisaleaks[.]com domain, one of the websites affiliated with Yemen Cyber Army, was registered at an IP address from likely-Iranian hosting company MonoVM. The IP address also intersected with the Russian infrastructure used to target the Saudi embassy in Ukraine in early 2015. It is entirely plausible, then, that Iranian and Russian actors were using web services offered by the same provider around the same time, hence the overlapping IP addresses. However, it is not possible to determine whether this infrastructure switch was intentional or merely a coincidence.\nConsidered together, history, motivation, messaging, capability, and infrastructure provide a framework for examining the competing hypotheses about attribution. Proper synthesis of these details is not possible with the same level of certainty across the WikiSaudiLeaks event. In attributing a multi-stage incident, we propose to assess each stage (the hack and the leak) against these five indicators. Tables 1 and 2 summarise the degree to which each stage of the WikiSaudiLeaks event can be attributed to three likely perpetrators: Yemen Cyber Army, Iran, and Russia.^{132}\nAs Tables 1 and 2 indicate, the Yemen Cyber Army has the lowest chance of being a real culprit. Lack of history and information about the group increases the possibility that it may have been a fictitious front for other perpetrators. The network intrusion can be attributed to Iran and Russia with varying degrees of confidence. Attributing the leak is not as straightforward, however. There is limited evidence of politically motivated leaks by Iranian actors unless Iran was indeed behind the attack on Britam Defence in 2013. While Russia has a long history of leaks during the Cold War and the pre-Internet days, there is limited credible evidence on Russia's involvement in cyber-enabled leaks prior to the attack on the DNC in 2016. Other indicators -- such as pro-Iran messaging, subtle cues from wikisaleaks[.]com, and the extensive coverage of the leaks by state-affiliated media early on -- can be taken as the involvement of Iran on some level. Last but not least, Iran is responsible for the forgery and disinformation campaign that came out of the WikiSaudiLeaks event. Overall, Iran scores higher on all three stages than other possible culprits.\nINTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY\n793\nTable 1.

Possible forgeries among the leaked data and plausible false flags add to the complications of attribution. The same actor(s) may not be behind seemingly related events. Distinguishing these actors from one another also comes with particular complexities. In this context, de-layering the attribution process and investigating each layer separately facilitate the assessment. The outcome may be varying degrees of confidence in the attribution of each stage, which in turn helps to identify the gaps in the attribution of digital covert action. The case of WikiSaudiLeaks captures these nuances.\nOn the strategic level, attribution remains a political decision based on information collated by intelligence and security agencies or influenced by foreign policy considerations.¹³⁴ It delineates red lines and weighs a set of legitimate responses to the attack.¹³⁵ In the case of WikiSaudiLeaks, affected state parties did not publicly attribute this case. Saudi officials offered little public communication regarding the source of the intrusion. Nor did allies of the kingdom with prominent cyber capabilities, such as the United States, release high level technical or intelligence assessments about WikiSaudiLeaks. Instead, speculative attribution was done by cyber security firms and individual researchers, who lack the authority and means to collect the signal and human intelligence necessary to reliably attribute an attack to a state.¹³⁶\nStrategic attribution comes at a cost, politically and logistically. It requires multiple government agencies and often private sector firms working together, often across borders, utilising their intelligence sources and methods. While there is no consistent approach to attributing cyber attacks among states, an incident is more likely to invoke attribution by states if it passes a two-fold test of significance: (1) the nature and severity of the attack, and (2) the affected parties and implications for their national security. In other words, who is targeted and how they are targeted are the key questions that can invoke an attribution response by states and their allies. The closer an attack hits one's home, the more likely that the state gets involved. Thus, the target and severity of cyber-enabled covert action affect the decision to expend resources on public attribution. WikiSaudiLeaks may not have passed this test.\nWhy was the campaign not conclusively attributed? First, the forensic evidence did not unambiguously point to a single adversary at any given moment.¹³⁷ Second, the entire event, it appears, was not consequential enough at any given moment in time for the Saudi government to initiate a more determined investigation and response. Lastly, although the attack was politically embarrassing, it seems that it did not constitute a sufficiently severe national security threat to Saudi Arabia to escalate to an international investigation with support from more experienced and capable allies.\nYet WikiSaudiLeaks set an internationally consequential precedent. It was highly likely the first state-enabled hack-and-leak operation that utilised WikiLeaks as an amplifying platform, a tactic that was most notably used just one year later in the most tectonic digital covert campaign of our times, the DNC hack-and-leak. In hindsight, it may have been a strategic shortcoming on the part of the US and UK intelligence communities not to have partnered with Saudi intelligence for a more robust response to WikiSaudiLeaks. Both countries, after all, became the target of Russian and Iranian active measures in the 2016, 2018, and 2019 elections, respectively. The episode nevertheless underscores the significance of coalitions and partnerships, especially if a targeted government does not possess mature capabilities and experience in attribution. WikiSaudiLeaks came before the consolidation of such theories as persistent engagement and defend forward in U.S. cyber strategy. With the benefit of hindsight, the same attack on an ally's integrity today may -- and should -- prompt a more mature response from FiveEyes partners and other open societies.\n## Conclusion\nCovert action is a political instrument. Hack-and-leak incidents may be designed to mess with regional and international politics by ‘inflaming existing contradictions', to use the old Soviet terminology once honed by KGB's Service A, history's most advanced disinformation bureaucracy. Hack-and-leak operations are only technically upgraded iterations of Cold War collect-and-leak operations. Since at least 2013, predominantly authoritarian governments have deployed hack-and-leak operations amid geopolitical crises against a range of adversaries. WikiSaudiLeaks is the pivotal historic example.\nThe multi-stage nature of digital covert action requires a multi-stage attribution process. This process extends across technical, operational, and strategic levels. Such all-source analysis must still cut across often hardwearing disciplinary boundaries between the kind of digital forensics commonly used in incident response and threat intelligence reporting and the kind of digital forensics commonly used to investigate influence operations (IO) and disinformation. Moreover, a single confidence score may not be appropriate for multi-stage events. That is, analysis of one stage may produce a degree of confidence that differs from other components of the same event. Worse, in extreme cases different components of what might appear as one campaign can be perpetrated by different actors, even unbeknownst to each other.\nWikiSaudiLeaks was strategically designed to inflame contradictions in Saudi Arabia, a party to the Yemen conflict, to wedge open its alliances, and rally international public opinion against the kingdom. The evidence available to us does not allow for definitive attribution for the entire WikiSaudiLeaks event. Instead, a multi-stage all-source investigation offers more details about each component. Each stage requires exploring a different set of forensic artefacts, as well as considering separate tactical, operational, and strategic aspects. The Saudi MOFA-related intrusions could be attributed, based on circumstantial evidence, to either Iran or Russia, possibly even both. The lack of forensic evidence about the provenance of the leaks adds to the challenge of attributing the campaign's exposure stage. However, Iran and Russia remain the most likely culprits, with some circumstantial evidence pointing to Iran. The final stage, the digital disinformation and amplification campaign, can be confidently attributed to Iran, given the abundant evidence exposed by social media companies. A multi-stage event, therefore, requires a multi-stage attribution process -- one that allows for gradients of attribution within each stage.\nThere are three non-exclusive explanations for why WikiSaudiLeaks was not attributed with high confidence to a specific adversary. First, the target, in this case Saudi Arabia, did not have sufficient political determination to perform public attribution. Amid the Yemen conflict, the kingdom was intent on minimising attention to the Saudi Cables and staying on message about the unravelling proxy war with Iran. Second, Saudi Arabia and interested third parties -- including the United States -- likely had insufficient incentive to unlock the attributive resources required to link the campaign to a specific adversary. Access to attributive capabilities consists of both access to a range of forensic\nartefacts and access to the skills and experience necessary to acquire, develop, cross-reference, process, analyse, contextualise, and interpret relevant signals and artefacts. Finally, the WikiSaudiLeaks campaign exhibited features that made the overall event exceptionally hard to attribute to one specific adversary. It is highly likely that these features were partly intended by at least one adversary, and partly unintended.\nMinimising uncertainty is the primary undertaking of attribution. Yet it is a highly complex and nuanced process. Technical forensic artefacts, if inconclusive, must be considered together with other data, obtained from a variety of sources, collected both passively and actively. The delayed nature of attribution further complicates the task. Additional useful details may only become available months or even years later, as our case illustrates, thus rendering early judgements incomplete. False flags, or suspicion thereof, and other challenges can significantly complicate attribution and the response it may require.\nAttributing twenty-first century covert action -- integrated campaigns that have a CNE, CNA, and possibly an IO component -- in a nutshell, is an art and a science and, above all, an all-source enterprise and as such vastly different from attributing narrow computer network breaches. In this attribution process, analysts will have to be ready to disentangle some campaigns, assessing, analysing and attributing their respective components -- the hack, forge, leak, amplify -- on their own merits. Attributing one or multiple components may be easy or hard, linking them together is a separate challenge yet. Adversaries, in turn, may take advantage of this layered attribution challenge.\nWikiSaudiLeaks came before its time, as the analytic toolsets and the strategic and investigative approaches necessary to understand and attribute this event have continued to mature after the fact. After all, it was only around 2016 that security firms started seriously integrating CNE and IO in their public-facing investigative work, with Mandiant among the first,^{142} and Microsoft^{143} and later Google^{144} following suit. Nor did the US government adopt the strategies of persistent engagement and defend forward until 2018,^{145} three years after WikiSaudiLeaks.\nSaudi Cables, in hindsight, was a chameleon that appeared as a different thing against different backdrops: seen in the WikiLeaks context, it appeared as innocent transparency activism; in the website defacement context, it appeared as patriot hacker skirmishes; and viewed against the foil of expanding digital covert action, it appeared as a campaign of at least one authoritarian intelligence agency."

This paper revisits one of the most complex, most significant, and most mysterious digital covert actions of our time: a 2015 hack-and-leak case known among investigators as 'WikiSaudiLeaks' that so far has evaded attribution. We argue that WikiSaudiLeaks was not a stand-alone event, but a puzzle piece in a larger covert action campaign that involved advanced computer network exploitation, computer network attack, persistent deception, and a creative influence and disinformation effort. By disintegrating the larger event into its components, limited attribution becomes possible. We present the most detailed and comprehensive investigation of this case to date, attribute at least one component of the larger event to Iranian intelligence, and draw conceptional conclusions.\n## Introduction\nWhat was WikiSaudiLeaks and why was it so hard to attribute? This paper revisits one of the most complex, most significant, and most mysterious hack-and-leak puzzles of our time, a 2015 case known among investigators as ‘WikiSaudiLeaks'. The name refers to a mysterious website that surfaced and disseminated a major trove of files taken from the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The site's operators curiously claimed to have given the stolen documents to WikiLeaks, which claimed to have published 122,619 files by year's end.1 Subsequently, the material received high profile press coverage2 and became known as ‘The Saudi Cables'.\nWikiSaudiLeaks is an early example of a fundamental yet neglected attribution challenge.3 The event was not unified. The leak was part of a larger covert action campaign that involved advanced computer network exploitation, computer network attack, persistent deception, and a creative influence and disinformation effort.4 Yet so far neither scholars nor investigators from public or private sector have been able to conclusively attribute WikiSaudiLeaks to a specific threat actor -- in sharp contrast to most other comparable high-profile cases. Why? Because the leak does nothing less than challenge the established attribution paradigm. Hack-and-leak events are not widely discussed, and existing scholarship tends to focus on the interplay between intrusion and influence, while neglecting the consequences for attribution.5 What if a single attribution statement for digital covert action is not possible in the first place?\nWikiSaudiLeaks happened just as the goldilocks moment of digital covert action was ending: about a year before the Russian election interference in the United States, when bulk leaks were still seen as innocent expressions of transparency activism; and just two years after Mandiant's APT1 report,6 when the public attribution debate and capabilities were still in their infancy. Later events have motivated prolific scholarship, most prominently the Democratic National Committee (DNC) hack-and-leak.7 Yet some of the earliest and most significant instances of digital covert action remain\nunderstudied. It is time to revise the WikiSaudiLeaks case, and with it our understanding of attributing covert action.\nDigital covert action was on the rise throughout the 2010s, with hack-and-leak operations making up a significant share. This rise is enabled, but insufficiently explained, by technological change. A list of the major hits would include the late 2000s campaign known as Stuxnet; various wiping attacks against Iranian targets in 2011; the 2012 attack against Saudi Aramco and Rasgas; the neglected 2013 Britam Defence leak; the 2014 Sony Pictures Entertainment breach-and-leak;; two remarkable blackouts in Kiev in 2015 and 2016 as well as numerous other operations in Ukraine; the series of breach-and-leak operations against the US election in 2016; the mysterious series of Shadow Brokers leaks; the ransomware attacks known as Wannacry and NotPetya in 2017, one executed poorly, the other deceptively; the Viasat sabotage at the outset of the Ukraine War in 2022, and several more, some of them subtle, others as yet not publicly discussed. The continuous and dynamic nature of such offensive activity helped give rise to the concepts of ‘persistent engagement' and ‘defend forward' in the U.S. government, in which attribution played a key role. Indeed all these major cases had one core feature in common: governments, and in many cases independent researchers, have attributed them with high confidence or even certainty to specific adversaries.\nYet WikiSaudiLeaks stands out: not only has it not been attributed with confidence, the case is also curiously understudied. Both absences are all the more remarkable given that the covert action has generated an extraordinary amount of media coverage, with hundreds of press stories. The ensuing leak is also infamous as one of the most unethical and extreme so far, releasing unredacted cables that included full names and passport numbers of victims of torture and sexual abuse.\nWhy was the campaign not attributed so far? What can this curious case tell us about the past and future of attributing computer network operations in general and covert action specifically? And, of course: who was responsible for WikiSaudiLeaks?\nWe argue that by breaking down the larger event into its components, limited attribution becomes possible. To understand the saga that is Wikisaudileaks, investigators must first deconstruct what appears to be one coherent event into its constituent components: collection, disclosure, and amplification. Each component, counterintuitively, may not only come with a specific confidence level; it may also lead to diverging and separate attribution assessments. What looks like one operation at a first glance, with closer inspection may, in fact, collapse into multiple operations. The limited scholarship on this case has entertained the possibility of Russian involvement. We attribute at least one component of the larger covert action to Iran.\nAttribution is what states make of it. The outcome of an attributive investigation into a major computer network breach is determined by resources and political priorities, both on the side of the victim and on the side of the perpetrator. The perpetrator plans and equips a clandestine or covert operation to sustain deniability -- the victim plans and equips investigative and analytical outfits to take deniability away. The decision to publicly attribute, however, is correlated with such factors as incident severity, geopolitical circumstances, the intelligence available on the case, technical and operational capacity, and the political will of those involved in the attribution process. The WikiSaudiLeaks event puts the interaction of these indicators to test and underscores several gaps in the attribution process.\nThe paper proceeds in four steps. First we provide context to hack-and-leak operations in the Middle East by revisiting a neglected case from 2013, the earliest known instance of a hack-and-leak. We then offer a granular analysis of the WikiSaudiLeaks event, unmasking a related disinformation campaign that so far has not been covered in public or confidential reporting on the case. The third section reviews competing hypotheses in the attribution of WikiSaudiLeaks, followed by a framework for attribution of different stages of the covert action. We close by discussing the challenges of attribution of this particular case and, more broadly, digital covert action.\n##\nPrelude\nHack-and-leak operations have become ever more common since 2013, globally and especially in the Middle East. Around that time, a number of still mysterious leaks appeared that, in hindsight, could have been the work of intelligence agencies or contractors. The rise of the Anonymous movement as well as WikiLeaks offered unprecedented and obvious opportunities for covert operations. For a few years before the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the wider public and most journalists saw leaks as something positive first and foremost, as a way to create transparency and accountability -- not as an ideal cover for dirty tricks.\nThe breaches that enable the subsequent disclosure of stolen files may be initially done for espionage purposes, or the targeting may be driven by covert action objectives. The offenders' precise intentions are likely to remain obscure in the absence of direct intelligence access or declassified archival records. Historically, however, it was often ‘throwaway' -- files that no longer served a narrow intelligence purpose -- that were used to furnish the content for targeted leaks. Particularly noteworthy in this context were the Shaltai Boltai disclosures in Russia, and, a few months after WikiSaudiLeaks, in October 2015, the unattributed and fairly obscure ‘Turok' FSB leak. These operations often seek to undermine an adversary's decision-making, political cohesion, domestic public opinion, leaders, reputation, and alliances.\nWhat follows is a prelude to the WikiSaudiLeaks event, similarly involving a regional conflict in the Middle East, equally neglected, and inconclusively attributed.\n### Britam defense\nThe earliest known major case of hack-and-leak operations in the Middle East dates back to the early 2010s. The context for the case was the civil war in Syria. In July 2012, the Syrian government acknowledged that it had chemical weapons in its possession though it would never deploy such weapons against its own citizens but only against foreign intervention. In August, then-President Barack Obama warned the Bashar al-Assad regime that any use of chemical weapons in Syria would significantly change his calculus on a U.S. military response. The prospect of a U.S. strike in Syria concerned Assad's key allies, Iran and Russia, who have remained staunch supporters of the Syrian government since the beginning of the conflict in early 2011.\nThe first allegation of use of chemical weapons in Syria was reported in the city of Homs on 23 December 2012. The news rippled through the region and beyond. On 15 January 2013, an anonymous source alleged to Foreign Policy that the State Department had compelling evidence to attribute the chemical attack to the Syrian military. These unverified, controversial claims raised speculations that a U.S. military strike in Syria might be imminent.\nThen, on 22 January, a mysterious post appeared on Pastebin, a widely used disclosure and documentation platform, titled ‘Millitary server hacked. Confidential data!‘ An entity calling itself ‘JAsIrX' posted a short note in broken English, about 130 words, with no fewer than 51 URLs to file-sharing sites. The note was crude, and claimed that Britam Defence, a UK-based military contractor, ‘killed Arabs in Iraq and plans to invade in Iran and Syria'.\nShortly after, around 24 January, a report appeared on the obscure site cyberwarnews[.]info, claiming that Britam had been hacked. On 28 January 2013, conspiracy theory websites started covering the leak. The niche site whatdoesitmean[.]com headlined: ‘Obama Plan for World War III Stuns Russia'. That same day Infowars titled: ‘Hacked Emails Reveal “Washington-Approved” Plan to Stage Chemical Weapons Attack in Syria'.\nThe following day the story went mainstream. The Daily Mail, one of the UK's most-read tabloids, blasted: ‘U.S. “backed plan to launch chemical weapon attack on Syria and blame it on Assad's regime”'. The report in the Mail cited an email exchange from the previous month, allegedly among a group of senior managers at Britam. The exchange suspiciously mentioned a proposal that Britam would supply chemical weapons to Syria, while posing as Russian mercenaries, in exchange\nfor a significant amount of money. The Daily Mail in turn linked to the initial report in Cyber War News that took the leak at face value.\nBritam, in fact, was targeted by a successful hack-leak-forge operation. An unknown attacker had breached Britam's email, likely in November 2012. On January 22 the perpetrators, calling themselves ‘JAsIrX', started posting internal documents from Britam on Pastebin. One email exchange from October 2012 purported to link Britam to a military training project in Saudi Arabia to increase readiness for a possible strike by Iran. Another exchange claimed a U.S.-backed proposal to Britam to ‘deliver a CW to Homs' and deploy its Ukrainian personnel to pose as Russian mercenaries\nThe fabricated incriminating emails appeared to have been sent two months apart from one another; yet both digital artefacts shared the same unique message identity number, and had the exact same ‘sent' timestamp, at 23:57:18. Similarly, the documents pertaining to the Saudi military project were created and modified in short succession on Friday, 18 January 2013 at 12:00 GMT. The suspicious content, combined with the suspicious metadata, makes it highly likely that these forged documents sought to falsely incriminate the company in a plot against the United States and Saudi Arabia.\nThe story immediately appeared on Press TV, the English language branch of the state-run broadcaster, Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB). Press TV took a hard anti-Western position, noting the timing as ‘the Syrian army forces have managed to clear the capital, Damascus and its surrounding areas of the militants and restore security'. Seeking renewed attention to the case, Fars News, a key media affiliate of Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), republished the allegations in August 2013, citing whatdoesitmean. Other Iranian hardliner news sites, notably Mehr News, echoed the recycled article, but the story did not gain much attention.\nAttribution in the case of the Britam hack-leak-forge remained vague. A Sunday Times article entertained the possibility of Iran's involvement, but offered no solid sourcing or evidence. There is limited public technical forensics available about the attack. But contextual and operational cues, such as Iran's high stakes in Syria and the unusual media coverage by state-affiliated outlets, support the Iran hypothesis.\nEither way, the incident was the first major hack-and-leak operation that involved a variety of state and nonstate actors in Middle East politics. Whoever was behind the operation had a vested interest in implicating the United States in the use of chemical weapons in Syria, and in detracting from the truth. The event unfolded in multiple stages. The perpetrator conducted a network intrusion and collected data on the target ahead of time, manipulated the data to take advantage of geopolitical developments in the region, and promptly released the stolen (and forged) materials to maximise the believability of the plot. These same features were also on display in the WikiSaudiLeaks operation that hit Saudi Arabia two years later. Similarly, both cases remain shrouded in mystery with no conclusive attribution.\nIn both events, adversarial actors were only beginning to flex technical resources to advance geopolitical motives through digital covert action. Inconclusive attribution in those early days extended the opportunity to the perpetrators to seek to subvert more significant targets. It was only a matter of time until major Western powers began to feel the burn at home.\n## WikiSaudiLeaks\nThe Yemen civil war was still fresh in March 2015. The Shi'ite Houthi rebels had taken over the capital city of Sanaa and ousted the Saudi-backed President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and its allies had launched a military offensive, Operation Decisive Storm, to counter the Iran-backed Houthi militias. Between March 26 and April 22, the Saudi-led airstrikes caused civil casualties and massive destruction across Yemen. The Saudi and Iranian interventions were, in some ways, only one episode in a long lineage of foreign interference in Yemen's affairs, some overt, others covert. Yet the escalating civil war offered the context for a new, unprecedented form of outside intervention -- one that remained shrouded in mystery for years.\nWikiSaudiLeaks unfolded in three episodes. First, a series of hacking incidents targeted both Iranian and Saudi-affiliated media outlets, suggesting patriotic hacker skirmishes on the margins of the Yemen conflict. The network intrusion soon reached the Saudi Ministry of Foreign affairs. Before long, in the second phase, troves of confidential cables from the Ministry were leaked to the public via WikiLeaks and other platforms. The third, and previously undiscussed, stage involved a disinformation campaign against a United Nations expert that Iran-affiliated media broadly promoted. The following sections offer a deep dive into these stages, outlining the technical, operational, and political context to each layer.\n### The hacks\nIn March and April 2015, a series of hacking incidents started drawing attention to the unfolding conflict in Yemen. On April 12, defacements appeared on the English Twitter and YouTube accounts of Iran's state-backed, Arabic news channel Al-Alam. The defacements included images of Saudi leadership, messages in support of Operation Decisive Storm, and a false claim that the Iran-backed Houthi leader was dead. Other tweets sent from Al-Alam's Twitter account disclosed a purported list of correspondents of Al-Alam. Both Al-Alam and SaharTV, another Iranian state-backed television channel, confirmed the incident and blamed it on Saudi hackers.\nAn anonymous, self-described hacking entity, @Cyber__Emotion claimed responsibility for the attacks on Twitter. The entity's earliest publicly-known activities date back to 2014, when an actor with the same handle took over official Twitter accounts of Saudi ministries of justice and finance, questioning these institutions' lack of concern for cybersecurity. In 2016, the group allegedly compromised the official account of the Saudi Minister of Education, criticising his performance and demanding improvement in the national educational system.\nOnly a day after the Al-Alam defacements, a previously unheard of hacking group Yemen Cyber Army defaced the Saudi-owned Arabic news site Al-Hayat on April 13. The defacement announcement displayed a picture of the Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and a provocative pro-Shi'ite message against the kingdom and its allies, threatening that their time would soon be up. In addition to the defacement, the attackers leaked the names, email addresses, and hashed passwords of Al-Hayat users and subscribers.\nIran's semi-official news agency, Fars News, was among the first outlets to react to the incident. Fars News published an ‘exclusive' coverage of the Al-Hayat defacement, attributing the attack to Yemen Cyber Army without offering any evidence about the identity or background of the group. Fars News also linked to the Yemen Cyber Army's announcements and files on Pastebin, which is frequently used by hackers to claim responsibility for website defacements.\nThe only posts disseminating the Pastebin announcements came from @QuickLeakOrg, the associated Twitter account of QuickLeak[.]net. QuickLeak is a fringe, now-defunct whistleblowing site used in 2013 by an Iranian hacker group Parastoo to promote their defacements activities. QuickLeak.net was registered under an Iranian name -- the same person had also registered Zone-hc, another now-defunct Iranian site modelled after another defacement forum, Zone-H. The IP address of QuickLeak and its associated network of domains, including quickleak[.]org and Wikileak[.]ir, was hosted by Iran's main Internet Service Provider (ISP), Telecommunication Company of Iran (TCI). These details are circumstantial evidence that link the Al-Hayat defacement to an entity in Iran.\nThe Al-Alam and Al-Hayat intrusions resembled patriotic hacktivist skirmishes on the margins of an unfolding geopolitical regional conflict. However, subsequent events, circumstantial evidence, and other technical indicators led some investigators to Iran, with the Yemen Cyber Army as a possible front.\nThe Saudi-led Operation Decisive Storm in Yemen ended on April 22. It was immediately followed by Operation Restoring Hope, which purportedly sought to reduce the use of force in Yemen and\nmove toward a political solution for the conflict.66 The Yemen Cyber Army, however, was not to let go of the feud as easily.\nAbout a month after the defacement of Al-Hayat, the Yemen Cyber Army defaced the website of Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) on May 20. The MOFA homepage displayed an animated image that announced the launch of Operation Hussein Badreddin al-Houthi, named after the assassinated leader of the Houthi insurgency. The image content was familiar. Similar to the Al-Hayat defacement, it included anti-Saudi messages and strong pro-Shi'ite imagery, including pictures of Iran's Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, and Hassan Nasrallah, secretary general of Lebanon's Hezbollah militia. The announcement also featured a Guy Fawkes-masked face, the uncanny symbol of hacking collective Anonymous, and Anonymous' famous slogan ‘We Don't Forget, We Don't Forgive'.\nThe Yemen Cyber Army promised to release a trove of encrypted data on Saudi diplomats, agents, and citizens, stolen from 3000 MOFA computers. That week, Yemen Cyber Army released two tranches of private information of citizens and MOFA personnel on Pastebin as password-protected files, the password included as well.67 In the Pastebin announcement perpetrators identified as ‘Cutting Sword of Justice', the same actor behind the 2012 attack on Saudi's national oil company, Aramco. The destructive attack against Aramco, dubbed ‘Shamoon', involved automated wiping of 30,000 business devices. U.S. intelligence community and cybersecurity researchers attributed the incident to Iranian state-affiliated actors.68\nThe day after the Pastebin announcement, on May 21, Iran's Fars News published yet another exclusive report on the hack, crediting the ominous Yemen Cyber Army.69 A subsequent report on May 21 included a Word file attachment that contained links to the leaked documents on several file-sharing sites and passwords to decompress encrypted files.70 Fars News branded these exclusive reports as ‘Saudileaks'. This was the first time that the term was used as far as public records show. Between May and August 2015, Fars News published 32 pieces on Saudi Leaks in the English language.\nAgain, @QuickLeakOrg sought to promote the Pastebin announcement and Fars News exclusives, aiming for maximum public attention to the intrusion. These tweets did not generate much engagement, however.71 Efforts by journalists to confirm the identity of the Yemen Cyber Army did not yield much information as the group refused to disclose their location or even speak Arabic to the press.72\nThe magnitude, format, and timing of the intrusion, coupled with other circumstantial evidence, suggested that the perpetrators, whoever they were, had pro-Houthi aspirations and were publicly challenging Saudis' ambitions in the Yemen conflict. For its part, the Saudi MOFA confirmed the attack on its website but downplayed the impact. The Ministry also warned against using and publishing any leaked material, describing the breach as a ‘plot of the nation's enemies' and promising legal action against perpetrators.73\n### The leaks\nAgainst the warnings of the Saudi government, however, two substantive leaks put the MOFA hack on the spotlight, challenging Saudi foreign policy and practices.\nOn 19 June 2015, WikiLeaks published over sixty thousand documents, titled as Saudi Cables, and promised half a million more to follow.74 These cables comprised more than confidential diplomatic correspondences, however. They also contained personal medical and legal records of survivors of sexual abuse, sick children, and the mentally ill, among others. The mixed nature of these cables raised concerns about WikiLeaks' precarious handling of private citizen information and prompted debates about the ethics of responsible leaks.75\nWikiLeaks had previously released several controversial document sets from states and private companies. Though the whistleblowing platform had been relatively dormant for a couple of years before it published the Saudi Cables in 2015. In its press release, WikiLeaks acknowledged the Yemen\nCyber Army as the initial source of ‘valuable sample documents' but did not disclose the source of the fresh trove, leaving the question of attribution unanswered. Upon the release of Saudi Cables, the Yemen Cyber Army went quiet and quit responding to media inquiries about their connection with the whistleblowing platform.\nThe Yemen Cyber Army partially came out of the dark on June 26 with the launch of their social media accounts and two now-defunct websites: Yemenica[.]com and wikisaleaks[.]com. Yemenica was a single-page site with a declaration from the group, describing itself as a ‘Yemeni youth community' united against the Saudi regime. Again, the description flashed back to a second group that claimed responsibility for the 2012 Shamoon attack, posing as Arab Youth Group. Notably, Yemenica had a Google Plus account, which at the time was the most popular social networking site among Iranian conservatives and was unaffected by Iran's infamous censorship practices.\nWikiSaudiLeaks presented an even more aggressive anti-Saudi manifesto: subtitled as Cyber Decisive Storm, the website header showed images of bombing of Yemen by Saudi-led forces in Operation Decisive Storm. It characterised the developments, in English, as a ‘barbaric Saudi-American aggression, with which the Israelites also stand'.\nWikiSaudiLeaks was likely an additional outlet to maximise attention to the leaked materials. The documents on the site were mostly in Arabic and had already been included in the WikiLeaks release. They were classified based on countries, regions, and international organisations such as the United Nations. The list began with old and current allies of the kingdom, including Qatar, the United States, Bahrain and Turkey. WikiSaudiLeaks also contained a dedicated category for ‘Persian Gulf Countries' -- a term that Iran has zealously used throughout the naming dispute with some Arab countries who have opted for alternatives such as ‘Arabian Gulf' or ‘Gulf'. These cues shed further light on the interests and motives of those behind WikiSaudiLeaks.\nWhoever spearheaded these leaks sought to alienate Saudi's allies, influence international audiences, and disrupt Saudi's strategic plans in Yemen. Several media partners of WikiLeaks, including the free press advocacy group Reporters Without Border, published selected materials and analyses about Saudi engagements internationally. While Western media broadly reported on the cables, the regional media remained divided on the matter according to traditional political lines. Pro-Saudi media, including Al-Hayat, reiterated the state warnings and refrained from circulating the leaked materials. The Iran-owned Al-Alam, on the other hand, extensively covered the cables. In the end, many Arabic language outlets chose not to cover Saudi Cables, presumably out of concern for legal and political retribution, leaving the regional impact of the leak rather unclear.\n### The sham\nThe public attention to Saudi Cables was already subsiding when a fabricated news article briefly brought SaudiLeaks back to some headlines. On July 27, Another Western Dawn News (AWDNews), a fringe news site, published an article in English, accusing a United Nations (UN) official of receiving bribes for biased reporting against the Islamic Republic of Iran. According to the article, the Saudi embassy in Kuwait had allegedly paid Dr. Ahmad Shaheed, then UN Special Rapporteur for the Situation of Human Rights in Iran, 10 million dollars to increase international pressure on Iran for its violation of human rights. The report cited a scanned copy of a top secret document purportedly from the Saudi Cables on WikiLeaks. Contrary to the AWDNews claim, however, the ‘source' document in Arabic mentioned a million dollar -- not ten -- paid to Shaheed.\nRegardless of the discrepancy, the article prompted strong reactions inside and outside Iran. Human rights groups characterised the allegation as a sophisticated, state-directed smear campaign against Shaheed and critics of Iran's record of human rights. For years, the Islamic Republic has refused to collaborate with the UN Special Rapporteurs, accusing them of plotting with Iran's adversaries, including Saudi Arabia, for biased or fabricated reporting about the situation of human rights in Iran. This article, if true, would have been\nthe perfect evidence for Iran's enduring righteousness. The bribery claim also aligned well with Saudi's previous attempts to grow its influence in the international human rights system. According to the WikiLeaks documents, in 2014 Saudi Arabia bartered votes with the United Kingdom and Russia to gain a seat at the UN Human Rights Council, despite its nefarious record at home.\nThe article rapidly circulated on other fringe news sites such as Al-Waqt and the Middle East Press. Iran's conservative media reacted immediately and amplified the news in Persian and Arabic languages, with some citing the original source site Al-Waie News. Among those were the Young Journalists Club, which is run by the IRIB, the state-owned broadcaster, and Tasnim News, another media affiliate of the IRGC. All of these platforms promoted the one-million-dollar bribe accusation.\nAmid public confusion and media inquiries, WikiLeaks refuted the claim that the document was one of the original Saudi Cables. In a tweet to online news site Iran Front Page, WikiLeaks challenged the authenticity of the alleged document. WikiLeaks stated: ‘@IranFrontPage Please Show Which Cable This Claim Is Based on. You Fail to Link to One of Our Cables in the Article', thus adding forgery to the puzzle of Saudi Leaks. Shaheed, for his part, personally thanked WikiLeaks for the clarification.\nIt took some time for attributive leads to emerge. Three years later, in August 2018, Facebook and Twitter announced their first takedown of state-linked assets from Iran. Among the 770 Iranian Twitter accounts removed were AWDNews, Al-Waie News, Al-Waqt, and Middle East Press, all of which had played a part in the smear campaign against the UN Special Rapporteur. In November 2020, U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) issued a warrant for seizure of 29 domains for being part of the Liberty Front Press network, the same media network that Meta, Twitter, FireEye, and ClearSky had previously attributed to Iran. In an accompanying affidavit, the DOJ asserted that each of the seized domains was ‘fraudulently registered' due to each being used by or on behalf of the IRGC. AWDNews[.]com was among the seized domains.\nDid the perpetrators behind the MOFA breach and the subsequent leak plan the forgery and disinformation campaign ahead of time, or was it an afterthought? The answer is unclear. But the disinformation campaign demonstrates how hack-and-leak events can catalyse cultivating false information to new and existing audiences. Once a breach happens and secrets spill into the public domain, related but fabricated stories become more believable and harder to debunk. Actors with no stake in the previous events may also seize the opportunity to harvest the outcome of hack-and-leaks.\nThe same actor(s) may not have been behind the three stages of Saudi Leaks. The forgery may have been devised on the fly. What is established, however, is that Iran's IRGC was behind the disinformation campaign. The manipulation of leaked material signals Iran's interest and capacity in leveraging the output of hack-and-leak events for influencing domestic and international audiences and antagonising Saudi allies.\n## Competing hypotheses: a framework for analysis\nThe multi-stage nature of the WikiSaudiLeaks event calls for a multi-stage attribution. Thus far, there is only decisive evidence for attributing the forgery to Iran based on Twitter and Facebook takedowns and DOJ's attribution. Yemen Cyber Army's lack of any historical background has bolstered speculations that it was a front for other prominent actors with resources, motives, and ambitions for such an undertaking. The attribution of the MOFA hack and the leaks has remained divergent. As the following passages indicate, existing research points to Iran and Russia as the two main culprits. Other possibilities include Yemeni hackers or a collaboration among different actors. This section considers possible hints for attributing the breach into the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs network and the leaks that ensued.\nThe breach\nThere are two possibilities with regard to the breach of the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The first hypothesis is that Iran breached the ministry's networks. This scenario would be in-line with Iran's involvement in a wider espionage operation that targeted government, military, and critical infrastructure targets across the Middle East between 2013 and 2015.\nIn June 2015, cybersecurity firm ClearSky published a report on an operation that had been in progress since mid 2014. ClearSky dubbed the alleged campaign ‘Thamar Reservoir' and pointed out a variety of targets of high interest to Iranian politics. These targets included international relations and defence professionals from Saudi Arabia, Israel, and elsewhere in the Middle East. The campaign utilised a range of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), including social engineering and spear phishing, mostly through Google services. ClearSky attributed Thamar Reservoir with high confidence to Iranian actors due to its considerable similarities of TTPs and overlapping infrastructure with previous operations also attributed to Iranian actors like Rocket Kitten and AjaxTeam.\nAnother cybersecurity company, Cylance, dubbed a related campaign ‘Operation Cleaver'. Cleaver included targets from Saudi Arabia's oil and gas and transportation industries in 2013--14. Among the TTPs used in Operation Cleaver, one particularly stands out. The threat actor predominantly used spear phishing to deceive targets to visit a job search website and submit their resumes. The scheme used an imposter of a legitimate professional development service winresume[.]com and its Easy Resume Creator Pro service to lure job candidates to download and install malware TinyZBot. The threat actor attempted to deceive its targets by convincing them they had a pending job opportunity at the industrial group Teledyne, through fake domains such as Teledyne-Jobs[.]com. To know more about the opportunity, the target had to use the malicious resume submission service. One of the Saudi cables later released by WikiLeaks suggests that a threat actor had used this very tactic to breach the Saudi MOFA network months before the May 2015 intrusion.\nIn January 2015, Saudi MOFA internally circulated a 14-page incident response report, describing an attack on the ministry's network that had started on 20 July 2014 (10 months before the May 2015 attack). The report, which is included in one of the Saudi cables, indicates that the system administrator of MOFA had received a targeted email with a job opportunity from the fictitious employer Teledyne. The target fell for the scheme and his machine was infected with the TinyZBot malware, which prompted data exfiltration from his device.\nThe ministry, however, only noticed the compromise in November 2014, when it detected failed proxy connections between the system admin computer and a suspicious server. 88.150.214.166 was the IP address of the server, which corresponds to that of the malicious domain Teledyne-Jobs[.]com, reportedly created by Iranian hackers. Outed by Cylance's Operation Cleaver report on 2 December 2014, the fake website stopped working on the same day. The MOFA report does not identify the extent of data exfiltration and network impact. But the document repeatedly cites Operation Cleaver, expressly attributing the attack to Iranian actors.\nThe public-facing WikiSaudiLeaks event started only in April 2015, but these technical reports put forward an alternative possibility. That is the attackers may have exfiltrated the diplomatic cables from the MOFA network earlier but held onto them until the Yemen conflict began to complicate regional geopolitics. This tactic resembles the hacking of Britam Defense. The company was hacked in November 2012 but the perpetrators held onto the stolen material until January 2013, when a U.S. military strike in Syria seemed looming. This significant time-delay is another indication of a professional intelligence agency tradecraft, as activists or militants likely would have acted more swiftly on a whim.\n## Russia\nThe Saudi MOFA was of interest to the Russian actors, too. Russia is known to have engaged in reconnaissance and espionage activities against Middle Eastern targets in the spring of 2015.\nFANCY BEAR, also known as Sofacy or APT 28, a unit of Russia's military intelligence agency (GRU), reportedly breached the Saudi embassy in Ukraine in February 2015. The exclusive use of this vulnerability by FANCY BEAR until April 2015 has led researchers to entertain the possibility that Russia may also be responsible for the breach of the Saudi MOFA's network in the WikiSaudiLeaks event.\nThe attack infrastructure in the GRU campaign also contains noteworthy overlaps with the ominous Yemen Cyber Army. Wikisaleaks, the website ostensibly run by Yemen Cyber Army, was registered on the same range of IP addresses linked to FANCY BEAR in 2015. The address is part of a range of 256 at Lithuanian hosting provider UAB DUOMENU CENTRAS, leased to an intermediary company, MonoVM. The company offers a range of services, including dedicated servers and web hosting. In May 2015, it still accepted a variety of crypto currencies, such as Bitcoin and Skrill, to process transactions. These decentralised methods of payment have been appealing to Russian actors for purchasing the infrastructure for hacking operations. The domain MonoVM[.]com has been registered with a Dubai address, but it appears to be owned or managed by Iranian individuals. The registrant details also include information about another hosting company, Azar Online, registered under the same Persian names. Azar Online appears to be an ISP in Tabriz, the capital of Eastern Azerbaijan province in Iran.\nLater disclosures established even more links between MonoVM and Iran. In December 2020, amid then-President Trump and his close allies' allegations of election fraud, a new website emerged with a hit list of U.S. officials that refuted Trump's claims. *Enemies of the People* sought to incite violence and wreak havoc in the United States. The Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) quickly attributed this operation to Iran. One of the associated domains of Enemies of the People website was hosted on MonoVM.\nIt is possible that FANCY BEAR used MonoVM, likely an Iranian company, for its espionage operations while masquerading as Yemen Cyber Army. FANCY BEAR has utilised the same technique, known as false flag, with other fronts such as the CyberBerkut and CyberCaliphate -- two GRU front groups that emerged in 2014. An alternative possibility, however, is that other actors, including Iranians, utilised MonoVM services for their purposes around the same time, thus creating a false flag, likely unintentionally.\nLater events suggested a third hypothesis. In 2019, another Russian actor, Turla (aka Snake), identified as Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), was detected to have hijacked the technical infrastructure of OilRig, an Iranian threat actor, for espionage attacks in 2017 and early 2018. In October 2019, US and UK intelligence services confirmed that Turla had exploited the command and control and operational infrastructure of Iranian actors to expand its network of victims.\nTurla had previously targeted entities in 45 countries in 2015, including governments, military organisations, and research institutions. Most of these victims were located in the Middle East and Europe. There is no evidence for such hijacking of infrastructure prior to 2017. Though it is possible that Turla, or other Russian actors, might have co-opted TTPs of Iranian actors in an effort to further obfuscate attribution for WikiSaudiLeaks. For example, Turla has used a variant of Mimikatz, a commonplace hacking tool used extensively by different actors, which was also previously used by Iranian actors in Operation Cleaver. A fourth possibility could be that the two groups, Iranians and Russians, may have been collaborating in some capacity.\n### The leaks\nAttribution of the leaks remains challenging, in large part due to limited evidence available on the details of the transfer of Saudi Cables to WikiLeaks and WikiSaudiLeaks websites. This gap is perpetuated by three factors. First, wikisaleaks[.]com was registered on the same IP range as the Russian C2 infrastructure in 2015. Second, yemenica[.]com, the other website of the Yemen Cyber Army, was registered with an email address from the Russian webmail provider, Yandex.\na report from 2019^{120} suggests that two weeks after the release of Saudi Cables in June 2015, WikiLeaks moved its web hosting infrastructure to a new server in Russia. Prior to the transfer, however, the same IP address hosted a fake domain that had been associated with phishing attacks by the Iranian Rocket Kitten until May 2015.^{121} This suggests that WikiLeaks may have collaborated with the Iranian hackers for the intrusion of Saudi MOFA, or coordinated for the transfer of stolen documents. It could also entirely be a coincidence. As with MonoVM, different actors may have used the same infrastructure for their preferred setup and reliability.\n## Five vectors for a deconstructed approach to attribution\nOur analysis of competing hypotheses illustrates that evidence on the technical, operational, and political aspects of the WikiSaudiLeaks events point to more than a single suspect. In entertaining these hypotheses, we consider a multi-factor framework that includes the history of different actors in undertaking hack-and-leak operations, motivation, messaging, capabilities (technical and otherwise), and infrastructure.^{122} Together, these indicators pave the ground for addressing the question of ‘who did it', with Iran, Russia, or the Yemen Cyber Army as the most likely culprits.\n### History\nIn assessing a threat actor's history, we first consider past behaviour that tracks with the tradecraft used in the case in question. Out of the three likely culprits, Iran and Russia had previously engaged in computer network exploitation (CNE) against a variety of adversaries, in particular diplomatic targets from the Middle East. Moreover, they both had previously used fictitious fronts in CNE and computer network attack (CNA) operations. Iranian Charming Kitten (APT33) had targeted Saudi Aramco in 2012, posing as the Cutting Sword of Justice and Arab Youth Group.^{123} Russia, too, has a history of using front groups for active measures.^{124} Cyber Berkut was a Russian scheme, posing as an anti-Ukraine hacktivist group to target the websites of NATO and several German officials in March 2014^{125} and January 2015,^{126} respectively. CyberCaliphate, a seemingly ISIS-associated group, breached TV5 Monde, a major French television network with global coverage, resulting in network disruption for hours in April 2015.^{127} The ominous Yemen Cyber Army, however, lacks any history prior to WikiSaudiLeaks, which bolsters the possibility of a front for other more established actors, like Iran or Russia.\n### Motivation\nSecond, we investigate the motivation which refers to a perpetrator's interest in conducting certain actions in a geopolitical context. WikiSaudiLeaks was a retaliatory response to the Saudis for their intervention in the Yemen conflict. In principle, the Houthi rebels and Iran would have both benefited from the collapse of the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen. While Russia has taken an intermediary role in Yemen to avoid direct conflict, the failure of a key US ally would still serve Russia's political and economic objectives in the region. Moreover, Iran and Russia's decisive intervention in Syria in support of the Assad regime has been met with unwavering opposition from Saudi Arabia and the United States, with either side accusing the other of supporting ‘terrorists'.^{128} The humiliating hack-and-leak events of WikiSaudiLeaks thus serve both Iran and Russia's vengeance toward Saudi Arabia.\n### Messaging\nThird, we turn to messaging which relates to the semantics and semiotics of the behaviour. The language, signs, and other cues used to communicate with the audience often contain clues about the actor. The WikiSaudiLeaks operators used a consistent anti-Saudi tone in all stages: the hacking of Al-Hayat and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, promoting the leaked material, and the\ndisinformation campaign. They conveyed resistance to the Saudi intervention in Yemen, with an obvious emphasis on pro-Iranian and pro-Shi'ite sentiments. In addition, the Iranian state media network was the first to systematically cover ‘Saudileaks' in English, weeks before WikiLeaks and other outlets did. At the very least, the zealous communication underscores Iran's vested interest in the incident. This is not to say that the same operators were behind the publication of the leaked material. However, these considerations along with the history and motivation factors skew the attribution assessment toward Iran. Admittedly, some of these details can be manipulated to falsely point in a certain direction and obfuscate attribution. Using a geopolitical cover makes attribution of a false flag operation particularly challenging.^{129}\n### Capability\nFourth, capability entails the technical expertise, economic and human resources, and enterprising networks of operators and media affiliates that enable a malicious operation. The WikiSaudiLeaks event suggests coordination among a network of operators on different levels, each marshalling a variety of skill sets. Each stage required capabilities that both Iran and Russia demonstrated before. Yet these factors seem far less viable for the Yemen Cyber Army due to its lack of history.\n### Infrastructure\nLastly, the infrastructure factor concerns the foundations for physical and virtual communication used to deliver a technical capability or maintain the command and control of capabilities.^{130} These structures include electronic devices, servers, domain tools, online services, and social media accounts, to name a few, that attackers can buy, lease, share, compromise, and repurpose to develop their infrastructure. In hack-and-leak operations, the infrastructure for the intrusion may not be the same as what is used for the leak. It is also possible that different actors use the same infrastructure at different points in time.^{131}\nAs with WikiSaudiLeaks, possible overlap of infrastructures can significantly impede detection and attribution. The wikisaleaks[.]com domain, one of the websites affiliated with Yemen Cyber Army, was registered at an IP address from likely-Iranian hosting company MonoVM. The IP address also intersected with the Russian infrastructure used to target the Saudi embassy in Ukraine in early 2015. It is entirely plausible, then, that Iranian and Russian actors were using web services offered by the same provider around the same time, hence the overlapping IP addresses. However, it is not possible to determine whether this infrastructure switch was intentional or merely a coincidence.\nConsidered together, history, motivation, messaging, capability, and infrastructure provide a framework for examining the competing hypotheses about attribution. Proper synthesis of these details is not possible with the same level of certainty across the WikiSaudiLeaks event. In attributing a multi-stage incident, we propose to assess each stage (the hack and the leak) against these five indicators. Tables 1 and 2 summarise the degree to which each stage of the WikiSaudiLeaks event can be attributed to three likely perpetrators: Yemen Cyber Army, Iran, and Russia.^{132}\nAs Tables 1 and 2 indicate, the Yemen Cyber Army has the lowest chance of being a real culprit. Lack of history and information about the group increases the possibility that it may have been a fictitious front for other perpetrators. The network intrusion can be attributed to Iran and Russia with varying degrees of confidence. Attributing the leak is not as straightforward, however. There is limited evidence of politically motivated leaks by Iranian actors unless Iran was indeed behind the attack on Britam Defence in 2013. While Russia has a long history of leaks during the Cold War and the pre-Internet days, there is limited credible evidence on Russia's involvement in cyber-enabled leaks prior to the attack on the DNC in 2016. Other indicators -- such as pro-Iran messaging, subtle cues from wikisaleaks[.]com, and the extensive coverage of the leaks by state-affiliated media early on -- can be taken as the involvement of Iran on some level. Last but not least, Iran is responsible for the forgery and disinformation campaign that came out of the WikiSaudiLeaks event. Overall, Iran scores higher on all three stages than other possible culprits.\nINTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY\n793\nTable 1.

Possible forgeries among the leaked data and plausible false flags add to the complications of attribution. The same actor(s) may not be behind seemingly related events. Distinguishing these actors from one another also comes with particular complexities. In this context, de-layering the attribution process and investigating each layer separately facilitate the assessment. The outcome may be varying degrees of confidence in the attribution of each stage, which in turn helps to identify the gaps in the attribution of digital covert action. The case of WikiSaudiLeaks captures these nuances.\nOn the strategic level, attribution remains a political decision based on information collated by intelligence and security agencies or influenced by foreign policy considerations.¹³⁴ It delineates red lines and weighs a set of legitimate responses to the attack.¹³⁵ In the case of WikiSaudiLeaks, affected state parties did not publicly attribute this case. Saudi officials offered little public communication regarding the source of the intrusion. Nor did allies of the kingdom with prominent cyber capabilities, such as the United States, release high level technical or intelligence assessments about WikiSaudiLeaks. Instead, speculative attribution was done by cyber security firms and individual researchers, who lack the authority and means to collect the signal and human intelligence necessary to reliably attribute an attack to a state.¹³⁶\nStrategic attribution comes at a cost, politically and logistically. It requires multiple government agencies and often private sector firms working together, often across borders, utilising their intelligence sources and methods. While there is no consistent approach to attributing cyber attacks among states, an incident is more likely to invoke attribution by states if it passes a two-fold test of significance: (1) the nature and severity of the attack, and (2) the affected parties and implications for their national security. In other words, who is targeted and how they are targeted are the key questions that can invoke an attribution response by states and their allies. The closer an attack hits one's home, the more likely that the state gets involved. Thus, the target and severity of cyber-enabled covert action affect the decision to expend resources on public attribution. WikiSaudiLeaks may not have passed this test.\nWhy was the campaign not conclusively attributed? First, the forensic evidence did not unambiguously point to a single adversary at any given moment.¹³⁷ Second, the entire event, it appears, was not consequential enough at any given moment in time for the Saudi government to initiate a more determined investigation and response. Lastly, although the attack was politically embarrassing, it seems that it did not constitute a sufficiently severe national security threat to Saudi Arabia to escalate to an international investigation with support from more experienced and capable allies.\nYet WikiSaudiLeaks set an internationally consequential precedent. It was highly likely the first state-enabled hack-and-leak operation that utilised WikiLeaks as an amplifying platform, a tactic that was most notably used just one year later in the most tectonic digital covert campaign of our times, the DNC hack-and-leak. In hindsight, it may have been a strategic shortcoming on the part of the US and UK intelligence communities not to have partnered with Saudi intelligence for a more robust response to WikiSaudiLeaks. Both countries, after all, became the target of Russian and Iranian active measures in the 2016, 2018, and 2019 elections, respectively. The episode nevertheless underscores the significance of coalitions and partnerships, especially if a targeted government does not possess mature capabilities and experience in attribution. WikiSaudiLeaks came before the consolidation of such theories as persistent engagement and defend forward in U.S. cyber strategy. With the benefit of hindsight, the same attack on an ally's integrity today may -- and should -- prompt a more mature response from FiveEyes partners and other open societies.\n## Conclusion\nCovert action is a political instrument. Hack-and-leak incidents may be designed to mess with regional and international politics by ‘inflaming existing contradictions', to use the old Soviet terminology once honed by KGB's Service A, history's most advanced disinformation bureaucracy. Hack-and-leak operations are only technically upgraded iterations of Cold War collect-and-leak operations. Since at least 2013, predominantly authoritarian governments have deployed hack-and-leak operations amid geopolitical crises against a range of adversaries. WikiSaudiLeaks is the pivotal historic example.\nThe multi-stage nature of digital covert action requires a multi-stage attribution process. This process extends across technical, operational, and strategic levels. Such all-source analysis must still cut across often hardwearing disciplinary boundaries between the kind of digital forensics commonly used in incident response and threat intelligence reporting and the kind of digital forensics commonly used to investigate influence operations (IO) and disinformation. Moreover, a single confidence score may not be appropriate for multi-stage events. That is, analysis of one stage may produce a degree of confidence that differs from other components of the same event. Worse, in extreme cases different components of what might appear as one campaign can be perpetrated by different actors, even unbeknownst to each other.\nWikiSaudiLeaks was strategically designed to inflame contradictions in Saudi Arabia, a party to the Yemen conflict, to wedge open its alliances, and rally international public opinion against the kingdom. The evidence available to us does not allow for definitive attribution for the entire WikiSaudiLeaks event. Instead, a multi-stage all-source investigation offers more details about each component. Each stage requires exploring a different set of forensic artefacts, as well as considering separate tactical, operational, and strategic aspects. The Saudi MOFA-related intrusions could be attributed, based on circumstantial evidence, to either Iran or Russia, possibly even both. The lack of forensic evidence about the provenance of the leaks adds to the challenge of attributing the campaign's exposure stage. However, Iran and Russia remain the most likely culprits, with some circumstantial evidence pointing to Iran. The final stage, the digital disinformation and amplification campaign, can be confidently attributed to Iran, given the abundant evidence exposed by social media companies. A multi-stage event, therefore, requires a multi-stage attribution process -- one that allows for gradients of attribution within each stage.\nThere are three non-exclusive explanations for why WikiSaudiLeaks was not attributed with high confidence to a specific adversary. First, the target, in this case Saudi Arabia, did not have sufficient political determination to perform public attribution. Amid the Yemen conflict, the kingdom was intent on minimising attention to the Saudi Cables and staying on message about the unravelling proxy war with Iran. Second, Saudi Arabia and interested third parties -- including the United States -- likely had insufficient incentive to unlock the attributive resources required to link the campaign to a specific adversary. Access to attributive capabilities consists of both access to a range of forensic\nartefacts and access to the skills and experience necessary to acquire, develop, cross-reference, process, analyse, contextualise, and interpret relevant signals and artefacts. Finally, the WikiSaudiLeaks campaign exhibited features that made the overall event exceptionally hard to attribute to one specific adversary. It is highly likely that these features were partly intended by at least one adversary, and partly unintended.\nMinimising uncertainty is the primary undertaking of attribution. Yet it is a highly complex and nuanced process. Technical forensic artefacts, if inconclusive, must be considered together with other data, obtained from a variety of sources, collected both passively and actively. The delayed nature of attribution further complicates the task. Additional useful details may only become available months or even years later, as our case illustrates, thus rendering early judgements incomplete. False flags, or suspicion thereof, and other challenges can significantly complicate attribution and the response it may require.\nAttributing twenty-first century covert action -- integrated campaigns that have a CNE, CNA, and possibly an IO component -- in a nutshell, is an art and a science and, above all, an all-source enterprise and as such vastly different from attributing narrow computer network breaches. In this attribution process, analysts will have to be ready to disentangle some campaigns, assessing, analysing and attributing their respective components -- the hack, forge, leak, amplify -- on their own merits. Attributing one or multiple components may be easy or hard, linking them together is a separate challenge yet. Adversaries, in turn, may take advantage of this layered attribution challenge.\nWikiSaudiLeaks came before its time, as the analytic toolsets and the strategic and investigative approaches necessary to understand and attribute this event have continued to mature after the fact. After all, it was only around 2016 that security firms started seriously integrating CNE and IO in their public-facing investigative work, with Mandiant among the first,^{142} and Microsoft^{143} and later Google^{144} following suit. Nor did the US government adopt the strategies of persistent engagement and defend forward until 2018,^{145} three years after WikiSaudiLeaks.\nSaudi Cables, in hindsight, was a chameleon that appeared as a different thing against different backdrops: seen in the WikiLeaks context, it appeared as innocent transparency activism; in the website defacement context, it appeared as patriot hacker skirmishes; and viewed against the foil of expanding digital covert action, it appeared as a campaign of at least one authoritarian intelligence agency."

This paper revisits one of the most complex, most significant, and most mysterious digital covert actions of our time: a 2015 hack-and-leak case known among investigators as 'WikiSaudiLeaks' that so far has evaded attribution. We argue that WikiSaudiLeaks was not a stand-alone event, but a puzzle piece in a larger covert action campaign that involved advanced computer network exploitation, computer network attack, persistent deception, and a creative influence and disinformation effort. By disintegrating the larger event into its components, limited attribution becomes possible. We present the most detailed and comprehensive investigation of this case to date, attribute at least one component of the larger event to Iranian intelligence, and draw conceptional conclusions.\n## Introduction What was WikiSaudiLeaks and why was it so hard to attribute? This paper revisits one of the most complex, most significant, and most mysterious hack-and-leak puzzles of our time, a 2015 case known among investigators as ‘WikiSaudiLeaks'. The name refers to a mysterious website that surfaced and disseminated a major trove of files taken from the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The site's operators curiously claimed to have given the stolen documents to WikiLeaks, which claimed to have published 122,619 files by year's end.1 Subsequently, the material received high profile press coverage2 and became known as ‘The Saudi Cables'.\nWikiSaudiLeaks is an early example of a fundamental yet neglected attribution challenge.3 The event was not unified. The leak was part of a larger covert action campaign that involved advanced computer network exploitation, computer network attack, persistent deception, and a creative influence and disinformation effort.4 Yet so far neither scholars nor investigators from public or private sector have been able to conclusively attribute WikiSaudiLeaks to a specific threat actor -- in sharp contrast to most other comparable high-profile cases. Why? Because the leak does nothing less than challenge the established attribution paradigm. Hack-and-leak events are not widely discussed, and existing scholarship tends to focus on the interplay between intrusion and influence, while neglecting the consequences for attribution.5 What if a single attribution statement for digital covert action is not possible in the first place?\nWikiSaudiLeaks happened just as the goldilocks moment of digital covert action was ending: about a year before the Russian election interference in the United States, when bulk leaks were still seen as innocent expressions of transparency activism; and just two years after Mandiant's APT1 report,6 when the public attribution debate and capabilities were still in their infancy. Later events have motivated prolific scholarship, most prominently the Democratic National Committee (DNC) hack-and-leak.7 Yet some of the earliest and most significant instances of digital covert action remain understudied. It is time to revise the WikiSaudiLeaks case, and with it our understanding of attributing covert action.\nDigital covert action was on the rise throughout the 2010s, with hack-and-leak operations making up a significant share. This rise is enabled, but insufficiently explained, by technological change. A list of the major hits would include the late 2000s campaign known as Stuxnet; various wiping attacks against Iranian targets in 2011; the 2012 attack against Saudi Aramco and Rasgas; the neglected 2013 Britam Defence leak; the 2014 Sony Pictures Entertainment breach-and-leak;; two remarkable blackouts in Kiev in 2015 and 2016 as well as numerous other operations in Ukraine; the series of breach-and-leak operations against the US election in 2016; the mysterious series of Shadow Brokers leaks; the ransomware attacks known as Wannacry and NotPetya in 2017, one executed poorly, the other deceptively; the Viasat sabotage at the outset of the Ukraine War in 2022, and several more, some of them subtle, others as yet not publicly discussed. The continuous and dynamic nature of such offensive activity helped give rise to the concepts of ‘persistent engagement' and ‘defend forward' in the U.S. government, in which attribution played a key role. Indeed all these major cases had one core feature in common: governments, and in many cases independent researchers, have attributed them with high confidence or even certainty to specific adversaries.\nYet WikiSaudiLeaks stands out: not only has it not been attributed with confidence, the case is also curiously understudied. Both absences are all the more remarkable given that the covert action has generated an extraordinary amount of media coverage, with hundreds of press stories. The ensuing leak is also infamous as one of the most unethical and extreme so far, releasing unredacted cables that included full names and passport numbers of victims of torture and sexual abuse.\nWhy was the campaign not attributed so far? What can this curious case tell us about the past and future of attributing computer network operations in general and covert action specifically? And, of course: who was responsible for WikiSaudiLeaks?\nWe argue that by breaking down the larger event into its components, limited attribution becomes possible. To understand the saga that is Wikisaudileaks, investigators must first deconstruct what appears to be one coherent event into its constituent components: collection, disclosure, and amplification. Each component, counterintuitively, may not only come with a specific confidence level; it may also lead to diverging and separate attribution assessments. What looks like one operation at a first glance, with closer inspection may, in fact, collapse into multiple operations. The limited scholarship on this case has entertained the possibility of Russian involvement. We attribute at least one component of the larger covert action to Iran.\nAttribution is what states make of it. The outcome of an attributive investigation into a major computer network breach is determined by resources and political priorities, both on the side of the victim and on the side of the perpetrator. The perpetrator plans and equips a clandestine or covert operation to sustain deniability -- the victim plans and equips investigative and analytical outfits to take deniability away. The decision to publicly attribute, however, is correlated with such factors as incident severity, geopolitical circumstances, the intelligence available on the case, technical and operational capacity, and the political will of those involved in the attribution process. The WikiSaudiLeaks event puts the interaction of these indicators to test and underscores several gaps in the attribution process.\nThe paper proceeds in four steps. First we provide context to hack-and-leak operations in the Middle East by revisiting a neglected case from 2013, the earliest known instance of a hack-and-leak. We then offer a granular analysis of the WikiSaudiLeaks event, unmasking a related disinformation campaign that so far has not been covered in public or confidential reporting on the case. The third section reviews competing hypotheses in the attribution of WikiSaudiLeaks, followed by a framework for attribution of different stages of the covert action. We close by discussing the challenges of attribution of this particular case and, more broadly, digital covert action.\n## Prelude Hack-and-leak operations have become ever more common since 2013, globally and especially in the Middle East. Around that time, a number of still mysterious leaks appeared that, in hindsight, could have been the work of intelligence agencies or contractors. The rise of the Anonymous movement as well as WikiLeaks offered unprecedented and obvious opportunities for covert operations. For a few years before the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the wider public and most journalists saw leaks as something positive first and foremost, as a way to create transparency and accountability -- not as an ideal cover for dirty tricks.\nThe breaches that enable the subsequent disclosure of stolen files may be initially done for espionage purposes, or the targeting may be driven by covert action objectives. The offenders' precise intentions are likely to remain obscure in the absence of direct intelligence access or declassified archival records. Historically, however, it was often ‘throwaway' -- files that no longer served a narrow intelligence purpose -- that were used to furnish the content for targeted leaks. Particularly noteworthy in this context were the Shaltai Boltai disclosures in Russia, and, a few months after WikiSaudiLeaks, in October 2015, the unattributed and fairly obscure ‘Turok' FSB leak. These operations often seek to undermine an adversary's decision-making, political cohesion, domestic public opinion, leaders, reputation, and alliances.\nWhat follows is a prelude to the WikiSaudiLeaks event, similarly involving a regional conflict in the Middle East, equally neglected, and inconclusively attributed.\n### Britam defense The earliest known major case of hack-and-leak operations in the Middle East dates back to the early 2010s. The context for the case was the civil war in Syria. In July 2012, the Syrian government acknowledged that it had chemical weapons in its possession though it would never deploy such weapons against its own citizens but only against foreign intervention. In August, then-President Barack Obama warned the Bashar al-Assad regime that any use of chemical weapons in Syria would significantly change his calculus on a U.S. military response. The prospect of a U.S. strike in Syria concerned Assad's key allies, Iran and Russia, who have remained staunch supporters of the Syrian government since the beginning of the conflict in early 2011.\nThe first allegation of use of chemical weapons in Syria was reported in the city of Homs on 23 December 2012. The news rippled through the region and beyond. On 15 January 2013, an anonymous source alleged to Foreign Policy that the State Department had compelling evidence to attribute the chemical attack to the Syrian military. These unverified, controversial claims raised speculations that a U.S. military strike in Syria might be imminent.\nThen, on 22 January, a mysterious post appeared on Pastebin, a widely used disclosure and documentation platform, titled ‘Millitary server hacked. Confidential data!‘ An entity calling itself ‘JAsIrX' posted a short note in broken English, about 130 words, with no fewer than 51 URLs to file-sharing sites. The note was crude, and claimed that Britam Defence, a UK-based military contractor, ‘killed Arabs in Iraq and plans to invade in Iran and Syria'.\nShortly after, around 24 January, a report appeared on the obscure site cyberwarnews[.]info, claiming that Britam had been hacked. On 28 January 2013, conspiracy theory websites started covering the leak. The niche site whatdoesitmean[.]com headlined: ‘Obama Plan for World War III Stuns Russia'. That same day Infowars titled: ‘Hacked Emails Reveal “Washington-Approved” Plan to Stage Chemical Weapons Attack in Syria'.\nThe following day the story went mainstream. The Daily Mail, one of the UK's most-read tabloids, blasted: ‘U.S. “backed plan to launch chemical weapon attack on Syria and blame it on Assad's regime”'. The report in the Mail cited an email exchange from the previous month, allegedly among a group of senior managers at Britam. The exchange suspiciously mentioned a proposal that Britam would supply chemical weapons to Syria, while posing as Russian mercenaries, in exchange for a significant amount of money. The Daily Mail in turn linked to the initial report in Cyber War News that took the leak at face value.\nBritam, in fact, was targeted by a successful hack-leak-forge operation. An unknown attacker had breached Britam's email, likely in November 2012. On January 22 the perpetrators, calling themselves ‘JAsIrX', started posting internal documents from Britam on Pastebin. One email exchange from October 2012 purported to link Britam to a military training project in Saudi Arabia to increase readiness for a possible strike by Iran. Another exchange claimed a U.S.-backed proposal to Britam to ‘deliver a CW to Homs' and deploy its Ukrainian personnel to pose as Russian mercenaries The fabricated incriminating emails appeared to have been sent two months apart from one another; yet both digital artefacts shared the same unique message identity number, and had the exact same ‘sent' timestamp, at 23:57:18. Similarly, the documents pertaining to the Saudi military project were created and modified in short succession on Friday, 18 January 2013 at 12:00 GMT. The suspicious content, combined with the suspicious metadata, makes it highly likely that these forged documents sought to falsely incriminate the company in a plot against the United States and Saudi Arabia.\nThe story immediately appeared on Press TV, the English language branch of the state-run broadcaster, Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB). Press TV took a hard anti-Western position, noting the timing as ‘the Syrian army forces have managed to clear the capital, Damascus and its surrounding areas of the militants and restore security'. Seeking renewed attention to the case, Fars News, a key media affiliate of Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), republished the allegations in August 2013, citing whatdoesitmean. Other Iranian hardliner news sites, notably Mehr News, echoed the recycled article, but the story did not gain much attention.\nAttribution in the case of the Britam hack-leak-forge remained vague. A Sunday Times article entertained the possibility of Iran's involvement, but offered no solid sourcing or evidence. There is limited public technical forensics available about the attack. But contextual and operational cues, such as Iran's high stakes in Syria and the unusual media coverage by state-affiliated outlets, support the Iran hypothesis.\nEither way, the incident was the first major hack-and-leak operation that involved a variety of state and nonstate actors in Middle East politics. Whoever was behind the operation had a vested interest in implicating the United States in the use of chemical weapons in Syria, and in detracting from the truth. The event unfolded in multiple stages. The perpetrator conducted a network intrusion and collected data on the target ahead of time, manipulated the data to take advantage of geopolitical developments in the region, and promptly released the stolen (and forged) materials to maximise the believability of the plot. These same features were also on display in the WikiSaudiLeaks operation that hit Saudi Arabia two years later. Similarly, both cases remain shrouded in mystery with no conclusive attribution.\nIn both events, adversarial actors were only beginning to flex technical resources to advance geopolitical motives through digital covert action. Inconclusive attribution in those early days extended the opportunity to the perpetrators to seek to subvert more significant targets. It was only a matter of time until major Western powers began to feel the burn at home.\n## WikiSaudiLeaks The Yemen civil war was still fresh in March 2015. The Shi'ite Houthi rebels had taken over the capital city of Sanaa and ousted the Saudi-backed President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and its allies had launched a military offensive, Operation Decisive Storm, to counter the Iran-backed Houthi militias. Between March 26 and April 22, the Saudi-led airstrikes caused civil casualties and massive destruction across Yemen. The Saudi and Iranian interventions were, in some ways, only one episode in a long lineage of foreign interference in Yemen's affairs, some overt, others covert. Yet the escalating civil war offered the context for a new, unprecedented form of outside intervention -- one that remained shrouded in mystery for years.\nWikiSaudiLeaks unfolded in three episodes. First, a series of hacking incidents targeted both Iranian and Saudi-affiliated media outlets, suggesting patriotic hacker skirmishes on the margins of the Yemen conflict. The network intrusion soon reached the Saudi Ministry of Foreign affairs. Before long, in the second phase, troves of confidential cables from the Ministry were leaked to the public via WikiLeaks and other platforms. The third, and previously undiscussed, stage involved a disinformation campaign against a United Nations expert that Iran-affiliated media broadly promoted. The following sections offer a deep dive into these stages, outlining the technical, operational, and political context to each layer.\n### The hacks In March and April 2015, a series of hacking incidents started drawing attention to the unfolding conflict in Yemen. On April 12, defacements appeared on the English Twitter and YouTube accounts of Iran's state-backed, Arabic news channel Al-Alam. The defacements included images of Saudi leadership, messages in support of Operation Decisive Storm, and a false claim that the Iran-backed Houthi leader was dead. Other tweets sent from Al-Alam's Twitter account disclosed a purported list of correspondents of Al-Alam. Both Al-Alam and SaharTV, another Iranian state-backed television channel, confirmed the incident and blamed it on Saudi hackers.\nAn anonymous, self-described hacking entity, @Cyber__Emotion claimed responsibility for the attacks on Twitter. The entity's earliest publicly-known activities date back to 2014, when an actor with the same handle took over official Twitter accounts of Saudi ministries of justice and finance, questioning these institutions' lack of concern for cybersecurity. In 2016, the group allegedly compromised the official account of the Saudi Minister of Education, criticising his performance and demanding improvement in the national educational system.\nOnly a day after the Al-Alam defacements, a previously unheard of hacking group Yemen Cyber Army defaced the Saudi-owned Arabic news site Al-Hayat on April 13. The defacement announcement displayed a picture of the Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and a provocative pro-Shi'ite message against the kingdom and its allies, threatening that their time would soon be up. In addition to the defacement, the attackers leaked the names, email addresses, and hashed passwords of Al-Hayat users and subscribers.\nIran's semi-official news agency, Fars News, was among the first outlets to react to the incident. Fars News published an ‘exclusive' coverage of the Al-Hayat defacement, attributing the attack to Yemen Cyber Army without offering any evidence about the identity or background of the group. Fars News also linked to the Yemen Cyber Army's announcements and files on Pastebin, which is frequently used by hackers to claim responsibility for website defacements.\nThe only posts disseminating the Pastebin announcements came from @QuickLeakOrg, the associated Twitter account of QuickLeak[.]net. QuickLeak is a fringe, now-defunct whistleblowing site used in 2013 by an Iranian hacker group Parastoo to promote their defacements activities. QuickLeak.net was registered under an Iranian name -- the same person had also registered Zone-hc, another now-defunct Iranian site modelled after another defacement forum, Zone-H. The IP address of QuickLeak and its associated network of domains, including quickleak[.]org and Wikileak[.]ir, was hosted by Iran's main Internet Service Provider (ISP), Telecommunication Company of Iran (TCI). These details are circumstantial evidence that link the Al-Hayat defacement to an entity in Iran.\nThe Al-Alam and Al-Hayat intrusions resembled patriotic hacktivist skirmishes on the margins of an unfolding geopolitical regional conflict. However, subsequent events, circumstantial evidence, and other technical indicators led some investigators to Iran, with the Yemen Cyber Army as a possible front.\nThe Saudi-led Operation Decisive Storm in Yemen ended on April 22. It was immediately followed by Operation Restoring Hope, which purportedly sought to reduce the use of force in Yemen and move toward a political solution for the conflict.66 The Yemen Cyber Army, however, was not to let go of the feud as easily.\nAbout a month after the defacement of Al-Hayat, the Yemen Cyber Army defaced the website of Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) on May 20. The MOFA homepage displayed an animated image that announced the launch of Operation Hussein Badreddin al-Houthi, named after the assassinated leader of the Houthi insurgency. The image content was familiar. Similar to the Al-Hayat defacement, it included anti-Saudi messages and strong pro-Shi'ite imagery, including pictures of Iran's Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, and Hassan Nasrallah, secretary general of Lebanon's Hezbollah militia. The announcement also featured a Guy Fawkes-masked face, the uncanny symbol of hacking collective Anonymous, and Anonymous' famous slogan ‘We Don't Forget, We Don't Forgive'.\nThe Yemen Cyber Army promised to release a trove of encrypted data on Saudi diplomats, agents, and citizens, stolen from 3000 MOFA computers. That week, Yemen Cyber Army released two tranches of private information of citizens and MOFA personnel on Pastebin as password-protected files, the password included as well.67 In the Pastebin announcement perpetrators identified as ‘Cutting Sword of Justice', the same actor behind the 2012 attack on Saudi's national oil company, Aramco. The destructive attack against Aramco, dubbed ‘Shamoon', involved automated wiping of 30,000 business devices. U.S. intelligence community and cybersecurity researchers attributed the incident to Iranian state-affiliated actors.68 The day after the Pastebin announcement, on May 21, Iran's Fars News published yet another exclusive report on the hack, crediting the ominous Yemen Cyber Army.69 A subsequent report on May 21 included a Word file attachment that contained links to the leaked documents on several file-sharing sites and passwords to decompress encrypted files.70 Fars News branded these exclusive reports as ‘Saudileaks'. This was the first time that the term was used as far as public records show. Between May and August 2015, Fars News published 32 pieces on Saudi Leaks in the English language.\nAgain, @QuickLeakOrg sought to promote the Pastebin announcement and Fars News exclusives, aiming for maximum public attention to the intrusion. These tweets did not generate much engagement, however.71 Efforts by journalists to confirm the identity of the Yemen Cyber Army did not yield much information as the group refused to disclose their location or even speak Arabic to the press.72 The magnitude, format, and timing of the intrusion, coupled with other circumstantial evidence, suggested that the perpetrators, whoever they were, had pro-Houthi aspirations and were publicly challenging Saudis' ambitions in the Yemen conflict. For its part, the Saudi MOFA confirmed the attack on its website but downplayed the impact. The Ministry also warned against using and publishing any leaked material, describing the breach as a ‘plot of the nation's enemies' and promising legal action against perpetrators.73 ### The leaks Against the warnings of the Saudi government, however, two substantive leaks put the MOFA hack on the spotlight, challenging Saudi foreign policy and practices.\nOn 19 June 2015, WikiLeaks published over sixty thousand documents, titled as Saudi Cables, and promised half a million more to follow.74 These cables comprised more than confidential diplomatic correspondences, however. They also contained personal medical and legal records of survivors of sexual abuse, sick children, and the mentally ill, among others. The mixed nature of these cables raised concerns about WikiLeaks' precarious handling of private citizen information and prompted debates about the ethics of responsible leaks.75 WikiLeaks had previously released several controversial document sets from states and private companies. Though the whistleblowing platform had been relatively dormant for a couple of years before it published the Saudi Cables in 2015. In its press release, WikiLeaks acknowledged the Yemen Cyber Army as the initial source of ‘valuable sample documents' but did not disclose the source of the fresh trove, leaving the question of attribution unanswered. Upon the release of Saudi Cables, the Yemen Cyber Army went quiet and quit responding to media inquiries about their connection with the whistleblowing platform.\nThe Yemen Cyber Army partially came out of the dark on June 26 with the launch of their social media accounts and two now-defunct websites: Yemenica[.]com and wikisaleaks[.]com. Yemenica was a single-page site with a declaration from the group, describing itself as a ‘Yemeni youth community' united against the Saudi regime. Again, the description flashed back to a second group that claimed responsibility for the 2012 Shamoon attack, posing as Arab Youth Group. Notably, Yemenica had a Google Plus account, which at the time was the most popular social networking site among Iranian conservatives and was unaffected by Iran's infamous censorship practices.\nWikiSaudiLeaks presented an even more aggressive anti-Saudi manifesto: subtitled as Cyber Decisive Storm, the website header showed images of bombing of Yemen by Saudi-led forces in Operation Decisive Storm. It characterised the developments, in English, as a ‘barbaric Saudi-American aggression, with which the Israelites also stand'.\nWikiSaudiLeaks was likely an additional outlet to maximise attention to the leaked materials. The documents on the site were mostly in Arabic and had already been included in the WikiLeaks release. They were classified based on countries, regions, and international organisations such as the United Nations. The list began with old and current allies of the kingdom, including Qatar, the United States, Bahrain and Turkey. WikiSaudiLeaks also contained a dedicated category for ‘Persian Gulf Countries' -- a term that Iran has zealously used throughout the naming dispute with some Arab countries who have opted for alternatives such as ‘Arabian Gulf' or ‘Gulf'. These cues shed further light on the interests and motives of those behind WikiSaudiLeaks.\nWhoever spearheaded these leaks sought to alienate Saudi's allies, influence international audiences, and disrupt Saudi's strategic plans in Yemen. Several media partners of WikiLeaks, including the free press advocacy group Reporters Without Border, published selected materials and analyses about Saudi engagements internationally. While Western media broadly reported on the cables, the regional media remained divided on the matter according to traditional political lines. Pro-Saudi media, including Al-Hayat, reiterated the state warnings and refrained from circulating the leaked materials. The Iran-owned Al-Alam, on the other hand, extensively covered the cables. In the end, many Arabic language outlets chose not to cover Saudi Cables, presumably out of concern for legal and political retribution, leaving the regional impact of the leak rather unclear.\n### The sham The public attention to Saudi Cables was already subsiding when a fabricated news article briefly brought SaudiLeaks back to some headlines. On July 27, Another Western Dawn News (AWDNews), a fringe news site, published an article in English, accusing a United Nations (UN) official of receiving bribes for biased reporting against the Islamic Republic of Iran. According to the article, the Saudi embassy in Kuwait had allegedly paid Dr. Ahmad Shaheed, then UN Special Rapporteur for the Situation of Human Rights in Iran, 10 million dollars to increase international pressure on Iran for its violation of human rights. The report cited a scanned copy of a top secret document purportedly from the Saudi Cables on WikiLeaks. Contrary to the AWDNews claim, however, the ‘source' document in Arabic mentioned a million dollar -- not ten -- paid to Shaheed.\nRegardless of the discrepancy, the article prompted strong reactions inside and outside Iran. Human rights groups characterised the allegation as a sophisticated, state-directed smear campaign against Shaheed and critics of Iran's record of human rights. For years, the Islamic Republic has refused to collaborate with the UN Special Rapporteurs, accusing them of plotting with Iran's adversaries, including Saudi Arabia, for biased or fabricated reporting about the situation of human rights in Iran. This article, if true, would have been the perfect evidence for Iran's enduring righteousness. The bribery claim also aligned well with Saudi's previous attempts to grow its influence in the international human rights system. According to the WikiLeaks documents, in 2014 Saudi Arabia bartered votes with the United Kingdom and Russia to gain a seat at the UN Human Rights Council, despite its nefarious record at home.\nThe article rapidly circulated on other fringe news sites such as Al-Waqt and the Middle East Press. Iran's conservative media reacted immediately and amplified the news in Persian and Arabic languages, with some citing the original source site Al-Waie News. Among those were the Young Journalists Club, which is run by the IRIB, the state-owned broadcaster, and Tasnim News, another media affiliate of the IRGC. All of these platforms promoted the one-million-dollar bribe accusation.\nAmid public confusion and media inquiries, WikiLeaks refuted the claim that the document was one of the original Saudi Cables. In a tweet to online news site Iran Front Page, WikiLeaks challenged the authenticity of the alleged document. WikiLeaks stated: ‘@IranFrontPage Please Show Which Cable This Claim Is Based on. You Fail to Link to One of Our Cables in the Article', thus adding forgery to the puzzle of Saudi Leaks. Shaheed, for his part, personally thanked WikiLeaks for the clarification.\nIt took some time for attributive leads to emerge. Three years later, in August 2018, Facebook and Twitter announced their first takedown of state-linked assets from Iran. Among the 770 Iranian Twitter accounts removed were AWDNews, Al-Waie News, Al-Waqt, and Middle East Press, all of which had played a part in the smear campaign against the UN Special Rapporteur. In November 2020, U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) issued a warrant for seizure of 29 domains for being part of the Liberty Front Press network, the same media network that Meta, Twitter, FireEye, and ClearSky had previously attributed to Iran. In an accompanying affidavit, the DOJ asserted that each of the seized domains was ‘fraudulently registered' due to each being used by or on behalf of the IRGC. AWDNews[.]com was among the seized domains.\nDid the perpetrators behind the MOFA breach and the subsequent leak plan the forgery and disinformation campaign ahead of time, or was it an afterthought? The answer is unclear. But the disinformation campaign demonstrates how hack-and-leak events can catalyse cultivating false information to new and existing audiences. Once a breach happens and secrets spill into the public domain, related but fabricated stories become more believable and harder to debunk. Actors with no stake in the previous events may also seize the opportunity to harvest the outcome of hack-and-leaks.\nThe same actor(s) may not have been behind the three stages of Saudi Leaks. The forgery may have been devised on the fly. What is established, however, is that Iran's IRGC was behind the disinformation campaign. The manipulation of leaked material signals Iran's interest and capacity in leveraging the output of hack-and-leak events for influencing domestic and international audiences and antagonising Saudi allies.\n## Competing hypotheses: a framework for analysis The multi-stage nature of the WikiSaudiLeaks event calls for a multi-stage attribution. Thus far, there is only decisive evidence for attributing the forgery to Iran based on Twitter and Facebook takedowns and DOJ's attribution. Yemen Cyber Army's lack of any historical background has bolstered speculations that it was a front for other prominent actors with resources, motives, and ambitions for such an undertaking. The attribution of the MOFA hack and the leaks has remained divergent. As the following passages indicate, existing research points to Iran and Russia as the two main culprits. Other possibilities include Yemeni hackers or a collaboration among different actors. This section considers possible hints for attributing the breach into the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs network and the leaks that ensued.\nThe breach There are two possibilities with regard to the breach of the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The first hypothesis is that Iran breached the ministry's networks. This scenario would be in-line with Iran's involvement in a wider espionage operation that targeted government, military, and critical infrastructure targets across the Middle East between 2013 and 2015.\nIn June 2015, cybersecurity firm ClearSky published a report on an operation that had been in progress since mid 2014. ClearSky dubbed the alleged campaign ‘Thamar Reservoir' and pointed out a variety of targets of high interest to Iranian politics. These targets included international relations and defence professionals from Saudi Arabia, Israel, and elsewhere in the Middle East. The campaign utilised a range of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), including social engineering and spear phishing, mostly through Google services. ClearSky attributed Thamar Reservoir with high confidence to Iranian actors due to its considerable similarities of TTPs and overlapping infrastructure with previous operations also attributed to Iranian actors like Rocket Kitten and AjaxTeam.\nAnother cybersecurity company, Cylance, dubbed a related campaign ‘Operation Cleaver'. Cleaver included targets from Saudi Arabia's oil and gas and transportation industries in 2013--14. Among the TTPs used in Operation Cleaver, one particularly stands out. The threat actor predominantly used spear phishing to deceive targets to visit a job search website and submit their resumes. The scheme used an imposter of a legitimate professional development service winresume[.]com and its Easy Resume Creator Pro service to lure job candidates to download and install malware TinyZBot. The threat actor attempted to deceive its targets by convincing them they had a pending job opportunity at the industrial group Teledyne, through fake domains such as Teledyne-Jobs[.]com. To know more about the opportunity, the target had to use the malicious resume submission service. One of the Saudi cables later released by WikiLeaks suggests that a threat actor had used this very tactic to breach the Saudi MOFA network months before the May 2015 intrusion.\nIn January 2015, Saudi MOFA internally circulated a 14-page incident response report, describing an attack on the ministry's network that had started on 20 July 2014 (10 months before the May 2015 attack). The report, which is included in one of the Saudi cables, indicates that the system administrator of MOFA had received a targeted email with a job opportunity from the fictitious employer Teledyne. The target fell for the scheme and his machine was infected with the TinyZBot malware, which prompted data exfiltration from his device.\nThe ministry, however, only noticed the compromise in November 2014, when it detected failed proxy connections between the system admin computer and a suspicious server. 88.150.214.166 was the IP address of the server, which corresponds to that of the malicious domain Teledyne-Jobs[.]com, reportedly created by Iranian hackers. Outed by Cylance's Operation Cleaver report on 2 December 2014, the fake website stopped working on the same day. The MOFA report does not identify the extent of data exfiltration and network impact. But the document repeatedly cites Operation Cleaver, expressly attributing the attack to Iranian actors.\nThe public-facing WikiSaudiLeaks event started only in April 2015, but these technical reports put forward an alternative possibility. That is the attackers may have exfiltrated the diplomatic cables from the MOFA network earlier but held onto them until the Yemen conflict began to complicate regional geopolitics. This tactic resembles the hacking of Britam Defense. The company was hacked in November 2012 but the perpetrators held onto the stolen material until January 2013, when a U.S. military strike in Syria seemed looming. This significant time-delay is another indication of a professional intelligence agency tradecraft, as activists or militants likely would have acted more swiftly on a whim.\n## Russia The Saudi MOFA was of interest to the Russian actors, too. Russia is known to have engaged in reconnaissance and espionage activities against Middle Eastern targets in the spring of 2015.\nFANCY BEAR, also known as Sofacy or APT 28, a unit of Russia's military intelligence agency (GRU), reportedly breached the Saudi embassy in Ukraine in February 2015. The exclusive use of this vulnerability by FANCY BEAR until April 2015 has led researchers to entertain the possibility that Russia may also be responsible for the breach of the Saudi MOFA's network in the WikiSaudiLeaks event.\nThe attack infrastructure in the GRU campaign also contains noteworthy overlaps with the ominous Yemen Cyber Army. Wikisaleaks, the website ostensibly run by Yemen Cyber Army, was registered on the same range of IP addresses linked to FANCY BEAR in 2015. The address is part of a range of 256 at Lithuanian hosting provider UAB DUOMENU CENTRAS, leased to an intermediary company, MonoVM. The company offers a range of services, including dedicated servers and web hosting. In May 2015, it still accepted a variety of crypto currencies, such as Bitcoin and Skrill, to process transactions. These decentralised methods of payment have been appealing to Russian actors for purchasing the infrastructure for hacking operations. The domain MonoVM[.]com has been registered with a Dubai address, but it appears to be owned or managed by Iranian individuals. The registrant details also include information about another hosting company, Azar Online, registered under the same Persian names. Azar Online appears to be an ISP in Tabriz, the capital of Eastern Azerbaijan province in Iran.\nLater disclosures established even more links between MonoVM and Iran. In December 2020, amid then-President Trump and his close allies' allegations of election fraud, a new website emerged with a hit list of U.S. officials that refuted Trump's claims. *Enemies of the People* sought to incite violence and wreak havoc in the United States. The Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) quickly attributed this operation to Iran. One of the associated domains of Enemies of the People website was hosted on MonoVM.\nIt is possible that FANCY BEAR used MonoVM, likely an Iranian company, for its espionage operations while masquerading as Yemen Cyber Army. FANCY BEAR has utilised the same technique, known as false flag, with other fronts such as the CyberBerkut and CyberCaliphate -- two GRU front groups that emerged in 2014. An alternative possibility, however, is that other actors, including Iranians, utilised MonoVM services for their purposes around the same time, thus creating a false flag, likely unintentionally.\nLater events suggested a third hypothesis. In 2019, another Russian actor, Turla (aka Snake), identified as Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), was detected to have hijacked the technical infrastructure of OilRig, an Iranian threat actor, for espionage attacks in 2017 and early 2018. In October 2019, US and UK intelligence services confirmed that Turla had exploited the command and control and operational infrastructure of Iranian actors to expand its network of victims.\nTurla had previously targeted entities in 45 countries in 2015, including governments, military organisations, and research institutions. Most of these victims were located in the Middle East and Europe. There is no evidence for such hijacking of infrastructure prior to 2017. Though it is possible that Turla, or other Russian actors, might have co-opted TTPs of Iranian actors in an effort to further obfuscate attribution for WikiSaudiLeaks. For example, Turla has used a variant of Mimikatz, a commonplace hacking tool used extensively by different actors, which was also previously used by Iranian actors in Operation Cleaver. A fourth possibility could be that the two groups, Iranians and Russians, may have been collaborating in some capacity.\n### The leaks Attribution of the leaks remains challenging, in large part due to limited evidence available on the details of the transfer of Saudi Cables to WikiLeaks and WikiSaudiLeaks websites. This gap is perpetuated by three factors. First, wikisaleaks[.]com was registered on the same IP range as the Russian C2 infrastructure in 2015. Second, yemenica[.]com, the other website of the Yemen Cyber Army, was registered with an email address from the Russian webmail provider, Yandex.\na report from 2019 suggests that two weeks after the release of Saudi Cables in June 2015, WikiLeaks moved its web hosting infrastructure to a new server in Russia. Prior to the transfer, however, the same IP address hosted a fake domain that had been associated with phishing attacks by the Iranian Rocket Kitten until May 2015. This suggests that WikiLeaks may have collaborated with the Iranian hackers for the intrusion of Saudi MOFA, or coordinated for the transfer of stolen documents. It could also entirely be a coincidence. As with MonoVM, different actors may have used the same infrastructure for their preferred setup and reliability.\n## Five vectors for a deconstructed approach to attribution Our analysis of competing hypotheses illustrates that evidence on the technical, operational, and political aspects of the WikiSaudiLeaks events point to more than a single suspect. In entertaining these hypotheses, we consider a multi-factor framework that includes the history of different actors in undertaking hack-and-leak operations, motivation, messaging, capabilities (technical and otherwise), and infrastructure. Together, these indicators pave the ground for addressing the question of ‘who did it', with Iran, Russia, or the Yemen Cyber Army as the most likely culprits.\n### History In assessing a threat actor's history, we first consider past behaviour that tracks with the tradecraft used in the case in question. Out of the three likely culprits, Iran and Russia had previously engaged in computer network exploitation (CNE) against a variety of adversaries, in particular diplomatic targets from the Middle East. Moreover, they both had previously used fictitious fronts in CNE and computer network attack (CNA) operations. Iranian Charming Kitten (APT33) had targeted Saudi Aramco in 2012, posing as the Cutting Sword of Justice and Arab Youth Group. Russia, too, has a history of using front groups for active measures. Cyber Berkut was a Russian scheme, posing as an anti-Ukraine hacktivist group to target the websites of NATO and several German officials in March 2014 and January 2015, respectively. CyberCaliphate, a seemingly ISIS-associated group, breached TV5 Monde, a major French television network with global coverage, resulting in network disruption for hours in April 2015. The ominous Yemen Cyber Army, however, lacks any history prior to WikiSaudiLeaks, which bolsters the possibility of a front for other more established actors, like Iran or Russia.\n### Motivation Second, we investigate the motivation which refers to a perpetrator's interest in conducting certain actions in a geopolitical context. WikiSaudiLeaks was a retaliatory response to the Saudis for their intervention in the Yemen conflict. In principle, the Houthi rebels and Iran would have both benefited from the collapse of the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen. While Russia has taken an intermediary role in Yemen to avoid direct conflict, the failure of a key US ally would still serve Russia's political and economic objectives in the region. Moreover, Iran and Russia's decisive intervention in Syria in support of the Assad regime has been met with unwavering opposition from Saudi Arabia and the United States, with either side accusing the other of supporting ‘terrorists'. The humiliating hack-and-leak events of WikiSaudiLeaks thus serve both Iran and Russia's vengeance toward Saudi Arabia.\n### Messaging Third, we turn to messaging which relates to the semantics and semiotics of the behaviour. The language, signs, and other cues used to communicate with the audience often contain clues about the actor. The WikiSaudiLeaks operators used a consistent anti-Saudi tone in all stages: the hacking of Al-Hayat and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, promoting the leaked material, and the disinformation campaign. They conveyed resistance to the Saudi intervention in Yemen, with an obvious emphasis on pro-Iranian and pro-Shi'ite sentiments. In addition, the Iranian state media network was the first to systematically cover ‘Saudileaks' in English, weeks before WikiLeaks and other outlets did. At the very least, the zealous communication underscores Iran's vested interest in the incident. This is not to say that the same operators were behind the publication of the leaked material. However, these considerations along with the history and motivation factors skew the attribution assessment toward Iran. Admittedly, some of these details can be manipulated to falsely point in a certain direction and obfuscate attribution. Using a geopolitical cover makes attribution of a false flag operation particularly challenging.\n### Capability Fourth, capability entails the technical expertise, economic and human resources, and enterprising networks of operators and media affiliates that enable a malicious operation. The WikiSaudiLeaks event suggests coordination among a network of operators on different levels, each marshalling a variety of skill sets. Each stage required capabilities that both Iran and Russia demonstrated before. Yet these factors seem far less viable for the Yemen Cyber Army due to its lack of history.\n### Infrastructure Lastly, the infrastructure factor concerns the foundations for physical and virtual communication used to deliver a technical capability or maintain the command and control of capabilities. These structures include electronic devices, servers, domain tools, online services, and social media accounts, to name a few, that attackers can buy, lease, share, compromise, and repurpose to develop their infrastructure. In hack-and-leak operations, the infrastructure for the intrusion may not be the same as what is used for the leak. It is also possible that different actors use the same infrastructure at different points in time.\nAs with WikiSaudiLeaks, possible overlap of infrastructures can significantly impede detection and attribution. The wikisaleaks[.]com domain, one of the websites affiliated with Yemen Cyber Army, was registered at an IP address from likely-Iranian hosting company MonoVM. The IP address also intersected with the Russian infrastructure used to target the Saudi embassy in Ukraine in early 2015. It is entirely plausible, then, that Iranian and Russian actors were using web services offered by the same provider around the same time, hence the overlapping IP addresses. However, it is not possible to determine whether this infrastructure switch was intentional or merely a coincidence.\nConsidered together, history, motivation, messaging, capability, and infrastructure provide a framework for examining the competing hypotheses about attribution. Proper synthesis of these details is not possible with the same level of certainty across the WikiSaudiLeaks event. In attributing a multi-stage incident, we propose to assess each stage (the hack and the leak) against these five indicators. Tables 1 and 2 summarise the degree to which each stage of the WikiSaudiLeaks event can be attributed to three likely perpetrators: Yemen Cyber Army, Iran, and Russia.\nAs Tables 1 and 2 indicate, the Yemen Cyber Army has the lowest chance of being a real culprit. Lack of history and information about the group increases the possibility that it may have been a fictitious front for other perpetrators. The network intrusion can be attributed to Iran and Russia with varying degrees of confidence. Attributing the leak is not as straightforward, however. There is limited evidence of politically motivated leaks by Iranian actors unless Iran was indeed behind the attack on Britam Defence in 2013. While Russia has a long history of leaks during the Cold War and the pre-Internet days, there is limited credible evidence on Russia's involvement in cyber-enabled leaks prior to the attack on the DNC in 2016. Other indicators -- such as pro-Iran messaging, subtle cues from wikisaleaks[.]com, and the extensive coverage of the leaks by state-affiliated media early on -- can be taken as the involvement of Iran on some level. Last but not least, Iran is responsible for the forgery and disinformation campaign that came out of the WikiSaudiLeaks event. Overall, Iran scores higher on all three stages than other possible culprits.\nINTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY\n\n|   | Yemen Cyber Army | Iran-affiliated Actors | Russia-affiliated Actors  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  History | No | Yes | Yes  |\n|  Motivation | Yes | Yes | Possibly  |\n|  Messaging | Yes | Yes | No  |\n|  Capability | * | Yes | Yes  |\n|  Infrastructure | * | Yes | Yes  |\nTable 2.

Possible forgeries among the leaked data and plausible false flags add to the complications of attribution. The same actor(s) may not be behind seemingly related events. Distinguishing these actors from one another also comes with particular complexities. In this context, de-layering the attribution process and investigating each layer separately facilitate the assessment. The outcome may be varying degrees of confidence in the attribution of each stage, which in turn helps to identify the gaps in the attribution of digital covert action. The case of WikiSaudiLeaks captures these nuances.\nOn the strategic level, attribution remains a political decision based on information collated by intelligence and security agencies or influenced by foreign policy considerations.¹³⁴ It delineates red lines and weighs a set of legitimate responses to the attack.¹³⁵ In the case of WikiSaudiLeaks, affected state parties did not publicly attribute this case. Saudi officials offered little public communication regarding the source of the intrusion. Nor did allies of the kingdom with prominent cyber capabilities, such as the United States, release high level technical or intelligence assessments about WikiSaudiLeaks. Instead, speculative attribution was done by cyber security firms and individual researchers, who lack the authority and means to collect the signal and human intelligence necessary to reliably attribute an attack to a state.¹³⁶\nStrategic attribution comes at a cost, politically and logistically. It requires multiple government agencies and often private sector firms working together, often across borders, utilising their intelligence sources and methods. While there is no consistent approach to attributing cyber attacks among states, an incident is more likely to invoke attribution by states if it passes a two-fold test of significance: (1) the nature and severity of the attack, and (2) the affected parties and implications for their national security. In other words, who is targeted and how they are targeted are the key questions that can invoke an attribution response by states and their allies. The closer an attack hits one's home, the more likely that the state gets involved. Thus, the target and severity of cyber-enabled covert action affect the decision to expend resources on public attribution. WikiSaudiLeaks may not have passed this test.\nWhy was the campaign not conclusively attributed? First, the forensic evidence did not unambiguously point to a single adversary at any given moment.¹³⁷ Second, the entire event, it appears, was not consequential enough at any given moment in time for the Saudi government to initiate a more determined investigation and response. Lastly, although the attack was politically embarrassing, it seems that it did not constitute a sufficiently severe national security threat to Saudi Arabia to escalate to an international investigation with support from more experienced and capable allies.\nYet WikiSaudiLeaks set an internationally consequential precedent. It was highly likely the first state-enabled hack-and-leak operation that utilised WikiLeaks as an amplifying platform, a tactic that was most notably used just one year later in the most tectonic digital covert campaign of our times, the DNC hack-and-leak. In hindsight, it may have been a strategic shortcoming on the part of the US and UK intelligence communities not to have partnered with Saudi intelligence for a more robust response to WikiSaudiLeaks. Both countries, after all, became the target of Russian and Iranian active measures in the 2016, 2018, and 2019 elections, respectively. The episode nevertheless underscores the significance of coalitions and partnerships, especially if a targeted government does not possess mature capabilities and experience in attribution. WikiSaudiLeaks came before the consolidation of such theories as persistent engagement and defend forward in U.S. cyber strategy. With the benefit of hindsight, the same attack on an ally's integrity today may -- and should -- prompt a more mature response from FiveEyes partners and other open societies.\n## Conclusion\nCovert action is a political instrument. Hack-and-leak incidents may be designed to mess with regional and international politics by ‘inflaming existing contradictions', to use the old Soviet terminology once honed by KGB's Service A, history's most advanced disinformation bureaucracy. Hack-and-leak operations are only technically upgraded iterations of Cold War collect-and-leak operations. Since at least 2013, predominantly authoritarian governments have deployed hack-and-leak operations amid geopolitical crises against a range of adversaries. WikiSaudiLeaks is the pivotal historic example.\nThe multi-stage nature of digital covert action requires a multi-stage attribution process. This process extends across technical, operational, and strategic levels. Such all-source analysis must still cut across often hardwearing disciplinary boundaries between the kind of digital forensics commonly used in incident response and threat intelligence reporting and the kind of digital forensics commonly used to investigate influence operations (IO) and disinformation. Moreover, a single confidence score may not be appropriate for multi-stage events. That is, analysis of one stage may produce a degree of confidence that differs from other components of the same event. Worse, in extreme cases different components of what might appear as one campaign can be perpetrated by different actors, even unbeknownst to each other.\nWikiSaudiLeaks was strategically designed to inflame contradictions in Saudi Arabia, a party to the Yemen conflict, to wedge open its alliances, and rally international public opinion against the kingdom. The evidence available to us does not allow for definitive attribution for the entire WikiSaudiLeaks event. Instead, a multi-stage all-source investigation offers more details about each component. Each stage requires exploring a different set of forensic artefacts, as well as considering separate tactical, operational, and strategic aspects. The Saudi MOFA-related intrusions could be attributed, based on circumstantial evidence, to either Iran or Russia, possibly even both. The lack of forensic evidence about the provenance of the leaks adds to the challenge of attributing the campaign's exposure stage. However, Iran and Russia remain the most likely culprits, with some circumstantial evidence pointing to Iran. The final stage, the digital disinformation and amplification campaign, can be confidently attributed to Iran, given the abundant evidence exposed by social media companies. A multi-stage event, therefore, requires a multi-stage attribution process -- one that allows for gradients of attribution within each stage.\nThere are three non-exclusive explanations for why WikiSaudiLeaks was not attributed with high confidence to a specific adversary. First, the target, in this case Saudi Arabia, did not have sufficient political determination to perform public attribution. Amid the Yemen conflict, the kingdom was intent on minimising attention to the Saudi Cables and staying on message about the unravelling proxy war with Iran. Second, Saudi Arabia and interested third parties -- including the United States -- likely had insufficient incentive to unlock the attributive resources required to link the campaign to a specific adversary. Access to attributive capabilities consists of both access to a range of forensic\nartefacts and access to the skills and experience necessary to acquire, develop, cross-reference, process, analyse, contextualise, and interpret relevant signals and artefacts. Finally, the WikiSaudiLeaks campaign exhibited features that made the overall event exceptionally hard to attribute to one specific adversary. It is highly likely that these features were partly intended by at least one adversary, and partly unintended.\nMinimising uncertainty is the primary undertaking of attribution. Yet it is a highly complex and nuanced process. Technical forensic artefacts, if inconclusive, must be considered together with other data, obtained from a variety of sources, collected both passively and actively. The delayed nature of attribution further complicates the task. Additional useful details may only become available months or even years later, as our case illustrates, thus rendering early judgements incomplete. False flags, or suspicion thereof, and other challenges can significantly complicate attribution and the response it may require.\nAttributing twenty-first century covert action -- integrated campaigns that have a CNE, CNA, and possibly an IO component -- in a nutshell, is an art and a science and, above all, an all-source enterprise and as such vastly different from attributing narrow computer network breaches. In this attribution process, analysts will have to be ready to disentangle some campaigns, assessing, analysing and attributing their respective components -- the hack, forge, leak, amplify -- on their own merits. Attributing one or multiple components may be easy or hard, linking them together is a separate challenge yet. Adversaries, in turn, may take advantage of this layered attribution challenge.\nWikiSaudiLeaks came before its time, as the analytic toolsets and the strategic and investigative approaches necessary to understand and attribute this event have continued to mature after the fact. After all, it was only around 2016 that security firms started seriously integrating CNE and IO in their public-facing investigative work, with Mandiant among the first,^{142} and Microsoft^{143} and later Google^{144} following suit. Nor did the US government adopt the strategies of persistent engagement and defend forward until 2018,^{145} three years after WikiSaudiLeaks.\nSaudi Cables, in hindsight, was a chameleon that appeared as a different thing against different backdrops: seen in the WikiLeaks context, it appeared as innocent transparency activism; in the website defacement context, it appeared as patriot hacker skirmishes; and viewed against the foil of expanding digital covert action, it appeared as a campaign of at least one authoritarian intelligence agency."

  "payload": "## ## Introduction What was WikiSaudiLeaks and why was it so hard to attribute? This paper revisits one of the most complex, most significant, and most mysterious hack-and-leak puzzles of our time, a 2015 case known among investigators as ‘WikiSaudiLeaks'. The name refers to a mysterious website that surfaced and disseminated a major trove of files taken from the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The site's operators curiously claimed to have given the stolen documents to WikiLeaks, which claimed to have published 122,619 files by year's end.1 Subsequently, the material received high profile press coverage2 and became known as ‘The Saudi Cables'.\n\nWikiSaudiLeaks is an early example of a fundamental yet neglected attribution challenge.3 The event was not unified. The leak was part of a larger covert action campaign that involved advanced computer network exploitation, computer network attack, persistent deception, and a creative influence and disinformation effort.4 Yet so far neither scholars nor investigators from public or private sector have been able to conclusively attribute WikiSaudiLeaks to a specific threat actor -- in sharp contrast to most other comparable high-profile cases. Why? Because the leak does nothing less than challenge the established attribution paradigm. Hack-and-leak events are not widely discussed, and existing scholarship tends to focus on the interplay between intrusion and influence, while neglecting the consequences for attribution.5 What if a single attribution statement for digital covert action is not possible in the first place?\nWikiSaudiLeaks happened just as the goldilocks moment of digital covert action was ending: about a year before the Russian election interference in the United States, when bulk leaks were still seen as innocent expressions of transparency activism; and just two years after Mandiant's APT1 report,6 when the public attribution debate and capabilities were still in their infancy. Later events have motivated prolific scholarship, most prominently the Democratic National Committee (DNC) hack-and-leak.7 Yet some of the earliest and most significant instances of digital covert action remain understudied. It is time to revise the WikiSaudiLeaks case, and with it our understanding of attributing covert action.\nDigital covert action was on the rise throughout the 2010s, with hack-and-leak operations making up a significant share. This rise is enabled, but insufficiently explained, by technological change. A list of the major hits would include the late 2000s campaign known as Stuxnet; various wiping attacks against Iranian targets in 2011; the 2012 attack against Saudi Aramco and Rasgas; the neglected 2013 Britam Defence leak; the 2014 Sony Pictures Entertainment breach-and-leak;; two remarkable blackouts in Kiev in 2015 and 2016 as well as numerous other operations in Ukraine; the series of breach-and-leak operations against the US election in 2016; the mysterious series of Shadow Brokers leaks; the ransomware attacks known as Wannacry and NotPetya in 2017, one executed poorly, the other deceptively; the Viasat sabotage at the outset of the Ukraine War in 2022, and several more, some of them subtle, others as yet not publicly discussed. The continuous and dynamic nature of such offensive activity helped give rise to the concepts of ‘persistent engagement' and ‘defend forward' in the U.S. government, in which attribution played a key role. Indeed all these major cases had one core feature in common: governments, and in many cases independent researchers, have attributed them with high confidence or even certainty to specific adversaries.\nYet WikiSaudiLeaks stands out: not only has it not been attributed with confidence, the case is also curiously understudied. Both absences are all the more remarkable given that the covert action has generated an extraordinary amount of media coverage, with hundreds of press stories. The ensuing leak is also infamous as one of the most unethical and extreme so far, releasing unredacted cables that included full names and passport numbers of victims of torture and sexual abuse.\nWhy was the campaign not attributed so far? What can this curious case tell us about the past and future of attributing computer network operations in general and covert action specifically? And, of course: who was responsible for WikiSaudiLeaks?\nWe argue that by breaking down the larger event into its components, limited attribution becomes possible. To understand the saga that is Wikisaudileaks, investigators must first deconstruct what appears to be one coherent event into its constituent components: collection, disclosure, and amplification. Each component, counterintuitively, may not only come with a specific confidence level; it may also lead to diverging and separate attribution assessments. What looks like one operation at a first glance, with closer inspection may, in fact, collapse into multiple operations. The limited scholarship on this case has entertained the possibility of Russian involvement. We attribute at least one component of the larger covert action to Iran.\nAttribution is what states make of it. The outcome of an attributive investigation into a major computer network breach is determined by resources and political priorities, both on the side of the victim and on the side of the perpetrator. The perpetrator plans and equips a clandestine or covert operation to sustain deniability -- the victim plans and equips investigative and analytical outfits to take deniability away. The decision to publicly attribute, however, is correlated with such factors as incident severity, geopolitical circumstances, the intelligence available on the case, technical and operational capacity, and the political will of those involved in the attribution process. The WikiSaudiLeaks event puts the interaction of these indicators to test and underscores several gaps in the attribution process.\nThe paper proceeds in four steps. First we provide context to hack-and-leak operations in the Middle East by revisiting a neglected case from 2013, the earliest known instance of a hack-and-leak. We then offer a granular analysis of the WikiSaudiLeaks event, unmasking a related disinformation campaign that so far has not been covered in public or confidential reporting on the case. The third section reviews competing hypotheses in the attribution of WikiSaudiLeaks, followed by a framework for attribution of different stages of the covert action. We close by discussing the challenges of attribution of this particular case and, more broadly, digital covert action.\n\n---\n\n## ## Conclusion\n\nCovert action is a political instrument. Hack-and-leak incidents may be designed to mess with regional and international politics by ‘inflaming existing contradictions', to use the old Soviet terminology once honed by KGB's Service A, history's most advanced disinformation bureaucracy.

    "# Attributing digital covert action: the curious case of WikiSaudiLeaks\n\nSimin Kargar, Thomas Rid\n\n## Abstract\n\nHow can digital covert action be attributed? This paper revisits one of the most complex, most significant, and most mysterious digital covert actions of our time: a 2015 hack-and-leak case known among investigators as 'WikiSaudiLeaks' that so far has evaded attribution. We argue that WikiSaudiLeaks was not a stand-alone event, but a puzzle piece in a larger covert action campaign that involved advanced computer network exploitation, computer network attack, persistent deception, and a creative influence and disinformation effort. By disintegrating the larger event into its components, limited attribution becomes possible. We present the most detailed and comprehensive investigation of this case to date, attribute at least one component of the larger event to Iranian intelligence, and draw conceptional conclusions.\n\n## Introduction\n\nWhat was WikiSaudiLeaks and why was it so hard to attribute?

    "understudied. It is time to revise the WikiSaudiLeaks case, and with it our understanding of attributing covert action.\n\nDigital covert action was on the rise throughout the 2010s, with hack-and-leak operations making up a significant share. This rise is enabled, but insufficiently explained, by technological change. A list of the major hits would include the late 2000s campaign known as Stuxnet; various wiping attacks against Iranian targets in 2011; the 2012 attack against Saudi Aramco and Rasgas; the neglected 2013 Britam Defence leak; the 2014 Sony Pictures Entertainment breach-and-leak;; two remarkable blackouts in Kiev in 2015 and 2016 as well as numerous other operations in Ukraine; the series of breach-and-leak operations against the US election in 2016; the mysterious series of Shadow Brokers leaks; the ransomware attacks known as Wannacry and NotPetya in 2017, one executed poorly, the other deceptively; the Viasat sabotage at the outset of the Ukraine War in 2022, and several more, some of them subtle, others as yet not publicly discussed. The continuous and dynamic nature of such offensive activity helped give rise to the concepts of ‘persistent engagement' and ‘defend forward' in the U.S. government, in which attribution played a key role. Indeed all these major cases had one core feature in common: governments, and in many cases independent researchers, have attributed them with high confidence or even certainty to specific adversaries.\n\nYet WikiSaudiLeaks stands out: not only has it not been attributed with confidence, the case is also curiously understudied. Both absences are all the more remarkable given that the covert action has generated an extraordinary amount of media coverage, with hundreds of press stories. The ensuing leak is also infamous as one of the most unethical and extreme so far, releasing unredacted cables that included full names and passport numbers of victims of torture and sexual abuse.\n\nWhy was the campaign not attributed so far? What can this curious case tell us about the past and future of attributing computer network operations in general and covert action specifically? And, of course: who was responsible for WikiSaudiLeaks?\n\nWe argue that by breaking down the larger event into its components, limited attribution becomes possible. To understand the saga that is Wikisaudileaks, investigators must first deconstruct what appears to be one coherent event into its constituent components: collection, disclosure, and amplification. Each component, counterintuitively, may not only come with a specific confidence level; it may also lead to diverging and separate attribution assessments. What looks like one operation at a first glance, with closer inspection may, in fact, collapse into multiple operations. The limited scholarship on this case has entertained the possibility of Russian involvement. We attribute at least one component of the larger covert action to Iran.\n\nAttribution is what states make of it. The outcome of an attributive investigation into a major computer network breach is determined by resources and political priorities, both on the side of the victim and on the side of the perpetrator. The perpetrator plans and equips a clandestine or covert operation to sustain deniability -- the victim plans and equips investigative and analytical outfits to take deniability away. The decision to publicly attribute, however, is correlated with such factors as incident severity, geopolitical circumstances, the intelligence available on the case, technical and operational capacity, and the political will of those involved in the attribution process. The WikiSaudiLeaks event puts the interaction of these indicators to test and underscores several gaps in the attribution process.\n\nThe paper proceeds in four steps. First we provide context to hack-and-leak operations in the Middle East by revisiting a neglected case from 2013, the earliest known instance of a hack-and-leak. We then offer a granular analysis of the WikiSaudiLeaks event, unmasking a related disinformation campaign that so far has not been covered in public or confidential reporting on the case. The third section reviews competing hypotheses in the attribution of WikiSaudiLeaks, followed by a framework for attribution of different stages of the covert action. We close by discussing the challenges of attribution of this particular case and, more broadly, digital covert action.\n\n##",
    "Prelude\n\nHack-and-leak operations have become ever more common since 2013, globally and especially in the Middle East. Around that time, a number of still mysterious leaks appeared that, in hindsight, could have been the work of intelligence agencies or contractors. The rise of the Anonymous movement as well as WikiLeaks offered unprecedented and obvious opportunities for covert operations. For a few years before the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the wider public and most journalists saw leaks as something positive first and foremost, as a way to create transparency and accountability -- not as an ideal cover for dirty tricks.\n\nThe breaches that enable the subsequent disclosure of stolen files may be initially done for espionage purposes, or the targeting may be driven by covert action objectives. The offenders' precise intentions are likely to remain obscure in the absence of direct intelligence access or declassified archival records. Historically, however, it was often ‘throwaway' -- files that no longer served a narrow intelligence purpose -- that were used to furnish the content for targeted leaks. Particularly noteworthy in this context were the Shaltai Boltai disclosures in Russia, and, a few months after WikiSaudiLeaks, in October 2015, the unattributed and fairly obscure ‘Turok' FSB leak. These operations often seek to undermine an adversary's decision-making, political cohesion, domestic public opinion, leaders, reputation, and alliances.\n\nWhat follows is a prelude to the WikiSaudiLeaks event, similarly involving a regional conflict in the Middle East, equally neglected, and inconclusively attributed.\n\n### Britam defense\n\nThe earliest known major case of hack-and-leak operations in the Middle East dates back to the early 2010s. The context for the case was the civil war in Syria. In July 2012, the Syrian government acknowledged that it had chemical weapons in its possession though it would never deploy such weapons against its own citizens but only against foreign intervention. In August, then-President Barack Obama warned the Bashar al-Assad regime that any use of chemical weapons in Syria would significantly change his calculus on a U.S. military response. The prospect of a U.S. strike in Syria concerned Assad's key allies, Iran and Russia, who have remained staunch supporters of the Syrian government since the beginning of the conflict in early 2011.\n\nThe first allegation of use of chemical weapons in Syria was reported in the city of Homs on 23 December 2012. The news rippled through the region and beyond. On 15 January 2013, an anonymous source alleged to Foreign Policy that the State Department had compelling evidence to attribute the chemical attack to the Syrian military. These unverified, controversial claims raised speculations that a U.S. military strike in Syria might be imminent.\n\nThen, on 22 January, a mysterious post appeared on Pastebin, a widely used disclosure and documentation platform, titled ‘Millitary server hacked. Confidential data!‘ An entity calling itself ‘JAsIrX' posted a short note in broken English, about 130 words, with no fewer than 51 URLs to file-sharing sites. The note was crude, and claimed that Britam Defence, a UK-based military contractor, ‘killed Arabs in Iraq and plans to invade in Iran and Syria'.\n\nShortly after, around 24 January, a report appeared on the obscure site cyberwarnews[.]info, claiming that Britam had been hacked. On 28 January 2013, conspiracy theory websites started covering the leak. The niche site whatdoesitmean[.]com headlined: ‘Obama Plan for World War III Stuns Russia'. That same day Infowars titled: ‘Hacked Emails Reveal “Washington-Approved” Plan to Stage Chemical Weapons Attack in Syria'.\n\nThe following day the story went mainstream. The Daily Mail, one of the UK's most-read tabloids, blasted: ‘U.S. “backed plan to launch chemical weapon attack on Syria and blame it on Assad's regime”'. The report in the Mail cited an email exchange from the previous month, allegedly among a group of senior managers at Britam. The exchange suspiciously mentioned a proposal that Britam would supply chemical weapons to Syria, while posing as Russian mercenaries, in exchange",
    "for a significant amount of money. The Daily Mail in turn linked to the initial report in Cyber War News that took the leak at face value.\n\nBritam, in fact, was targeted by a successful hack-leak-forge operation. An unknown attacker had breached Britam's email, likely in November 2012. On January 22 the perpetrators, calling themselves ‘JAsIrX', started posting internal documents from Britam on Pastebin. One email exchange from October 2012 purported to link Britam to a military training project in Saudi Arabia to increase readiness for a possible strike by Iran. Another exchange claimed a U.S.-backed proposal to Britam to ‘deliver a CW to Homs' and deploy its Ukrainian personnel to pose as Russian mercenaries\n\nThe fabricated incriminating emails appeared to have been sent two months apart from one another; yet both digital artefacts shared the same unique message identity number, and had the exact same ‘sent' timestamp, at 23:57:18. Similarly, the documents pertaining to the Saudi military project were created and modified in short succession on Friday, 18 January 2013 at 12:00 GMT. The suspicious content, combined with the suspicious metadata, makes it highly likely that these forged documents sought to falsely incriminate the company in a plot against the United States and Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe story immediately appeared on Press TV, the English language branch of the state-run broadcaster, Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB). Press TV took a hard anti-Western position, noting the timing as ‘the Syrian army forces have managed to clear the capital, Damascus and its surrounding areas of the militants and restore security'. Seeking renewed attention to the case, Fars News, a key media affiliate of Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), republished the allegations in August 2013, citing whatdoesitmean. Other Iranian hardliner news sites, notably Mehr News, echoed the recycled article, but the story did not gain much attention.\n\nAttribution in the case of the Britam hack-leak-forge remained vague. A Sunday Times article entertained the possibility of Iran's involvement, but offered no solid sourcing or evidence. There is limited public technical forensics available about the attack. But contextual and operational cues, such as Iran's high stakes in Syria and the unusual media coverage by state-affiliated outlets, support the Iran hypothesis.\n\nEither way, the incident was the first major hack-and-leak operation that involved a variety of state and nonstate actors in Middle East politics. Whoever was behind the operation had a vested interest in implicating the United States in the use of chemical weapons in Syria, and in detracting from the truth. The event unfolded in multiple stages. The perpetrator conducted a network intrusion and collected data on the target ahead of time, manipulated the data to take advantage of geopolitical developments in the region, and promptly released the stolen (and forged) materials to maximise the believability of the plot. These same features were also on display in the WikiSaudiLeaks operation that hit Saudi Arabia two years later. Similarly, both cases remain shrouded in mystery with no conclusive attribution.\n\nIn both events, adversarial actors were only beginning to flex technical resources to advance geopolitical motives through digital covert action. Inconclusive attribution in those early days extended the opportunity to the perpetrators to seek to subvert more significant targets. It was only a matter of time until major Western powers began to feel the burn at home.\n\n## WikiSaudiLeaks\n\nThe Yemen civil war was still fresh in March 2015. The Shi'ite Houthi rebels had taken over the capital city of Sanaa and ousted the Saudi-backed President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and its allies had launched a military offensive, Operation Decisive Storm, to counter the Iran-backed Houthi militias. Between March 26 and April 22, the Saudi-led airstrikes caused civil casualties and massive destruction across Yemen. The Saudi and Iranian interventions were, in some ways, only one episode in a long lineage of foreign interference in Yemen's affairs, some overt, others covert. Yet the escalating civil war offered the context for a new, unprecedented form of outside intervention -- one that remained shrouded in mystery for years.",
    "WikiSaudiLeaks unfolded in three episodes. First, a series of hacking incidents targeted both Iranian and Saudi-affiliated media outlets, suggesting patriotic hacker skirmishes on the margins of the Yemen conflict. The network intrusion soon reached the Saudi Ministry of Foreign affairs. Before long, in the second phase, troves of confidential cables from the Ministry were leaked to the public via WikiLeaks and other platforms. The third, and previously undiscussed, stage involved a disinformation campaign against a United Nations expert that Iran-affiliated media broadly promoted. The following sections offer a deep dive into these stages, outlining the technical, operational, and political context to each layer.\n\n### The hacks\n\nIn March and April 2015, a series of hacking incidents started drawing attention to the unfolding conflict in Yemen. On April 12, defacements appeared on the English Twitter and YouTube accounts of Iran's state-backed, Arabic news channel Al-Alam. The defacements included images of Saudi leadership, messages in support of Operation Decisive Storm, and a false claim that the Iran-backed Houthi leader was dead. Other tweets sent from Al-Alam's Twitter account disclosed a purported list of correspondents of Al-Alam. Both Al-Alam and SaharTV, another Iranian state-backed television channel, confirmed the incident and blamed it on Saudi hackers.\n\nAn anonymous, self-described hacking entity, @Cyber__Emotion claimed responsibility for the attacks on Twitter. The entity's earliest publicly-known activities date back to 2014, when an actor with the same handle took over official Twitter accounts of Saudi ministries of justice and finance, questioning these institutions' lack of concern for cybersecurity. In 2016, the group allegedly compromised the official account of the Saudi Minister of Education, criticising his performance and demanding improvement in the national educational system.\n\nOnly a day after the Al-Alam defacements, a previously unheard of hacking group Yemen Cyber Army defaced the Saudi-owned Arabic news site Al-Hayat on April 13. The defacement announcement displayed a picture of the Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and a provocative pro-Shi'ite message against the kingdom and its allies, threatening that their time would soon be up. In addition to the defacement, the attackers leaked the names, email addresses, and hashed passwords of Al-Hayat users and subscribers.\n\nIran's semi-official news agency, Fars News, was among the first outlets to react to the incident. Fars News published an ‘exclusive' coverage of the Al-Hayat defacement, attributing the attack to Yemen Cyber Army without offering any evidence about the identity or background of the group. Fars News also linked to the Yemen Cyber Army's announcements and files on Pastebin, which is frequently used by hackers to claim responsibility for website defacements.\n\nThe only posts disseminating the Pastebin announcements came from @QuickLeakOrg, the associated Twitter account of QuickLeak[.]net. QuickLeak is a fringe, now-defunct whistleblowing site used in 2013 by an Iranian hacker group Parastoo to promote their defacements activities. QuickLeak.net was registered under an Iranian name -- the same person had also registered Zone-hc, another now-defunct Iranian site modelled after another defacement forum, Zone-H. The IP address of QuickLeak and its associated network of domains, including quickleak[.]org and Wikileak[.]ir, was hosted by Iran's main Internet Service Provider (ISP), Telecommunication Company of Iran (TCI). These details are circumstantial evidence that link the Al-Hayat defacement to an entity in Iran.\n\nThe Al-Alam and Al-Hayat intrusions resembled patriotic hacktivist skirmishes on the margins of an unfolding geopolitical regional conflict. However, subsequent events, circumstantial evidence, and other technical indicators led some investigators to Iran, with the Yemen Cyber Army as a possible front.\n\nThe Saudi-led Operation Decisive Storm in Yemen ended on April 22. It was immediately followed by Operation Restoring Hope, which purportedly sought to reduce the use of force in Yemen and",
    "move toward a political solution for the conflict.66 The Yemen Cyber Army, however, was not to let go of the feud as easily.\n\nAbout a month after the defacement of Al-Hayat, the Yemen Cyber Army defaced the website of Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) on May 20. The MOFA homepage displayed an animated image that announced the launch of Operation Hussein Badreddin al-Houthi, named after the assassinated leader of the Houthi insurgency. The image content was familiar. Similar to the Al-Hayat defacement, it included anti-Saudi messages and strong pro-Shi'ite imagery, including pictures of Iran's Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, and Hassan Nasrallah, secretary general of Lebanon's Hezbollah militia. The announcement also featured a Guy Fawkes-masked face, the uncanny symbol of hacking collective Anonymous, and Anonymous' famous slogan ‘We Don't Forget, We Don't Forgive'.\n\nThe Yemen Cyber Army promised to release a trove of encrypted data on Saudi diplomats, agents, and citizens, stolen from 3000 MOFA computers. That week, Yemen Cyber Army released two tranches of private information of citizens and MOFA personnel on Pastebin as password-protected files, the password included as well.67 In the Pastebin announcement perpetrators identified as ‘Cutting Sword of Justice', the same actor behind the 2012 attack on Saudi's national oil company, Aramco. The destructive attack against Aramco, dubbed ‘Shamoon', involved automated wiping of 30,000 business devices. U.S. intelligence community and cybersecurity researchers attributed the incident to Iranian state-affiliated actors.68\n\nThe day after the Pastebin announcement, on May 21, Iran's Fars News published yet another exclusive report on the hack, crediting the ominous Yemen Cyber Army.69 A subsequent report on May 21 included a Word file attachment that contained links to the leaked documents on several file-sharing sites and passwords to decompress encrypted files.70 Fars News branded these exclusive reports as ‘Saudileaks'. This was the first time that the term was used as far as public records show. Between May and August 2015, Fars News published 32 pieces on Saudi Leaks in the English language.\n\nAgain, @QuickLeakOrg sought to promote the Pastebin announcement and Fars News exclusives, aiming for maximum public attention to the intrusion. These tweets did not generate much engagement, however.71 Efforts by journalists to confirm the identity of the Yemen Cyber Army did not yield much information as the group refused to disclose their location or even speak Arabic to the press.72\n\nThe magnitude, format, and timing of the intrusion, coupled with other circumstantial evidence, suggested that the perpetrators, whoever they were, had pro-Houthi aspirations and were publicly challenging Saudis' ambitions in the Yemen conflict. For its part, the Saudi MOFA confirmed the attack on its website but downplayed the impact. The Ministry also warned against using and publishing any leaked material, describing the breach as a ‘plot of the nation's enemies' and promising legal action against perpetrators.73\n\n### The leaks\n\nAgainst the warnings of the Saudi government, however, two substantive leaks put the MOFA hack on the spotlight, challenging Saudi foreign policy and practices.\n\nOn 19 June 2015, WikiLeaks published over sixty thousand documents, titled as Saudi Cables, and promised half a million more to follow.74 These cables comprised more than confidential diplomatic correspondences, however. They also contained personal medical and legal records of survivors of sexual abuse, sick children, and the mentally ill, among others. The mixed nature of these cables raised concerns about WikiLeaks' precarious handling of private citizen information and prompted debates about the ethics of responsible leaks.75\n\nWikiLeaks had previously released several controversial document sets from states and private companies. Though the whistleblowing platform had been relatively dormant for a couple of years before it published the Saudi Cables in 2015. In its press release, WikiLeaks acknowledged the Yemen",
    "Cyber Army as the initial source of ‘valuable sample documents' but did not disclose the source of the fresh trove, leaving the question of attribution unanswered. Upon the release of Saudi Cables, the Yemen Cyber Army went quiet and quit responding to media inquiries about their connection with the whistleblowing platform.\n\nThe Yemen Cyber Army partially came out of the dark on June 26 with the launch of their social media accounts and two now-defunct websites: Yemenica[.]com and wikisaleaks[.]com. Yemenica was a single-page site with a declaration from the group, describing itself as a ‘Yemeni youth community' united against the Saudi regime. Again, the description flashed back to a second group that claimed responsibility for the 2012 Shamoon attack, posing as Arab Youth Group. Notably, Yemenica had a Google Plus account, which at the time was the most popular social networking site among Iranian conservatives and was unaffected by Iran's infamous censorship practices.\n\nWikiSaudiLeaks presented an even more aggressive anti-Saudi manifesto: subtitled as Cyber Decisive Storm, the website header showed images of bombing of Yemen by Saudi-led forces in Operation Decisive Storm. It characterised the developments, in English, as a ‘barbaric Saudi-American aggression, with which the Israelites also stand'.\n\nWikiSaudiLeaks was likely an additional outlet to maximise attention to the leaked materials. The documents on the site were mostly in Arabic and had already been included in the WikiLeaks release. They were classified based on countries, regions, and international organisations such as the United Nations. The list began with old and current allies of the kingdom, including Qatar, the United States, Bahrain and Turkey. WikiSaudiLeaks also contained a dedicated category for ‘Persian Gulf Countries' -- a term that Iran has zealously used throughout the naming dispute with some Arab countries who have opted for alternatives such as ‘Arabian Gulf' or ‘Gulf'. These cues shed further light on the interests and motives of those behind WikiSaudiLeaks.\n\nWhoever spearheaded these leaks sought to alienate Saudi's allies, influence international audiences, and disrupt Saudi's strategic plans in Yemen. Several media partners of WikiLeaks, including the free press advocacy group Reporters Without Border, published selected materials and analyses about Saudi engagements internationally. While Western media broadly reported on the cables, the regional media remained divided on the matter according to traditional political lines. Pro-Saudi media, including Al-Hayat, reiterated the state warnings and refrained from circulating the leaked materials. The Iran-owned Al-Alam, on the other hand, extensively covered the cables. In the end, many Arabic language outlets chose not to cover Saudi Cables, presumably out of concern for legal and political retribution, leaving the regional impact of the leak rather unclear.\n\n### The sham\n\nThe public attention to Saudi Cables was already subsiding when a fabricated news article briefly brought SaudiLeaks back to some headlines. On July 27, Another Western Dawn News (AWDNews), a fringe news site, published an article in English, accusing a United Nations (UN) official of receiving bribes for biased reporting against the Islamic Republic of Iran. According to the article, the Saudi embassy in Kuwait had allegedly paid Dr. Ahmad Shaheed, then UN Special Rapporteur for the Situation of Human Rights in Iran, 10 million dollars to increase international pressure on Iran for its violation of human rights. The report cited a scanned copy of a top secret document purportedly from the Saudi Cables on WikiLeaks. Contrary to the AWDNews claim, however, the ‘source' document in Arabic mentioned a million dollar -- not ten -- paid to Shaheed.\n\nRegardless of the discrepancy, the article prompted strong reactions inside and outside Iran. Human rights groups characterised the allegation as a sophisticated, state-directed smear campaign against Shaheed and critics of Iran's record of human rights. For years, the Islamic Republic has refused to collaborate with the UN Special Rapporteurs, accusing them of plotting with Iran's adversaries, including Saudi Arabia, for biased or fabricated reporting about the situation of human rights in Iran. This article, if true, would have been",
    "the perfect evidence for Iran's enduring righteousness. The bribery claim also aligned well with Saudi's previous attempts to grow its influence in the international human rights system. According to the WikiLeaks documents, in 2014 Saudi Arabia bartered votes with the United Kingdom and Russia to gain a seat at the UN Human Rights Council, despite its nefarious record at home.\n\nThe article rapidly circulated on other fringe news sites such as Al-Waqt and the Middle East Press. Iran's conservative media reacted immediately and amplified the news in Persian and Arabic languages, with some citing the original source site Al-Waie News. Among those were the Young Journalists Club, which is run by the IRIB, the state-owned broadcaster, and Tasnim News, another media affiliate of the IRGC. All of these platforms promoted the one-million-dollar bribe accusation.\n\nAmid public confusion and media inquiries, WikiLeaks refuted the claim that the document was one of the original Saudi Cables. In a tweet to online news site Iran Front Page, WikiLeaks challenged the authenticity of the alleged document. WikiLeaks stated: ‘@IranFrontPage Please Show Which Cable This Claim Is Based on. You Fail to Link to One of Our Cables in the Article', thus adding forgery to the puzzle of Saudi Leaks. Shaheed, for his part, personally thanked WikiLeaks for the clarification.\n\nIt took some time for attributive leads to emerge. Three years later, in August 2018, Facebook and Twitter announced their first takedown of state-linked assets from Iran. Among the 770 Iranian Twitter accounts removed were AWDNews, Al-Waie News, Al-Waqt, and Middle East Press, all of which had played a part in the smear campaign against the UN Special Rapporteur. In November 2020, U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) issued a warrant for seizure of 29 domains for being part of the Liberty Front Press network, the same media network that Meta, Twitter, FireEye, and ClearSky had previously attributed to Iran. In an accompanying affidavit, the DOJ asserted that each of the seized domains was ‘fraudulently registered' due to each being used by or on behalf of the IRGC. AWDNews[.]com was among the seized domains.\n\nDid the perpetrators behind the MOFA breach and the subsequent leak plan the forgery and disinformation campaign ahead of time, or was it an afterthought? The answer is unclear. But the disinformation campaign demonstrates how hack-and-leak events can catalyse cultivating false information to new and existing audiences. Once a breach happens and secrets spill into the public domain, related but fabricated stories become more believable and harder to debunk. Actors with no stake in the previous events may also seize the opportunity to harvest the outcome of hack-and-leaks.\n\nThe same actor(s) may not have been behind the three stages of Saudi Leaks. The forgery may have been devised on the fly. What is established, however, is that Iran's IRGC was behind the disinformation campaign. The manipulation of leaked material signals Iran's interest and capacity in leveraging the output of hack-and-leak events for influencing domestic and international audiences and antagonising Saudi allies.\n\n## Competing hypotheses: a framework for analysis\n\nThe multi-stage nature of the WikiSaudiLeaks event calls for a multi-stage attribution. Thus far, there is only decisive evidence for attributing the forgery to Iran based on Twitter and Facebook takedowns and DOJ's attribution. Yemen Cyber Army's lack of any historical background has bolstered speculations that it was a front for other prominent actors with resources, motives, and ambitions for such an undertaking. The attribution of the MOFA hack and the leaks has remained divergent. As the following passages indicate, existing research points to Iran and Russia as the two main culprits. Other possibilities include Yemeni hackers or a collaboration among different actors. This section considers possible hints for attributing the breach into the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs network and the leaks that ensued.",
    "The breach\n\nThere are two possibilities with regard to the breach of the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The first hypothesis is that Iran breached the ministry's networks. This scenario would be in-line with Iran's involvement in a wider espionage operation that targeted government, military, and critical infrastructure targets across the Middle East between 2013 and 2015.\n\nIn June 2015, cybersecurity firm ClearSky published a report on an operation that had been in progress since mid 2014. ClearSky dubbed the alleged campaign ‘Thamar Reservoir' and pointed out a variety of targets of high interest to Iranian politics. These targets included international relations and defence professionals from Saudi Arabia, Israel, and elsewhere in the Middle East. The campaign utilised a range of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), including social engineering and spear phishing, mostly through Google services. ClearSky attributed Thamar Reservoir with high confidence to Iranian actors due to its considerable similarities of TTPs and overlapping infrastructure with previous operations also attributed to Iranian actors like Rocket Kitten and AjaxTeam.\n\nAnother cybersecurity company, Cylance, dubbed a related campaign ‘Operation Cleaver'. Cleaver included targets from Saudi Arabia's oil and gas and transportation industries in 2013--14. Among the TTPs used in Operation Cleaver, one particularly stands out. The threat actor predominantly used spear phishing to deceive targets to visit a job search website and submit their resumes. The scheme used an imposter of a legitimate professional development service winresume[.]com and its Easy Resume Creator Pro service to lure job candidates to download and install malware TinyZBot. The threat actor attempted to deceive its targets by convincing them they had a pending job opportunity at the industrial group Teledyne, through fake domains such as Teledyne-Jobs[.]com. To know more about the opportunity, the target had to use the malicious resume submission service. One of the Saudi cables later released by WikiLeaks suggests that a threat actor had used this very tactic to breach the Saudi MOFA network months before the May 2015 intrusion.\n\nIn January 2015, Saudi MOFA internally circulated a 14-page incident response report, describing an attack on the ministry's network that had started on 20 July 2014 (10 months before the May 2015 attack). The report, which is included in one of the Saudi cables, indicates that the system administrator of MOFA had received a targeted email with a job opportunity from the fictitious employer Teledyne. The target fell for the scheme and his machine was infected with the TinyZBot malware, which prompted data exfiltration from his device.\n\nThe ministry, however, only noticed the compromise in November 2014, when it detected failed proxy connections between the system admin computer and a suspicious server. 88.150.214.166 was the IP address of the server, which corresponds to that of the malicious domain Teledyne-Jobs[.]com, reportedly created by Iranian hackers. Outed by Cylance's Operation Cleaver report on 2 December 2014, the fake website stopped working on the same day. The MOFA report does not identify the extent of data exfiltration and network impact. But the document repeatedly cites Operation Cleaver, expressly attributing the attack to Iranian actors.\n\nThe public-facing WikiSaudiLeaks event started only in April 2015, but these technical reports put forward an alternative possibility. That is the attackers may have exfiltrated the diplomatic cables from the MOFA network earlier but held onto them until the Yemen conflict began to complicate regional geopolitics. This tactic resembles the hacking of Britam Defense. The company was hacked in November 2012 but the perpetrators held onto the stolen material until January 2013, when a U.S. military strike in Syria seemed looming. This significant time-delay is another indication of a professional intelligence agency tradecraft, as activists or militants likely would have acted more swiftly on a whim.\n\n## Russia\n\nThe Saudi MOFA was of interest to the Russian actors, too. Russia is known to have engaged in reconnaissance and espionage activities against Middle Eastern targets in the spring of 2015.",
    "FANCY BEAR, also known as Sofacy or APT 28, a unit of Russia's military intelligence agency (GRU), reportedly breached the Saudi embassy in Ukraine in February 2015. The exclusive use of this vulnerability by FANCY BEAR until April 2015 has led researchers to entertain the possibility that Russia may also be responsible for the breach of the Saudi MOFA's network in the WikiSaudiLeaks event.\n\nThe attack infrastructure in the GRU campaign also contains noteworthy overlaps with the ominous Yemen Cyber Army. Wikisaleaks, the website ostensibly run by Yemen Cyber Army, was registered on the same range of IP addresses linked to FANCY BEAR in 2015. The address is part of a range of 256 at Lithuanian hosting provider UAB DUOMENU CENTRAS, leased to an intermediary company, MonoVM. The company offers a range of services, including dedicated servers and web hosting. In May 2015, it still accepted a variety of crypto currencies, such as Bitcoin and Skrill, to process transactions. These decentralised methods of payment have been appealing to Russian actors for purchasing the infrastructure for hacking operations. The domain MonoVM[.]com has been registered with a Dubai address, but it appears to be owned or managed by Iranian individuals. The registrant details also include information about another hosting company, Azar Online, registered under the same Persian names. Azar Online appears to be an ISP in Tabriz, the capital of Eastern Azerbaijan province in Iran.\n\nLater disclosures established even more links between MonoVM and Iran. In December 2020, amid then-President Trump and his close allies' allegations of election fraud, a new website emerged with a hit list of U.S. officials that refuted Trump's claims. *Enemies of the People* sought to incite violence and wreak havoc in the United States. The Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) quickly attributed this operation to Iran. One of the associated domains of Enemies of the People website was hosted on MonoVM.\n\nIt is possible that FANCY BEAR used MonoVM, likely an Iranian company, for its espionage operations while masquerading as Yemen Cyber Army. FANCY BEAR has utilised the same technique, known as false flag, with other fronts such as the CyberBerkut and CyberCaliphate -- two GRU front groups that emerged in 2014. An alternative possibility, however, is that other actors, including Iranians, utilised MonoVM services for their purposes around the same time, thus creating a false flag, likely unintentionally.\n\nLater events suggested a third hypothesis. In 2019, another Russian actor, Turla (aka Snake), identified as Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), was detected to have hijacked the technical infrastructure of OilRig, an Iranian threat actor, for espionage attacks in 2017 and early 2018. In October 2019, US and UK intelligence services confirmed that Turla had exploited the command and control and operational infrastructure of Iranian actors to expand its network of victims.\n\nTurla had previously targeted entities in 45 countries in 2015, including governments, military organisations, and research institutions. Most of these victims were located in the Middle East and Europe. There is no evidence for such hijacking of infrastructure prior to 2017. Though it is possible that Turla, or other Russian actors, might have co-opted TTPs of Iranian actors in an effort to further obfuscate attribution for WikiSaudiLeaks. For example, Turla has used a variant of Mimikatz, a commonplace hacking tool used extensively by different actors, which was also previously used by Iranian actors in Operation Cleaver. A fourth possibility could be that the two groups, Iranians and Russians, may have been collaborating in some capacity.\n\n### The leaks\n\nAttribution of the leaks remains challenging, in large part due to limited evidence available on the details of the transfer of Saudi Cables to WikiLeaks and WikiSaudiLeaks websites. This gap is perpetuated by three factors. First, wikisaleaks[.]com was registered on the same IP range as the Russian C2 infrastructure in 2015. Second, yemenica[.]com, the other website of the Yemen Cyber Army, was registered with an email address from the Russian webmail provider, Yandex.",
    "a report from 2019^{120} suggests that two weeks after the release of Saudi Cables in June 2015, WikiLeaks moved its web hosting infrastructure to a new server in Russia. Prior to the transfer, however, the same IP address hosted a fake domain that had been associated with phishing attacks by the Iranian Rocket Kitten until May 2015.^{121} This suggests that WikiLeaks may have collaborated with the Iranian hackers for the intrusion of Saudi MOFA, or coordinated for the transfer of stolen documents. It could also entirely be a coincidence. As with MonoVM, different actors may have used the same infrastructure for their preferred setup and reliability.\n\n## Five vectors for a deconstructed approach to attribution\n\nOur analysis of competing hypotheses illustrates that evidence on the technical, operational, and political aspects of the WikiSaudiLeaks events point to more than a single suspect. In entertaining these hypotheses, we consider a multi-factor framework that includes the history of different actors in undertaking hack-and-leak operations, motivation, messaging, capabilities (technical and otherwise), and infrastructure.^{122} Together, these indicators pave the ground for addressing the question of ‘who did it', with Iran, Russia, or the Yemen Cyber Army as the most likely culprits.\n\n### History\n\nIn assessing a threat actor's history, we first consider past behaviour that tracks with the tradecraft used in the case in question. Out of the three likely culprits, Iran and Russia had previously engaged in computer network exploitation (CNE) against a variety of adversaries, in particular diplomatic targets from the Middle East. Moreover, they both had previously used fictitious fronts in CNE and computer network attack (CNA) operations. Iranian Charming Kitten (APT33) had targeted Saudi Aramco in 2012, posing as the Cutting Sword of Justice and Arab Youth Group.^{123} Russia, too, has a history of using front groups for active measures.^{124} Cyber Berkut was a Russian scheme, posing as an anti-Ukraine hacktivist group to target the websites of NATO and several German officials in March 2014^{125} and January 2015,^{126} respectively. CyberCaliphate, a seemingly ISIS-associated group, breached TV5 Monde, a major French television network with global coverage, resulting in network disruption for hours in April 2015.^{127} The ominous Yemen Cyber Army, however, lacks any history prior to WikiSaudiLeaks, which bolsters the possibility of a front for other more established actors, like Iran or Russia.\n\n### Motivation\n\nSecond, we investigate the motivation which refers to a perpetrator's interest in conducting certain actions in a geopolitical context. WikiSaudiLeaks was a retaliatory response to the Saudis for their intervention in the Yemen conflict. In principle, the Houthi rebels and Iran would have both benefited from the collapse of the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen. While Russia has taken an intermediary role in Yemen to avoid direct conflict, the failure of a key US ally would still serve Russia's political and economic objectives in the region. Moreover, Iran and Russia's decisive intervention in Syria in support of the Assad regime has been met with unwavering opposition from Saudi Arabia and the United States, with either side accusing the other of supporting ‘terrorists'.^{128} The humiliating hack-and-leak events of WikiSaudiLeaks thus serve both Iran and Russia's vengeance toward Saudi Arabia.\n\n### Messaging\n\nThird, we turn to messaging which relates to the semantics and semiotics of the behaviour. The language, signs, and other cues used to communicate with the audience often contain clues about the actor. The WikiSaudiLeaks operators used a consistent anti-Saudi tone in all stages: the hacking of Al-Hayat and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, promoting the leaked material, and the",
    "disinformation campaign. They conveyed resistance to the Saudi intervention in Yemen, with an obvious emphasis on pro-Iranian and pro-Shi'ite sentiments. In addition, the Iranian state media network was the first to systematically cover ‘Saudileaks' in English, weeks before WikiLeaks and other outlets did. At the very least, the zealous communication underscores Iran's vested interest in the incident. This is not to say that the same operators were behind the publication of the leaked material. However, these considerations along with the history and motivation factors skew the attribution assessment toward Iran. Admittedly, some of these details can be manipulated to falsely point in a certain direction and obfuscate attribution. Using a geopolitical cover makes attribution of a false flag operation particularly challenging.^{129}\n\n### Capability\n\nFourth, capability entails the technical expertise, economic and human resources, and enterprising networks of operators and media affiliates that enable a malicious operation. The WikiSaudiLeaks event suggests coordination among a network of operators on different levels, each marshalling a variety of skill sets. Each stage required capabilities that both Iran and Russia demonstrated before. Yet these factors seem far less viable for the Yemen Cyber Army due to its lack of history.\n\n### Infrastructure\n\nLastly, the infrastructure factor concerns the foundations for physical and virtual communication used to deliver a technical capability or maintain the command and control of capabilities.^{130} These structures include electronic devices, servers, domain tools, online services, and social media accounts, to name a few, that attackers can buy, lease, share, compromise, and repurpose to develop their infrastructure. In hack-and-leak operations, the infrastructure for the intrusion may not be the same as what is used for the leak. It is also possible that different actors use the same infrastructure at different points in time.^{131}\n\nAs with WikiSaudiLeaks, possible overlap of infrastructures can significantly impede detection and attribution. The wikisaleaks[.]com domain, one of the websites affiliated with Yemen Cyber Army, was registered at an IP address from likely-Iranian hosting company MonoVM. The IP address also intersected with the Russian infrastructure used to target the Saudi embassy in Ukraine in early 2015. It is entirely plausible, then, that Iranian and Russian actors were using web services offered by the same provider around the same time, hence the overlapping IP addresses. However, it is not possible to determine whether this infrastructure switch was intentional or merely a coincidence.\n\nConsidered together, history, motivation, messaging, capability, and infrastructure provide a framework for examining the competing hypotheses about attribution. Proper synthesis of these details is not possible with the same level of certainty across the WikiSaudiLeaks event. In attributing a multi-stage incident, we propose to assess each stage (the hack and the leak) against these five indicators. Tables 1 and 2 summarise the degree to which each stage of the WikiSaudiLeaks event can be attributed to three likely perpetrators: Yemen Cyber Army, Iran, and Russia.^{132}\n\nAs Tables 1 and 2 indicate, the Yemen Cyber Army has the lowest chance of being a real culprit. Lack of history and information about the group increases the possibility that it may have been a fictitious front for other perpetrators. The network intrusion can be attributed to Iran and Russia with varying degrees of confidence. Attributing the leak is not as straightforward, however. There is limited evidence of politically motivated leaks by Iranian actors unless Iran was indeed behind the attack on Britam Defence in 2013. While Russia has a long history of leaks during the Cold War and the pre-Internet days, there is limited credible evidence on Russia's involvement in cyber-enabled leaks prior to the attack on the DNC in 2016. Other indicators -- such as pro-Iran messaging, subtle cues from wikisaleaks[.]com, and the extensive coverage of the leaks by state-affiliated media early on -- can be taken as the involvement of Iran on some level. Last but not least, Iran is responsible for the forgery and disinformation campaign that came out of the WikiSaudiLeaks event. Overall, Iran scores higher on all three stages than other possible culprits.",

Possible forgeries among the leaked data and plausible false flags add to the complications of attribution. The same actor(s) may not be behind seemingly related events. Distinguishing these actors from one another also comes with particular complexities. In this context, de-layering the attribution process and investigating each layer separately facilitate the assessment. The outcome may be varying degrees of confidence in the attribution of each stage, which in turn helps to identify the gaps in the attribution of digital covert action. The case of WikiSaudiLeaks captures these nuances.\n\nOn the strategic level, attribution remains a political decision based on information collated by intelligence and security agencies or influenced by foreign policy considerations.¹³⁴ It delineates red lines and weighs a set of legitimate responses to the attack.¹³⁵ In the case of WikiSaudiLeaks, affected state parties did not publicly attribute this case. Saudi officials offered little public communication regarding the source of the intrusion. Nor did allies of the kingdom with prominent cyber capabilities, such as the United States, release high level technical or intelligence assessments about WikiSaudiLeaks. Instead, speculative attribution was done by cyber security firms and individual researchers, who lack the authority and means to collect the signal and human intelligence necessary to reliably attribute an attack to a state.¹³⁶\n\nStrategic attribution comes at a cost, politically and logistically. It requires multiple government agencies and often private sector firms working together, often across borders, utilising their intelligence sources and methods. While there is no consistent approach to attributing cyber attacks among states, an incident is more likely to invoke attribution by states if it passes a two-fold test of significance: (1) the nature and severity of the attack, and (2) the affected parties and implications for their national security. In other words, who is targeted and how they are targeted are the key questions that can invoke an attribution response by states and their allies. The closer an attack hits one's home, the more likely that the state gets involved. Thus, the target and severity of cyber-enabled covert action affect the decision to expend resources on public attribution. WikiSaudiLeaks may not have passed this test.\n\nWhy was the campaign not conclusively attributed? First, the forensic evidence did not unambiguously point to a single adversary at any given moment.¹³⁷ Second, the entire event, it appears, was not consequential enough at any given moment in time for the Saudi government to initiate a more determined investigation and response. Lastly, although the attack was politically embarrassing, it seems that it did not constitute a sufficiently severe national security threat to Saudi Arabia to escalate to an international investigation with support from more experienced and capable allies.",
    "Yet WikiSaudiLeaks set an internationally consequential precedent. It was highly likely the first state-enabled hack-and-leak operation that utilised WikiLeaks as an amplifying platform, a tactic that was most notably used just one year later in the most tectonic digital covert campaign of our times, the DNC hack-and-leak. In hindsight, it may have been a strategic shortcoming on the part of the US and UK intelligence communities not to have partnered with Saudi intelligence for a more robust response to WikiSaudiLeaks. Both countries, after all, became the target of Russian and Iranian active measures in the 2016, 2018, and 2019 elections, respectively. The episode nevertheless underscores the significance of coalitions and partnerships, especially if a targeted government does not possess mature capabilities and experience in attribution. WikiSaudiLeaks came before the consolidation of such theories as persistent engagement and defend forward in U.S. cyber strategy. With the benefit of hindsight, the same attack on an ally's integrity today may -- and should -- prompt a more mature response from FiveEyes partners and other open societies.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCovert action is a political instrument. Hack-and-leak incidents may be designed to mess with regional and international politics by ‘inflaming existing contradictions', to use the old Soviet terminology once honed by KGB's Service A, history's most advanced disinformation bureaucracy. Hack-and-leak operations are only technically upgraded iterations of Cold War collect-and-leak operations. Since at least 2013, predominantly authoritarian governments have deployed hack-and-leak operations amid geopolitical crises against a range of adversaries. WikiSaudiLeaks is the pivotal historic example.\n\nThe multi-stage nature of digital covert action requires a multi-stage attribution process. This process extends across technical, operational, and strategic levels. Such all-source analysis must still cut across often hardwearing disciplinary boundaries between the kind of digital forensics commonly used in incident response and threat intelligence reporting and the kind of digital forensics commonly used to investigate influence operations (IO) and disinformation. Moreover, a single confidence score may not be appropriate for multi-stage events. That is, analysis of one stage may produce a degree of confidence that differs from other components of the same event. Worse, in extreme cases different components of what might appear as one campaign can be perpetrated by different actors, even unbeknownst to each other.\n\nWikiSaudiLeaks was strategically designed to inflame contradictions in Saudi Arabia, a party to the Yemen conflict, to wedge open its alliances, and rally international public opinion against the kingdom. The evidence available to us does not allow for definitive attribution for the entire WikiSaudiLeaks event. Instead, a multi-stage all-source investigation offers more details about each component. Each stage requires exploring a different set of forensic artefacts, as well as considering separate tactical, operational, and strategic aspects. The Saudi MOFA-related intrusions could be attributed, based on circumstantial evidence, to either Iran or Russia, possibly even both. The lack of forensic evidence about the provenance of the leaks adds to the challenge of attributing the campaign's exposure stage. However, Iran and Russia remain the most likely culprits, with some circumstantial evidence pointing to Iran. The final stage, the digital disinformation and amplification campaign, can be confidently attributed to Iran, given the abundant evidence exposed by social media companies. A multi-stage event, therefore, requires a multi-stage attribution process -- one that allows for gradients of attribution within each stage.\n\nThere are three non-exclusive explanations for why WikiSaudiLeaks was not attributed with high confidence to a specific adversary. First, the target, in this case Saudi Arabia, did not have sufficient political determination to perform public attribution. Amid the Yemen conflict, the kingdom was intent on minimising attention to the Saudi Cables and staying on message about the unravelling proxy war with Iran. Second, Saudi Arabia and interested third parties -- including the United States -- likely had insufficient incentive to unlock the attributive resources required to link the campaign to a specific adversary. Access to attributive capabilities consists of both access to a range of forensic",
    "artefacts and access to the skills and experience necessary to acquire, develop, cross-reference, process, analyse, contextualise, and interpret relevant signals and artefacts. Finally, the WikiSaudiLeaks campaign exhibited features that made the overall event exceptionally hard to attribute to one specific adversary. It is highly likely that these features were partly intended by at least one adversary, and partly unintended.\n\nMinimising uncertainty is the primary undertaking of attribution. Yet it is a highly complex and nuanced process. Technical forensic artefacts, if inconclusive, must be considered together with other data, obtained from a variety of sources, collected both passively and actively. The delayed nature of attribution further complicates the task. Additional useful details may only become available months or even years later, as our case illustrates, thus rendering early judgements incomplete. False flags, or suspicion thereof, and other challenges can significantly complicate attribution and the response it may require.\n\nAttributing twenty-first century covert action -- integrated campaigns that have a CNE, CNA, and possibly an IO component -- in a nutshell, is an art and a science and, above all, an all-source enterprise and as such vastly different from attributing narrow computer network breaches. In this attribution process, analysts will have to be ready to disentangle some campaigns, assessing, analysing and attributing their respective components -- the hack, forge, leak, amplify -- on their own merits. Attributing one or multiple components may be easy or hard, linking them together is a separate challenge yet. Adversaries, in turn, may take advantage of this layered attribution challenge.\n\nWikiSaudiLeaks came before its time, as the analytic toolsets and the strategic and investigative approaches necessary to understand and attribute this event have continued to mature after the fact. After all, it was only around 2016 that security firms started seriously integrating CNE and IO in their public-facing investigative work, with Mandiant among the first,^{142} and Microsoft^{143} and later Google^{144} following suit. Nor did the US government adopt the strategies of persistent engagement and defend forward until 2018,^{145} three years after WikiSaudiLeaks.\n\nSaudi Cables, in hindsight, was a chameleon that appeared as a different thing against different backdrops: seen in the WikiLeaks context, it appeared as innocent transparency activism; in the website defacement context, it appeared as patriot hacker skirmishes; and viewed against the foil of expanding digital covert action, it appeared as a campaign of at least one authoritarian intelligence agency.\n\n## Notes\n\n1.

This paper revisits one of the most complex, most significant, and most mysterious digital covert actions of our time: a 2015 hack-and-leak case known among investigators as 'WikiSaudiLeaks' that so far has evaded attribution. We argue that WikiSaudiLeaks was not a stand-alone event, but a puzzle piece in a larger covert action campaign that involved advanced computer network exploitation, computer network attack, persistent deception, and a creative influence and disinformation effort. By disintegrating the larger event into its components, limited attribution becomes possible. We present the most detailed and comprehensive investigation of this case to date, attribute at least one component of the larger event to Iranian intelligence, and draw conceptional conclusions.",
