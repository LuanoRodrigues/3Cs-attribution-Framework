Indeed, the more sophisticated the attack, the more sophisticated the attacker, thereby pointing to a state actor as the culprit – or so it is argued. However, Clement Guitton and Elaine Korzak note the lack of clarity and inconsistency around the term 'sophistication', contending that it is context-dependent and therefore that it cannot be used unquestioningly in identifying the perpetrator of a cyber-attack.\n\nWhen in 2010 cyber-security company Kaspersky started examining Stuxnet, a piece of malware that targeted Iranian nuclear centrifuges, it declared that 'Stuxnet's sophistication, purpose and the intelligence behind it suggest the involvement of a state'. Two years later, a New York Times report confirmed these suspicions, exposing Stuxnet as a joint US-Israeli operation. This case set a precedent in considering the sophistication of an attack as a criterion for assessing whether it was sponsored by a state. Thus, when in August 2012 malware called Shamoon infected the computers of Saudi Arabia's national oil company Aramco, US Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta declared in a briefing at the Pentagon that 'the attack on Aramco involved a pretty sophisticated tool. There are only a few countries in the world that have that capability'.\n\nAttribution of cyber-attacks – finding the identity of both the actors behind an attack and their sponsor – is difficult. Yet for a victim state, differentiating criminal attacks from those sponsored\n\nby state actors is essential, as they call for different responses. In one case, the victim state will want to prosecute the criminals. In the other, it may consider an array of diplomatic, economic and even military measures against the state that sponsored the attack. Without attribution, it is difficult to adapt national defence to a threat, let alone respond to it. The importance of attribution and its associated challenges have therefore led many experts to consider a number of criteria for assessing the possibility of state sponsorship, including sophistication. This criterion has considerable appeal, as it seems to be a simple way of making a connection between a cyber-attack and a state actor.\n\nIt is questionable, however, whether sophistication really is an appropriate criterion and it is important to ask how sophistication is being defined.\n\nCountering the current prevailing popularity of sophistication as a determinant of state sponsorship, this article argues that usage of the term reveals a lack of consensus over its definition. Moreover, as non-state actors\n\nhave carried out attacks considered to be sophisticated, the utility of sophistication as a criterion is limited. A survey of the international legal framework governing attribution confirms this finding. Thus, while sophistication may appear to be an appealing criterion for assessing the likelihood of state sponsorship, it is not necessarily an accurate or sufficient one.\n\n# Different Contexts, Different Definitions\n\n## Stuxnet\n\nThe case of Stuxnet set a precedent in the use of sophistication as an indicator of the probability of state sponsorship. Focusing mainly on technical elements, analysts thought that Stuxnet was sophisticated for three reasons.4 First, the malware and its various versions remained undetected for years. Although the first version was probably created in 2005, it was not detected until 2010. Secondly, the malware had only one, very specific target that was not connected to the Internet: the controllers at the Natanz nuclear plant. Different versions\n\n© RUSI JOURNAL AUGUST/SEPTEMBER 2013 VOL. 158 NO. 4 pp. 62-68\n\nDOI: 10.1080/03071847.2013.826509",

            "markdown": "GUITTON AND KORZAK\n\nof the malware were released and the last of these used four zero-day exploits – that is to say, previously undiscovered vulnerabilities in the system. Thirdly, when the malware found its target, it displayed incorrect values of valve pressure and rotation frequency to hide what it was doing – namely, irreversibly damaging the centrifuges. This process required specific and detailed knowledge of the system at the Natanz nuclear plant. Consequently, Kaspersky and other cybersecurity firms considered Stuxnet to be sophisticated because of its stealth, its high number of zero-day exploits and the precise intelligence it necessitated.\n\n# Shamoon\n\nOfficials such as Panetta also considered Shamoon - the malware used to attack Saudi Arabia's national oil company Aramco - to be sophisticated. Applying the very technical definition of 'sophistication' used in the case of Stuxnet to this incident, however, reveals a lack of clarity and consistency.\n\nShamoon attempted to delete files on the computers that it infected, including the master boot record, to prevent the computers from starting again. However, the high visibility of the deletion mechanism quickly brought the attack to the attention of system administrators. Shamoon was therefore not stealthy. Nor was it novel: the deletion mechanism used was from a commercially available product called RawDisk. Lastly, the deletion mechanism did not always work. The mechanism was supposed to replace deleted files with the image of a burning US flag, but the image file was corrupted and only the first line of pixels appeared. If the goal of the attack was 'to stop the flow of oil and gas' - as Aramco's vice president for corporate planning, Abdullah Al-Saadan, believed - Shamoon failed in this regard. These mistakes led Kaspersky to call Shamoon 'quick and dirty'.\n\nAlthough this analysis shows that the technical criteria set by Stuxnet for 'sophistication' do not apply in the case of Shamoon, officials nonetheless considered it to be a sophisticated piece of malware. Such contradictory claims reveal a lack of definitional clarity with regard to the concept. Indeed, the case\n\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\nSaudi Aramco geoscientists and petroleum engineers at the Geosteering Centre in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. Image courtesy of saudiaramco.com.\n\nof Shamoon shows that, in addition to technical elements, sophistication can also be characterised by political elements, and that this broader definition includes the nature of the target and the motivation of the attackers. Additional criteria for sophistication thus include whether the target of the attack can be considered politically sensitive, and whether the attackers have a political objective.\n\nSaudi Arabia's national oil company was a politically sensitive target in the case of Shamoon. Aramco faces fierce competition from other oil companies - state-supported or otherwise - in addition to threats from various political activist movements. The ultimate purpose of the malware may well have been to cause substantial damage to Aramco and to impair its reputation as a secure company. With regard to motives and political objectives, a possible explanation for the attack is that Iran wished to retaliate against the straining sanctions regime that has hit the country - as asserted by an unnamed government official in the Washington Post.[8] A second explanation is that political activists chose Aramco as a symbol of the Saudi Arabian government and its wealth. An Arab activist group called the 'Cutting Sword of Justice' claimed that it targeted Aramco\n\nfor political reasons, as it is the main source of revenue for Saudi Arabia, which it accuses of being involved in 'crimes and atrocities taking place in various countries around the world'.9 To support its claim, it released the IP addresses of all of Aramco's compromised servers, with the date and time of their breach. Aramco confirmed that the data released was accurate. Thus, there is evidence to suggest that on this occasion the motives may have been political.\n\n# The 'Comment Crew'\n\nIn comparison to Stuxnet and Shamoon, which were both considered 'sophisticated', recent attacks on US companies were - perhaps surprisingly - not categorised as 'sophisticated'. In February 2013, the US cyber-security company Mandiant released a widely quoted report in which it identified the Chinese military - also referred to as the 'Comment Crew', or APT1 - as the perpetrator behind hundreds of attacks on mainly US companies.[10] These included one against the Coca-Cola Company, reported three months earlier by Bloomberg,[11] in which the attackers used a variety of malware sent via e-mails designed to entice their victims into opening them and releasing the malware - a technique",

            "markdown": "known as spear-phishing. Despite this, neither of the reports by Mandiant and Bloomberg described the attacks as sophisticated. Similarly, two weeks before the publication of its report, Mandiant was investigating a breach at the New York Times, in co-ordination with the FBI, which followed an extensive report by the newspaper about the wealth of China's then premier, Wen Jiabao. The New York Times later repeatedly pointed to the possible involvement of the Chinese military in the cyber-attack.^{12} Yet again, neither Mandiant nor the New York Times referred to the attacks as being sophisticated.\n\nResponding to the publication of the Mandiant report, which was corroborated by many other intelligence reports, Tom Donilon, the national security adviser to the US president between October 2010 and June 2013, directly confronted China in requesting that its government investigate the allegations and engage in diplomatic discussions. However, in contrast to the reports by Mandiant and the New York Times, Donilon described the attacks as ‘sophisticated'.^{13} It is thus interesting to identify those elements that can account for this discrepancy in assessment.\n\nFirst, the attacks may genuinely have failed to impress analysts on a technical level with regard to stealth, the use of zero-day exploits and intelligence. This, however, may be an unfair depiction, as the attacks were sufficiently stealthy to evade the attention of the main cyber-security companies for years due to the updating of the techniques used. Modularity was therefore a key aspect of the malware. Its delivery, however, remained simple. To deliver the malware, the attackers required a certain amount of limited intelligence on the interests of the targeted individuals. However, unlike the Stuxnet case, such intelligence was easily available and did not require an in-depth understanding of technical systems that had not previously been widely studied (such as SCADA systems, used to control many different industrial processes and the target of the Stuxnet malware).\n\nSecondly, the attacks were an espionage campaign and thus differed from Stuxnet and Shamoon, which respectively aimed at inducing physical damage or destroying information in an attempt to sabotage operations. Therefore, on the part of the technical experts at least, the term ‘sophistication' appears to have been reserved for such sabotage operations, perhaps due to the complexity involved and the vividness and tangibility of the result. The destruction of nuclear centrifuges by Stuxnet and the erasure of data from 30,000 computers by Shamoon are both much more visible and seemingly impressive -- and can perhaps even be considered as more innovative in their goals -- than the ‘mere' leaking of information as a result of a cyber-attack.\n\nThis leads to the third reason for not characterising the attack as sophisticated: by refraining from doing so, Mandiant and the New York Times may have been seeking to create an image of Chinese hackers as less capable and innovative than their US counterparts. In this sense, the choice of words used in publicly describing a cyber-attack reflects a specific selection of its traits. The characterisation of an attack as ‘sophisticated' frames the perception of the enemy as being similarly sophisticated. Recent reports by the US Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Defense have explicitly made this leap from ‘sophisticated attack' to ‘sophisticated attacker',^{14} with several political implications for the response to an attack once attributed. Indeed, this shift can be used to enhance the apparent salience of the threat, facilitating moves towards changes in the regulatory framework, as seen in the renewed effort by the White House to pass cyber-security legislation.\n\nNevertheless, this framing in terms of a ‘sophisticated attacker' is counterproductive when considering the possible suspects behind the attacks. Despite the difficulty of assessing a country's capabilities, analysts try to parse states into categories, such as ‘enemy states with low capabilities' or ‘friendly states with high capabilities'. For example, defining an attack as ‘sophisticated' is likely to restrict the range of suspects and hypotheses under consideration, and thus may skew the analytical process. Attackers can exploit this bias and make effective use of the attribution problem to mislead investigators.\n\nThe analysis of the three case studies -- Stuxnet, Shamoon and the attacks carried out by the Comment Crew -- illustrates the lack of definitional clarity of the term ‘sophistication' and a lack of consistency in its use. In contrast to Stuxnet, the other case studies have shown that the label ‘sophistication' is not contingent upon crossing a technical threshold or fulfilling a specific set of technical criteria -- as also demonstrated by the Mandiant report. Indeed, as in the case of Shamoon, the political nature and targets of the attack may also influence whether it is thought to be sophisticated. Clearly, therefore, different elements play a preponderant role in the assessment of an attack's sophistication depending on the context. Such a lack of definitional consensus warrants clarification in its own right. More importantly, however, because sophistication is increasingly used as a reference point through which to establish the likelihood of state sponsorship, the use of the term can skew the attribution process and its outcome. The following cases illustrate that attacks considered to be sophisticated are not necessarily perpetrated by state actors. This suggests that caution is needed when using sophistication as a criterion in the attribution of a cyber-attack to a state actor.\n\n## Sophisticated Attacks by Criminals\n\nIn the past, high-profile political organisations have been subject to numerous cyber-attacks carried out by criminals, despite the apparent lack of economic value. In particular, in the 1990s there was a series of hacks into US military networks that were first identified as sophisticated due to the political circumstances, with law-enforcement agencies initially thinking that state actors were behind these attacks. However, these were later revealed to be criminal cases.\n\nIn 1991, for example, in the midst of the Gulf War, a group of Dutch students hacked into thirty-four sites including NASA at the Kennedy Space Center, the Pentagon's Pacific Fleet Command and the Lawrence Livermore National",

The words they searched for in the networks – 'military', 'nuclear', 'missile', 'Desert Storm' and 'Desert Shield' – led the US to believe that a foreign intelligence service was behind the attack.[15] In 1994, British teenagers Richard Pryce and Mathew Bevan broke into the computers of NASA, several US Air Force bases and allegedly the defence company Lockheed Martin.[16] In February 1998, during a period of tense relations between the US and Iraq, three teenagers hacked into the US Air Force's networks.[17] Lastly, in 2001, British citizen Gary McKinnon broke into ninety-seven US computers, of which fifty-three belonged to the army, twenty-six to the navy, sixteen to NASA, one to the Department of Defense, and one to the air force.[18] These incidents illustrate that initial characterisations of sophistication involving high-profile political targets do not necessarily imply state sponsorship.\n\nThe aims of these attacks were confined to espionage; however, even in relation to sabotage operations, state actors are not alone in being able to carry out technically sophisticated and devastating attacks. In this way, the current director of national intelligence was inaccurate in his statement before Congress that only state actors can launch 'sophisticated' and 'devastating' attacks capable of inflicting 'long-term, wide-scale disruption of services'.[19] This false distinction between 'sophisticated' and 'non-sophisticated' relies on two equally false assumptions for which Stuxnet set the precedent: that only state actors can collect technical intelligence and that only state actors can appropriately test the malware to fine-tune it.\n\nFirst, state actors are no longer the sole collectors of intelligence. Criminals are highly capable of launching spear-phishing campaigns or using other tools to retrieve confidential information. Most criminals engaged in this type of activity are motivated by financial gain, and are mostly interested in retrieving credit-card data. However, other criminals and criminal groups with more political agendas can use cyber-attacks to gain access to technical intelligence that they would need in preparation for a larger attack. Recently, more tools have emerged that make the\n\ncollection of intelligence even easier: for example, Shodan – a search engine which lists industrial control systems accessible from the Internet. Analysts should therefore not underestimate the capacity of individual criminals and organised criminal groups to acquire technical intelligence on a target in order to orchestrate sophisticated attacks.\n\nSecondly, there is an ongoing debate about the resources required for mounting attacks on industrial control systems, and more specifically, about the resources required to test the malware used to target such systems. On the one hand, David Sanger of the New York Times suggested that the US built a replica of Iran's centrifuges to fine-tune Stuxnet.[20] An attack on industrial control systems needs to override the mechanisms designed to interrupt the process controlled by the computers should they malfunction. The fine-tuning of the malware therefore aims to achieve this without technicians working on the industrial control systems becoming aware of the attacks. On the other hand, many experts think that it is relatively easy to mount and fine-tune attacks on many industrial control systems by replicating only the sensitive parts. For instance, Dale Peterson, a specialist in industrial control systems, concludes that: 'developing an ICS [industrial control system] cyber weapon is simple given a small team and access to the target product'.[21] Nor is it impossible to gain access to such systems. For example, a SCADA system can be smaller than a suitcase, and large manufacturers of such systems, such as Siemens, even lend them to researchers so that they can improve their security. With sufficient organisation, non-state actors can be creative enough to mount such technically sophisticated attacks. Therefore, having studied Stuxnet, political scientists Sean Collins and Stephen McCombie concluded that such attacks are 'open to a number of aggressors, not just nation states'.[22]\n\nThis ongoing debate thus cautions against the assumption that only states can replicate an industrial-control-system environment. Indeed, it would be highly reductionist to think that only state actors have the skills for intelligence\n\ngathering and for mounting a devastating attack. Moreover, experience shows that non-state actors can develop new tactics with which to circumvent national cybersecurity measures, to remain stealthy and to sustain a high pace of attack. The Zeus malware – which creates a botnet, a network of computers controlled by commands issued by the botnet's master – is one such example.\n\nAlthough it does not target industrial control systems, the Zeus malware is comparable to Stuxnet in terms of its technical attributes: it is stealthy, modular and exploits many vulnerabilities. Unlike Stuxnet, however, Zeus was not engineered by a state actor. According to Microsoft, Zeus first appeared in late 2006, and has demonstrated an exceptionally long lifespan, given that it was still highly active in 2012.[23] Throughout this time, the malware's author constantly updated it with new functionalities to evade detection and to help the botnets already created to survive.[24]\n\nThe malware's modularity and resistance to being detected quickly made it popular among criminals with a range of interests, although it remains used primarily in financial fraud. It has become clear that the author of Zeus is a professional at creating, updating and selling the modules that comprise the malware's suite of programmes: he or she sold copies of Zeus under licence, keeping the code private but offering to update it, similar to legitimate software companies.[25] Kevin McNally, a project manager at the US Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command, estimated that the author of the malware might have earned as much as $15 million in licensing fees.[26]\n\nThe Zeus malware follows the technical elements of sophistication mentioned above: it is full of novelties and is effective, stealthy and modular, having proven robust against disruption. Yet it is not the result of a state-sponsored activity. The evidence suggests that the author's purpose in creating the malware is wholly criminal.[27] Thus, simply considering the sophistication of an attack and the malware behind it is insufficient and should not therefore be used to determine state sponsorship.\n\n65",

            "markdown": "A similar conclusion can be reached following a comprehensive survey of the international legal framework, which also suggests that the criterion of sophistication can play only a limited role in assessing state sponsorship.\n\n## Legal Requirements for State Sponsorship\n\nThe ability to attribute a cyber-attack to a state under international law is critically important, as it determines which areas of law an attack invokes. If a state cannot attribute an attack to another state actor, the national laws and in particular the criminal laws of the targeted state apply. In contrast, if a state can impute responsibility for an attack to another state, then international law is applicable. This body of law, broadly speaking, governs relations between states. Thus, if a cyber-attack breaches international law, then the targeted state is entitled under those same laws to take certain measures in response. In exceptional circumstances a state may even resort to the use of force in self defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter, should the breach amount to an ‘armed attack'.^{28} As a result, attribution to a state is critical since the two areas of law -- domestic and international -- entail different response options.\n\nIndividual criteria, such as sophistication, can inform but not determine this assessment of state responsibility, which is instead guided by four longstanding, general norms structured around different categories of state involvement.\n\nFirst, the actions of state organs -- whether individuals or organisational entities -- are attributable to the state in question.^{29} Thus if a targeted state ascertained that a governmental organ -- be it civilian or military -- conducted a cyber-attack, it could hold the state itself responsible under public international law. In addition to this, the actions of persons or entities empowered by national law to exercise some degree of governmental authority are also attributable to a state. This, however, is only the case if the persons or entities are ‘acting in that capacity in the particular instance'.^{30} Independent contractors or privatised corporations entrusted with exercising certain governmental duties fall into this category.\n\nSecondly, and most interestingly, a victim state can also seek to attribute actions that were not undertaken by state organs or entities to another state, provided that the perpetrators acted ‘on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of', that state.^{31} This category encompasses individuals or organisations hired by states to conduct cyber-attacks. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the exact degree of control necessary to be proven for purposes of attribution has turned out to be somewhat problematic. The International Court of Justice set a fairly high standard in the 1984 Contra case involving Nicaragua, in which the government of Nicaragua accused the United States of, among other things, recruiting, organising, paying and commanding a paramilitary group known as the Contras. The Contras sought to subvert the Sandinistas, the socialist party that took power in 1979 in a coup d'état and which was regarded as communist by the US.\n\nThe court examined whether it could legally attribute acts committed by the Contras to the United States based on its involvement, but concluded the ‘financing, organizing, training, supplying and equipping of the contras, the selection of its military or paramilitary targets, and the planning of the whole of its operation' was ‘still insufficient' to legally attribute acts committed by the Contras to the United States.^{32} In this case, state responsibility could not be imputed unless the United States had clearly exerted ‘effective control' over the military and paramilitary operations of the Contras,^{33} suggesting that control of an individual or a group with respect to the overall actions taken is not sufficient. Rather, the state making the allegation needs to show that the accused state had control over or gave instructions with respect to every action in question. Thus, in addition to the challenge of obtaining factual proof of any kind of state involvement, the court set a high standard of ‘effective control' for purposes of legal attribution.^{34}\n\nWhile the Nicaraguan regime's effort to legally attribute the actions of the Contras to the US failed, on a political level it had little doubt about US involvement in supporting the Contras' operations. For instance, the Associated Press reporter Eloy Aguilar wrote in April 1984 that ‘CIA support for the Nicaraguan Democratic Force is evident and openly discussed in Congress'.^{35} Although the court did not establish legal responsibility on the part of the US, it did acknowledge the substantial level of state involvement. However, as the Nicaragua case showed, attribution on a political level does not necessarily equate to state responsibility under international law.\n\nThirdly, even if a targeted state cannot attribute a cyber-attack to another state under the foregoing principles, it may still hold that state responsible if it subsequently ‘acknowledges and adopts the conduct in question as its own'.^{36} For instance, although the initial attack on the United States' embassy in Tehran in 1979 was not attributable to Iran, the subsequent endorsement of the Iranian authorities turned the occupation of the embassy into an act of the Iranian state.\n\nLastly, every state has an ‘obligation to not allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States'.^{37} On this basis a state can be held responsible if it does not take necessary and reasonable measures to prevent or stop a cyber-attack. It is important to note that under this principle a state is only responsible for its failure to stop the attack; it cannot be held legally responsible for the actual attack (provided that the state was not involved in the attack under the foregoing principles).^{38} The lack of technical expertise in certain countries might render the application of this principle a problematic policy option.\n\nConsidering these four principles governing the legal process of attributing an attack to a state, it becomes apparent that the standards necessary for attribution are stringent. The second category in particular -- whether an attack is conducted under the direction or control of a state -- requires proof of ‘effective control' of particular attacks or actions. The level of state involvement required is considerable. As mentioned above, the International Court of Justice regarded even the financing, organising and training of the Contras as insufficient",

For example, in the Oil Platforms case between Iran and the United States – which arose during the 1980–88 Iran-Iraq War – the International Court of Justice ruled in 2003 that the United States had not provided sufficient evidence to prove that Iran was responsible for a 1987 missile attack on a US-flagged tanker, the Sea Isle City.³⁹ The evidence put forward by the United States included satellite imagery of missile sites, expert reports as well as eyewitness testimonies. The standard of evidence required in this case proved to be demanding, although it involved the use of traditional physical force, which often leaves behind a trail of evidence (such as missile sites and other staging grounds, troop movements, or records of the supply of munitions and materiel). In contrast, investigators of cyber-attacks have access only to intangible traces to prove an actor's culpability. Moreover, if the attacks are not conducted by government organs but by individuals or groups directed by a state, the victim state will have to demonstrate that the accused state had 'effective control' in order to impute responsibility to it.\n\nThese high standards incorporated in the legal framework that governs state attribution, coupled with the plausible deniability and veil of anonymity afforded by cyber-attacks, create an international legal landscape of attribution highly unsatisfactory to most policy-makers.\n\nThe challenge of attribution in relation to cyber-attack has led Matthew Hoisington, for instance, to suggest\n\nthat policy-makers should significantly lower the standards of legal attribution, particularly in the case of attacks prompting a response in self-defence. Accordingly, if an attack targets critical national infrastructure, 'a state could respond in presumptively good-faith self-defense without first attributing or characterizing the attack to the level of specificity required under the traditional formulation'.⁴⁰ However, such calls are misplaced. The veil of anonymity and deniability inherent to cyber-attacks is exactly the reason why standards of attribution should remain high, so as to avoid innocent states being accused of conducting cyber-attacks – and being the potential victim of misplaced retaliation. Third parties could also exploit longstanding tensions between states in order to escalate conflict situations.\n\nIn light of the arguably unsatisfactory legal framework of attribution, the popularity of sophistication as a criterion in attributing attacks to a state appears understandable. Yet, as has been shown, attribution in legal terms is assessed based on varying degrees of state involvement. According to the principles mentioned above, a victim state would need to ascertain whether an attack originated from a state organ or whether the state in question was in 'effective control' of the entity conducting the attack. The criterion of sophistication cannot replace these guiding principles of the legal assessment of attribution. Sophistication can only serve as an element of evidence within this framework.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThere is no common understanding of the term 'sophistication' as it is used by prominent political figures or by technical\n\nexperts in the cyber-security debate. By looking at different case studies, this article has identified several technical and political elements that characterise sophistication in each individual context. The lack of clarity and consistency in the use of the term hinders an informed discussion about the significance of sophistication as a criterion for assessing the likelihood of state sponsorship.\n\nFurther, counter-examples have shown that sophistication alone cannot serve as a conclusive determinant in this regard. Sophistication does not necessarily imply state sponsorship — and vice versa. Moreover, the determination of state sponsorship or responsibility in international legal terms follows a different set of criteria based on varying degrees of state involvement. In this framework, sophistication can play only a limited role. It can serve to strengthen or weaken evidence brought forward, but will never constitute a legal criterion in itself. It is therefore important to caution against the significance of sophistication as a seemingly appealing criterion for attribution.\n\nClement Guitton is a PhD candidate in the Department of War Studies at King's College London currently working on the problem of attribution.

Indeed, the more sophisticated the attack, the more sophisticated the attacker, thereby pointing to a state actor as the culprit – or so it is argued. However, Clement Guitton and Elaine Korzak note the lack of clarity and inconsistency around the term 'sophistication', contending that it is context-dependent and therefore that it cannot be used unquestioningly in identifying the perpetrator of a cyber-attack.\nWhen in 2010 cyber-security company Kaspersky started examining Stuxnet, a piece of malware that targeted Iranian nuclear centrifuges, it declared that 'Stuxnet's sophistication, purpose and the intelligence behind it suggest the involvement of a state'. Two years later, a New York Times report confirmed these suspicions, exposing Stuxnet as a joint US-Israeli operation. This case set a precedent in considering the sophistication of an attack as a criterion for assessing whether it was sponsored by a state. Thus, when in August 2012 malware called Shamoon infected the computers of Saudi Arabia's national oil company Aramco, US Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta declared in a briefing at the Pentagon that 'the attack on Aramco involved a pretty sophisticated tool. There are only a few countries in the world that have that capability'.\nAttribution of cyber-attacks – finding the identity of both the actors behind an attack and their sponsor – is difficult. Yet for a victim state, differentiating criminal attacks from those sponsored\nby state actors is essential, as they call for different responses. In one case, the victim state will want to prosecute the criminals. In the other, it may consider an array of diplomatic, economic and even military measures against the state that sponsored the attack. Without attribution, it is difficult to adapt national defence to a threat, let alone respond to it. The importance of attribution and its associated challenges have therefore led many experts to consider a number of criteria for assessing the possibility of state sponsorship, including sophistication. This criterion has considerable appeal, as it seems to be a simple way of making a connection between a cyber-attack and a state actor.\nIt is questionable, however, whether sophistication really is an appropriate criterion and it is important to ask how sophistication is being defined.\nCountering the current prevailing popularity of sophistication as a determinant of state sponsorship, this article argues that usage of the term reveals a lack of consensus over its definition. Moreover, as non-state actors\nhave carried out attacks considered to be sophisticated, the utility of sophistication as a criterion is limited. A survey of the international legal framework governing attribution confirms this finding. Thus, while sophistication may appear to be an appealing criterion for assessing the likelihood of state sponsorship, it is not necessarily an accurate or sufficient one.\n# Different Contexts, Different Definitions\n## Stuxnet\nThe case of Stuxnet set a precedent in the use of sophistication as an indicator of the probability of state sponsorship. Focusing mainly on technical elements, analysts thought that Stuxnet was sophisticated for three reasons.4 First, the malware and its various versions remained undetected for years. Although the first version was probably created in 2005, it was not detected until 2010. Secondly, the malware had only one, very specific target that was not connected to the Internet: the controllers at the Natanz nuclear plant. Different versions\n© RUSI JOURNAL AUGUST/SEPTEMBER 2013 VOL. 158 NO. 4 pp. 62-68\nDOI: 10.1080/03071847.2013.826509\nGUITTON AND KORZAK\nof the malware were released and the last of these used four zero-day exploits – that is to say, previously undiscovered vulnerabilities in the system. Thirdly, when the malware found its target, it displayed incorrect values of valve pressure and rotation frequency to hide what it was doing – namely, irreversibly damaging the centrifuges. This process required specific and detailed knowledge of the system at the Natanz nuclear plant. Consequently, Kaspersky and other cybersecurity firms considered Stuxnet to be sophisticated because of its stealth, its high number of zero-day exploits and the precise intelligence it necessitated.\n# Shamoon\nOfficials such as Panetta also considered Shamoon - the malware used to attack Saudi Arabia's national oil company Aramco - to be sophisticated. Applying the very technical definition of 'sophistication' used in the case of Stuxnet to this incident, however, reveals a lack of clarity and consistency.\nShamoon attempted to delete files on the computers that it infected, including the master boot record, to prevent the computers from starting again. However, the high visibility of the deletion mechanism quickly brought the attack to the attention of system administrators. Shamoon was therefore not stealthy. Nor was it novel: the deletion mechanism used was from a commercially available product called RawDisk. Lastly, the deletion mechanism did not always work. The mechanism was supposed to replace deleted files with the image of a burning US flag, but the image file was corrupted and only the first line of pixels appeared. If the goal of the attack was 'to stop the flow of oil and gas' - as Aramco's vice president for corporate planning, Abdullah Al-Saadan, believed - Shamoon failed in this regard. These mistakes led Kaspersky to call Shamoon 'quick and dirty'.\nAlthough this analysis shows that the technical criteria set by Stuxnet for 'sophistication' do not apply in the case of Shamoon, officials nonetheless considered it to be a sophisticated piece of malware. Such contradictory claims reveal a lack of definitional clarity with regard to the concept. Indeed, the case\nSaudi Aramco geoscientists and petroleum engineers at the Geosteering Centre in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. Image courtesy of saudiaramco.com.\nof Shamoon shows that, in addition to technical elements, sophistication can also be characterised by political elements, and that this broader definition includes the nature of the target and the motivation of the attackers. Additional criteria for sophistication thus include whether the target of the attack can be considered politically sensitive, and whether the attackers have a political objective.\nSaudi Arabia's national oil company was a politically sensitive target in the case of Shamoon. Aramco faces fierce competition from other oil companies - state-supported or otherwise - in addition to threats from various political activist movements. The ultimate purpose of the malware may well have been to cause substantial damage to Aramco and to impair its reputation as a secure company. With regard to motives and political objectives, a possible explanation for the attack is that Iran wished to retaliate against the straining sanctions regime that has hit the country - as asserted by an unnamed government official in the Washington Post.[8] A second explanation is that political activists chose Aramco as a symbol of the Saudi Arabian government and its wealth. An Arab activist group called the 'Cutting Sword of Justice' claimed that it targeted Aramco\nfor political reasons, as it is the main source of revenue for Saudi Arabia, which it accuses of being involved in 'crimes and atrocities taking place in various countries around the world'.9 To support its claim, it released the IP addresses of all of Aramco's compromised servers, with the date and time of their breach. Aramco confirmed that the data released was accurate. Thus, there is evidence to suggest that on this occasion the motives may have been political.\n# The 'Comment Crew'\nIn comparison to Stuxnet and Shamoon, which were both considered 'sophisticated', recent attacks on US companies were - perhaps surprisingly - not categorised as 'sophisticated'. In February 2013, the US cyber-security company Mandiant released a widely quoted report in which it identified the Chinese military - also referred to as the 'Comment Crew', or APT1 - as the perpetrator behind hundreds of attacks on mainly US companies.[10] These included one against the Coca-Cola Company, reported three months earlier by Bloomberg,[11] in which the attackers used a variety of malware sent via e-mails designed to entice their victims into opening them and releasing the malware - a technique\nknown as spear-phishing. Despite this, neither of the reports by Mandiant and Bloomberg described the attacks as sophisticated. Similarly, two weeks before the publication of its report, Mandiant was investigating a breach at the New York Times, in co-ordination with the FBI, which followed an extensive report by the newspaper about the wealth of China's then premier, Wen Jiabao. The New York Times later repeatedly pointed to the possible involvement of the Chinese military in the cyber-attack.^{12} Yet again, neither Mandiant nor the New York Times referred to the attacks as being sophisticated.\nResponding to the publication of the Mandiant report, which was corroborated by many other intelligence reports, Tom Donilon, the national security adviser to the US president between October 2010 and June 2013, directly confronted China in requesting that its government investigate the allegations and engage in diplomatic discussions. However, in contrast to the reports by Mandiant and the New York Times, Donilon described the attacks as ‘sophisticated'.^{13} It is thus interesting to identify those elements that can account for this discrepancy in assessment.\nFirst, the attacks may genuinely have failed to impress analysts on a technical level with regard to stealth, the use of zero-day exploits and intelligence. This, however, may be an unfair depiction, as the attacks were sufficiently stealthy to evade the attention of the main cyber-security companies for years due to the updating of the techniques used. Modularity was therefore a key aspect of the malware. Its delivery, however, remained simple. To deliver the malware, the attackers required a certain amount of limited intelligence on the interests of the targeted individuals. However, unlike the Stuxnet case, such intelligence was easily available and did not require an in-depth understanding of technical systems that had not previously been widely studied (such as SCADA systems, used to control many different industrial processes and the target of the Stuxnet malware).\nSecondly, the attacks were an espionage campaign and thus differed from Stuxnet and Shamoon, which respectively aimed at inducing physical damage or destroying information in an attempt to sabotage operations. Therefore, on the part of the technical experts at least, the term ‘sophistication' appears to have been reserved for such sabotage operations, perhaps due to the complexity involved and the vividness and tangibility of the result. The destruction of nuclear centrifuges by Stuxnet and the erasure of data from 30,000 computers by Shamoon are both much more visible and seemingly impressive -- and can perhaps even be considered as more innovative in their goals -- than the ‘mere' leaking of information as a result of a cyber-attack.\nThis leads to the third reason for not characterising the attack as sophisticated: by refraining from doing so, Mandiant and the New York Times may have been seeking to create an image of Chinese hackers as less capable and innovative than their US counterparts. In this sense, the choice of words used in publicly describing a cyber-attack reflects a specific selection of its traits. The characterisation of an attack as ‘sophisticated' frames the perception of the enemy as being similarly sophisticated. Recent reports by the US Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Defense have explicitly made this leap from ‘sophisticated attack' to ‘sophisticated attacker',^{14} with several political implications for the response to an attack once attributed. Indeed, this shift can be used to enhance the apparent salience of the threat, facilitating moves towards changes in the regulatory framework, as seen in the renewed effort by the White House to pass cyber-security legislation.\nNevertheless, this framing in terms of a ‘sophisticated attacker' is counterproductive when considering the possible suspects behind the attacks. Despite the difficulty of assessing a country's capabilities, analysts try to parse states into categories, such as ‘enemy states with low capabilities' or ‘friendly states with high capabilities'. For example, defining an attack as ‘sophisticated' is likely to restrict the range of suspects and hypotheses under consideration, and thus may skew the analytical process. Attackers can exploit this bias and make effective use of the attribution problem to mislead investigators.\nThe analysis of the three case studies -- Stuxnet, Shamoon and the attacks carried out by the Comment Crew -- illustrates the lack of definitional clarity of the term ‘sophistication' and a lack of consistency in its use. In contrast to Stuxnet, the other case studies have shown that the label ‘sophistication' is not contingent upon crossing a technical threshold or fulfilling a specific set of technical criteria -- as also demonstrated by the Mandiant report. Indeed, as in the case of Shamoon, the political nature and targets of the attack may also influence whether it is thought to be sophisticated. Clearly, therefore, different elements play a preponderant role in the assessment of an attack's sophistication depending on the context. Such a lack of definitional consensus warrants clarification in its own right. More importantly, however, because sophistication is increasingly used as a reference point through which to establish the likelihood of state sponsorship, the use of the term can skew the attribution process and its outcome. The following cases illustrate that attacks considered to be sophisticated are not necessarily perpetrated by state actors. This suggests that caution is needed when using sophistication as a criterion in the attribution of a cyber-attack to a state actor.\n## Sophisticated Attacks by Criminals\nIn the past, high-profile political organisations have been subject to numerous cyber-attacks carried out by criminals, despite the apparent lack of economic value. In particular, in the 1990s there was a series of hacks into US military networks that were first identified as sophisticated due to the political circumstances, with law-enforcement agencies initially thinking that state actors were behind these attacks. However, these were later revealed to be criminal cases.\nIn 1991, for example, in the midst of the Gulf War, a group of Dutch students hacked into thirty-four sites including NASA at the Kennedy Space Center, the Pentagon's Pacific Fleet Command and the Lawrence Livermore National\nGUITTON AND KORZAK\nLaboratory. The words they searched for in the networks – 'military', 'nuclear', 'missile', 'Desert Storm' and 'Desert Shield' – led the US to believe that a foreign intelligence service was behind the attack.[15] In 1994, British teenagers Richard Pryce and Mathew Bevan broke into the computers of NASA, several US Air Force bases and allegedly the defence company Lockheed Martin.[16] In February 1998, during a period of tense relations between the US and Iraq, three teenagers hacked into the US Air Force's networks.[17] Lastly, in 2001, British citizen Gary McKinnon broke into ninety-seven US computers, of which fifty-three belonged to the army, twenty-six to the navy, sixteen to NASA, one to the Department of Defense, and one to the air force.[18] These incidents illustrate that initial characterisations of sophistication involving high-profile political targets do not necessarily imply state sponsorship.\nThe aims of these attacks were confined to espionage; however, even in relation to sabotage operations, state actors are not alone in being able to carry out technically sophisticated and devastating attacks. In this way, the current director of national intelligence was inaccurate in his statement before Congress that only state actors can launch 'sophisticated' and 'devastating' attacks capable of inflicting 'long-term, wide-scale disruption of services'.[19] This false distinction between 'sophisticated' and 'non-sophisticated' relies on two equally false assumptions for which Stuxnet set the precedent: that only state actors can collect technical intelligence and that only state actors can appropriately test the malware to fine-tune it.\nFirst, state actors are no longer the sole collectors of intelligence. Criminals are highly capable of launching spear-phishing campaigns or using other tools to retrieve confidential information. Most criminals engaged in this type of activity are motivated by financial gain, and are mostly interested in retrieving credit-card data. However, other criminals and criminal groups with more political agendas can use cyber-attacks to gain access to technical intelligence that they would need in preparation for a larger attack. Recently, more tools have emerged that make the\ncollection of intelligence even easier: for example, Shodan – a search engine which lists industrial control systems accessible from the Internet. Analysts should therefore not underestimate the capacity of individual criminals and organised criminal groups to acquire technical intelligence on a target in order to orchestrate sophisticated attacks.\nSecondly, there is an ongoing debate about the resources required for mounting attacks on industrial control systems, and more specifically, about the resources required to test the malware used to target such systems. On the one hand, David Sanger of the New York Times suggested that the US built a replica of Iran's centrifuges to fine-tune Stuxnet.[20] An attack on industrial control systems needs to override the mechanisms designed to interrupt the process controlled by the computers should they malfunction. The fine-tuning of the malware therefore aims to achieve this without technicians working on the industrial control systems becoming aware of the attacks. On the other hand, many experts think that it is relatively easy to mount and fine-tune attacks on many industrial control systems by replicating only the sensitive parts. For instance, Dale Peterson, a specialist in industrial control systems, concludes that: 'developing an ICS [industrial control system] cyber weapon is simple given a small team and access to the target product'.[21] Nor is it impossible to gain access to such systems. For example, a SCADA system can be smaller than a suitcase, and large manufacturers of such systems, such as Siemens, even lend them to researchers so that they can improve their security. With sufficient organisation, non-state actors can be creative enough to mount such technically sophisticated attacks. Therefore, having studied Stuxnet, political scientists Sean Collins and Stephen McCombie concluded that such attacks are 'open to a number of aggressors, not just nation states'.[22]\nThis ongoing debate thus cautions against the assumption that only states can replicate an industrial-control-system environment. Indeed, it would be highly reductionist to think that only state actors have the skills for intelligence\ngathering and for mounting a devastating attack. Moreover, experience shows that non-state actors can develop new tactics with which to circumvent national cybersecurity measures, to remain stealthy and to sustain a high pace of attack. The Zeus malware – which creates a botnet, a network of computers controlled by commands issued by the botnet's master – is one such example.\nAlthough it does not target industrial control systems, the Zeus malware is comparable to Stuxnet in terms of its technical attributes: it is stealthy, modular and exploits many vulnerabilities. Unlike Stuxnet, however, Zeus was not engineered by a state actor. According to Microsoft, Zeus first appeared in late 2006, and has demonstrated an exceptionally long lifespan, given that it was still highly active in 2012.[23] Throughout this time, the malware's author constantly updated it with new functionalities to evade detection and to help the botnets already created to survive.[24]\nThe malware's modularity and resistance to being detected quickly made it popular among criminals with a range of interests, although it remains used primarily in financial fraud. It has become clear that the author of Zeus is a professional at creating, updating and selling the modules that comprise the malware's suite of programmes: he or she sold copies of Zeus under licence, keeping the code private but offering to update it, similar to legitimate software companies.[25] Kevin McNally, a project manager at the US Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command, estimated that the author of the malware might have earned as much as $15 million in licensing fees.[26]\nThe Zeus malware follows the technical elements of sophistication mentioned above: it is full of novelties and is effective, stealthy and modular, having proven robust against disruption. Yet it is not the result of a state-sponsored activity. The evidence suggests that the author's purpose in creating the malware is wholly criminal.[27] Thus, simply considering the sophistication of an attack and the malware behind it is insufficient and should not therefore be used to determine state sponsorship.\n65\nA similar conclusion can be reached following a comprehensive survey of the international legal framework, which also suggests that the criterion of sophistication can play only a limited role in assessing state sponsorship.\n## Legal Requirements for State Sponsorship\nThe ability to attribute a cyber-attack to a state under international law is critically important, as it determines which areas of law an attack invokes. If a state cannot attribute an attack to another state actor, the national laws and in particular the criminal laws of the targeted state apply. In contrast, if a state can impute responsibility for an attack to another state, then international law is applicable. This body of law, broadly speaking, governs relations between states. Thus, if a cyber-attack breaches international law, then the targeted state is entitled under those same laws to take certain measures in response. In exceptional circumstances a state may even resort to the use of force in self defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter, should the breach amount to an ‘armed attack'.^{28} As a result, attribution to a state is critical since the two areas of law -- domestic and international -- entail different response options.\nIndividual criteria, such as sophistication, can inform but not determine this assessment of state responsibility, which is instead guided by four longstanding, general norms structured around different categories of state involvement.\nFirst, the actions of state organs -- whether individuals or organisational entities -- are attributable to the state in question.^{29} Thus if a targeted state ascertained that a governmental organ -- be it civilian or military -- conducted a cyber-attack, it could hold the state itself responsible under public international law. In addition to this, the actions of persons or entities empowered by national law to exercise some degree of governmental authority are also attributable to a state. This, however, is only the case if the persons or entities are ‘acting in that capacity in the particular instance'.^{30} Independent contractors or privatised corporations entrusted with exercising certain governmental duties fall into this category.\nSecondly, and most interestingly, a victim state can also seek to attribute actions that were not undertaken by state organs or entities to another state, provided that the perpetrators acted ‘on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of', that state.^{31} This category encompasses individuals or organisations hired by states to conduct cyber-attacks. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the exact degree of control necessary to be proven for purposes of attribution has turned out to be somewhat problematic. The International Court of Justice set a fairly high standard in the 1984 Contra case involving Nicaragua, in which the government of Nicaragua accused the United States of, among other things, recruiting, organising, paying and commanding a paramilitary group known as the Contras. The Contras sought to subvert the Sandinistas, the socialist party that took power in 1979 in a coup d'état and which was regarded as communist by the US.\nThe court examined whether it could legally attribute acts committed by the Contras to the United States based on its involvement, but concluded the ‘financing, organizing, training, supplying and equipping of the contras, the selection of its military or paramilitary targets, and the planning of the whole of its operation' was ‘still insufficient' to legally attribute acts committed by the Contras to the United States.^{32} In this case, state responsibility could not be imputed unless the United States had clearly exerted ‘effective control' over the military and paramilitary operations of the Contras,^{33} suggesting that control of an individual or a group with respect to the overall actions taken is not sufficient. Rather, the state making the allegation needs to show that the accused state had control over or gave instructions with respect to every action in question. Thus, in addition to the challenge of obtaining factual proof of any kind of state involvement, the court set a high standard of ‘effective control' for purposes of legal attribution.^{34}\nWhile the Nicaraguan regime's effort to legally attribute the actions of the Contras to the US failed, on a political level it had little doubt about US involvement in supporting the Contras' operations. For instance, the Associated Press reporter Eloy Aguilar wrote in April 1984 that ‘CIA support for the Nicaraguan Democratic Force is evident and openly discussed in Congress'.^{35} Although the court did not establish legal responsibility on the part of the US, it did acknowledge the substantial level of state involvement. However, as the Nicaragua case showed, attribution on a political level does not necessarily equate to state responsibility under international law.\nThirdly, even if a targeted state cannot attribute a cyber-attack to another state under the foregoing principles, it may still hold that state responsible if it subsequently ‘acknowledges and adopts the conduct in question as its own'.^{36} For instance, although the initial attack on the United States' embassy in Tehran in 1979 was not attributable to Iran, the subsequent endorsement of the Iranian authorities turned the occupation of the embassy into an act of the Iranian state.\nLastly, every state has an ‘obligation to not allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States'.^{37} On this basis a state can be held responsible if it does not take necessary and reasonable measures to prevent or stop a cyber-attack. It is important to note that under this principle a state is only responsible for its failure to stop the attack; it cannot be held legally responsible for the actual attack (provided that the state was not involved in the attack under the foregoing principles).^{38} The lack of technical expertise in certain countries might render the application of this principle a problematic policy option.\nConsidering these four principles governing the legal process of attributing an attack to a state, it becomes apparent that the standards necessary for attribution are stringent. The second category in particular -- whether an attack is conducted under the direction or control of a state -- requires proof of ‘effective control' of particular attacks or actions. The level of state involvement required is considerable. As mentioned above, the International Court of Justice regarded even the financing, organising and training of the Contras as insufficient\nGUITTON AND KORZAK\ninvolvement to legally attribute the acts of the group to the United States.\nIn addition, the standard of factual evidence required to prove state involvement can likewise pose significant challenges. For example, in the Oil Platforms case between Iran and the United States – which arose during the 1980–88 Iran-Iraq War – the International Court of Justice ruled in 2003 that the United States had not provided sufficient evidence to prove that Iran was responsible for a 1987 missile attack on a US-flagged tanker, the Sea Isle City.³⁹ The evidence put forward by the United States included satellite imagery of missile sites, expert reports as well as eyewitness testimonies. The standard of evidence required in this case proved to be demanding, although it involved the use of traditional physical force, which often leaves behind a trail of evidence (such as missile sites and other staging grounds, troop movements, or records of the supply of munitions and materiel). In contrast, investigators of cyber-attacks have access only to intangible traces to prove an actor's culpability. Moreover, if the attacks are not conducted by government organs but by individuals or groups directed by a state, the victim state will have to demonstrate that the accused state had 'effective control' in order to impute responsibility to it.\nThese high standards incorporated in the legal framework that governs state attribution, coupled with the plausible deniability and veil of anonymity afforded by cyber-attacks, create an international legal landscape of attribution highly unsatisfactory to most policy-makers.\nThe challenge of attribution in relation to cyber-attack has led Matthew Hoisington, for instance, to suggest\nthat policy-makers should significantly lower the standards of legal attribution, particularly in the case of attacks prompting a response in self-defence. Accordingly, if an attack targets critical national infrastructure, 'a state could respond in presumptively good-faith self-defense without first attributing or characterizing the attack to the level of specificity required under the traditional formulation'.⁴⁰ However, such calls are misplaced. The veil of anonymity and deniability inherent to cyber-attacks is exactly the reason why standards of attribution should remain high, so as to avoid innocent states being accused of conducting cyber-attacks – and being the potential victim of misplaced retaliation. Third parties could also exploit longstanding tensions between states in order to escalate conflict situations.\nIn light of the arguably unsatisfactory legal framework of attribution, the popularity of sophistication as a criterion in attributing attacks to a state appears understandable. Yet, as has been shown, attribution in legal terms is assessed based on varying degrees of state involvement. According to the principles mentioned above, a victim state would need to ascertain whether an attack originated from a state organ or whether the state in question was in 'effective control' of the entity conducting the attack. The criterion of sophistication cannot replace these guiding principles of the legal assessment of attribution. Sophistication can only serve as an element of evidence within this framework.\n## Conclusion\nThere is no common understanding of the term 'sophistication' as it is used by prominent political figures or by technical\nexperts in the cyber-security debate. By looking at different case studies, this article has identified several technical and political elements that characterise sophistication in each individual context. The lack of clarity and consistency in the use of the term hinders an informed discussion about the significance of sophistication as a criterion for assessing the likelihood of state sponsorship.\nFurther, counter-examples have shown that sophistication alone cannot serve as a conclusive determinant in this regard. Sophistication does not necessarily imply state sponsorship — and vice versa. Moreover, the determination of state sponsorship or responsibility in international legal terms follows a different set of criteria based on varying degrees of state involvement. In this framework, sophistication can play only a limited role. It can serve to strengthen or weaken evidence brought forward, but will never constitute a legal criterion in itself. It is therefore important to caution against the significance of sophistication as a seemingly appealing criterion for attribution.\nClement Guitton is a PhD candidate in the Department of War Studies at King's College London currently working on the problem of attribution.

Indeed, the more sophisticated the attack, the more sophisticated the attacker, thereby pointing to a state actor as the culprit – or so it is argued. However, Clement Guitton and Elaine Korzak note the lack of clarity and inconsistency around the term 'sophistication', contending that it is context-dependent and therefore that it cannot be used unquestioningly in identifying the perpetrator of a cyber-attack.\nWhen in 2010 cyber-security company Kaspersky started examining Stuxnet, a piece of malware that targeted Iranian nuclear centrifuges, it declared that 'Stuxnet's sophistication, purpose and the intelligence behind it suggest the involvement of a state'. Two years later, a New York Times report confirmed these suspicions, exposing Stuxnet as a joint US-Israeli operation. This case set a precedent in considering the sophistication of an attack as a criterion for assessing whether it was sponsored by a state. Thus, when in August 2012 malware called Shamoon infected the computers of Saudi Arabia's national oil company Aramco, US Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta declared in a briefing at the Pentagon that 'the attack on Aramco involved a pretty sophisticated tool. There are only a few countries in the world that have that capability'.\nAttribution of cyber-attacks – finding the identity of both the actors behind an attack and their sponsor – is difficult. Yet for a victim state, differentiating criminal attacks from those sponsored by state actors is essential, as they call for different responses. In one case, the victim state will want to prosecute the criminals. In the other, it may consider an array of diplomatic, economic and even military measures against the state that sponsored the attack. Without attribution, it is difficult to adapt national defence to a threat, let alone respond to it. The importance of attribution and its associated challenges have therefore led many experts to consider a number of criteria for assessing the possibility of state sponsorship, including sophistication. This criterion has considerable appeal, as it seems to be a simple way of making a connection between a cyber-attack and a state actor.\nIt is questionable, however, whether sophistication really is an appropriate criterion and it is important to ask how sophistication is being defined.\nCountering the current prevailing popularity of sophistication as a determinant of state sponsorship, this article argues that usage of the term reveals a lack of consensus over its definition. Moreover, as non-state actors have carried out attacks considered to be sophisticated, the utility of sophistication as a criterion is limited. A survey of the international legal framework governing attribution confirms this finding. Thus, while sophistication may appear to be an appealing criterion for assessing the likelihood of state sponsorship, it is not necessarily an accurate or sufficient one.\n# Different Contexts, Different Definitions ## Stuxnet The case of Stuxnet set a precedent in the use of sophistication as an indicator of the probability of state sponsorship. Focusing mainly on technical elements, analysts thought that Stuxnet was sophisticated for three reasons.4 First, the malware and its various versions remained undetected for years. Although the first version was probably created in 2005, it was not detected until 2010. Secondly, the malware had only one, very specific target that was not connected to the Internet: the controllers at the Natanz nuclear plant. Different versions © RUSI JOURNAL AUGUST/SEPTEMBER 2013 VOL. 158 NO. 4 pp. 62-68 DOI: 10.1080/03071847.2013.826509 GUITTON AND KORZAK of the malware were released and the last of these used four zero-day exploits – that is to say, previously undiscovered vulnerabilities in the system. Thirdly, when the malware found its target, it displayed incorrect values of valve pressure and rotation frequency to hide what it was doing – namely, irreversibly damaging the centrifuges. This process required specific and detailed knowledge of the system at the Natanz nuclear plant. Consequently, Kaspersky and other cybersecurity firms considered Stuxnet to be sophisticated because of its stealth, its high number of zero-day exploits and the precise intelligence it necessitated.\n# Shamoon Officials such as Panetta also considered Shamoon - the malware used to attack Saudi Arabia's national oil company Aramco - to be sophisticated. Applying the very technical definition of 'sophistication' used in the case of Stuxnet to this incident, however, reveals a lack of clarity and consistency.\nShamoon attempted to delete files on the computers that it infected, including the master boot record, to prevent the computers from starting again. However, the high visibility of the deletion mechanism quickly brought the attack to the attention of system administrators. Shamoon was therefore not stealthy. Nor was it novel: the deletion mechanism used was from a commercially available product called RawDisk. Lastly, the deletion mechanism did not always work. The mechanism was supposed to replace deleted files with the image of a burning US flag, but the image file was corrupted and only the first line of pixels appeared. If the goal of the attack was 'to stop the flow of oil and gas' - as Aramco's vice president for corporate planning, Abdullah Al-Saadan, believed - Shamoon failed in this regard. These mistakes led Kaspersky to call Shamoon 'quick and dirty'.\nAlthough this analysis shows that the technical criteria set by Stuxnet for 'sophistication' do not apply in the case of Shamoon, officials nonetheless considered it to be a sophisticated piece of malware. Such contradictory claims reveal a lack of definitional clarity with regard to the concept. Indeed, the case Saudi Aramco geoscientists and petroleum engineers at the Geosteering Centre in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. Image courtesy of saudiaramco.com.\nof Shamoon shows that, in addition to technical elements, sophistication can also be characterised by political elements, and that this broader definition includes the nature of the target and the motivation of the attackers. Additional criteria for sophistication thus include whether the target of the attack can be considered politically sensitive, and whether the attackers have a political objective.\nSaudi Arabia's national oil company was a politically sensitive target in the case of Shamoon. Aramco faces fierce competition from other oil companies - state-supported or otherwise - in addition to threats from various political activist movements. The ultimate purpose of the malware may well have been to cause substantial damage to Aramco and to impair its reputation as a secure company. With regard to motives and political objectives, a possible explanation for the attack is that Iran wished to retaliate against the straining sanctions regime that has hit the country - as asserted by an unnamed government official in the Washington Post.[8] A second explanation is that political activists chose Aramco as a symbol of the Saudi Arabian government and its wealth. An Arab activist group called the 'Cutting Sword of Justice' claimed that it targeted Aramco for political reasons, as it is the main source of revenue for Saudi Arabia, which it accuses of being involved in 'crimes and atrocities taking place in various countries around the world'.9 To support its claim, it released the IP addresses of all of Aramco's compromised servers, with the date and time of their breach. Aramco confirmed that the data released was accurate. Thus, there is evidence to suggest that on this occasion the motives may have been political.\n# The 'Comment Crew' In comparison to Stuxnet and Shamoon, which were both considered 'sophisticated', recent attacks on US companies were - perhaps surprisingly - not categorised as 'sophisticated'. In February 2013, the US cyber-security company Mandiant released a widely quoted report in which it identified the Chinese military - also referred to as the 'Comment Crew', or APT1 - as the perpetrator behind hundreds of attacks on mainly US companies.[10] These included one against the Coca-Cola Company, reported three months earlier by Bloomberg,[11] in which the attackers used a variety of malware sent via e-mails designed to entice their victims into opening them and releasing the malware - a technique known as spear-phishing. Despite this, neither of the reports by Mandiant and Bloomberg described the attacks as sophisticated. Similarly, two weeks before the publication of its report, Mandiant was investigating a breach at the New York Times, in co-ordination with the FBI, which followed an extensive report by the newspaper about the wealth of China's then premier, Wen Jiabao. The New York Times later repeatedly pointed to the possible involvement of the Chinese military in the cyber-attack. Yet again, neither Mandiant nor the New York Times referred to the attacks as being sophisticated.\nResponding to the publication of the Mandiant report, which was corroborated by many other intelligence reports, Tom Donilon, the national security adviser to the US president between October 2010 and June 2013, directly confronted China in requesting that its government investigate the allegations and engage in diplomatic discussions. However, in contrast to the reports by Mandiant and the New York Times, Donilon described the attacks as ‘sophisticated'. It is thus interesting to identify those elements that can account for this discrepancy in assessment.\nFirst, the attacks may genuinely have failed to impress analysts on a technical level with regard to stealth, the use of zero-day exploits and intelligence. This, however, may be an unfair depiction, as the attacks were sufficiently stealthy to evade the attention of the main cyber-security companies for years due to the updating of the techniques used. Modularity was therefore a key aspect of the malware. Its delivery, however, remained simple. To deliver the malware, the attackers required a certain amount of limited intelligence on the interests of the targeted individuals. However, unlike the Stuxnet case, such intelligence was easily available and did not require an in-depth understanding of technical systems that had not previously been widely studied (such as SCADA systems, used to control many different industrial processes and the target of the Stuxnet malware).\nSecondly, the attacks were an espionage campaign and thus differed from Stuxnet and Shamoon, which respectively aimed at inducing physical damage or destroying information in an attempt to sabotage operations. Therefore, on the part of the technical experts at least, the term ‘sophistication' appears to have been reserved for such sabotage operations, perhaps due to the complexity involved and the vividness and tangibility of the result. The destruction of nuclear centrifuges by Stuxnet and the erasure of data from 30,000 computers by Shamoon are both much more visible and seemingly impressive -- and can perhaps even be considered as more innovative in their goals -- than the ‘mere' leaking of information as a result of a cyber-attack.\nThis leads to the third reason for not characterising the attack as sophisticated: by refraining from doing so, Mandiant and the New York Times may have been seeking to create an image of Chinese hackers as less capable and innovative than their US counterparts. In this sense, the choice of words used in publicly describing a cyber-attack reflects a specific selection of its traits. The characterisation of an attack as ‘sophisticated' frames the perception of the enemy as being similarly sophisticated. Recent reports by the US Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Defense have explicitly made this leap from ‘sophisticated attack' to ‘sophisticated attacker', with several political implications for the response to an attack once attributed. Indeed, this shift can be used to enhance the apparent salience of the threat, facilitating moves towards changes in the regulatory framework, as seen in the renewed effort by the White House to pass cyber-security legislation.\nNevertheless, this framing in terms of a ‘sophisticated attacker' is counterproductive when considering the possible suspects behind the attacks. Despite the difficulty of assessing a country's capabilities, analysts try to parse states into categories, such as ‘enemy states with low capabilities' or ‘friendly states with high capabilities'. For example, defining an attack as ‘sophisticated' is likely to restrict the range of suspects and hypotheses under consideration, and thus may skew the analytical process. Attackers can exploit this bias and make effective use of the attribution problem to mislead investigators.\nThe analysis of the three case studies -- Stuxnet, Shamoon and the attacks carried out by the Comment Crew -- illustrates the lack of definitional clarity of the term ‘sophistication' and a lack of consistency in its use. In contrast to Stuxnet, the other case studies have shown that the label ‘sophistication' is not contingent upon crossing a technical threshold or fulfilling a specific set of technical criteria -- as also demonstrated by the Mandiant report. Indeed, as in the case of Shamoon, the political nature and targets of the attack may also influence whether it is thought to be sophisticated. Clearly, therefore, different elements play a preponderant role in the assessment of an attack's sophistication depending on the context. Such a lack of definitional consensus warrants clarification in its own right. More importantly, however, because sophistication is increasingly used as a reference point through which to establish the likelihood of state sponsorship, the use of the term can skew the attribution process and its outcome. The following cases illustrate that attacks considered to be sophisticated are not necessarily perpetrated by state actors. This suggests that caution is needed when using sophistication as a criterion in the attribution of a cyber-attack to a state actor.\n## Sophisticated Attacks by Criminals In the past, high-profile political organisations have been subject to numerous cyber-attacks carried out by criminals, despite the apparent lack of economic value. In particular, in the 1990s there was a series of hacks into US military networks that were first identified as sophisticated due to the political circumstances, with law-enforcement agencies initially thinking that state actors were behind these attacks. However, these were later revealed to be criminal cases.\nIn 1991, for example, in the midst of the Gulf War, a group of Dutch students hacked into thirty-four sites including NASA at the Kennedy Space Center, the Pentagon's Pacific Fleet Command and the Lawrence Livermore National GUITTON AND KORZAK Laboratory. The words they searched for in the networks – 'military', 'nuclear', 'missile', 'Desert Storm' and 'Desert Shield' – led the US to believe that a foreign intelligence service was behind the attack.[15] In 1994, British teenagers Richard Pryce and Mathew Bevan broke into the computers of NASA, several US Air Force bases and allegedly the defence company Lockheed Martin.[16] In February 1998, during a period of tense relations between the US and Iraq, three teenagers hacked into the US Air Force's networks.[17] Lastly, in 2001, British citizen Gary McKinnon broke into ninety-seven US computers, of which fifty-three belonged to the army, twenty-six to the navy, sixteen to NASA, one to the Department of Defense, and one to the air force.[18] These incidents illustrate that initial characterisations of sophistication involving high-profile political targets do not necessarily imply state sponsorship.\nThe aims of these attacks were confined to espionage; however, even in relation to sabotage operations, state actors are not alone in being able to carry out technically sophisticated and devastating attacks. In this way, the current director of national intelligence was inaccurate in his statement before Congress that only state actors can launch 'sophisticated' and 'devastating' attacks capable of inflicting 'long-term, wide-scale disruption of services'.[19] This false distinction between 'sophisticated' and 'non-sophisticated' relies on two equally false assumptions for which Stuxnet set the precedent: that only state actors can collect technical intelligence and that only state actors can appropriately test the malware to fine-tune it.\nFirst, state actors are no longer the sole collectors of intelligence. Criminals are highly capable of launching spear-phishing campaigns or using other tools to retrieve confidential information. Most criminals engaged in this type of activity are motivated by financial gain, and are mostly interested in retrieving credit-card data. However, other criminals and criminal groups with more political agendas can use cyber-attacks to gain access to technical intelligence that they would need in preparation for a larger attack. Recently, more tools have emerged that make the collection of intelligence even easier: for example, Shodan – a search engine which lists industrial control systems accessible from the Internet. Analysts should therefore not underestimate the capacity of individual criminals and organised criminal groups to acquire technical intelligence on a target in order to orchestrate sophisticated attacks.\nSecondly, there is an ongoing debate about the resources required for mounting attacks on industrial control systems, and more specifically, about the resources required to test the malware used to target such systems. On the one hand, David Sanger of the New York Times suggested that the US built a replica of Iran's centrifuges to fine-tune Stuxnet.[20] An attack on industrial control systems needs to override the mechanisms designed to interrupt the process controlled by the computers should they malfunction. The fine-tuning of the malware therefore aims to achieve this without technicians working on the industrial control systems becoming aware of the attacks. On the other hand, many experts think that it is relatively easy to mount and fine-tune attacks on many industrial control systems by replicating only the sensitive parts. For instance, Dale Peterson, a specialist in industrial control systems, concludes that: 'developing an ICS [industrial control system] cyber weapon is simple given a small team and access to the target product'.[21] Nor is it impossible to gain access to such systems. For example, a SCADA system can be smaller than a suitcase, and large manufacturers of such systems, such as Siemens, even lend them to researchers so that they can improve their security. With sufficient organisation, non-state actors can be creative enough to mount such technically sophisticated attacks. Therefore, having studied Stuxnet, political scientists Sean Collins and Stephen McCombie concluded that such attacks are 'open to a number of aggressors, not just nation states'.[22] This ongoing debate thus cautions against the assumption that only states can replicate an industrial-control-system environment. Indeed, it would be highly reductionist to think that only state actors have the skills for intelligence gathering and for mounting a devastating attack. Moreover, experience shows that non-state actors can develop new tactics with which to circumvent national cybersecurity measures, to remain stealthy and to sustain a high pace of attack. The Zeus malware – which creates a botnet, a network of computers controlled by commands issued by the botnet's master – is one such example.\nAlthough it does not target industrial control systems, the Zeus malware is comparable to Stuxnet in terms of its technical attributes: it is stealthy, modular and exploits many vulnerabilities. Unlike Stuxnet, however, Zeus was not engineered by a state actor. According to Microsoft, Zeus first appeared in late 2006, and has demonstrated an exceptionally long lifespan, given that it was still highly active in 2012.[23] Throughout this time, the malware's author constantly updated it with new functionalities to evade detection and to help the botnets already created to survive.[24] The malware's modularity and resistance to being detected quickly made it popular among criminals with a range of interests, although it remains used primarily in financial fraud. It has become clear that the author of Zeus is a professional at creating, updating and selling the modules that comprise the malware's suite of programmes: he or she sold copies of Zeus under licence, keeping the code private but offering to update it, similar to legitimate software companies.[25] Kevin McNally, a project manager at the US Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command, estimated that the author of the malware might have earned as much as $15 million in licensing fees.[26] The Zeus malware follows the technical elements of sophistication mentioned above: it is full of novelties and is effective, stealthy and modular, having proven robust against disruption. Yet it is not the result of a state-sponsored activity. The evidence suggests that the author's purpose in creating the malware is wholly criminal.[27] Thus, simply considering the sophistication of an attack and the malware behind it is insufficient and should not therefore be used to determine state sponsorship.\n\n## Legal Requirements for State Sponsorship\nThe ability to attribute a cyber-attack to a state under international law is critically important, as it determines which areas of law an attack invokes. If a state cannot attribute an attack to another state actor, the national laws and in particular the criminal laws of the targeted state apply. In contrast, if a state can impute responsibility for an attack to another state, then international law is applicable. This body of law, broadly speaking, governs relations between states. Thus, if a cyber-attack breaches international law, then the targeted state is entitled under those same laws to take certain measures in response. In exceptional circumstances a state may even resort to the use of force in self defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter, should the breach amount to an ‘armed attack'.^{28} As a result, attribution to a state is critical since the two areas of law -- domestic and international -- entail different response options.\nIndividual criteria, such as sophistication, can inform but not determine this assessment of state responsibility, which is instead guided by four longstanding, general norms structured around different categories of state involvement.\nFirst, the actions of state organs -- whether individuals or organisational entities -- are attributable to the state in question.^{29} Thus if a targeted state ascertained that a governmental organ -- be it civilian or military -- conducted a cyber-attack, it could hold the state itself responsible under public international law. In addition to this, the actions of persons or entities empowered by national law to exercise some degree of governmental authority are also attributable to a state. This, however, is only the case if the persons or entities are ‘acting in that capacity in the particular instance'.^{30} Independent contractors or privatised corporations entrusted with exercising certain governmental duties fall into this category.\nSecondly, and most interestingly, a victim state can also seek to attribute actions that were not undertaken by state organs or entities to another state, provided that the perpetrators acted ‘on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of', that state.^{31} This category encompasses individuals or organisations hired by states to conduct cyber-attacks. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the exact degree of control necessary to be proven for purposes of attribution has turned out to be somewhat problematic. The International Court of Justice set a fairly high standard in the 1984 Contra case involving Nicaragua, in which the government of Nicaragua accused the United States of, among other things, recruiting, organising, paying and commanding a paramilitary group known as the Contras. The Contras sought to subvert the Sandinistas, the socialist party that took power in 1979 in a coup d'état and which was regarded as communist by the US.\nThe court examined whether it could legally attribute acts committed by the Contras to the United States based on its involvement, but concluded the ‘financing, organizing, training, supplying and equipping of the contras, the selection of its military or paramilitary targets, and the planning of the whole of its operation' was ‘still insufficient' to legally attribute acts committed by the Contras to the United States.^{32} In this case, state responsibility could not be imputed unless the United States had clearly exerted ‘effective control' over the military and paramilitary operations of the Contras,^{33} suggesting that control of an individual or a group with respect to the overall actions taken is not sufficient. Rather, the state making the allegation needs to show that the accused state had control over or gave instructions with respect to every action in question. Thus, in addition to the challenge of obtaining factual proof of any kind of state involvement, the court set a high standard of ‘effective control' for purposes of legal attribution.^{34}\nWhile the Nicaraguan regime's effort to legally attribute the actions of the Contras to the US failed, on a political level it had little doubt about US involvement in supporting the Contras' operations. For instance, the Associated Press reporter Eloy Aguilar wrote in April 1984 that ‘CIA support for the Nicaraguan Democratic Force is evident and openly discussed in Congress'.^{35} Although the court did not establish legal responsibility on the part of the US, it did acknowledge the substantial level of state involvement. However, as the Nicaragua case showed, attribution on a political level does not necessarily equate to state responsibility under international law.\nThirdly, even if a targeted state cannot attribute a cyber-attack to another state under the foregoing principles, it may still hold that state responsible if it subsequently ‘acknowledges and adopts the conduct in question as its own'.^{36} For instance, although the initial attack on the United States' embassy in Tehran in 1979 was not attributable to Iran, the subsequent endorsement of the Iranian authorities turned the occupation of the embassy into an act of the Iranian state.\nLastly, every state has an ‘obligation to not allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States'.^{37} On this basis a state can be held responsible if it does not take necessary and reasonable measures to prevent or stop a cyber-attack. It is important to note that under this principle a state is only responsible for its failure to stop the attack; it cannot be held legally responsible for the actual attack (provided that the state was not involved in the attack under the foregoing principles).^{38} The lack of technical expertise in certain countries might render the application of this principle a problematic policy option.\nConsidering these four principles governing the legal process of attributing an attack to a state, it becomes apparent that the standards necessary for attribution are stringent. The second category in particular -- whether an attack is conducted under the direction or control of a state -- requires proof of ‘effective control' of particular attacks or actions. The level of state involvement required is considerable. As mentioned above, the International Court of Justice regarded even the financing, organising and training of the Contras as insufficient\nGUITTON AND KORZAK\ninvolvement to legally attribute the acts of the group to the United States.\nIn addition, the standard of factual evidence required to prove state involvement can likewise pose significant challenges. For example, in the Oil Platforms case between Iran and the United States – which arose during the 1980–88 Iran-Iraq War – the International Court of Justice ruled in 2003 that the United States had not provided sufficient evidence to prove that Iran was responsible for a 1987 missile attack on a US-flagged tanker, the Sea Isle City.³⁹ The evidence put forward by the United States included satellite imagery of missile sites, expert reports as well as eyewitness testimonies. The standard of evidence required in this case proved to be demanding, although it involved the use of traditional physical force, which often leaves behind a trail of evidence (such as missile sites and other staging grounds, troop movements, or records of the supply of munitions and materiel). In contrast, investigators of cyber-attacks have access only to intangible traces to prove an actor's culpability. Moreover, if the attacks are not conducted by government organs but by individuals or groups directed by a state, the victim state will have to demonstrate that the accused state had 'effective control' in order to impute responsibility to it.\nThese high standards incorporated in the legal framework that governs state attribution, coupled with the plausible deniability and veil of anonymity afforded by cyber-attacks, create an international legal landscape of attribution highly unsatisfactory to most policy-makers.\nThe challenge of attribution in relation to cyber-attack has led Matthew Hoisington, for instance, to suggest\nthat policy-makers should significantly lower the standards of legal attribution, particularly in the case of attacks prompting a response in self-defence. Accordingly, if an attack targets critical national infrastructure, 'a state could respond in presumptively good-faith self-defense without first attributing or characterizing the attack to the level of specificity required under the traditional formulation'.⁴⁰ However, such calls are misplaced. The veil of anonymity and deniability inherent to cyber-attacks is exactly the reason why standards of attribution should remain high, so as to avoid innocent states being accused of conducting cyber-attacks – and being the potential victim of misplaced retaliation. Third parties could also exploit longstanding tensions between states in order to escalate conflict situations.\nIn light of the arguably unsatisfactory legal framework of attribution, the popularity of sophistication as a criterion in attributing attacks to a state appears understandable. Yet, as has been shown, attribution in legal terms is assessed based on varying degrees of state involvement. According to the principles mentioned above, a victim state would need to ascertain whether an attack originated from a state organ or whether the state in question was in 'effective control' of the entity conducting the attack. The criterion of sophistication cannot replace these guiding principles of the legal assessment of attribution. Sophistication can only serve as an element of evidence within this framework.\n## Conclusion\nThere is no common understanding of the term 'sophistication' as it is used by prominent political figures or by technical\nexperts in the cyber-security debate. By looking at different case studies, this article has identified several technical and political elements that characterise sophistication in each individual context. The lack of clarity and consistency in the use of the term hinders an informed discussion about the significance of sophistication as a criterion for assessing the likelihood of state sponsorship.\nFurther, counter-examples have shown that sophistication alone cannot serve as a conclusive determinant in this regard. Sophistication does not necessarily imply state sponsorship — and vice versa. Moreover, the determination of state sponsorship or responsibility in international legal terms follows a different set of criteria based on varying degrees of state involvement. In this framework, sophistication can play only a limited role. It can serve to strengthen or weaken evidence brought forward, but will never constitute a legal criterion in itself. It is therefore important to caution against the significance of sophistication as a seemingly appealing criterion for attribution.\nClement Guitton is a PhD candidate in the Department of War Studies at King's College London currently working on the problem of attribution.

Indeed, the more sophisticated the attack, the more sophisticated the attacker, thereby pointing to a state actor as the culprit – or so it is argued. However, Clement Guitton and Elaine Korzak note the lack of clarity and inconsistency around the term 'sophistication', contending that it is context-dependent and therefore that it cannot be used unquestioningly in identifying the perpetrator of a cyber-attack.\nWhen in 2010 cyber-security company Kaspersky started examining Stuxnet, a piece of malware that targeted Iranian nuclear centrifuges, it declared that 'Stuxnet's sophistication, purpose and the intelligence behind it suggest the involvement of a state'. Two years later, a New York Times report confirmed these suspicions, exposing Stuxnet as a joint US-Israeli operation. This case set a precedent in considering the sophistication of an attack as a criterion for assessing whether it was sponsored by a state. Thus, when in August 2012 malware called Shamoon infected the computers of Saudi Arabia's national oil company Aramco, US Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta declared in a briefing at the Pentagon that 'the attack on Aramco involved a pretty sophisticated tool. There are only a few countries in the world that have that capability'.\nAttribution of cyber-attacks – finding the identity of both the actors behind an attack and their sponsor – is difficult. Yet for a victim state, differentiating criminal attacks from those sponsored by state actors is essential, as they call for different responses. In one case, the victim state will want to prosecute the criminals. In the other, it may consider an array of diplomatic, economic and even military measures against the state that sponsored the attack. Without attribution, it is difficult to adapt national defence to a threat, let alone respond to it. The importance of attribution and its associated challenges have therefore led many experts to consider a number of criteria for assessing the possibility of state sponsorship, including sophistication. This criterion has considerable appeal, as it seems to be a simple way of making a connection between a cyber-attack and a state actor.\nIt is questionable, however, whether sophistication really is an appropriate criterion and it is important to ask how sophistication is being defined.\nCountering the current prevailing popularity of sophistication as a determinant of state sponsorship, this article argues that usage of the term reveals a lack of consensus over its definition. Moreover, as non-state actors have carried out attacks considered to be sophisticated, the utility of sophistication as a criterion is limited. A survey of the international legal framework governing attribution confirms this finding. Thus, while sophistication may appear to be an appealing criterion for assessing the likelihood of state sponsorship, it is not necessarily an accurate or sufficient one.\n# Different Contexts, Different Definitions ## Stuxnet The case of Stuxnet set a precedent in the use of sophistication as an indicator of the probability of state sponsorship. Focusing mainly on technical elements, analysts thought that Stuxnet was sophisticated for three reasons.4 First, the malware and its various versions remained undetected for years. Although the first version was probably created in 2005, it was not detected until 2010. Secondly, the malware had only one, very specific target that was not connected to the Internet: the controllers at the Natanz nuclear plant. Different versions © RUSI JOURNAL AUGUST/SEPTEMBER 2013 VOL. 158 NO. 4 pp. 62-68 DOI: 10.1080/03071847.2013.826509 GUITTON AND KORZAK of the malware were released and the last of these used four zero-day exploits – that is to say, previously undiscovered vulnerabilities in the system. Thirdly, when the malware found its target, it displayed incorrect values of valve pressure and rotation frequency to hide what it was doing – namely, irreversibly damaging the centrifuges. This process required specific and detailed knowledge of the system at the Natanz nuclear plant. Consequently, Kaspersky and other cybersecurity firms considered Stuxnet to be sophisticated because of its stealth, its high number of zero-day exploits and the precise intelligence it necessitated.\n# Shamoon Officials such as Panetta also considered Shamoon - the malware used to attack Saudi Arabia's national oil company Aramco - to be sophisticated. Applying the very technical definition of 'sophistication' used in the case of Stuxnet to this incident, however, reveals a lack of clarity and consistency.\nShamoon attempted to delete files on the computers that it infected, including the master boot record, to prevent the computers from starting again. However, the high visibility of the deletion mechanism quickly brought the attack to the attention of system administrators. Shamoon was therefore not stealthy. Nor was it novel: the deletion mechanism used was from a commercially available product called RawDisk. Lastly, the deletion mechanism did not always work. The mechanism was supposed to replace deleted files with the image of a burning US flag, but the image file was corrupted and only the first line of pixels appeared. If the goal of the attack was 'to stop the flow of oil and gas' - as Aramco's vice president for corporate planning, Abdullah Al-Saadan, believed - Shamoon failed in this regard. These mistakes led Kaspersky to call Shamoon 'quick and dirty'.\nAlthough this analysis shows that the technical criteria set by Stuxnet for 'sophistication' do not apply in the case of Shamoon, officials nonetheless considered it to be a sophisticated piece of malware. Such contradictory claims reveal a lack of definitional clarity with regard to the concept. Indeed, the case Saudi Aramco geoscientists and petroleum engineers at the Geosteering Centre in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. Image courtesy of saudiaramco.com.\nof Shamoon shows that, in addition to technical elements, sophistication can also be characterised by political elements, and that this broader definition includes the nature of the target and the motivation of the attackers. Additional criteria for sophistication thus include whether the target of the attack can be considered politically sensitive, and whether the attackers have a political objective.\nSaudi Arabia's national oil company was a politically sensitive target in the case of Shamoon. Aramco faces fierce competition from other oil companies - state-supported or otherwise - in addition to threats from various political activist movements. The ultimate purpose of the malware may well have been to cause substantial damage to Aramco and to impair its reputation as a secure company. With regard to motives and political objectives, a possible explanation for the attack is that Iran wished to retaliate against the straining sanctions regime that has hit the country - as asserted by an unnamed government official in the Washington Post.[8] A second explanation is that political activists chose Aramco as a symbol of the Saudi Arabian government and its wealth. An Arab activist group called the 'Cutting Sword of Justice' claimed that it targeted Aramco for political reasons, as it is the main source of revenue for Saudi Arabia, which it accuses of being involved in 'crimes and atrocities taking place in various countries around the world'.9 To support its claim, it released the IP addresses of all of Aramco's compromised servers, with the date and time of their breach. Aramco confirmed that the data released was accurate. Thus, there is evidence to suggest that on this occasion the motives may have been political.\n# The 'Comment Crew' In comparison to Stuxnet and Shamoon, which were both considered 'sophisticated', recent attacks on US companies were - perhaps surprisingly - not categorised as 'sophisticated'. In February 2013, the US cyber-security company Mandiant released a widely quoted report in which it identified the Chinese military - also referred to as the 'Comment Crew', or APT1 - as the perpetrator behind hundreds of attacks on mainly US companies.[10] These included one against the Coca-Cola Company, reported three months earlier by Bloomberg,[11] in which the attackers used a variety of malware sent via e-mails designed to entice their victims into opening them and releasing the malware - a technique known as spear-phishing. Despite this, neither of the reports by Mandiant and Bloomberg described the attacks as sophisticated. Similarly, two weeks before the publication of its report, Mandiant was investigating a breach at the New York Times, in co-ordination with the FBI, which followed an extensive report by the newspaper about the wealth of China's then premier, Wen Jiabao. The New York Times later repeatedly pointed to the possible involvement of the Chinese military in the cyber-attack. Yet again, neither Mandiant nor the New York Times referred to the attacks as being sophisticated.\nResponding to the publication of the Mandiant report, which was corroborated by many other intelligence reports, Tom Donilon, the national security adviser to the US president between October 2010 and June 2013, directly confronted China in requesting that its government investigate the allegations and engage in diplomatic discussions. However, in contrast to the reports by Mandiant and the New York Times, Donilon described the attacks as ‘sophisticated'. It is thus interesting to identify those elements that can account for this discrepancy in assessment.\nFirst, the attacks may genuinely have failed to impress analysts on a technical level with regard to stealth, the use of zero-day exploits and intelligence. This, however, may be an unfair depiction, as the attacks were sufficiently stealthy to evade the attention of the main cyber-security companies for years due to the updating of the techniques used. Modularity was therefore a key aspect of the malware. Its delivery, however, remained simple. To deliver the malware, the attackers required a certain amount of limited intelligence on the interests of the targeted individuals. However, unlike the Stuxnet case, such intelligence was easily available and did not require an in-depth understanding of technical systems that had not previously been widely studied (such as SCADA systems, used to control many different industrial processes and the target of the Stuxnet malware).\nSecondly, the attacks were an espionage campaign and thus differed from Stuxnet and Shamoon, which respectively aimed at inducing physical damage or destroying information in an attempt to sabotage operations. Therefore, on the part of the technical experts at least, the term ‘sophistication' appears to have been reserved for such sabotage operations, perhaps due to the complexity involved and the vividness and tangibility of the result. The destruction of nuclear centrifuges by Stuxnet and the erasure of data from 30,000 computers by Shamoon are both much more visible and seemingly impressive -- and can perhaps even be considered as more innovative in their goals -- than the ‘mere' leaking of information as a result of a cyber-attack.\nThis leads to the third reason for not characterising the attack as sophisticated: by refraining from doing so, Mandiant and the New York Times may have been seeking to create an image of Chinese hackers as less capable and innovative than their US counterparts. In this sense, the choice of words used in publicly describing a cyber-attack reflects a specific selection of its traits. The characterisation of an attack as ‘sophisticated' frames the perception of the enemy as being similarly sophisticated. Recent reports by the US Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Defense have explicitly made this leap from ‘sophisticated attack' to ‘sophisticated attacker', with several political implications for the response to an attack once attributed. Indeed, this shift can be used to enhance the apparent salience of the threat, facilitating moves towards changes in the regulatory framework, as seen in the renewed effort by the White House to pass cyber-security legislation.\nNevertheless, this framing in terms of a ‘sophisticated attacker' is counterproductive when considering the possible suspects behind the attacks. Despite the difficulty of assessing a country's capabilities, analysts try to parse states into categories, such as ‘enemy states with low capabilities' or ‘friendly states with high capabilities'. For example, defining an attack as ‘sophisticated' is likely to restrict the range of suspects and hypotheses under consideration, and thus may skew the analytical process. Attackers can exploit this bias and make effective use of the attribution problem to mislead investigators.\nThe analysis of the three case studies -- Stuxnet, Shamoon and the attacks carried out by the Comment Crew -- illustrates the lack of definitional clarity of the term ‘sophistication' and a lack of consistency in its use. In contrast to Stuxnet, the other case studies have shown that the label ‘sophistication' is not contingent upon crossing a technical threshold or fulfilling a specific set of technical criteria -- as also demonstrated by the Mandiant report. Indeed, as in the case of Shamoon, the political nature and targets of the attack may also influence whether it is thought to be sophisticated. Clearly, therefore, different elements play a preponderant role in the assessment of an attack's sophistication depending on the context. Such a lack of definitional consensus warrants clarification in its own right. More importantly, however, because sophistication is increasingly used as a reference point through which to establish the likelihood of state sponsorship, the use of the term can skew the attribution process and its outcome. The following cases illustrate that attacks considered to be sophisticated are not necessarily perpetrated by state actors. This suggests that caution is needed when using sophistication as a criterion in the attribution of a cyber-attack to a state actor.\n## Sophisticated Attacks by Criminals In the past, high-profile political organisations have been subject to numerous cyber-attacks carried out by criminals, despite the apparent lack of economic value. In particular, in the 1990s there was a series of hacks into US military networks that were first identified as sophisticated due to the political circumstances, with law-enforcement agencies initially thinking that state actors were behind these attacks. However, these were later revealed to be criminal cases.\nIn 1991, for example, in the midst of the Gulf War, a group of Dutch students hacked into thirty-four sites including NASA at the Kennedy Space Center, the Pentagon's Pacific Fleet Command and the Lawrence Livermore National GUITTON AND KORZAK Laboratory. The words they searched for in the networks – 'military', 'nuclear', 'missile', 'Desert Storm' and 'Desert Shield' – led the US to believe that a foreign intelligence service was behind the attack.[15] In 1994, British teenagers Richard Pryce and Mathew Bevan broke into the computers of NASA, several US Air Force bases and allegedly the defence company Lockheed Martin.[16] In February 1998, during a period of tense relations between the US and Iraq, three teenagers hacked into the US Air Force's networks.[17] Lastly, in 2001, British citizen Gary McKinnon broke into ninety-seven US computers, of which fifty-three belonged to the army, twenty-six to the navy, sixteen to NASA, one to the Department of Defense, and one to the air force.[18] These incidents illustrate that initial characterisations of sophistication involving high-profile political targets do not necessarily imply state sponsorship.\nThe aims of these attacks were confined to espionage; however, even in relation to sabotage operations, state actors are not alone in being able to carry out technically sophisticated and devastating attacks. In this way, the current director of national intelligence was inaccurate in his statement before Congress that only state actors can launch 'sophisticated' and 'devastating' attacks capable of inflicting 'long-term, wide-scale disruption of services'.[19] This false distinction between 'sophisticated' and 'non-sophisticated' relies on two equally false assumptions for which Stuxnet set the precedent: that only state actors can collect technical intelligence and that only state actors can appropriately test the malware to fine-tune it.\nFirst, state actors are no longer the sole collectors of intelligence. Criminals are highly capable of launching spear-phishing campaigns or using other tools to retrieve confidential information. Most criminals engaged in this type of activity are motivated by financial gain, and are mostly interested in retrieving credit-card data. However, other criminals and criminal groups with more political agendas can use cyber-attacks to gain access to technical intelligence that they would need in preparation for a larger attack. Recently, more tools have emerged that make the collection of intelligence even easier: for example, Shodan – a search engine which lists industrial control systems accessible from the Internet. Analysts should therefore not underestimate the capacity of individual criminals and organised criminal groups to acquire technical intelligence on a target in order to orchestrate sophisticated attacks.\nSecondly, there is an ongoing debate about the resources required for mounting attacks on industrial control systems, and more specifically, about the resources required to test the malware used to target such systems. On the one hand, David Sanger of the New York Times suggested that the US built a replica of Iran's centrifuges to fine-tune Stuxnet.[20] An attack on industrial control systems needs to override the mechanisms designed to interrupt the process controlled by the computers should they malfunction. The fine-tuning of the malware therefore aims to achieve this without technicians working on the industrial control systems becoming aware of the attacks. On the other hand, many experts think that it is relatively easy to mount and fine-tune attacks on many industrial control systems by replicating only the sensitive parts. For instance, Dale Peterson, a specialist in industrial control systems, concludes that: 'developing an ICS [industrial control system] cyber weapon is simple given a small team and access to the target product'.[21] Nor is it impossible to gain access to such systems. For example, a SCADA system can be smaller than a suitcase, and large manufacturers of such systems, such as Siemens, even lend them to researchers so that they can improve their security. With sufficient organisation, non-state actors can be creative enough to mount such technically sophisticated attacks. Therefore, having studied Stuxnet, political scientists Sean Collins and Stephen McCombie concluded that such attacks are 'open to a number of aggressors, not just nation states'.[22] This ongoing debate thus cautions against the assumption that only states can replicate an industrial-control-system environment. Indeed, it would be highly reductionist to think that only state actors have the skills for intelligence gathering and for mounting a devastating attack. Moreover, experience shows that non-state actors can develop new tactics with which to circumvent national cybersecurity measures, to remain stealthy and to sustain a high pace of attack. The Zeus malware – which creates a botnet, a network of computers controlled by commands issued by the botnet's master – is one such example.\nAlthough it does not target industrial control systems, the Zeus malware is comparable to Stuxnet in terms of its technical attributes: it is stealthy, modular and exploits many vulnerabilities. Unlike Stuxnet, however, Zeus was not engineered by a state actor. According to Microsoft, Zeus first appeared in late 2006, and has demonstrated an exceptionally long lifespan, given that it was still highly active in 2012.[23] Throughout this time, the malware's author constantly updated it with new functionalities to evade detection and to help the botnets already created to survive.[24] The malware's modularity and resistance to being detected quickly made it popular among criminals with a range of interests, although it remains used primarily in financial fraud. It has become clear that the author of Zeus is a professional at creating, updating and selling the modules that comprise the malware's suite of programmes: he or she sold copies of Zeus under licence, keeping the code private but offering to update it, similar to legitimate software companies.[25] Kevin McNally, a project manager at the US Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command, estimated that the author of the malware might have earned as much as $15 million in licensing fees.[26] The Zeus malware follows the technical elements of sophistication mentioned above: it is full of novelties and is effective, stealthy and modular, having proven robust against disruption. Yet it is not the result of a state-sponsored activity. The evidence suggests that the author's purpose in creating the malware is wholly criminal.[27] Thus, simply considering the sophistication of an attack and the malware behind it is insufficient and should not therefore be used to determine state sponsorship.\n\n## Legal Requirements for State Sponsorship\nThe ability to attribute a cyber-attack to a state under international law is critically important, as it determines which areas of law an attack invokes. If a state cannot attribute an attack to another state actor, the national laws and in particular the criminal laws of the targeted state apply. In contrast, if a state can impute responsibility for an attack to another state, then international law is applicable. This body of law, broadly speaking, governs relations between states. Thus, if a cyber-attack breaches international law, then the targeted state is entitled under those same laws to take certain measures in response. In exceptional circumstances a state may even resort to the use of force in self defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter, should the breach amount to an ‘armed attack'.^{28} As a result, attribution to a state is critical since the two areas of law -- domestic and international -- entail different response options.\nIndividual criteria, such as sophistication, can inform but not determine this assessment of state responsibility, which is instead guided by four longstanding, general norms structured around different categories of state involvement.\nFirst, the actions of state organs -- whether individuals or organisational entities -- are attributable to the state in question.^{29} Thus if a targeted state ascertained that a governmental organ -- be it civilian or military -- conducted a cyber-attack, it could hold the state itself responsible under public international law. In addition to this, the actions of persons or entities empowered by national law to exercise some degree of governmental authority are also attributable to a state. This, however, is only the case if the persons or entities are ‘acting in that capacity in the particular instance'.^{30} Independent contractors or privatised corporations entrusted with exercising certain governmental duties fall into this category.\nSecondly, and most interestingly, a victim state can also seek to attribute actions that were not undertaken by state organs or entities to another state, provided that the perpetrators acted ‘on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of', that state.^{31} This category encompasses individuals or organisations hired by states to conduct cyber-attacks. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the exact degree of control necessary to be proven for purposes of attribution has turned out to be somewhat problematic. The International Court of Justice set a fairly high standard in the 1984 Contra case involving Nicaragua, in which the government of Nicaragua accused the United States of, among other things, recruiting, organising, paying and commanding a paramilitary group known as the Contras. The Contras sought to subvert the Sandinistas, the socialist party that took power in 1979 in a coup d'état and which was regarded as communist by the US.\nThe court examined whether it could legally attribute acts committed by the Contras to the United States based on its involvement, but concluded the ‘financing, organizing, training, supplying and equipping of the contras, the selection of its military or paramilitary targets, and the planning of the whole of its operation' was ‘still insufficient' to legally attribute acts committed by the Contras to the United States.^{32} In this case, state responsibility could not be imputed unless the United States had clearly exerted ‘effective control' over the military and paramilitary operations of the Contras,^{33} suggesting that control of an individual or a group with respect to the overall actions taken is not sufficient. Rather, the state making the allegation needs to show that the accused state had control over or gave instructions with respect to every action in question. Thus, in addition to the challenge of obtaining factual proof of any kind of state involvement, the court set a high standard of ‘effective control' for purposes of legal attribution.^{34}\nWhile the Nicaraguan regime's effort to legally attribute the actions of the Contras to the US failed, on a political level it had little doubt about US involvement in supporting the Contras' operations. For instance, the Associated Press reporter Eloy Aguilar wrote in April 1984 that ‘CIA support for the Nicaraguan Democratic Force is evident and openly discussed in Congress'.^{35} Although the court did not establish legal responsibility on the part of the US, it did acknowledge the substantial level of state involvement. However, as the Nicaragua case showed, attribution on a political level does not necessarily equate to state responsibility under international law.\nThirdly, even if a targeted state cannot attribute a cyber-attack to another state under the foregoing principles, it may still hold that state responsible if it subsequently ‘acknowledges and adopts the conduct in question as its own'.^{36} For instance, although the initial attack on the United States' embassy in Tehran in 1979 was not attributable to Iran, the subsequent endorsement of the Iranian authorities turned the occupation of the embassy into an act of the Iranian state.\nLastly, every state has an ‘obligation to not allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States'.^{37} On this basis a state can be held responsible if it does not take necessary and reasonable measures to prevent or stop a cyber-attack. It is important to note that under this principle a state is only responsible for its failure to stop the attack; it cannot be held legally responsible for the actual attack (provided that the state was not involved in the attack under the foregoing principles).^{38} The lack of technical expertise in certain countries might render the application of this principle a problematic policy option.\nConsidering these four principles governing the legal process of attributing an attack to a state, it becomes apparent that the standards necessary for attribution are stringent. The second category in particular -- whether an attack is conducted under the direction or control of a state -- requires proof of ‘effective control' of particular attacks or actions. The level of state involvement required is considerable. As mentioned above, the International Court of Justice regarded even the financing, organising and training of the Contras as insufficient\nGUITTON AND KORZAK\ninvolvement to legally attribute the acts of the group to the United States.\nIn addition, the standard of factual evidence required to prove state involvement can likewise pose significant challenges. For example, in the Oil Platforms case between Iran and the United States – which arose during the 1980–88 Iran-Iraq War – the International Court of Justice ruled in 2003 that the United States had not provided sufficient evidence to prove that Iran was responsible for a 1987 missile attack on a US-flagged tanker, the Sea Isle City.³⁹ The evidence put forward by the United States included satellite imagery of missile sites, expert reports as well as eyewitness testimonies. The standard of evidence required in this case proved to be demanding, although it involved the use of traditional physical force, which often leaves behind a trail of evidence (such as missile sites and other staging grounds, troop movements, or records of the supply of munitions and materiel). In contrast, investigators of cyber-attacks have access only to intangible traces to prove an actor's culpability. Moreover, if the attacks are not conducted by government organs but by individuals or groups directed by a state, the victim state will have to demonstrate that the accused state had 'effective control' in order to impute responsibility to it.\nThese high standards incorporated in the legal framework that governs state attribution, coupled with the plausible deniability and veil of anonymity afforded by cyber-attacks, create an international legal landscape of attribution highly unsatisfactory to most policy-makers.\nThe challenge of attribution in relation to cyber-attack has led Matthew Hoisington, for instance, to suggest\nthat policy-makers should significantly lower the standards of legal attribution, particularly in the case of attacks prompting a response in self-defence. Accordingly, if an attack targets critical national infrastructure, 'a state could respond in presumptively good-faith self-defense without first attributing or characterizing the attack to the level of specificity required under the traditional formulation'.⁴⁰ However, such calls are misplaced. The veil of anonymity and deniability inherent to cyber-attacks is exactly the reason why standards of attribution should remain high, so as to avoid innocent states being accused of conducting cyber-attacks – and being the potential victim of misplaced retaliation. Third parties could also exploit longstanding tensions between states in order to escalate conflict situations.\nIn light of the arguably unsatisfactory legal framework of attribution, the popularity of sophistication as a criterion in attributing attacks to a state appears understandable. Yet, as has been shown, attribution in legal terms is assessed based on varying degrees of state involvement. According to the principles mentioned above, a victim state would need to ascertain whether an attack originated from a state organ or whether the state in question was in 'effective control' of the entity conducting the attack. The criterion of sophistication cannot replace these guiding principles of the legal assessment of attribution. Sophistication can only serve as an element of evidence within this framework.\n## Conclusion\nThere is no common understanding of the term 'sophistication' as it is used by prominent political figures or by technical\nexperts in the cyber-security debate. By looking at different case studies, this article has identified several technical and political elements that characterise sophistication in each individual context. The lack of clarity and consistency in the use of the term hinders an informed discussion about the significance of sophistication as a criterion for assessing the likelihood of state sponsorship.\nFurther, counter-examples have shown that sophistication alone cannot serve as a conclusive determinant in this regard. Sophistication does not necessarily imply state sponsorship — and vice versa. Moreover, the determination of state sponsorship or responsibility in international legal terms follows a different set of criteria based on varying degrees of state involvement. In this framework, sophistication can play only a limited role. It can serve to strengthen or weaken evidence brought forward, but will never constitute a legal criterion in itself. It is therefore important to caution against the significance of sophistication as a seemingly appealing criterion for attribution.\nClement Guitton is a PhD candidate in the Department of War Studies at King's College London currently working on the problem of attribution.

Indeed, the more sophisticated the attack, the more sophisticated the attacker, thereby pointing to a state actor as the culprit – or so it is argued. However, Clement Guitton and Elaine Korzak note the lack of clarity and inconsistency around the term 'sophistication', contending that it is context-dependent and therefore that it cannot be used unquestioningly in identifying the perpetrator of a cyber-attack.\nWhen in 2010 cyber-security company Kaspersky started examining Stuxnet, a piece of malware that targeted Iranian nuclear centrifuges, it declared that 'Stuxnet's sophistication, purpose and the intelligence behind it suggest the involvement of a state'. Two years later, a New York Times report confirmed these suspicions, exposing Stuxnet as a joint US-Israeli operation. This case set a precedent in considering the sophistication of an attack as a criterion for assessing whether it was sponsored by a state. Thus, when in August 2012 malware called Shamoon infected the computers of Saudi Arabia's national oil company Aramco, US Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta declared in a briefing at the Pentagon that 'the attack on Aramco involved a pretty sophisticated tool. There are only a few countries in the world that have that capability'.\nAttribution of cyber-attacks – finding the identity of both the actors behind an attack and their sponsor – is difficult. Yet for a victim state, differentiating criminal attacks from those sponsored by state actors is essential, as they call for different responses. In one case, the victim state will want to prosecute the criminals. In the other, it may consider an array of diplomatic, economic and even military measures against the state that sponsored the attack. Without attribution, it is difficult to adapt national defence to a threat, let alone respond to it. The importance of attribution and its associated challenges have therefore led many experts to consider a number of criteria for assessing the possibility of state sponsorship, including sophistication. This criterion has considerable appeal, as it seems to be a simple way of making a connection between a cyber-attack and a state actor.\nIt is questionable, however, whether sophistication really is an appropriate criterion and it is important to ask how sophistication is being defined.\nCountering the current prevailing popularity of sophistication as a determinant of state sponsorship, this article argues that usage of the term reveals a lack of consensus over its definition. Moreover, as non-state actors have carried out attacks considered to be sophisticated, the utility of sophistication as a criterion is limited. A survey of the international legal framework governing attribution confirms this finding. Thus, while sophistication may appear to be an appealing criterion for assessing the likelihood of state sponsorship, it is not necessarily an accurate or sufficient one.\n# Different Contexts, Different Definitions ## Stuxnet The case of Stuxnet set a precedent in the use of sophistication as an indicator of the probability of state sponsorship. Focusing mainly on technical elements, analysts thought that Stuxnet was sophisticated for three reasons.4 First, the malware and its various versions remained undetected for years. Although the first version was probably created in 2005, it was not detected until 2010. Secondly, the malware had only one, very specific target that was not connected to the Internet: the controllers at the Natanz nuclear plant. Different versions © RUSI JOURNAL AUGUST/SEPTEMBER 2013 VOL. 158 NO. 4 pp. 62-68 DOI: 10.1080/03071847.2013.826509 GUITTON AND KORZAK of the malware were released and the last of these used four zero-day exploits – that is to say, previously undiscovered vulnerabilities in the system. Thirdly, when the malware found its target, it displayed incorrect values of valve pressure and rotation frequency to hide what it was doing – namely, irreversibly damaging the centrifuges. This process required specific and detailed knowledge of the system at the Natanz nuclear plant. Consequently, Kaspersky and other cybersecurity firms considered Stuxnet to be sophisticated because of its stealth, its high number of zero-day exploits and the precise intelligence it necessitated.\n# Shamoon Officials such as Panetta also considered Shamoon - the malware used to attack Saudi Arabia's national oil company Aramco - to be sophisticated. Applying the very technical definition of 'sophistication' used in the case of Stuxnet to this incident, however, reveals a lack of clarity and consistency.\nShamoon attempted to delete files on the computers that it infected, including the master boot record, to prevent the computers from starting again. However, the high visibility of the deletion mechanism quickly brought the attack to the attention of system administrators. Shamoon was therefore not stealthy. Nor was it novel: the deletion mechanism used was from a commercially available product called RawDisk. Lastly, the deletion mechanism did not always work. The mechanism was supposed to replace deleted files with the image of a burning US flag, but the image file was corrupted and only the first line of pixels appeared. If the goal of the attack was 'to stop the flow of oil and gas' - as Aramco's vice president for corporate planning, Abdullah Al-Saadan, believed - Shamoon failed in this regard. These mistakes led Kaspersky to call Shamoon 'quick and dirty'.\nAlthough this analysis shows that the technical criteria set by Stuxnet for 'sophistication' do not apply in the case of Shamoon, officials nonetheless considered it to be a sophisticated piece of malware. Such contradictory claims reveal a lack of definitional clarity with regard to the concept. Indeed, the case Saudi Aramco geoscientists and petroleum engineers at the Geosteering Centre in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. Image courtesy of saudiaramco.com.\nof Shamoon shows that, in addition to technical elements, sophistication can also be characterised by political elements, and that this broader definition includes the nature of the target and the motivation of the attackers. Additional criteria for sophistication thus include whether the target of the attack can be considered politically sensitive, and whether the attackers have a political objective.\nSaudi Arabia's national oil company was a politically sensitive target in the case of Shamoon. Aramco faces fierce competition from other oil companies - state-supported or otherwise - in addition to threats from various political activist movements. The ultimate purpose of the malware may well have been to cause substantial damage to Aramco and to impair its reputation as a secure company. With regard to motives and political objectives, a possible explanation for the attack is that Iran wished to retaliate against the straining sanctions regime that has hit the country - as asserted by an unnamed government official in the Washington Post.[8] A second explanation is that political activists chose Aramco as a symbol of the Saudi Arabian government and its wealth. An Arab activist group called the 'Cutting Sword of Justice' claimed that it targeted Aramco for political reasons, as it is the main source of revenue for Saudi Arabia, which it accuses of being involved in 'crimes and atrocities taking place in various countries around the world'.9 To support its claim, it released the IP addresses of all of Aramco's compromised servers, with the date and time of their breach. Aramco confirmed that the data released was accurate. Thus, there is evidence to suggest that on this occasion the motives may have been political.\n# The 'Comment Crew' In comparison to Stuxnet and Shamoon, which were both considered 'sophisticated', recent attacks on US companies were - perhaps surprisingly - not categorised as 'sophisticated'. In February 2013, the US cyber-security company Mandiant released a widely quoted report in which it identified the Chinese military - also referred to as the 'Comment Crew', or APT1 - as the perpetrator behind hundreds of attacks on mainly US companies.[10] These included one against the Coca-Cola Company, reported three months earlier by Bloomberg,[11] in which the attackers used a variety of malware sent via e-mails designed to entice their victims into opening them and releasing the malware - a technique known as spear-phishing. Despite this, neither of the reports by Mandiant and Bloomberg described the attacks as sophisticated. Similarly, two weeks before the publication of its report, Mandiant was investigating a breach at the New York Times, in co-ordination with the FBI, which followed an extensive report by the newspaper about the wealth of China's then premier, Wen Jiabao. The New York Times later repeatedly pointed to the possible involvement of the Chinese military in the cyber-attack. Yet again, neither Mandiant nor the New York Times referred to the attacks as being sophisticated.\nResponding to the publication of the Mandiant report, which was corroborated by many other intelligence reports, Tom Donilon, the national security adviser to the US president between October 2010 and June 2013, directly confronted China in requesting that its government investigate the allegations and engage in diplomatic discussions. However, in contrast to the reports by Mandiant and the New York Times, Donilon described the attacks as ‘sophisticated'. It is thus interesting to identify those elements that can account for this discrepancy in assessment.\nFirst, the attacks may genuinely have failed to impress analysts on a technical level with regard to stealth, the use of zero-day exploits and intelligence. This, however, may be an unfair depiction, as the attacks were sufficiently stealthy to evade the attention of the main cyber-security companies for years due to the updating of the techniques used. Modularity was therefore a key aspect of the malware. Its delivery, however, remained simple. To deliver the malware, the attackers required a certain amount of limited intelligence on the interests of the targeted individuals. However, unlike the Stuxnet case, such intelligence was easily available and did not require an in-depth understanding of technical systems that had not previously been widely studied (such as SCADA systems, used to control many different industrial processes and the target of the Stuxnet malware).\nSecondly, the attacks were an espionage campaign and thus differed from Stuxnet and Shamoon, which respectively aimed at inducing physical damage or destroying information in an attempt to sabotage operations. Therefore, on the part of the technical experts at least, the term ‘sophistication' appears to have been reserved for such sabotage operations, perhaps due to the complexity involved and the vividness and tangibility of the result. The destruction of nuclear centrifuges by Stuxnet and the erasure of data from 30,000 computers by Shamoon are both much more visible and seemingly impressive -- and can perhaps even be considered as more innovative in their goals -- than the ‘mere' leaking of information as a result of a cyber-attack.\nThis leads to the third reason for not characterising the attack as sophisticated: by refraining from doing so, Mandiant and the New York Times may have been seeking to create an image of Chinese hackers as less capable and innovative than their US counterparts. In this sense, the choice of words used in publicly describing a cyber-attack reflects a specific selection of its traits. The characterisation of an attack as ‘sophisticated' frames the perception of the enemy as being similarly sophisticated. Recent reports by the US Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Defense have explicitly made this leap from ‘sophisticated attack' to ‘sophisticated attacker', with several political implications for the response to an attack once attributed. Indeed, this shift can be used to enhance the apparent salience of the threat, facilitating moves towards changes in the regulatory framework, as seen in the renewed effort by the White House to pass cyber-security legislation.\nNevertheless, this framing in terms of a ‘sophisticated attacker' is counterproductive when considering the possible suspects behind the attacks. Despite the difficulty of assessing a country's capabilities, analysts try to parse states into categories, such as ‘enemy states with low capabilities' or ‘friendly states with high capabilities'. For example, defining an attack as ‘sophisticated' is likely to restrict the range of suspects and hypotheses under consideration, and thus may skew the analytical process. Attackers can exploit this bias and make effective use of the attribution problem to mislead investigators.\nThe analysis of the three case studies -- Stuxnet, Shamoon and the attacks carried out by the Comment Crew -- illustrates the lack of definitional clarity of the term ‘sophistication' and a lack of consistency in its use. In contrast to Stuxnet, the other case studies have shown that the label ‘sophistication' is not contingent upon crossing a technical threshold or fulfilling a specific set of technical criteria -- as also demonstrated by the Mandiant report. Indeed, as in the case of Shamoon, the political nature and targets of the attack may also influence whether it is thought to be sophisticated. Clearly, therefore, different elements play a preponderant role in the assessment of an attack's sophistication depending on the context. Such a lack of definitional consensus warrants clarification in its own right. More importantly, however, because sophistication is increasingly used as a reference point through which to establish the likelihood of state sponsorship, the use of the term can skew the attribution process and its outcome. The following cases illustrate that attacks considered to be sophisticated are not necessarily perpetrated by state actors. This suggests that caution is needed when using sophistication as a criterion in the attribution of a cyber-attack to a state actor.\n## Sophisticated Attacks by Criminals In the past, high-profile political organisations have been subject to numerous cyber-attacks carried out by criminals, despite the apparent lack of economic value. In particular, in the 1990s there was a series of hacks into US military networks that were first identified as sophisticated due to the political circumstances, with law-enforcement agencies initially thinking that state actors were behind these attacks. However, these were later revealed to be criminal cases.\nIn 1991, for example, in the midst of the Gulf War, a group of Dutch students hacked into thirty-four sites including NASA at the Kennedy Space Center, the Pentagon's Pacific Fleet Command and the Lawrence Livermore National GUITTON AND KORZAK Laboratory. The words they searched for in the networks – 'military', 'nuclear', 'missile', 'Desert Storm' and 'Desert Shield' – led the US to believe that a foreign intelligence service was behind the attack.[15] In 1994, British teenagers Richard Pryce and Mathew Bevan broke into the computers of NASA, several US Air Force bases and allegedly the defence company Lockheed Martin.[16] In February 1998, during a period of tense relations between the US and Iraq, three teenagers hacked into the US Air Force's networks.[17] Lastly, in 2001, British citizen Gary McKinnon broke into ninety-seven US computers, of which fifty-three belonged to the army, twenty-six to the navy, sixteen to NASA, one to the Department of Defense, and one to the air force.[18] These incidents illustrate that initial characterisations of sophistication involving high-profile political targets do not necessarily imply state sponsorship.\nThe aims of these attacks were confined to espionage; however, even in relation to sabotage operations, state actors are not alone in being able to carry out technically sophisticated and devastating attacks. In this way, the current director of national intelligence was inaccurate in his statement before Congress that only state actors can launch 'sophisticated' and 'devastating' attacks capable of inflicting 'long-term, wide-scale disruption of services'.[19] This false distinction between 'sophisticated' and 'non-sophisticated' relies on two equally false assumptions for which Stuxnet set the precedent: that only state actors can collect technical intelligence and that only state actors can appropriately test the malware to fine-tune it.\nFirst, state actors are no longer the sole collectors of intelligence. Criminals are highly capable of launching spear-phishing campaigns or using other tools to retrieve confidential information. Most criminals engaged in this type of activity are motivated by financial gain, and are mostly interested in retrieving credit-card data. However, other criminals and criminal groups with more political agendas can use cyber-attacks to gain access to technical intelligence that they would need in preparation for a larger attack. Recently, more tools have emerged that make the collection of intelligence even easier: for example, Shodan – a search engine which lists industrial control systems accessible from the Internet. Analysts should therefore not underestimate the capacity of individual criminals and organised criminal groups to acquire technical intelligence on a target in order to orchestrate sophisticated attacks.\nSecondly, there is an ongoing debate about the resources required for mounting attacks on industrial control systems, and more specifically, about the resources required to test the malware used to target such systems. On the one hand, David Sanger of the New York Times suggested that the US built a replica of Iran's centrifuges to fine-tune Stuxnet.[20] An attack on industrial control systems needs to override the mechanisms designed to interrupt the process controlled by the computers should they malfunction. The fine-tuning of the malware therefore aims to achieve this without technicians working on the industrial control systems becoming aware of the attacks. On the other hand, many experts think that it is relatively easy to mount and fine-tune attacks on many industrial control systems by replicating only the sensitive parts. For instance, Dale Peterson, a specialist in industrial control systems, concludes that: 'developing an ICS [industrial control system] cyber weapon is simple given a small team and access to the target product'.[21] Nor is it impossible to gain access to such systems. For example, a SCADA system can be smaller than a suitcase, and large manufacturers of such systems, such as Siemens, even lend them to researchers so that they can improve their security. With sufficient organisation, non-state actors can be creative enough to mount such technically sophisticated attacks. Therefore, having studied Stuxnet, political scientists Sean Collins and Stephen McCombie concluded that such attacks are 'open to a number of aggressors, not just nation states'.[22] This ongoing debate thus cautions against the assumption that only states can replicate an industrial-control-system environment. Indeed, it would be highly reductionist to think that only state actors have the skills for intelligence gathering and for mounting a devastating attack. Moreover, experience shows that non-state actors can develop new tactics with which to circumvent national cybersecurity measures, to remain stealthy and to sustain a high pace of attack. The Zeus malware – which creates a botnet, a network of computers controlled by commands issued by the botnet's master – is one such example.\nAlthough it does not target industrial control systems, the Zeus malware is comparable to Stuxnet in terms of its technical attributes: it is stealthy, modular and exploits many vulnerabilities. Unlike Stuxnet, however, Zeus was not engineered by a state actor. According to Microsoft, Zeus first appeared in late 2006, and has demonstrated an exceptionally long lifespan, given that it was still highly active in 2012.[23] Throughout this time, the malware's author constantly updated it with new functionalities to evade detection and to help the botnets already created to survive.[24] The malware's modularity and resistance to being detected quickly made it popular among criminals with a range of interests, although it remains used primarily in financial fraud. It has become clear that the author of Zeus is a professional at creating, updating and selling the modules that comprise the malware's suite of programmes: he or she sold copies of Zeus under licence, keeping the code private but offering to update it, similar to legitimate software companies.[25] Kevin McNally, a project manager at the US Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command, estimated that the author of the malware might have earned as much as $15 million in licensing fees.[26] The Zeus malware follows the technical elements of sophistication mentioned above: it is full of novelties and is effective, stealthy and modular, having proven robust against disruption. Yet it is not the result of a state-sponsored activity. The evidence suggests that the author's purpose in creating the malware is wholly criminal.[27] Thus, simply considering the sophistication of an attack and the malware behind it is insufficient and should not therefore be used to determine state sponsorship.\n\n## Legal Requirements for State Sponsorship\nThe ability to attribute a cyber-attack to a state under international law is critically important, as it determines which areas of law an attack invokes. If a state cannot attribute an attack to another state actor, the national laws and in particular the criminal laws of the targeted state apply. In contrast, if a state can impute responsibility for an attack to another state, then international law is applicable. This body of law, broadly speaking, governs relations between states. Thus, if a cyber-attack breaches international law, then the targeted state is entitled under those same laws to take certain measures in response. In exceptional circumstances a state may even resort to the use of force in self defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter, should the breach amount to an ‘armed attack'.^{28} As a result, attribution to a state is critical since the two areas of law -- domestic and international -- entail different response options.\nIndividual criteria, such as sophistication, can inform but not determine this assessment of state responsibility, which is instead guided by four longstanding, general norms structured around different categories of state involvement.\nFirst, the actions of state organs -- whether individuals or organisational entities -- are attributable to the state in question.^{29} Thus if a targeted state ascertained that a governmental organ -- be it civilian or military -- conducted a cyber-attack, it could hold the state itself responsible under public international law. In addition to this, the actions of persons or entities empowered by national law to exercise some degree of governmental authority are also attributable to a state. This, however, is only the case if the persons or entities are ‘acting in that capacity in the particular instance'.^{30} Independent contractors or privatised corporations entrusted with exercising certain governmental duties fall into this category.\nSecondly, and most interestingly, a victim state can also seek to attribute actions that were not undertaken by state organs or entities to another state, provided that the perpetrators acted ‘on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of', that state.^{31} This category encompasses individuals or organisations hired by states to conduct cyber-attacks. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the exact degree of control necessary to be proven for purposes of attribution has turned out to be somewhat problematic. The International Court of Justice set a fairly high standard in the 1984 Contra case involving Nicaragua, in which the government of Nicaragua accused the United States of, among other things, recruiting, organising, paying and commanding a paramilitary group known as the Contras. The Contras sought to subvert the Sandinistas, the socialist party that took power in 1979 in a coup d'état and which was regarded as communist by the US.\nThe court examined whether it could legally attribute acts committed by the Contras to the United States based on its involvement, but concluded the ‘financing, organizing, training, supplying and equipping of the contras, the selection of its military or paramilitary targets, and the planning of the whole of its operation' was ‘still insufficient' to legally attribute acts committed by the Contras to the United States.^{32} In this case, state responsibility could not be imputed unless the United States had clearly exerted ‘effective control' over the military and paramilitary operations of the Contras,^{33} suggesting that control of an individual or a group with respect to the overall actions taken is not sufficient. Rather, the state making the allegation needs to show that the accused state had control over or gave instructions with respect to every action in question. Thus, in addition to the challenge of obtaining factual proof of any kind of state involvement, the court set a high standard of ‘effective control' for purposes of legal attribution.^{34}\nWhile the Nicaraguan regime's effort to legally attribute the actions of the Contras to the US failed, on a political level it had little doubt about US involvement in supporting the Contras' operations. For instance, the Associated Press reporter Eloy Aguilar wrote in April 1984 that ‘CIA support for the Nicaraguan Democratic Force is evident and openly discussed in Congress'.^{35} Although the court did not establish legal responsibility on the part of the US, it did acknowledge the substantial level of state involvement. However, as the Nicaragua case showed, attribution on a political level does not necessarily equate to state responsibility under international law.\nThirdly, even if a targeted state cannot attribute a cyber-attack to another state under the foregoing principles, it may still hold that state responsible if it subsequently ‘acknowledges and adopts the conduct in question as its own'.^{36} For instance, although the initial attack on the United States' embassy in Tehran in 1979 was not attributable to Iran, the subsequent endorsement of the Iranian authorities turned the occupation of the embassy into an act of the Iranian state.\nLastly, every state has an ‘obligation to not allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States'.^{37} On this basis a state can be held responsible if it does not take necessary and reasonable measures to prevent or stop a cyber-attack. It is important to note that under this principle a state is only responsible for its failure to stop the attack; it cannot be held legally responsible for the actual attack (provided that the state was not involved in the attack under the foregoing principles).^{38} The lack of technical expertise in certain countries might render the application of this principle a problematic policy option.\nConsidering these four principles governing the legal process of attributing an attack to a state, it becomes apparent that the standards necessary for attribution are stringent. The second category in particular -- whether an attack is conducted under the direction or control of a state -- requires proof of ‘effective control' of particular attacks or actions. The level of state involvement required is considerable. As mentioned above, the International Court of Justice regarded even the financing, organising and training of the Contras as insufficient\nGUITTON AND KORZAK\ninvolvement to legally attribute the acts of the group to the United States.\nIn addition, the standard of factual evidence required to prove state involvement can likewise pose significant challenges. For example, in the Oil Platforms case between Iran and the United States – which arose during the 1980–88 Iran-Iraq War – the International Court of Justice ruled in 2003 that the United States had not provided sufficient evidence to prove that Iran was responsible for a 1987 missile attack on a US-flagged tanker, the Sea Isle City.³⁹ The evidence put forward by the United States included satellite imagery of missile sites, expert reports as well as eyewitness testimonies. The standard of evidence required in this case proved to be demanding, although it involved the use of traditional physical force, which often leaves behind a trail of evidence (such as missile sites and other staging grounds, troop movements, or records of the supply of munitions and materiel). In contrast, investigators of cyber-attacks have access only to intangible traces to prove an actor's culpability. Moreover, if the attacks are not conducted by government organs but by individuals or groups directed by a state, the victim state will have to demonstrate that the accused state had 'effective control' in order to impute responsibility to it.\nThese high standards incorporated in the legal framework that governs state attribution, coupled with the plausible deniability and veil of anonymity afforded by cyber-attacks, create an international legal landscape of attribution highly unsatisfactory to most policy-makers.\nThe challenge of attribution in relation to cyber-attack has led Matthew Hoisington, for instance, to suggest\nthat policy-makers should significantly lower the standards of legal attribution, particularly in the case of attacks prompting a response in self-defence. Accordingly, if an attack targets critical national infrastructure, 'a state could respond in presumptively good-faith self-defense without first attributing or characterizing the attack to the level of specificity required under the traditional formulation'.⁴⁰ However, such calls are misplaced. The veil of anonymity and deniability inherent to cyber-attacks is exactly the reason why standards of attribution should remain high, so as to avoid innocent states being accused of conducting cyber-attacks – and being the potential victim of misplaced retaliation. Third parties could also exploit longstanding tensions between states in order to escalate conflict situations.\nIn light of the arguably unsatisfactory legal framework of attribution, the popularity of sophistication as a criterion in attributing attacks to a state appears understandable. Yet, as has been shown, attribution in legal terms is assessed based on varying degrees of state involvement. According to the principles mentioned above, a victim state would need to ascertain whether an attack originated from a state organ or whether the state in question was in 'effective control' of the entity conducting the attack. The criterion of sophistication cannot replace these guiding principles of the legal assessment of attribution. Sophistication can only serve as an element of evidence within this framework.\n## Conclusion\nThere is no common understanding of the term 'sophistication' as it is used by prominent political figures or by technical\nexperts in the cyber-security debate. By looking at different case studies, this article has identified several technical and political elements that characterise sophistication in each individual context. The lack of clarity and consistency in the use of the term hinders an informed discussion about the significance of sophistication as a criterion for assessing the likelihood of state sponsorship.\nFurther, counter-examples have shown that sophistication alone cannot serve as a conclusive determinant in this regard. Sophistication does not necessarily imply state sponsorship — and vice versa. Moreover, the determination of state sponsorship or responsibility in international legal terms follows a different set of criteria based on varying degrees of state involvement. In this framework, sophistication can play only a limited role. It can serve to strengthen or weaken evidence brought forward, but will never constitute a legal criterion in itself. It is therefore important to caution against the significance of sophistication as a seemingly appealing criterion for attribution.\nClement Guitton is a PhD candidate in the Department of War Studies at King's College London currently working on the problem of attribution.

Indeed, the more sophisticated the attack, the more sophisticated the attacker, thereby pointing to a state actor as the culprit – or so it is argued. However, Clement Guitton and Elaine Korzak note the lack of clarity and inconsistency around the term 'sophistication', contending that it is context-dependent and therefore that it cannot be used unquestioningly in identifying the perpetrator of a cyber-attack.\nWhen in 2010 cyber-security company Kaspersky started examining Stuxnet, a piece of malware that targeted Iranian nuclear centrifuges, it declared that 'Stuxnet's sophistication, purpose and the intelligence behind it suggest the involvement of a state'. Two years later, a New York Times report confirmed these suspicions, exposing Stuxnet as a joint US-Israeli operation. This case set a precedent in considering the sophistication of an attack as a criterion for assessing whether it was sponsored by a state. Thus, when in August 2012 malware called Shamoon infected the computers of Saudi Arabia's national oil company Aramco, US Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta declared in a briefing at the Pentagon that 'the attack on Aramco involved a pretty sophisticated tool. There are only a few countries in the world that have that capability'.\nAttribution of cyber-attacks – finding the identity of both the actors behind an attack and their sponsor – is difficult. Yet for a victim state, differentiating criminal attacks from those sponsored\nby state actors is essential, as they call for different responses. In one case, the victim state will want to prosecute the criminals. In the other, it may consider an array of diplomatic, economic and even military measures against the state that sponsored the attack. Without attribution, it is difficult to adapt national defence to a threat, let alone respond to it. The importance of attribution and its associated challenges have therefore led many experts to consider a number of criteria for assessing the possibility of state sponsorship, including sophistication. This criterion has considerable appeal, as it seems to be a simple way of making a connection between a cyber-attack and a state actor.\nIt is questionable, however, whether sophistication really is an appropriate criterion and it is important to ask how sophistication is being defined.\nCountering the current prevailing popularity of sophistication as a determinant of state sponsorship, this article argues that usage of the term reveals a lack of consensus over its definition. Moreover, as non-state actors\nhave carried out attacks considered to be sophisticated, the utility of sophistication as a criterion is limited. A survey of the international legal framework governing attribution confirms this finding. Thus, while sophistication may appear to be an appealing criterion for assessing the likelihood of state sponsorship, it is not necessarily an accurate or sufficient one.\n# Different Contexts, Different Definitions\n## Stuxnet\nThe case of Stuxnet set a precedent in the use of sophistication as an indicator of the probability of state sponsorship. Focusing mainly on technical elements, analysts thought that Stuxnet was sophisticated for three reasons.4 First, the malware and its various versions remained undetected for years. Although the first version was probably created in 2005, it was not detected until 2010. Secondly, the malware had only one, very specific target that was not connected to the Internet: the controllers at the Natanz nuclear plant. Different versions\n© RUSI JOURNAL AUGUST/SEPTEMBER 2013 VOL. 158 NO. 4 pp. 62-68\nDOI: 10.1080/03071847.2013.826509\nGUITTON AND KORZAK\nof the malware were released and the last of these used four zero-day exploits – that is to say, previously undiscovered vulnerabilities in the system. Thirdly, when the malware found its target, it displayed incorrect values of valve pressure and rotation frequency to hide what it was doing – namely, irreversibly damaging the centrifuges. This process required specific and detailed knowledge of the system at the Natanz nuclear plant. Consequently, Kaspersky and other cybersecurity firms considered Stuxnet to be sophisticated because of its stealth, its high number of zero-day exploits and the precise intelligence it necessitated.\n# Shamoon\nOfficials such as Panetta also considered Shamoon - the malware used to attack Saudi Arabia's national oil company Aramco - to be sophisticated. Applying the very technical definition of 'sophistication' used in the case of Stuxnet to this incident, however, reveals a lack of clarity and consistency.\nShamoon attempted to delete files on the computers that it infected, including the master boot record, to prevent the computers from starting again. However, the high visibility of the deletion mechanism quickly brought the attack to the attention of system administrators. Shamoon was therefore not stealthy. Nor was it novel: the deletion mechanism used was from a commercially available product called RawDisk. Lastly, the deletion mechanism did not always work. The mechanism was supposed to replace deleted files with the image of a burning US flag, but the image file was corrupted and only the first line of pixels appeared. If the goal of the attack was 'to stop the flow of oil and gas' - as Aramco's vice president for corporate planning, Abdullah Al-Saadan, believed - Shamoon failed in this regard. These mistakes led Kaspersky to call Shamoon 'quick and dirty'.\nAlthough this analysis shows that the technical criteria set by Stuxnet for 'sophistication' do not apply in the case of Shamoon, officials nonetheless considered it to be a sophisticated piece of malware. Such contradictory claims reveal a lack of definitional clarity with regard to the concept. Indeed, the case\nSaudi Aramco geoscientists and petroleum engineers at the Geosteering Centre in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. Image courtesy of saudiaramco.com.\nof Shamoon shows that, in addition to technical elements, sophistication can also be characterised by political elements, and that this broader definition includes the nature of the target and the motivation of the attackers. Additional criteria for sophistication thus include whether the target of the attack can be considered politically sensitive, and whether the attackers have a political objective.\nSaudi Arabia's national oil company was a politically sensitive target in the case of Shamoon. Aramco faces fierce competition from other oil companies - state-supported or otherwise - in addition to threats from various political activist movements. The ultimate purpose of the malware may well have been to cause substantial damage to Aramco and to impair its reputation as a secure company. With regard to motives and political objectives, a possible explanation for the attack is that Iran wished to retaliate against the straining sanctions regime that has hit the country - as asserted by an unnamed government official in the Washington Post. A second explanation is that political activists chose Aramco as a symbol of the Saudi Arabian government and its wealth. An Arab activist group called the 'Cutting Sword of Justice' claimed that it targeted Aramco\nfor political reasons, as it is the main source of revenue for Saudi Arabia, which it accuses of being involved in 'crimes and atrocities taking place in various countries around the world'.9 To support its claim, it released the IP addresses of all of Aramco's compromised servers, with the date and time of their breach. Aramco confirmed that the data released was accurate. Thus, there is evidence to suggest that on this occasion the motives may have been political.\n# The 'Comment Crew'\nIn comparison to Stuxnet and Shamoon, which were both considered 'sophisticated', recent attacks on US companies were - perhaps surprisingly - not categorised as 'sophisticated'. In February 2013, the US cyber-security company Mandiant released a widely quoted report in which it identified the Chinese military - also referred to as the 'Comment Crew', or APT1 - as the perpetrator behind hundreds of attacks on mainly US companies. These included one against the Coca-Cola Company, reported three months earlier by Bloomberg, in which the attackers used a variety of malware sent via e-mails designed to entice their victims into opening them and releasing the malware - a technique\nknown as spear-phishing. Despite this, neither of the reports by Mandiant and Bloomberg described the attacks as sophisticated. Similarly, two weeks before the publication of its report, Mandiant was investigating a breach at the New York Times, in co-ordination with the FBI, which followed an extensive report by the newspaper about the wealth of China's then premier, Wen Jiabao. The New York Times later repeatedly pointed to the possible involvement of the Chinese military in the cyber-attack.^{12} Yet again, neither Mandiant nor the New York Times referred to the attacks as being sophisticated.\nResponding to the publication of the Mandiant report, which was corroborated by many other intelligence reports, Tom Donilon, the national security adviser to the US president between October 2010 and June 2013, directly confronted China in requesting that its government investigate the allegations and engage in diplomatic discussions. However, in contrast to the reports by Mandiant and the New York Times, Donilon described the attacks as ‘sophisticated'.^{13} It is thus interesting to identify those elements that can account for this discrepancy in assessment.\nFirst, the attacks may genuinely have failed to impress analysts on a technical level with regard to stealth, the use of zero-day exploits and intelligence. This, however, may be an unfair depiction, as the attacks were sufficiently stealthy to evade the attention of the main cyber-security companies for years due to the updating of the techniques used. Modularity was therefore a key aspect of the malware. Its delivery, however, remained simple. To deliver the malware, the attackers required a certain amount of limited intelligence on the interests of the targeted individuals. However, unlike the Stuxnet case, such intelligence was easily available and did not require an in-depth understanding of technical systems that had not previously been widely studied (such as SCADA systems, used to control many different industrial processes and the target of the Stuxnet malware).\nSecondly, the attacks were an espionage campaign and thus differed from Stuxnet and Shamoon, which respectively aimed at inducing physical damage or destroying information in an attempt to sabotage operations. Therefore, on the part of the technical experts at least, the term ‘sophistication' appears to have been reserved for such sabotage operations, perhaps due to the complexity involved and the vividness and tangibility of the result. The destruction of nuclear centrifuges by Stuxnet and the erasure of data from 30,000 computers by Shamoon are both much more visible and seemingly impressive -- and can perhaps even be considered as more innovative in their goals -- than the ‘mere' leaking of information as a result of a cyber-attack.\nThis leads to the third reason for not characterising the attack as sophisticated: by refraining from doing so, Mandiant and the New York Times may have been seeking to create an image of Chinese hackers as less capable and innovative than their US counterparts. In this sense, the choice of words used in publicly describing a cyber-attack reflects a specific selection of its traits. The characterisation of an attack as ‘sophisticated' frames the perception of the enemy as being similarly sophisticated. Recent reports by the US Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Defense have explicitly made this leap from ‘sophisticated attack' to ‘sophisticated attacker',^{14} with several political implications for the response to an attack once attributed. Indeed, this shift can be used to enhance the apparent salience of the threat, facilitating moves towards changes in the regulatory framework, as seen in the renewed effort by the White House to pass cyber-security legislation.\nNevertheless, this framing in terms of a ‘sophisticated attacker' is counterproductive when considering the possible suspects behind the attacks. Despite the difficulty of assessing a country's capabilities, analysts try to parse states into categories, such as ‘enemy states with low capabilities' or ‘friendly states with high capabilities'. For example, defining an attack as ‘sophisticated' is likely to restrict the range of suspects and hypotheses under consideration, and thus may skew the analytical process. Attackers can exploit this bias and make effective use of the attribution problem to mislead investigators.\nThe analysis of the three case studies -- Stuxnet, Shamoon and the attacks carried out by the Comment Crew -- illustrates the lack of definitional clarity of the term ‘sophistication' and a lack of consistency in its use. In contrast to Stuxnet, the other case studies have shown that the label ‘sophistication' is not contingent upon crossing a technical threshold or fulfilling a specific set of technical criteria -- as also demonstrated by the Mandiant report. Indeed, as in the case of Shamoon, the political nature and targets of the attack may also influence whether it is thought to be sophisticated. Clearly, therefore, different elements play a preponderant role in the assessment of an attack's sophistication depending on the context. Such a lack of definitional consensus warrants clarification in its own right. More importantly, however, because sophistication is increasingly used as a reference point through which to establish the likelihood of state sponsorship, the use of the term can skew the attribution process and its outcome. The following cases illustrate that attacks considered to be sophisticated are not necessarily perpetrated by state actors. This suggests that caution is needed when using sophistication as a criterion in the attribution of a cyber-attack to a state actor.\n## Sophisticated Attacks by Criminals\nIn the past, high-profile political organisations have been subject to numerous cyber-attacks carried out by criminals, despite the apparent lack of economic value. In particular, in the 1990s there was a series of hacks into US military networks that were first identified as sophisticated due to the political circumstances, with law-enforcement agencies initially thinking that state actors were behind these attacks. However, these were later revealed to be criminal cases.\nIn 1991, for example, in the midst of the Gulf War, a group of Dutch students hacked into thirty-four sites including NASA at the Kennedy Space Center, the Pentagon's Pacific Fleet Command and the Lawrence Livermore National\nGUITTON AND KORZAK\nLaboratory. The words they searched for in the networks – 'military', 'nuclear', 'missile', 'Desert Storm' and 'Desert Shield' – led the US to believe that a foreign intelligence service was behind the attack. In 1994, British teenagers Richard Pryce and Mathew Bevan broke into the computers of NASA, several US Air Force bases and allegedly the defence company Lockheed Martin. In February 1998, during a period of tense relations between the US and Iraq, three teenagers hacked into the US Air Force's networks. Lastly, in 2001, British citizen Gary McKinnon broke into ninety-seven US computers, of which fifty-three belonged to the army, twenty-six to the navy, sixteen to NASA, one to the Department of Defense, and one to the air force. These incidents illustrate that initial characterisations of sophistication involving high-profile political targets do not necessarily imply state sponsorship.\nThe aims of these attacks were confined to espionage; however, even in relation to sabotage operations, state actors are not alone in being able to carry out technically sophisticated and devastating attacks. In this way, the current director of national intelligence was inaccurate in his statement before Congress that only state actors can launch 'sophisticated' and 'devastating' attacks capable of inflicting 'long-term, wide-scale disruption of services'. This false distinction between 'sophisticated' and 'non-sophisticated' relies on two equally false assumptions for which Stuxnet set the precedent: that only state actors can collect technical intelligence and that only state actors can appropriately test the malware to fine-tune it.\nFirst, state actors are no longer the sole collectors of intelligence. Criminals are highly capable of launching spear-phishing campaigns or using other tools to retrieve confidential information. Most criminals engaged in this type of activity are motivated by financial gain, and are mostly interested in retrieving credit-card data. However, other criminals and criminal groups with more political agendas can use cyber-attacks to gain access to technical intelligence that they would need in preparation for a larger attack. Recently, more tools have emerged that make the\ncollection of intelligence even easier: for example, Shodan – a search engine which lists industrial control systems accessible from the Internet. Analysts should therefore not underestimate the capacity of individual criminals and organised criminal groups to acquire technical intelligence on a target in order to orchestrate sophisticated attacks.\nSecondly, there is an ongoing debate about the resources required for mounting attacks on industrial control systems, and more specifically, about the resources required to test the malware used to target such systems. On the one hand, David Sanger of the New York Times suggested that the US built a replica of Iran's centrifuges to fine-tune Stuxnet. An attack on industrial control systems needs to override the mechanisms designed to interrupt the process controlled by the computers should they malfunction. The fine-tuning of the malware therefore aims to achieve this without technicians working on the industrial control systems becoming aware of the attacks. On the other hand, many experts think that it is relatively easy to mount and fine-tune attacks on many industrial control systems by replicating only the sensitive parts. For instance, Dale Peterson, a specialist in industrial control systems, concludes that: 'developing an ICS [industrial control system] cyber weapon is simple given a small team and access to the target product'. Nor is it impossible to gain access to such systems. For example, a SCADA system can be smaller than a suitcase, and large manufacturers of such systems, such as Siemens, even lend them to researchers so that they can improve their security. With sufficient organisation, non-state actors can be creative enough to mount such technically sophisticated attacks. Therefore, having studied Stuxnet, political scientists Sean Collins and Stephen McCombie concluded that such attacks are 'open to a number of aggressors, not just nation states'.\nThis ongoing debate thus cautions against the assumption that only states can replicate an industrial-control-system environment. Indeed, it would be highly reductionist to think that only state actors have the skills for intelligence\ngathering and for mounting a devastating attack. Moreover, experience shows that non-state actors can develop new tactics with which to circumvent national cybersecurity measures, to remain stealthy and to sustain a high pace of attack. The Zeus malware – which creates a botnet, a network of computers controlled by commands issued by the botnet's master – is one such example.\nAlthough it does not target industrial control systems, the Zeus malware is comparable to Stuxnet in terms of its technical attributes: it is stealthy, modular and exploits many vulnerabilities. Unlike Stuxnet, however, Zeus was not engineered by a state actor. According to Microsoft, Zeus first appeared in late 2006, and has demonstrated an exceptionally long lifespan, given that it was still highly active in 2012. Throughout this time, the malware's author constantly updated it with new functionalities to evade detection and to help the botnets already created to survive.\nThe malware's modularity and resistance to being detected quickly made it popular among criminals with a range of interests, although it remains used primarily in financial fraud. It has become clear that the author of Zeus is a professional at creating, updating and selling the modules that comprise the malware's suite of programmes: he or she sold copies of Zeus under licence, keeping the code private but offering to update it, similar to legitimate software companies. Kevin McNally, a project manager at the US Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command, estimated that the author of the malware might have earned as much as $15 million in licensing fees.\nThe Zeus malware follows the technical elements of sophistication mentioned above: it is full of novelties and is effective, stealthy and modular, having proven robust against disruption. Yet it is not the result of a state-sponsored activity. The evidence suggests that the author's purpose in creating the malware is wholly criminal. Thus, simply considering the sophistication of an attack and the malware behind it is insufficient and should not therefore be used to determine state sponsorship.\n65\nA similar conclusion can be reached following a comprehensive survey of the international legal framework, which also suggests that the criterion of sophistication can play only a limited role in assessing state sponsorship.\n## Legal Requirements for State Sponsorship\nThe ability to attribute a cyber-attack to a state under international law is critically important, as it determines which areas of law an attack invokes. If a state cannot attribute an attack to another state actor, the national laws and in particular the criminal laws of the targeted state apply. In contrast, if a state can impute responsibility for an attack to another state, then international law is applicable. This body of law, broadly speaking, governs relations between states. Thus, if a cyber-attack breaches international law, then the targeted state is entitled under those same laws to take certain measures in response. In exceptional circumstances a state may even resort to the use of force in self defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter, should the breach amount to an ‘armed attack'.^{28} As a result, attribution to a state is critical since the two areas of law -- domestic and international -- entail different response options.\nIndividual criteria, such as sophistication, can inform but not determine this assessment of state responsibility, which is instead guided by four longstanding, general norms structured around different categories of state involvement.\nFirst, the actions of state organs -- whether individuals or organisational entities -- are attributable to the state in question.^{29} Thus if a targeted state ascertained that a governmental organ -- be it civilian or military -- conducted a cyber-attack, it could hold the state itself responsible under public international law. In addition to this, the actions of persons or entities empowered by national law to exercise some degree of governmental authority are also attributable to a state. This, however, is only the case if the persons or entities are ‘acting in that capacity in the particular instance'.^{30} Independent contractors or privatised corporations entrusted with exercising certain governmental duties fall into this category.\nSecondly, and most interestingly, a victim state can also seek to attribute actions that were not undertaken by state organs or entities to another state, provided that the perpetrators acted ‘on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of', that state.^{31} This category encompasses individuals or organisations hired by states to conduct cyber-attacks. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the exact degree of control necessary to be proven for purposes of attribution has turned out to be somewhat problematic. The International Court of Justice set a fairly high standard in the 1984 Contra case involving Nicaragua, in which the government of Nicaragua accused the United States of, among other things, recruiting, organising, paying and commanding a paramilitary group known as the Contras. The Contras sought to subvert the Sandinistas, the socialist party that took power in 1979 in a coup d'état and which was regarded as communist by the US.\nThe court examined whether it could legally attribute acts committed by the Contras to the United States based on its involvement, but concluded the ‘financing, organizing, training, supplying and equipping of the contras, the selection of its military or paramilitary targets, and the planning of the whole of its operation' was ‘still insufficient' to legally attribute acts committed by the Contras to the United States.^{32} In this case, state responsibility could not be imputed unless the United States had clearly exerted ‘effective control' over the military and paramilitary operations of the Contras,^{33} suggesting that control of an individual or a group with respect to the overall actions taken is not sufficient. Rather, the state making the allegation needs to show that the accused state had control over or gave instructions with respect to every action in question. Thus, in addition to the challenge of obtaining factual proof of any kind of state involvement, the court set a high standard of ‘effective control' for purposes of legal attribution.^{34}\nWhile the Nicaraguan regime's effort to legally attribute the actions of the Contras to the US failed, on a political level it had little doubt about US involvement in supporting the Contras' operations. For instance, the Associated Press reporter Eloy Aguilar wrote in April 1984 that ‘CIA support for the Nicaraguan Democratic Force is evident and openly discussed in Congress'.^{35} Although the court did not establish legal responsibility on the part of the US, it did acknowledge the substantial level of state involvement. However, as the Nicaragua case showed, attribution on a political level does not necessarily equate to state responsibility under international law.\nThirdly, even if a targeted state cannot attribute a cyber-attack to another state under the foregoing principles, it may still hold that state responsible if it subsequently ‘acknowledges and adopts the conduct in question as its own'.^{36} For instance, although the initial attack on the United States' embassy in Tehran in 1979 was not attributable to Iran, the subsequent endorsement of the Iranian authorities turned the occupation of the embassy into an act of the Iranian state.\nLastly, every state has an ‘obligation to not allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States'.^{37} On this basis a state can be held responsible if it does not take necessary and reasonable measures to prevent or stop a cyber-attack. It is important to note that under this principle a state is only responsible for its failure to stop the attack; it cannot be held legally responsible for the actual attack (provided that the state was not involved in the attack under the foregoing principles).^{38} The lack of technical expertise in certain countries might render the application of this principle a problematic policy option.\nConsidering these four principles governing the legal process of attributing an attack to a state, it becomes apparent that the standards necessary for attribution are stringent. The second category in particular -- whether an attack is conducted under the direction or control of a state -- requires proof of ‘effective control' of particular attacks or actions. The level of state involvement required is considerable. As mentioned above, the International Court of Justice regarded even the financing, organising and training of the Contras as insufficient\nGUITTON AND KORZAK\ninvolvement to legally attribute the acts of the group to the United States.\nIn addition, the standard of factual evidence required to prove state involvement can likewise pose significant challenges. For example, in the Oil Platforms case between Iran and the United States – which arose during the 1980–88 Iran-Iraq War – the International Court of Justice ruled in 2003 that the United States had not provided sufficient evidence to prove that Iran was responsible for a 1987 missile attack on a US-flagged tanker, the Sea Isle City.³⁹ The evidence put forward by the United States included satellite imagery of missile sites, expert reports as well as eyewitness testimonies. The standard of evidence required in this case proved to be demanding, although it involved the use of traditional physical force, which often leaves behind a trail of evidence (such as missile sites and other staging grounds, troop movements, or records of the supply of munitions and materiel). In contrast, investigators of cyber-attacks have access only to intangible traces to prove an actor's culpability. Moreover, if the attacks are not conducted by government organs but by individuals or groups directed by a state, the victim state will have to demonstrate that the accused state had 'effective control' in order to impute responsibility to it.\nThese high standards incorporated in the legal framework that governs state attribution, coupled with the plausible deniability and veil of anonymity afforded by cyber-attacks, create an international legal landscape of attribution highly unsatisfactory to most policy-makers.\nThe challenge of attribution in relation to cyber-attack has led Matthew Hoisington, for instance, to suggest\nthat policy-makers should significantly lower the standards of legal attribution, particularly in the case of attacks prompting a response in self-defence. Accordingly, if an attack targets critical national infrastructure, 'a state could respond in presumptively good-faith self-defense without first attributing or characterizing the attack to the level of specificity required under the traditional formulation'.⁴⁰ However, such calls are misplaced. The veil of anonymity and deniability inherent to cyber-attacks is exactly the reason why standards of attribution should remain high, so as to avoid innocent states being accused of conducting cyber-attacks – and being the potential victim of misplaced retaliation. Third parties could also exploit longstanding tensions between states in order to escalate conflict situations.\nIn light of the arguably unsatisfactory legal framework of attribution, the popularity of sophistication as a criterion in attributing attacks to a state appears understandable. Yet, as has been shown, attribution in legal terms is assessed based on varying degrees of state involvement. According to the principles mentioned above, a victim state would need to ascertain whether an attack originated from a state organ or whether the state in question was in 'effective control' of the entity conducting the attack. The criterion of sophistication cannot replace these guiding principles of the legal assessment of attribution. Sophistication can only serve as an element of evidence within this framework.\n## Conclusion\nThere is no common understanding of the term 'sophistication' as it is used by prominent political figures or by technical\nexperts in the cyber-security debate. By looking at different case studies, this article has identified several technical and political elements that characterise sophistication in each individual context. The lack of clarity and consistency in the use of the term hinders an informed discussion about the significance of sophistication as a criterion for assessing the likelihood of state sponsorship.\nFurther, counter-examples have shown that sophistication alone cannot serve as a conclusive determinant in this regard. Sophistication does not necessarily imply state sponsorship — and vice versa. Moreover, the determination of state sponsorship or responsibility in international legal terms follows a different set of criteria based on varying degrees of state involvement. In this framework, sophistication can play only a limited role. It can serve to strengthen or weaken evidence brought forward, but will never constitute a legal criterion in itself. It is therefore important to caution against the significance of sophistication as a seemingly appealing criterion for attribution.\nClement Guitton is a PhD candidate in the Department of War Studies at King's College London currently working on the problem of attribution.

Indeed, the more sophisticated the attack, the more sophisticated the attacker, thereby pointing to a state actor as the culprit – or so it is argued. However, Clement Guitton and Elaine Korzak note the lack of clarity and inconsistency around the term 'sophistication', contending that it is context-dependent and therefore that it cannot be used unquestioningly in identifying the perpetrator of a cyber-attack.\nWhen in 2010 cyber-security company Kaspersky started examining Stuxnet, a piece of malware that targeted Iranian nuclear centrifuges, it declared that 'Stuxnet's sophistication, purpose and the intelligence behind it suggest the involvement of a state'. Two years later, a New York Times report confirmed these suspicions, exposing Stuxnet as a joint US-Israeli operation. This case set a precedent in considering the sophistication of an attack as a criterion for assessing whether it was sponsored by a state. Thus, when in August 2012 malware called Shamoon infected the computers of Saudi Arabia's national oil company Aramco, US Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta declared in a briefing at the Pentagon that 'the attack on Aramco involved a pretty sophisticated tool. There are only a few countries in the world that have that capability'.\nAttribution of cyber-attacks – finding the identity of both the actors behind an attack and their sponsor – is difficult. Yet for a victim state, differentiating criminal attacks from those sponsored by state actors is essential, as they call for different responses. In one case, the victim state will want to prosecute the criminals. In the other, it may consider an array of diplomatic, economic and even military measures against the state that sponsored the attack. Without attribution, it is difficult to adapt national defence to a threat, let alone respond to it. The importance of attribution and its associated challenges have therefore led many experts to consider a number of criteria for assessing the possibility of state sponsorship, including sophistication. This criterion has considerable appeal, as it seems to be a simple way of making a connection between a cyber-attack and a state actor.\nIt is questionable, however, whether sophistication really is an appropriate criterion and it is important to ask how sophistication is being defined.\nCountering the current prevailing popularity of sophistication as a determinant of state sponsorship, this article argues that usage of the term reveals a lack of consensus over its definition. Moreover, as non-state actors have carried out attacks considered to be sophisticated, the utility of sophistication as a criterion is limited. A survey of the international legal framework governing attribution confirms this finding. Thus, while sophistication may appear to be an appealing criterion for assessing the likelihood of state sponsorship, it is not necessarily an accurate or sufficient one.\n# Different Contexts, Different Definitions ## Stuxnet The case of Stuxnet set a precedent in the use of sophistication as an indicator of the probability of state sponsorship. Focusing mainly on technical elements, analysts thought that Stuxnet was sophisticated for three reasons.4 First, the malware and its various versions remained undetected for years. Although the first version was probably created in 2005, it was not detected until 2010. Secondly, the malware had only one, very specific target that was not connected to the Internet: the controllers at the Natanz nuclear plant. Different versions © RUSI JOURNAL AUGUST/SEPTEMBER 2013 VOL. 158 NO. 4 pp. 62-68 DOI: 10.1080/03071847.2013.826509 GUITTON AND KORZAK of the malware were released and the last of these used four zero-day exploits – that is to say, previously undiscovered vulnerabilities in the system. Thirdly, when the malware found its target, it displayed incorrect values of valve pressure and rotation frequency to hide what it was doing – namely, irreversibly damaging the centrifuges. This process required specific and detailed knowledge of the system at the Natanz nuclear plant. Consequently, Kaspersky and other cybersecurity firms considered Stuxnet to be sophisticated because of its stealth, its high number of zero-day exploits and the precise intelligence it necessitated.\n# Shamoon Officials such as Panetta also considered Shamoon - the malware used to attack Saudi Arabia's national oil company Aramco - to be sophisticated. Applying the very technical definition of 'sophistication' used in the case of Stuxnet to this incident, however, reveals a lack of clarity and consistency.\nShamoon attempted to delete files on the computers that it infected, including the master boot record, to prevent the computers from starting again. However, the high visibility of the deletion mechanism quickly brought the attack to the attention of system administrators. Shamoon was therefore not stealthy. Nor was it novel: the deletion mechanism used was from a commercially available product called RawDisk. Lastly, the deletion mechanism did not always work. The mechanism was supposed to replace deleted files with the image of a burning US flag, but the image file was corrupted and only the first line of pixels appeared. If the goal of the attack was 'to stop the flow of oil and gas' - as Aramco's vice president for corporate planning, Abdullah Al-Saadan, believed - Shamoon failed in this regard. These mistakes led Kaspersky to call Shamoon 'quick and dirty'.\nAlthough this analysis shows that the technical criteria set by Stuxnet for 'sophistication' do not apply in the case of Shamoon, officials nonetheless considered it to be a sophisticated piece of malware. Such contradictory claims reveal a lack of definitional clarity with regard to the concept. Indeed, the case Saudi Aramco geoscientists and petroleum engineers at the Geosteering Centre in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. Image courtesy of saudiaramco.com.\nof Shamoon shows that, in addition to technical elements, sophistication can also be characterised by political elements, and that this broader definition includes the nature of the target and the motivation of the attackers. Additional criteria for sophistication thus include whether the target of the attack can be considered politically sensitive, and whether the attackers have a political objective.\nSaudi Arabia's national oil company was a politically sensitive target in the case of Shamoon. Aramco faces fierce competition from other oil companies - state-supported or otherwise - in addition to threats from various political activist movements. The ultimate purpose of the malware may well have been to cause substantial damage to Aramco and to impair its reputation as a secure company. With regard to motives and political objectives, a possible explanation for the attack is that Iran wished to retaliate against the straining sanctions regime that has hit the country - as asserted by an unnamed government official in the Washington Post.[8] A second explanation is that political activists chose Aramco as a symbol of the Saudi Arabian government and its wealth. An Arab activist group called the 'Cutting Sword of Justice' claimed that it targeted Aramco for political reasons, as it is the main source of revenue for Saudi Arabia, which it accuses of being involved in 'crimes and atrocities taking place in various countries around the world'.9 To support its claim, it released the IP addresses of all of Aramco's compromised servers, with the date and time of their breach. Aramco confirmed that the data released was accurate. Thus, there is evidence to suggest that on this occasion the motives may have been political.\n# The 'Comment Crew' In comparison to Stuxnet and Shamoon, which were both considered 'sophisticated', recent attacks on US companies were - perhaps surprisingly - not categorised as 'sophisticated'. In February 2013, the US cyber-security company Mandiant released a widely quoted report in which it identified the Chinese military - also referred to as the 'Comment Crew', or APT1 - as the perpetrator behind hundreds of attacks on mainly US companies.[10] These included one against the Coca-Cola Company, reported three months earlier by Bloomberg,[11] in which the attackers used a variety of malware sent via e-mails designed to entice their victims into opening them and releasing the malware - a technique known as spear-phishing. Despite this, neither of the reports by Mandiant and Bloomberg described the attacks as sophisticated. Similarly, two weeks before the publication of its report, Mandiant was investigating a breach at the New York Times, in co-ordination with the FBI, which followed an extensive report by the newspaper about the wealth of China's then premier, Wen Jiabao. The New York Times later repeatedly pointed to the possible involvement of the Chinese military in the cyber-attack. Yet again, neither Mandiant nor the New York Times referred to the attacks as being sophisticated.\nResponding to the publication of the Mandiant report, which was corroborated by many other intelligence reports, Tom Donilon, the national security adviser to the US president between October 2010 and June 2013, directly confronted China in requesting that its government investigate the allegations and engage in diplomatic discussions. However, in contrast to the reports by Mandiant and the New York Times, Donilon described the attacks as ‘sophisticated'. It is thus interesting to identify those elements that can account for this discrepancy in assessment.\nFirst, the attacks may genuinely have failed to impress analysts on a technical level with regard to stealth, the use of zero-day exploits and intelligence. This, however, may be an unfair depiction, as the attacks were sufficiently stealthy to evade the attention of the main cyber-security companies for years due to the updating of the techniques used. Modularity was therefore a key aspect of the malware. Its delivery, however, remained simple. To deliver the malware, the attackers required a certain amount of limited intelligence on the interests of the targeted individuals. However, unlike the Stuxnet case, such intelligence was easily available and did not require an in-depth understanding of technical systems that had not previously been widely studied (such as SCADA systems, used to control many different industrial processes and the target of the Stuxnet malware).\nSecondly, the attacks were an espionage campaign and thus differed from Stuxnet and Shamoon, which respectively aimed at inducing physical damage or destroying information in an attempt to sabotage operations. Therefore, on the part of the technical experts at least, the term ‘sophistication' appears to have been reserved for such sabotage operations, perhaps due to the complexity involved and the vividness and tangibility of the result. The destruction of nuclear centrifuges by Stuxnet and the erasure of data from 30,000 computers by Shamoon are both much more visible and seemingly impressive -- and can perhaps even be considered as more innovative in their goals -- than the ‘mere' leaking of information as a result of a cyber-attack.\nThis leads to the third reason for not characterising the attack as sophisticated: by refraining from doing so, Mandiant and the New York Times may have been seeking to create an image of Chinese hackers as less capable and innovative than their US counterparts. In this sense, the choice of words used in publicly describing a cyber-attack reflects a specific selection of its traits. The characterisation of an attack as ‘sophisticated' frames the perception of the enemy as being similarly sophisticated. Recent reports by the US Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Defense have explicitly made this leap from ‘sophisticated attack' to ‘sophisticated attacker', with several political implications for the response to an attack once attributed. Indeed, this shift can be used to enhance the apparent salience of the threat, facilitating moves towards changes in the regulatory framework, as seen in the renewed effort by the White House to pass cyber-security legislation.\nNevertheless, this framing in terms of a ‘sophisticated attacker' is counterproductive when considering the possible suspects behind the attacks. Despite the difficulty of assessing a country's capabilities, analysts try to parse states into categories, such as ‘enemy states with low capabilities' or ‘friendly states with high capabilities'. For example, defining an attack as ‘sophisticated' is likely to restrict the range of suspects and hypotheses under consideration, and thus may skew the analytical process. Attackers can exploit this bias and make effective use of the attribution problem to mislead investigators.\nThe analysis of the three case studies -- Stuxnet, Shamoon and the attacks carried out by the Comment Crew -- illustrates the lack of definitional clarity of the term ‘sophistication' and a lack of consistency in its use. In contrast to Stuxnet, the other case studies have shown that the label ‘sophistication' is not contingent upon crossing a technical threshold or fulfilling a specific set of technical criteria -- as also demonstrated by the Mandiant report. Indeed, as in the case of Shamoon, the political nature and targets of the attack may also influence whether it is thought to be sophisticated. Clearly, therefore, different elements play a preponderant role in the assessment of an attack's sophistication depending on the context. Such a lack of definitional consensus warrants clarification in its own right. More importantly, however, because sophistication is increasingly used as a reference point through which to establish the likelihood of state sponsorship, the use of the term can skew the attribution process and its outcome. The following cases illustrate that attacks considered to be sophisticated are not necessarily perpetrated by state actors. This suggests that caution is needed when using sophistication as a criterion in the attribution of a cyber-attack to a state actor.\n## Sophisticated Attacks by Criminals In the past, high-profile political organisations have been subject to numerous cyber-attacks carried out by criminals, despite the apparent lack of economic value. In particular, in the 1990s there was a series of hacks into US military networks that were first identified as sophisticated due to the political circumstances, with law-enforcement agencies initially thinking that state actors were behind these attacks. However, these were later revealed to be criminal cases.\nIn 1991, for example, in the midst of the Gulf War, a group of Dutch students hacked into thirty-four sites including NASA at the Kennedy Space Center, the Pentagon's Pacific Fleet Command and the Lawrence Livermore National GUITTON AND KORZAK Laboratory. The words they searched for in the networks – 'military', 'nuclear', 'missile', 'Desert Storm' and 'Desert Shield' – led the US to believe that a foreign intelligence service was behind the attack.[15] In 1994, British teenagers Richard Pryce and Mathew Bevan broke into the computers of NASA, several US Air Force bases and allegedly the defence company Lockheed Martin.[16] In February 1998, during a period of tense relations between the US and Iraq, three teenagers hacked into the US Air Force's networks.[17] Lastly, in 2001, British citizen Gary McKinnon broke into ninety-seven US computers, of which fifty-three belonged to the army, twenty-six to the navy, sixteen to NASA, one to the Department of Defense, and one to the air force.[18] These incidents illustrate that initial characterisations of sophistication involving high-profile political targets do not necessarily imply state sponsorship.\nThe aims of these attacks were confined to espionage; however, even in relation to sabotage operations, state actors are not alone in being able to carry out technically sophisticated and devastating attacks. In this way, the current director of national intelligence was inaccurate in his statement before Congress that only state actors can launch 'sophisticated' and 'devastating' attacks capable of inflicting 'long-term, wide-scale disruption of services'.[19] This false distinction between 'sophisticated' and 'non-sophisticated' relies on two equally false assumptions for which Stuxnet set the precedent: that only state actors can collect technical intelligence and that only state actors can appropriately test the malware to fine-tune it.\nFirst, state actors are no longer the sole collectors of intelligence. Criminals are highly capable of launching spear-phishing campaigns or using other tools to retrieve confidential information. Most criminals engaged in this type of activity are motivated by financial gain, and are mostly interested in retrieving credit-card data. However, other criminals and criminal groups with more political agendas can use cyber-attacks to gain access to technical intelligence that they would need in preparation for a larger attack. Recently, more tools have emerged that make the collection of intelligence even easier: for example, Shodan – a search engine which lists industrial control systems accessible from the Internet. Analysts should therefore not underestimate the capacity of individual criminals and organised criminal groups to acquire technical intelligence on a target in order to orchestrate sophisticated attacks.\nSecondly, there is an ongoing debate about the resources required for mounting attacks on industrial control systems, and more specifically, about the resources required to test the malware used to target such systems. On the one hand, David Sanger of the New York Times suggested that the US built a replica of Iran's centrifuges to fine-tune Stuxnet.[20] An attack on industrial control systems needs to override the mechanisms designed to interrupt the process controlled by the computers should they malfunction. The fine-tuning of the malware therefore aims to achieve this without technicians working on the industrial control systems becoming aware of the attacks. On the other hand, many experts think that it is relatively easy to mount and fine-tune attacks on many industrial control systems by replicating only the sensitive parts. For instance, Dale Peterson, a specialist in industrial control systems, concludes that: 'developing an ICS [industrial control system] cyber weapon is simple given a small team and access to the target product'.[21] Nor is it impossible to gain access to such systems. For example, a SCADA system can be smaller than a suitcase, and large manufacturers of such systems, such as Siemens, even lend them to researchers so that they can improve their security. With sufficient organisation, non-state actors can be creative enough to mount such technically sophisticated attacks. Therefore, having studied Stuxnet, political scientists Sean Collins and Stephen McCombie concluded that such attacks are 'open to a number of aggressors, not just nation states'.[22] This ongoing debate thus cautions against the assumption that only states can replicate an industrial-control-system environment. Indeed, it would be highly reductionist to think that only state actors have the skills for intelligence gathering and for mounting a devastating attack. Moreover, experience shows that non-state actors can develop new tactics with which to circumvent national cybersecurity measures, to remain stealthy and to sustain a high pace of attack. The Zeus malware – which creates a botnet, a network of computers controlled by commands issued by the botnet's master – is one such example.\nAlthough it does not target industrial control systems, the Zeus malware is comparable to Stuxnet in terms of its technical attributes: it is stealthy, modular and exploits many vulnerabilities. Unlike Stuxnet, however, Zeus was not engineered by a state actor. According to Microsoft, Zeus first appeared in late 2006, and has demonstrated an exceptionally long lifespan, given that it was still highly active in 2012.[23] Throughout this time, the malware's author constantly updated it with new functionalities to evade detection and to help the botnets already created to survive.[24] The malware's modularity and resistance to being detected quickly made it popular among criminals with a range of interests, although it remains used primarily in financial fraud. It has become clear that the author of Zeus is a professional at creating, updating and selling the modules that comprise the malware's suite of programmes: he or she sold copies of Zeus under licence, keeping the code private but offering to update it, similar to legitimate software companies.[25] Kevin McNally, a project manager at the US Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command, estimated that the author of the malware might have earned as much as $15 million in licensing fees.[26] The Zeus malware follows the technical elements of sophistication mentioned above: it is full of novelties and is effective, stealthy and modular, having proven robust against disruption. Yet it is not the result of a state-sponsored activity. The evidence suggests that the author's purpose in creating the malware is wholly criminal.[27] Thus, simply considering the sophistication of an attack and the malware behind it is insufficient and should not therefore be used to determine state sponsorship.\n\n## Legal Requirements for State Sponsorship\nThe ability to attribute a cyber-attack to a state under international law is critically important, as it determines which areas of law an attack invokes. If a state cannot attribute an attack to another state actor, the national laws and in particular the criminal laws of the targeted state apply. In contrast, if a state can impute responsibility for an attack to another state, then international law is applicable. This body of law, broadly speaking, governs relations between states. Thus, if a cyber-attack breaches international law, then the targeted state is entitled under those same laws to take certain measures in response. In exceptional circumstances a state may even resort to the use of force in self defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter, should the breach amount to an ‘armed attack'.^{28} As a result, attribution to a state is critical since the two areas of law -- domestic and international -- entail different response options.\nIndividual criteria, such as sophistication, can inform but not determine this assessment of state responsibility, which is instead guided by four longstanding, general norms structured around different categories of state involvement.\nFirst, the actions of state organs -- whether individuals or organisational entities -- are attributable to the state in question.^{29} Thus if a targeted state ascertained that a governmental organ -- be it civilian or military -- conducted a cyber-attack, it could hold the state itself responsible under public international law. In addition to this, the actions of persons or entities empowered by national law to exercise some degree of governmental authority are also attributable to a state. This, however, is only the case if the persons or entities are ‘acting in that capacity in the particular instance'.^{30} Independent contractors or privatised corporations entrusted with exercising certain governmental duties fall into this category.\nSecondly, and most interestingly, a victim state can also seek to attribute actions that were not undertaken by state organs or entities to another state, provided that the perpetrators acted ‘on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of', that state.^{31} This category encompasses individuals or organisations hired by states to conduct cyber-attacks. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the exact degree of control necessary to be proven for purposes of attribution has turned out to be somewhat problematic. The International Court of Justice set a fairly high standard in the 1984 Contra case involving Nicaragua, in which the government of Nicaragua accused the United States of, among other things, recruiting, organising, paying and commanding a paramilitary group known as the Contras. The Contras sought to subvert the Sandinistas, the socialist party that took power in 1979 in a coup d'état and which was regarded as communist by the US.\nThe court examined whether it could legally attribute acts committed by the Contras to the United States based on its involvement, but concluded the ‘financing, organizing, training, supplying and equipping of the contras, the selection of its military or paramilitary targets, and the planning of the whole of its operation' was ‘still insufficient' to legally attribute acts committed by the Contras to the United States.^{32} In this case, state responsibility could not be imputed unless the United States had clearly exerted ‘effective control' over the military and paramilitary operations of the Contras,^{33} suggesting that control of an individual or a group with respect to the overall actions taken is not sufficient. Rather, the state making the allegation needs to show that the accused state had control over or gave instructions with respect to every action in question. Thus, in addition to the challenge of obtaining factual proof of any kind of state involvement, the court set a high standard of ‘effective control' for purposes of legal attribution.^{34}\nWhile the Nicaraguan regime's effort to legally attribute the actions of the Contras to the US failed, on a political level it had little doubt about US involvement in supporting the Contras' operations. For instance, the Associated Press reporter Eloy Aguilar wrote in April 1984 that ‘CIA support for the Nicaraguan Democratic Force is evident and openly discussed in Congress'.^{35} Although the court did not establish legal responsibility on the part of the US, it did acknowledge the substantial level of state involvement. However, as the Nicaragua case showed, attribution on a political level does not necessarily equate to state responsibility under international law.\nThirdly, even if a targeted state cannot attribute a cyber-attack to another state under the foregoing principles, it may still hold that state responsible if it subsequently ‘acknowledges and adopts the conduct in question as its own'.^{36} For instance, although the initial attack on the United States' embassy in Tehran in 1979 was not attributable to Iran, the subsequent endorsement of the Iranian authorities turned the occupation of the embassy into an act of the Iranian state.\nLastly, every state has an ‘obligation to not allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States'.^{37} On this basis a state can be held responsible if it does not take necessary and reasonable measures to prevent or stop a cyber-attack. It is important to note that under this principle a state is only responsible for its failure to stop the attack; it cannot be held legally responsible for the actual attack (provided that the state was not involved in the attack under the foregoing principles).^{38} The lack of technical expertise in certain countries might render the application of this principle a problematic policy option.\nConsidering these four principles governing the legal process of attributing an attack to a state, it becomes apparent that the standards necessary for attribution are stringent. The second category in particular -- whether an attack is conducted under the direction or control of a state -- requires proof of ‘effective control' of particular attacks or actions. The level of state involvement required is considerable. As mentioned above, the International Court of Justice regarded even the financing, organising and training of the Contras as insufficient\nGUITTON AND KORZAK\ninvolvement to legally attribute the acts of the group to the United States.\nIn addition, the standard of factual evidence required to prove state involvement can likewise pose significant challenges. For example, in the Oil Platforms case between Iran and the United States – which arose during the 1980–88 Iran-Iraq War – the International Court of Justice ruled in 2003 that the United States had not provided sufficient evidence to prove that Iran was responsible for a 1987 missile attack on a US-flagged tanker, the Sea Isle City.³⁹ The evidence put forward by the United States included satellite imagery of missile sites, expert reports as well as eyewitness testimonies. The standard of evidence required in this case proved to be demanding, although it involved the use of traditional physical force, which often leaves behind a trail of evidence (such as missile sites and other staging grounds, troop movements, or records of the supply of munitions and materiel). In contrast, investigators of cyber-attacks have access only to intangible traces to prove an actor's culpability. Moreover, if the attacks are not conducted by government organs but by individuals or groups directed by a state, the victim state will have to demonstrate that the accused state had 'effective control' in order to impute responsibility to it.\nThese high standards incorporated in the legal framework that governs state attribution, coupled with the plausible deniability and veil of anonymity afforded by cyber-attacks, create an international legal landscape of attribution highly unsatisfactory to most policy-makers.\nThe challenge of attribution in relation to cyber-attack has led Matthew Hoisington, for instance, to suggest\nthat policy-makers should significantly lower the standards of legal attribution, particularly in the case of attacks prompting a response in self-defence. Accordingly, if an attack targets critical national infrastructure, 'a state could respond in presumptively good-faith self-defense without first attributing or characterizing the attack to the level of specificity required under the traditional formulation'.⁴⁰ However, such calls are misplaced. The veil of anonymity and deniability inherent to cyber-attacks is exactly the reason why standards of attribution should remain high, so as to avoid innocent states being accused of conducting cyber-attacks – and being the potential victim of misplaced retaliation. Third parties could also exploit longstanding tensions between states in order to escalate conflict situations.\nIn light of the arguably unsatisfactory legal framework of attribution, the popularity of sophistication as a criterion in attributing attacks to a state appears understandable. Yet, as has been shown, attribution in legal terms is assessed based on varying degrees of state involvement. According to the principles mentioned above, a victim state would need to ascertain whether an attack originated from a state organ or whether the state in question was in 'effective control' of the entity conducting the attack. The criterion of sophistication cannot replace these guiding principles of the legal assessment of attribution. Sophistication can only serve as an element of evidence within this framework.\n## Conclusion\nThere is no common understanding of the term 'sophistication' as it is used by prominent political figures or by technical\nexperts in the cyber-security debate. By looking at different case studies, this article has identified several technical and political elements that characterise sophistication in each individual context. The lack of clarity and consistency in the use of the term hinders an informed discussion about the significance of sophistication as a criterion for assessing the likelihood of state sponsorship.\nFurther, counter-examples have shown that sophistication alone cannot serve as a conclusive determinant in this regard. Sophistication does not necessarily imply state sponsorship — and vice versa. Moreover, the determination of state sponsorship or responsibility in international legal terms follows a different set of criteria based on varying degrees of state involvement. In this framework, sophistication can play only a limited role. It can serve to strengthen or weaken evidence brought forward, but will never constitute a legal criterion in itself. It is therefore important to caution against the significance of sophistication as a seemingly appealing criterion for attribution.\nClement Guitton is a PhD candidate in the Department of War Studies at King's College London currently working on the problem of attribution.
