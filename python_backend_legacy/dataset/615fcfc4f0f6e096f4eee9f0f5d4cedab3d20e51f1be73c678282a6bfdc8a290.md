Attribution of cyberattacks to the state is difficult. Though the doctrine of due diligence has the potential to addresses this problem by lowering the threshold of attribution, it may unduly expand the scope of State responsibility. In addition, the procedural requirements for takings countermeasures are impractical in cyberspace. The substantive requirement of proportionality is of fundamental importance, but lacks clear and workable benchmark. Therefore, application of countermeasures in cyberspace is fraught with uncertainties and international law on this issue remains unsettled.\nKeywords: cyberattack; countermeasures; attribution; principle of proportionality; due diligence\n# I. Introduction\nIn recent years, cyberattacks have become more frequent. How to respond to cyberattacks and maintain cyber security has become an issue with significant strategic and practical implications that needs to be addressed urgently in the international community. Under international law, the injured State enjoys the right of self-defense against internationally wrongful acts that have reached the level of armed attack.¹ However, in practice, most cyberattacks do not reach the required threshold of use of force, letting alone an armed attack.² Taking the 2010 “Stuxnet” Incident for example, the prevailing view was that the cyberattacks did not constitute an armed attack in international law, notwithstanding that the virus had led to the damage of thousands of Iranian uranium enrichment centrifuges. Therefore, in most cases, a State is not able to exercise its right to self-defense against a cyberattack.³\n* ZHU Lei (朱磊), Ph.D. in Law, associate professor at the Wuhan University Institute of International Law in China.\n¹ Armed attacks are the most serious type of use of force, according to the International Court of Justice’s opinion in the Nicaragua case. See Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), Judgement, ICJ Reports 1986, para.191.\n² See Michael N. Schmitt ed., Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations, at 538–531 (2nd edition, Cambridge University Press 2017). The book propose eight factors for assessing whether a cyberattack constitutes the use of force, including, severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability of effects, military character, state involvement and presumptive legality.\n³ See Robin Geiss &amp; Henning Lahmann, Freedom and Security in Cyberspace: Shifting the Focus Away from Military Responses towards Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention, in Katharina Ziolkowski ed., Peacetime Regime for State Activities in Cyberspace: International Law, International Relations and Diplomacy, at 628 (NATO CCDCOE Publication 2013).\nWuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers\nIn response to these cyberattacks which do not rise to the level of an armed attack, States tend to respond in a non-forceful and peaceful manner in practice. For example, in January 2015, the United States (\"USA\") imposed economic sanctions on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea as a response to the cyberattack on Sony Pictures Entertainment.⁴ In response to the allegation that Russia had interfered in the United States' General Election through cyberattacks, the USA announced the expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats in December 2016.⁵\nCyberspace is considered as the new frontier of national sovereignty and international law is applicable in this area.⁶ The legal nature and status of the actions taken by the injured State in response to cyberattacks under international law is an issue that deserves serious consideration, in which the central issue involved is that of countermeasures. Similar to the right of self-defense, it allows a State to take its own measures of private remedies against an internationally wrongful act. Where certain conditions are met, it can preclude the wrongfulness of those measures and thereby relieve the responsibility of the State.\nThe countermeasure as a customary international law with a long history is controversial in international law. Its application to cyberspace is even more challenging because as an emerging field of science and technology, cyberspace has characteristics different from those areas of traditional State sovereignty. This paper analyzes how countermeasures in international law are applied to cyberspace in light of the characteristics of cyberspace, and examines the main issues and controversies in the application of countermeasures to cyberspace.\n## II. The Historical Development and Inherent Contradictories of Countermeasures\n## 1. Historical Development of Countermeasures\nThe term \"countermeasure\" was first used by the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office of the United Kingdom in 1916 in its correspondences with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Sweden.⁷ And the first detailed discussion on countermeasures was in the *Air Services Agreement* arbitration case in 1978.⁸ In this case, the USA made its claim based on countermeasures, which\n⁴ See Zhuang Xiaodan, *Revenge for Sony Pictures? US Launches New Round of Sanctions against North Korea*, at https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_1290937 (last visited June 3, 2023).\n⁵ See Lu Jiafei &amp; Xu Jianmei, *U.S. Announces Sanctions against Russia for Alleged Cyberattacks to Interfere in U.S. Election*, at https://world.huanqiu.com/article/9CaKrnJZtjV (last visited June 3, 2019).\n⁶ UN Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (\"UNGGE\"), the main platform and mechanism for official intergovernmental dialogue on international law in cyberspace, acknowledged in its 2013 report that international law applies in cyberspace. See UN, A/68/98.\n⁷ See Omer Yousif Elagab, *The Place of Non-Forcible Counter-Measures in Contemporary International Law*, in Guy S. Goodwin-Gill &amp; Stefan Talmon eds., *The Reality of International Law: Essays in Honour of Ian Brownlie*, at 125 (Oxford University Press 1999).\n⁸ See the *Air Service Agreement* of 27 March 1946 between the United States of America and France (1978) 18 RIAA 417.\nThe Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law\nwas upheld by the Arbitral Tribunal.⁹ The term was widely used after the Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (“Draft Articles on Responsibility of States”), adopted by the International Law Commission of the United Nations (“UNILC”) in 2001, which used the term and contained detailed rules on countermeasures in seven articles.¹⁰\nThe historical root of countermeasures is found in the traditional international law concept of reprisals,¹¹ which is essentially a mechanism of private remedy. The concept of “countermeasures” is used as a synonym for “reprisals” and inherits the key elements of the latter. The institution of reprisals in international law has a long history and its development can be divided into three stages.\nThe first stage was a completely liberal private reprisal, which was common in the early stage of the development of the rule of law, during which the State apparatus was not yet in place and public enforcement mechanisms for the law were missing. Where the rights of individuals were violated without remedy from public power, they could take it upon themselves to enforce the law and take reprisals as a means of obtaining the relief. In ancient Greece, the customary law of seizing foreigners existed in the city-states of Athens. Where a citizen of a city-state was killed by a foreigner or the government, the relatives of the victim enjoyed the right to capture and detain three citizens of that foreign state as hostages and demand that the perpetrator be presented or compensated. Where the claim was not met, the victim’s relatives would enjoy the right to kill the hostages to pay back the blood debt.¹²\nThe second stage was the reprisal authorized by the State, essentially to incorporate reprisal into the framework of State regulation. The letter of reprisal¹³ offers a good example. It has its roots in Roman law.¹⁴ In ancient Rome, public authorities became involved in the system of reprisals and regulated it strictly. If the rights of a Roman citizen (especially a merchant) were violated by an alien, the victim could seize the citizen of that State to retaliate with procedural and substantive restrictions. Before the reprisal could be carried out, the victim must apply to the relevant State authority for a permit to do so. The precondition of obtaining the permit is that the victim had been treated unfairly by the courts of a foreign State and that his or her damages could not be compensated and his or her rights could not be remedied. The scope must be limited to the actual damage suffered by the victim and the seizure by force can be carried out only within the Roman territory or on international waters.¹⁵\n⁹ Omer Yousif Elagab, supra note 7, at 125–126.\n¹⁰ The International Court of Justice referred to the term twice in 1980 in the United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran case, and several times in the Nicaragua case in 1986.\n¹¹ See Malcolm N. Shaw, International Law 794 (Cambridge University Press 2008).\n¹² See David J. Bederman, International Law in Antiquity, at 123 (Cambridge University Press 2007).\n¹³ Letter of reprisal is also known as letter of marquee.\n¹⁴ Its modern formulation can be found in the Constitution of the United States of America, which in Section 8 of Article 1 authorizes the Congress to grant letters of marque and reprisal.\n¹⁵ See Wilhelm G. Grewe, The Epochs of International Law, at 117 (De Gruyter 2000).\nWuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers\nDuring the medieval period, reprisals centered on the letter of marquee, whereby armed privateers, with government concession, may chase and destroy foreign lawbreakers and fleets, as well as attack and plunder enemy merchant ships. By the 16th Century, wartime plundering became quite widespread and many States began to legislate and regulate the granting of such letters. Hugo Grotius in his book (1604), *De Jure Praedae*, legally defended the act of Dutch ships attacking Portuguese and Spanish ships. He argued that the granting of permit was akin to declaring a “private war,” justified by the fact that the laws of each State had no effective jurisdiction over the seas and that merchant ships had to arm themselves in self-defense.^[16]^\nThe third stage was to prohibit the use of forcible reprisal. Traditional reprisal includes both forcible and non-forcible means, the majority of which is forcible. In the early 20th Century, the international community restricted the use of force through a series of conventions. Modern international law prohibits the use of force and the Charter of the United Nations explicitly prohibits the use of force and the threat of force. As a result, forcible reprisal eventually receded from the stage of history. Accordingly, the term “countermeasures,” also known as “non-forcible reprisal,” was adopted to conform to the development of modern international law, which corresponded to reprisals by non-forcible means. In this way, the term can distinguish itself from reprisals by force and avoid the negative connotations associated with the concept of reprisals in traditional international law.^[17]^\n## 2. The Inherent Contradictories of Countermeasures\nA review of the historical development reveals its inherent tensions and contradictories, which is also the core issue to be addressed in contemporary international law. On the one hand, the existence of countermeasures is justified. In the absence of adequate public enforcement mechanisms when the rule of law is weak, reprisal offers a workable and efficient private solution. In domestic law, with the development of the rule of law, private enforcement of the law was increasingly limited and ultimately superseded by public enforcement of the law. By contrast, international law is based on the principle of sovereign equality and the international community is an egalitarian society. International law has an inherent flaw in that it lacks a centralized enforcement mechanism with enforcement authority that overrides the State, resulting in inadequate supply of public remedies. Therefore, it is necessary to have countermeasures as a form of private national remedies.\nThe essence of countermeasures, on the other hand, is to leave law enforcement in private hands, which could be harmful and even dangerous. Without any constraints, reprisal is highly vulnerable to abuse, plunging the international law into law of the jungle. Though the medieval letter of marquee was under the State’s regulation, it was often no different than piracy in practice. Bartolus de Saxoferrato (1314-1357), a famous European medieval jurist, wrote in a work published in\n^[16] See Hugo Grotius, *Commentary on the Law of Prize and Booty*, at 62 (Liberty Fund 2012).\n^[17] See Mary Ellen O’Connell, *The Power and Purpose of International Law: Insights from the Theory and Practice of Enforcement*, at 233 (Oxford University Press 2011).\nThe Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law\n1354 that reprisal was an “odious remedy” that could result in counter-retaliation, intensifying conflicts between the two nations, and sabotage their interactions as well as their economic and trade relations.¹⁸ He, therefore, pushed for tight restrictions on reprisals.\nBut, how can the balance between the reasonableness and the harm of countermeasures be achieved? This is the most difficult and contentious issue in the modern international law regime on countermeasures, which is also evident in the drafting process of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States. Although the majority of States recognized the necessity of countermeasures, many expressed concerns about the harmfulness of countermeasures. Therefore, in order to prevent the abuse of countermeasures, the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States adopted the principle of “conditional lawfulness” for countermeasures and set strict requirements for their implementation, in an attempt to prevent such measures from becoming tools for strong States to oppress weak States. Only countermeasures that have met these conditions are lawful; otherwise, they would be considered as internationally wrongful acts.\nThe rules established in the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States are the authoritative expression of modern international law on countermeasures, but they are also highly contentious. The fundamental disagreement during the development of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States was over the legal status of countermeasures, especially whether they are lawful or unlawful in nature. Representatives of some States took a positive attitude towards countermeasures, proposing that countermeasures are lawful in themselves, which are the rights enjoyed by States in international law, and are unlawful only under certain exceptional circumstances. However, this view was not supported by the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States which regarded countermeasures as unlawful *per se*.¹⁹ Countermeasures are internationally wrongful act that are in breach of internationally law, with the possibility of excluding the international wrongfulness of the act under certain circumstances. Therefore, countermeasures involve a situation excluding the wrongfulness of the act and may be invoked a defense to the accusation of internationally wrongful act. This fundamental stance taken by the UNILC is to discourage rather than promote the use of countermeasures.\nIn summary, countermeasures are the private enforcement of the law and have certain negative consequences. The historical development of countermeasures is a process of introducing more restrictions on its use and to bring it under the regulation of the law. In the meanwhile, international community is egalitarian in nature, which provides the solid foundation for its existence as an accepted form of enforcement under customary international law. Setting clear requirements for their use, mitigating their harmfulness, and limiting their application within an acceptable boundary are the key purpose for modern international law regime on countermeasures.\n¹⁸ Wilhelm G. Grewe, *supra* note 15, at 117.\n¹⁹ This basic principle is also reflected in Tallinn Manual 2.0 on International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations. See Michael N. Schmitt, *supra* note 2, at 225.\nWuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers\n## III. Prerequisites for Taking Countermeasures in Cyberspace: Internationally Wrongful Acts in Cyberspace\n## 1. Temporal Limitation of Countermeasures\nThe existence of an internationally wrongful act is a prerequisite for taking countermeasures, which is the primary reason for the exclusion of its wrongfulness.²⁰ Countermeasures are similar to self-defense in this regard, which are taken in response to a prior internationally wrongful act by another State. As a result, countermeasures should be considered as the “shield” for defense rather than the “spear” for offense. The absence of an effective enforcement mechanism in international law allows the injured State to suspend its international obligations only when the other State has violated the law in the first place. In other words, the essence of countermeasures is to counteract an internationally wrongful act with an illegal act, with the goal of forcing the injuring State to resume its international obligations and restore normal relations between the two nations. Therefore, countermeasures are a part of the enforcement mechanism of international law, through which the injured State are able to protect its own rights and interests, thus also a mechanism of remedy in international law.\nCountermeasures must be taken against an ongoing internationally wrongful act and are not preventive or prospective. Once the wrongful act ceases, the countermeasures must also be ceased.²¹ Thus, if a cyberattack has not yet occurred or has ended, the injured State shall not take countermeasures. This rule significantly limits the possibility of an injured State to take countermeasures in response to a cyber-related wrongful act, because unlike traditional internationally wrongful acts, most cyberattacks are sudden and short-lived, leaving only a relatively limited period of time for an injured State to respond and diminishing the possibility of taking countermeasures in response to a cyberattack.\nIt is worth noting that modern cyberattacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, often requiring a large investment of manpower and resources, and their complexity and destructive power may be no less than a small-scale war.²² Complex cyberattacks take a long time from planning to actual implementation involving multiple steps such as intelligence collection, vulnerability detection, intrusion and infiltration into the network, and virus implantation. They often require coordination and cooperation of a professional and technical team. The time span of cyberattacks provides the opportunities and possibilities for injured State to monitor and detect cyberattacks earlier.\n---\n²⁰ See Denis Alland, *Countermeasures of General Interest*, 13 European Journal of International Law 1221 (2002).\n²¹ See Maurice Kamto, *The Time Factor in the Application of Countermeasures*, in James Crawford et al. eds., *The Law of International Responsibility*, at 1176 (Oxford University Press 2010).\n²² See Jiang Shibo, *Cyber Attacks and the Application of the Laws of War*, 16(2) Wuhan University International Law Review 43–70 (2014).\nThe Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law\nThe cyberattack on the Ukrainian power grid on 23 December 2015 offers a good illustration. The cyberattack began in the spring of 2014, when the attackers first spear-phished IT staff and system administrators, causing viruses to infect systems and opening backdoors for subsequent cyberattacks. Over the following months, the attackers conducted extensive network reconnaissance, exploration and mapping efforts and gained the ability to manage user accounts within the network and employee login credentials. The final step of the cyberattack consisted of a series of coordinated actions, including reconfiguring the uninterruptible power supply, disconnecting the circuit breaker to take the substation offline, and launching a denial-of-service attack on the customer call center.[23]\nIn order to deal with sophisticated cyberattacks, the injured State should develop and improve its capabilities of cyber-related technology, strengthen real-time supervision over cyberattacks, detect ongoing cyberattacks at an early stage, and fix vulnerabilities of the system and strengthen measures for cyber prevention and defense. If the cyberattack is still at such an early stage as the planning, vulnerability detection and intelligence gathering, the injured State should exercise restraint and should not take countermeasures; otherwise, it may cause miscalculation and lead to the escalation of disputes. Once a cyberattack enters the next stage of implementation, such as planting viruses and stealing account information, etc., it constitutes an internationally wrongful act in violation of international law, at which time the injured State may take countermeasures against the act without waiting for the final stage of the cyberattack to unfold.\n## 2. Attribution of Internationally Wrongful Acts\nUnder international law, countermeasures are measures taken by a state against another state, which carries two important implications. Although enterprises are frequently subject to cyberattacks,[24] the measures taken by enterprises in response to cyberattacks do not constitute the countermeasures under international law.[25] Second, the object of countermeasures must be the State rather than non-State actors. In reality, there are very few inter-State cyberattacks, and most of such attacks are initiated by private non-State actors (e.g., patriotic hackers and lone wolves).[26] The first issue to be addressed in determining whether there is an internationally wrongful act is the attribution of cyberattacks, i.e., whether privately committed acts can be attributed to the State and constitute acts of the State.[27] If a cyberattack committed by a non-State actor is not attributed to the State, it\n[23] See Kim Zetter, Inside the Cunning, Unprecedented Hack of Ukraine’s Power Grid, at https://www.wired.com/2016/03/inside-cunning-unprecedented-hack-ukraines-power-grid/ (last visited June 3, 2023).\n[24] The 2017 Annual Internet Security Report released by Tencent Security pointed out that up to 86% of companies worldwide had experienced at least one cyberattack in 2017. Tencent’s 2017 Annual Internet Security Report: Nearly 90% of Global Companies Suffered Cyber Attacks, at http://tech.chinadaily.com.cn/2018-01/31/content_35621606.htm (last visited June 3, 2019).\n[25] See Michael N. Schmitt, Below the Threshold Cyber Operations: The Counter-Measures Response Option and International Law, 54 Virginia Journal of International Law 697 (2014).\n[26] See Michael N. Schmitt, In Defense of Due Diligence in Cyberspace, 125 Yale Law Journal Forum 77 (2015).\n[27] See Tom Ruys, Sanctions, Retorsions and Countermeasures: Concepts and International Legal Framework, in Larissa van den Herik ed., Research Handbook on UN Sanctions and International Law, at 14 (Edward Elgar Publishing 2016).\nWuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers\nmay constitute a violation of domestic law, but not an internationally wrongful act in violation of international law, and the injured State cannot take countermeasures against such acts.²⁸\nAttribution is an extremely challenging issue in identifying State responsibility in cyberspace, involving three layers of attribution. First, from the technical perspective, unlike traditional physical domains such as sea, land and air, the cyberspace is a decentralized system. Cyberspace is open, pluralistic, interoperable, and anonymous, and attackers often use encryption technology to transmit information in packets to hide their identities and sources, making the investigation of the source of cyberattacks quite complex, costly and protracted.²⁹\nSecond, after locating the source of cyberattacks through technical means, the subject behind the cyberattacks also needs to be identified. Even if the IP address is traced to a State's cyber infrastructure, it may not meet the criteria of burden of proof for attribution because IP addresses can be spoofed. For example, in 2013, an organization impersonating its IP address as from the Ukrainian government conducted cyber operations against the NATO Cyber Cooperative Defense Center of Excellence, the Estonian Defense Forces, and the armed forces of other NATO countries. Clearly, the conduct could not be attributed to the Ukrainian government.³⁰\nFinally, it remains to determine whether the act committed by the attackers constitutes the act of a State, i.e., legal attribution. The key issue is whether cyberattacks committed by non-State actors can be attributed to the State and constitute internationally wrongful acts that entails State responsibility. The challenge is degree of connection required for attribution to the State the cyberattacks committed by non-State actors. Under Article 8 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States, the conduct of non-State actors acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of a State is attributable to that State. The International Court of Justice (\"ICJ\") established the doctrine of \"effective control\" in the Nicaragua case in 1987. In that case, the USA played a significant and decisive role in financing, organizing, training, supplying, and equipping the Nicaraguan Contras, but the ICJ found that the series of U.S. acts did not constitute \"effective control\"³¹ and thus could not meet the standard of attribution.\nThe doctrine of effective control requires the State play a direct and a leading role in the cyberattacks, not just a supporting one, setting a higher threshold for State responsibility for private conduct. For example, the USA believed that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea played a \"central role\" in the 2014 cyberattack on Sony Pictures, which rose to the level of effective control and imposed\n²⁸ See Michael N. Schmitt, *Peacetime Cyber Responses and Wartime Cyber Operations under International Law: An Analytical Vade Mecum*, 8 Harvard National Security Journal 260 (2017).\n²⁹ See Huang Zhixiong ed., *On Cyber Sovereignty—Jurisprudence, Policy and Practice*, at 39 (Social Sciences Academic Press 2017).\n³⁰ See Michael N. Schmitt, *supra* note 2, at 203.\n³¹ *Supra* note 1, at para. 115.\nThe Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law\nsanctions against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.³² In contrast, Iranian hackers conducted DDoS cyberattacks against a number of U.S. financial institutions between 2011 and 2013. Although these hackers had ties to the Iranian government, such ties did not rise to the level of effective control and therefore the attacks could not be attributed to Iran and the USA could not take countermeasures against Iran accordingly.³³\nThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 on International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations (“Tallinn Manual 2.0”) adopts the ICJ’s standard of effective control. It gives the following illustrative example. A State plans and oversees an operation to use a software update to implant a new vulnerability in software widely used by another state in its governmental computers. The former State enters into a confidential contract with the company that produced the software to embed the vulnerability and directs the course of action. In such a case the State planned, directed, and supervised over a particular cyberattack and took a leading and direct role in the operation, which is fundamentally different from the ancillary role played by the US government in the Nicaragua case and thus the company’s conduct is attributable to the State.³⁴\nThe doctrine of effective control adopts a relatively stringent criterion of attribution, which makes it difficult for the injured State to prove, thus severely limiting the application of countermeasures. In practice, the injuring State may not directly organize the implementation of cyberattacks, but indirectly support cyberattacks as a way to avoid State responsibility. Moreover, cyberattacks are secretive and complex, and attackers often use technical means to hide the source of the attack, so it is not easy to obtain conclusive evidence to prove the extent of State involvement in such cyberattacks and the role played by the State. And such evidence is often located in the injuring State or even across the globe, which is difficult to obtain and even if obtained, the timing for taking countermeasures may has already elapsed.³⁵ For example, Estonia was subjected to a DDoS attack in 2007 and investigation revealed that the source of the attack was computers from 178 countries, including Vietnam and the USA. The cyberattack lasted for three weeks, providing a valuable time for evidence collection and attribution. However, to date, there is still no conclusive evidence of to attribute the responsibility to Russia.³⁶\nIn summary, the rules on attribution in international law are established for traditional internationally wrongful acts and thus are difficult to apply to cyberspace. It has the effect of greatly limiting the possibility of taking countermeasures in cyberspace. Some scholars argued that the constraints of existing customary law should be lifted and States should be allowed to take countermeasures\n³² Zhuang Xiaodan, supra note 4.\n³³ See BBC: US Indicts 7 Iranian Hackers for Breaching Multiple Financial Firms, at https://news.youth.cn/gj/201603/t20160325_7779822.htm (last visited June 3, 2019).\n³⁴ See Michael N. Schmitt, supra note 2, at 209.\n³⁵ See Article 53 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States.\n³⁶ See Wang Shiying, Estonia’s Cybersecurity Policies and Practices and Its Role in the NATO Process, at http://www.sohu.com/a/138699619_257305 (last visited June 3, 2019).\nWuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers\nagainst non-State actors.³⁷ It essentially treats non-State actors as the subject of responsibility in international law, thus a departure from the basic principle of international law, which may have disturbing and far-reaching impact on the existing international order.\n## 3. Due Diligence\nTo address the difficulty of attribution under the doctrine of effective control, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 introduces due diligence into cyberspace, proposing that a State must exercise due diligence in not allowing its territory, or territory or cyber infrastructure under its governmental control, to be used for cyber operations that affect the rights of, and produce serious adverse consequences for, other States.³⁸ This lowers the criterion of attribution required by the doctrine of effective control and reduces the threshold of State responsibility for acts of private subjects, essentially as a type of vicarious liability.³⁹ This is an important development and breakthrough compared to the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (Tallinn Manual 1.0).\nThe ICJ has affirmed the doctrine of due diligence in the Corfu Channel case,⁴⁰ the Tehran Hostage case,⁴¹ and the Nicaragua case.⁴² For example, in the Corfu Channel case, although the mines were not laid by Albania, the area where the incident occurred was Albanian territorial waters and Albania should bear the regulatory responsibility for that area. Also, judging from the geographical location and expertise, Albania had the knowledge of the mines laid in the Corfu Channel,⁴³ but failed to take relevant measures, and therefore should bear responsibility. The ICJ stated that every State has an obligation “not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States.”⁴⁴\nUnder the doctrine of due diligence, a State must take active measures to prevent, reduce or limit the occurrence of damage, which is essentially an obligation to prevent transnational damage. The infrastructure on which cyberspace is based is physical, located in a particular State, and falls within the sovereign jurisdiction of that State, and due diligence is equally applicable. This basic position was also adopted by the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Information Security (“UNGGE”) in its report issued in 2015.⁴⁵ Therefore, if a State violates due diligence in\n³⁷ See Gary Corn &amp; Eric Talbot Jensen, *The Use of Force and Cyber Countermeasures*, 32 Temple International &amp; Comparative Law Journal 127 (2018).\n³⁸ See Michael N. Schmitt, *supra* note 2, at 128.\n³⁹ See Huang Zhixiong, *The Attribution of Cyberattacks in International Law*, 5 Global Law Review 164 (2014).\n⁴⁰ See Corfu Channel (United Kingdom v. Albania), Judgment, ICJ Reports 1949, at 22.\n⁴¹ See the United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran (United States v. Iran), Judgment, ICJ Report 1980, para. 63.\n⁴² *Supra* note 1, at para.157.\n⁴³ *Supra* note 40, at para. 65.\n⁴⁴ *Supra* note 40, at para. 67.\n⁴⁵ See UN, A/70/174.\nThe Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law\ncyberspace, it constitutes an internationally wrongful act and the injured State is entitled to take countermeasures.\nThe most controversial issue in practice is the scope of the obligation assumed by a State under the doctrine of due diligence. On this issue, two extreme positions should be avoided. If a liberal approach is adopted, i.e., a State assumes little or even no obligation, this will lead to the abuse of the principle of sovereignty, allowing the use of network facilities to infringe upon the interests of other States.\nOn the other hand, an expanded interpretation would broaden the scope of due diligence, constitute an unreasonable restriction on State sovereignty, which lacks a basis in international law. In this regard, the view of U.S. military judge Matthew J. Sklerov is quite representative. He advocated that strict criminal legislation and law enforcement could effectively prevent cyberattacks,⁴⁶ and argued that the State's obligation in cyberspace includes passing stringent criminal laws, conducting vigorous investigations, prosecuting attackers, and, during the investigation and prosecution, cooperating with the victim state of cyberattacks that originated from within their borders.⁴⁷ According to this view, knowledge of the occurrence of the damage is also not a requirement for the assumption of due diligence.⁴⁸ In other words, the State has the obligation to take active criminal action to prevent and stop illegal cyberattacks, and the State's negligence or omission in any respect constitutes tacit approval and sheltering of such attacks⁴⁹ and constitutes a violation of due diligence.\nIn practice, however, cyberattacks are often deceptive and disguised, and attackers may use the network infrastructure of other States to carry out remote attacks. Matthew J. Sklerov's view underestimated the complexity of cyberattacks in practice, which may lead to a misjudgment on state responsibility of cyberattacks. The USA, with its significant political, economic, and military position in the world, is often the target of cyberattacks, but it is difficult to hold the relevant States responsible in practice due to the problem of attribution. This view which expands the scope of due diligence attempts to lift the constraints and limitations under traditional rules of international law and to lower the threshold of State responsibility, thus enabling the USA to take countermeasures against other States more easily. Such practice should come under close scrutiny.\nThe appropriate approach on this issue is to return to the current framework of international law under which a State assumes due diligence responsibility only to the extent of knowledge on the occurrence of damage.⁵⁰ This basic principle was also endorsed in the report of the UNGGE issued in 2015, and is a commonly held position by States. Under this doctrine, knowledge may be actual\n⁴⁶ See Matthew J. Sklerov, Solving the Dilemma of State Responses to Cyberattacks: A Justification for the Use of Active Defenses against States Who Neglect Their Duty to Prevent, 201 Military Law Review 71 (2009).\n⁴⁷ Id., at 62.\n⁴⁸ Id., at 71.\n⁴⁹ Id.\n⁵⁰ Supra note 40, at para.18.\nWuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers\nor constructive. A State may be found to have actual knowledge of a cyberattack if it has detected or has been notified by the injured State of an attack originating from that country.^[51]^ The essence of constructive knowledge is the reverse of the burden of proof. The challenge of attribution in cyberspace is evidence, and in the case of constructive knowledge the burden of proof is shifted to the territorial State where the cyberattack originated which have more evidence than the victim state. Therefore it is presumed to have knowledge of the cyberattack with the possibility of rebuttal.^[52]^\nWith the sheer number of Internet users and the technology to hide their identities and even erase traces of Internet access, it is almost impossible to achieve complete and comprehensive regulation in cyberspace. But this does not mean that the State is unaware of cyber operations within its borders. Whether a State is aware of cyberattacks is closely related to its technical capacities and the regulatory policy it adopts in cyberspace.\nCyberspace is highly complex and technical in nature, and cyber regulation relies on the relevant cyber technical capacities which many developing countries may lack. This is an important factor that must be taken into account when assessing knowledge. Otherwise, it may unduly expand the scope of due diligence obligations. On the other hand, every State regulates cyber activities within its territory to some extent, and an absolutely free cyberspace does not exist. Title V of the Convention on Cybercrime explicitly requires contracting parties to collect and record computer data in real time, which does not only include traffic data, but also content data.\nCyber supervision and regulation is common practice among states, and the difference lies in the degree of its stringency. If a State has strict supervision over cyberspace, it is more likely to know that a cyberattack has occurred, and it can even constitute \"constructive knowledge.\" For example, in May 2013, the U.S. energy security was significantly threatened by a cyberattack on the critical control systems of energy companies and attackers were even able to manipulate the oil and gas pipelines. The U.S. officials said that although there was no conclusive evidence that the cyberattack was supported by the Iranian government, it was unlikely that the Iranian government was unaware of the attack because the Iranian government had centralized control over the cyberspace.^[53]^ This offers a good example of the how the constructive knowledge may be applied in practice.\nIn summary, the precondition for taking countermeasures is the existence of an internationally wrongful act. What is challenging in cyberspace is how to attribute cyberattacks committed by non-State actors to the State. Under the traditional doctrine of effective control, the threshold for attribution is high and difficult to reach in cyberspace. While the doctrine of due diligence may\n^[51]^ See Wolff Heintschel von Heinegg, *Legal Implications of Territorial Sovereignty in Cyberspace*, in Christian Czosseck *et al.* eds., 2012 4th International Conference on Cyber Conflict (NATO CCDCOE Publications, Tallin, 2012).\n^[52]^ For example, if a government-dedicated network infrastructure is used to carry out a cyberattack, there is a presumption that the government of that State had knowledge of the cyberattack because the network was under the full control and supervision of the government.\n^[53]^ See N. Perlroth &amp; D. Sanger, *New Computer Attacks Traced to Iran*, Officials Say, The New York Times (May 24, 2013).\nThe Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law\nstep in to solve this problem, the danger is that the scope of due diligence may be overly broad. A balanced approach is that State responsibility only limited cyberattacks to which the State has knowledge of.\n## IV. Procedural Requirements for Taking Countermeasures in Cyberspace\n## 1. The Instrumentality of Countermeasures\nIn the application of countermeasures, the determination of an internationally wrongful act is unilateral in nature. The injured State makes its own judgment as to the existence of the internationally wrongful act and the gravity of the damage caused by such act, and makes its own decision as to whether or not and what countermeasures to take.^[54]^ For example, when the Sony Pictures Entertainment suffered a cyberattack in 2014, the U.S. Government, based on the information available to its intelligence community, believed that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea played a central role in the cyberattack, which constituted a State act. It then imposed economic sanctions on three Korean government agencies and officials.^[55]^ In this process, the US State had three roles to play, i.e., as the victim state of a cyberattack, the adjudicator of an internationally wrongful act, and implementer of countermeasures. This leads to an obvious conflict of interest and is prone to exaggerated assessment of the severity of the damage and the necessity of countermeasures, resulting in the escalation of disputes.^[56]^\nThe determination of an internationally wrongful act is a complex process of fact finding and application of law, which is not an easy task. There is no third-party body in the existing international law system to make an objective and neutral determination on the existence of an internationally wrongful act. In other words, countermeasures are taken on the basis of a one-sided claim of injured State and there is a possibility of abuse in practice. Some States may fabricate the existence of an internationally wrongful act and accuse another State of committing such act. Countermeasures may be used as a justification for the State to take measures such as sanctions, thus becoming a tool for strong countries to bully the weak. This is the greatest danger in the application of countermeasures in cyberspace, a cause for concern for developing countries in particular. Therefore, at the 2017 session of the UNGGE, developing countries, represented by Cuba, opposed the application of the right to self-defense and countermeasures to cyberspace.^[57]^\n^[54]^ Mary Ellen O’Connell, *supra* note 17, at 230.\n^[55]^ See Li Liangyong, *U.S. Sanctions North Korea over Sony “Hack,” No Response from North Korea*, at http://www.xinhuanet.com/world/2015-01/04/c_127354664.htm (last visited June 3, 2023).\n^[56]^ See N. Jansen Calamita, *Sanctions, Countermeasures, and the Iranian Nuclear Issue*, 42 Vanderbilt Journal of Transnational Law 1420 (2009).\n^[57]^ See Anders Henriksen, *The End of the Road for the UNGGE Process: The Future Regulation of Cyberspace*, 5 Journal of Cybersecurity 1 (2019).\nWuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers\nIn order to prevent countermeasures from being abused and leading to the escalation of disputes, and to ensure that they are taken only when they are necessary to achieve their purpose, Article 52 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States set out a series of stringent procedural requirements for countermeasures. Countermeasures, which are instrumental in nature, are intended to induce the responsible State to cease its violations, to comply with and fulfill its international obligations again and to restore lawful relations between the two States. But, countermeasures are not the only way to achieve such end. The fundamental principle of peaceful settlement of international disputes is well established in modern international law[68] and Article 33 of the UN Charter provides a list of pacific methods,[59] which shall be given priority in international dispute settlement. In contrast, countermeasures are exceptional in nature[60] and shall be taken only as the last resort. The injured State should first seek to resolve the disputes through the usual dispute settlement methods contained in Article 33 of the UN Charter, rather than through countermeasures.\nThe victim State shall invoke State responsibility against the injuring State in the first instance. Countermeasures shall not be taken if the injuring State has ceased the wrongful act and undertaken to pay compensation. Second, the injured State should also comply with its obligation to notify in advance and to seek a negotiated settlement of the dispute; this is the second procedural requirement for the taking of countermeasures.[61] In this process, the case of state responsibility is presented to the injuring State and to put some pressure on it to cooperate, thus giving the injuring State a second chance.[62] Finally, an injured State may not take countermeasures when a dispute has already been submitted to a dispute settlement mechanism.\nThese procedural requirements for countermeasures apply equally in the cyberspace. In particular, the last two procedural requirements are controversial which triggered intense debate in the course of formulating the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States. Their application in cyberspace is even more challenging, which will be discussed below.\n## 2. Notification and Seeking to Settle Disputes through Negotiations\nIn order to prevent escalation of a dispute, the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States provides that the injured State should notify the responsible State of any decision to take countermeasures\nThe Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law\nand offer to negotiate with that State.⁶³ In practice, notification and negotiation are not two separate steps. The purpose of notification is to give the injuring State an opportunity to respond. If the injuring State does so, it constitutes the start of negotiations between the Parties.⁶⁴ In cyberspace, notification is necessary because cyberattacks are often covert. Notification gives the responsible State an opportunity for clarification and prevents misjudgment and the escalation of disputes.\nHowever, the obligation to notify as a procedural requirement in cyberspace faces a number of challenges. First, it is not supported by current state practice. When a State take measures to respond to an internationally wrongful act, usually it does not invoke countermeasure as a justification. Even the issue is subject to a dispute settlement procedure, the victim State usually argues that its act complies with international law in the first instance. Countermeasures come into play only when the act is found to be internationally wrongful, i.e., as a defense and exemption from state responsibility.⁶⁵ Therefore, although there are a large number of cases in which countermeasures have been taken to respond to internationally wrongful acts, the number of cases in which countermeasures are invoked are very limited in practice. For example, the U.S. Government expelled Russian diplomatic officials in response to alleged Russia’s interference with the U.S. general election through cyberattacks in 2016, but it did not explicitly mention countermeasure as its legal basis.⁶⁶\nSecond, obligation to notify in cyberspace may be impractical. This is because the tracing the source of cyberattacks is complex and challenging. In practice, it is often difficult to identify who the attacker is and where it is originated, rendering notification being impossible. Furthermore, prior notification is likely to diminish the effectiveness of countermeasures in cyberspace.⁶⁷ This is particularly the case if countermeasures are taken through cyber means. Once the injuring State becomes aware of the countermeasures, the cyber tools can be captured and reused. Moreover, an injuring State, having been notified of countermeasures, may temporarily suspend cyberattacks as a means of avoiding such measures, because countermeasures shall cease as well in such situation. Therefore, prior notification may render countermeasures meaningless and ineffective.\nThe obligation to notify is not absolute and the injured State may take such urgent countermeasures as necessary.⁶⁸ This is also recognized by The Tallinn Manual 2.0 which points out that urgent\n⁶³ A small number of experts argued that negotiation is also one of the prior procedural requirement for taking countermeasures. The majority of experts did not agree and were in the opinion that this may be an excuse for the responsible State to stall for time. See Michael N. Schmitt, supra note 2, at 152.\n⁶⁴ Mary Ellen O’Connell, supra note 17, at 259.\n⁶⁵ For example, in the Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project case, Slovakia did not claim that its actions constitute countermeasures, instead revoked other grounds as justification. The application of countermeasures arose only after its claims had not been upheld and its actions were found internationally wrongful. See the Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project (Hungary/Slovakia), Judgment, ICJ Reports 1997, para. 82.\n⁶⁶ Lu Jiafei &amp; Xu Jianmei, supra note 5.\n⁶⁷ Gary Corn &amp; Eric Talbot Jensen, supra note 37.\n⁶⁸ See Article 52 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States.\nWuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers\ncountermeasures are highly likely in cyberspace. Cyberattacks are often both unpredictable and can spread rapidly over a short period of time, even capable of significantly impairing critical infrastructure.⁶⁹ Thus any delay in time may cause unknown and even irreparable damage. In such circumstances, the victim State may take urgent countermeasures without prior notification to the injuring State. For example, a State is being attacked by a serious internationally wrongful cyber operation. The injured State intends to respond by blocking all electronic access to the bank accounts of the responsible State. If the responsible State is notified of that intention, it will have the opportunity to transfer the assets out of the country, effectively depriving the injured State of the possibility of taking such countermeasure.⁷⁰ Therefore, urgent countermeasure is of significant practical implications as they may be used more widely in cyberspace.\n## 3. Dispute Settlement Mechanisms\nInternational laws provide for dispute settlement mechanisms capable of rendering a binding decision on a dispute, thus offering relief to the injured State. This would undermine the very underlying reason that justify countermeasure, i.e., international law lacks a centralized enforcement mechanism. In addition, such mechanisms may reach a final resolution of the disputes between the states. By contrast, countermeasures are temporary in nature and cannot solve the dispute definitively, and the dispute may eventually be submitted to dispute settlement procedures. Thus the countermeasure is a less favored means of dispute resolution.\nThe relationship between countermeasures and dispute settlement mechanisms was one of the most controversial issues in the formulation of Draft Articles on Responsibility of States. The special rapporteur, Gaetano Arangio Ruiz, advocated the idea that the injured State is obliged to submit the dispute to the dispute settlement procedure before resorting to countermeasures, which is also reflected in the text he drafted.⁷¹ However, this view was not supported by States. The final text provides, in Article 52(3), that Countermeasures may not be taken, and if already taken must be suspended without undue delay if the dispute is pending before a court or tribunal which has the authority to make decisions binding on the parties.⁷²\nIn the process of formulating the Tallinn Manual 2.0, the majority of the International Group of Experts adopted the position of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States. However, the application of the rule was not without controversy. Members of the International Group of Experts were divided on whether or not such obligation is absolute. Some experts held the opinion that such\n⁶⁹ See Katharine C. Hinkle, Countermeasures in the Cyber Context: One More Thing to Worry about, 37 Yale Journal of International Law Online 11 (2011).\n⁷⁰ See Michael N. Schmitt, supra note 2, at 234–235.\n⁷¹ Mary Ellen O’Connell, supra note 17, at 258.\n⁷² The phrase “court or tribunal” refers to any third-party dispute settlement procedure, whatever its designation. The court or tribunal must have the power to order interim measures that are capable of protecting the purportedly injured State. See Michael N. Schmitt, supra note 2, at 235.\nThe Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law\na dispute settlement mechanism is mandatory if it is explicitly required by international law. On the other hand, a minority of the experts argued that, rather than creating an absolute obligation, a case-by-case analysis should be undertaken to evaluate whether a third-party dispute settlement body had sufficient capacities to protect the rights of the injured State thus providing an effective alternative to countermeasures.^[73]^\nIt is submitted that dispute settlement mechanisms do not exclude countermeasures and resort to dispute settlement procedure is not a prerequisite procedural requirement for the taking of countermeasures. Under current international law, dispute settlement mechanisms are not substitute for countermeasures and provisional and urgent countermeasures are allowed even after a dispute has been submitted to a mandatory dispute settlement mechanism.^[74]^ This is particularly the case in cyberspace. Damage caused by cyberattacks could spread rapidly in a short period of time, sometimes even beyond the control of the attackers, which traditional dispute settlement mechanisms of international law may be ill-equipped to address.^[75]^ Therefore, countermeasures may be excluded only if treaties between the states involved contain technical defensive measures that are effective in induce the responsible State to comply with its international obligations and to prevent further damage, thus able to provide the victim State appropriate mechanism for remedy. Otherwise, the taking of countermeasures should not be precluded in cyberspace, even if the dispute is subject to a dispute settlement process.\n## V. Substantive Requirement for Taking Countermeasures in Cyberspace: The Principle of Proportionality\nCountermeasures taken by the injured State must comply with the principle of proportionality. If the countermeasures exceed the reasonable boundary set by the proportionality test, they will be punitive and retaliatory in nature and will no longer be legitimate under international law but rather an internationally wrongful act.^[76]^ Article 51 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States provides that countermeasures must be commensurate with the injury suffered. Under the proportionality test, countermeasures are assessed against the injuries suffered, not only in purely “quantitative” terms but also “qualitative” factors. This proportionality is equally applicable to countermeasures in cyberspace, which was clearly confirmed in the report published by the UNGGE in 2015.^[77]^\n^[73]^ *Id.*, at 235.\n^[74]^ *Id.*, at 236.\n^[75]^ Trojans can have multiple variants as they spread.

Cases Applying the Principle of Proportionality\nAssessing the proportionality of a countermeasure is not only controversial$^{78}$ but also challenging.$^{79}$ The principle of proportionality is concerned with the intensity of countermeasures, aiming to establish a benchmark for countermeasures and restrict them within a reasonable limit. Such test essentially is matter of degree and the outcome of applying the principle of proportionality is unpredictable. The International Law Commission points out explicitly that what is proportionate is not a matter which can be determined precisely and can at best be accomplished by approximation.$^{80}$ The Draft Articles on Responsibility of States does not set out any specific rules on the application of the proportionality test, but only provide the factors to be considered: (1) the extent of the injury suffered; (2) the gravity of the internationally wrongful act; (3) the rights of the injured and responsible State (and interests of other States) that are affected; and (4) the necessity of inducing the responsible State to fulfill its obligations.$^{81}$ This exercise involves value judgment and balancing of interests, thus subjective in nature. Moreover, the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States does not articulate the hierarchy of these factors elements. Therefore, there is still no clear guidance on the application of the principle of proportionality, lacking much-needed predictability and certainty.\nThere are very few cases concerning the proportionality of countermeasures in current international law, among which the only successful one is the Air Service Agreement arbitration case in 1978.$^{82}$ In 1946, France and the USA signed a bilateral agreement to open international air routes between the two States. Disputes arose between the two countries when France refused to allow a change of gauge in London by American flights. As a countermeasure, the USA planned to suspend some flights from Paris to the U.S. In its award, the arbitral tribunal did not make a quantitative analysis of the damage caused by the French wrongful act and the impact of the American countermeasure, but rather a qualitative analysis of the impact of the French illegal act. The key factor considered by the Tribunal was the importance of legal principles involved to the USA, and especially its impact on American aviation policy.$^{83}$ Since the 1970s, the USA has pursued the policy of aviation liberalization and concluded a number of air transport agreements with other States, promoting the opening of international air transport market. The French act restricted the freedom of air transportation, which was incompatible with American aviation policy. In addition, bilateral treaties signed by the USA with other States also contained similar provisions on change of gauge. The French act would affect the interpretation and application of these provisions, which may have significant adverse impact on America. Therefore, the arbitral tribunal concluded that the U.S. countermeasure did not obviously violate the principle of proportionality.$^{84}$ In this case, the key\n78 See David J. Bederman, Counterintuiting Countermeasures, 96 The American Journal of International Law 821 (2002).\n79 Supra note 76, at Paragraph 3.\n80 Id., Paragraphs 5 and 3 respectively.\n81 Id., Paragraph 6.

Supra note 8, at para. 83.\n84 Supra note 8.\nThe Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law\nfactors considered by the tribunal, i.e., the importance of the aviation policy and the potential impact of the damage, involves qualitative evaluation which is a general approximation rather than an accurate quantitative measurement.\nAnother one is the Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project case in 1997 in which the principle of proportionality was applied and a negative conclusion was made.⁸⁵ In this case, Hungary and Slovakia signed an agreement to jointly build a dam on the Danube in 1977. During the implementation of the agreement, Hungary unilaterally terminated the construction of the dam. As a countermeasure, Slovakia diverted the Danube in its territory to intercept water resources.⁸⁶ Different from the Air Service Agreement case, the ICJ combined quantitative and qualitative analysis in this case. First, from a qualitative perspective, the Court pointed out that the countermeasure had affected Hungary's important rights to equitable and reasonable share of natural resources of the Danube, including both navigational and non-navigational use. Second, the Court analyzed the intensity of the countermeasure taken by Slovakia. It held that Slovakia had unilaterally diversified and controlled 80% to 90% of water resources of the Danube. Measures with such magnitude will have a significant impact on the ecosystem of the Danube basin, clearly exceeding the reasonable limit, and thus inconsistent with the principle of proportionality.⁸⁷ In this case, the Danube is an important international river. The sheer volume of water being diversified, 80% to 90%, was a prima facie indication that the measure was probably out of proportionality. Thus it is a relatively easy case to adjudicate. However, if the amount of water resources affected by the countermeasure was in the range of 10% to 50%, the issue of proportionality would be in the grey area.\n## 2. The Benchmark for the Proportionality test\nThe benchmark for the proportionality test is also a controversial issue. The Draft Articles on Responsibility of States set injury as the benchmark for evaluating proportionality, allowing the injured State to retaliate against the injuring State with an equivalent damage, and thus forcing the injuring State to cease the infringement. This is not fundamentally different from the private retaliation of \"an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.\" It may lead to countermeasure going beyond what is strictly necessary for its very purpose and become punitive in nature. Therefore, there are inherent contradictions in the regime on countermeasures as set out by the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States.⁸⁸ This benchmark works well only among States with comparable strength. On the other hand, if there is a significant gap in strength between the countries involved,\n⁸⁵ See the Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project (Hungary/Slovakia), Judgment, ICJ Reports 1997.\n⁸⁶ In the judgment, the ICJ adopted a two-step approach. First, the Court found that Hungary violated the treaty concluded by both parties, which constituted an internationally wrongful act. Secondly, the Court discussed whether Slovakia's acts constituted countermeasures, one of the most important factor of which was the principle of proportionality. *Id.*, at para. 82.\n⁸⁷ *Id.*, at paras. 85–86.\n⁸⁸ See Nigel White &amp; Ademola Abass, *Countermeasures and Sanctions*, in Malcolm Evans ed., International Law, at 513 (Cambridge University Press 2018).\nWuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers\ncountermeasure as under the current proportionality test may be abused by those powerful States as an excuse to bully the weak ones.\nIn recent years, some scholars proposed a functional approach towards the proportionality test, arguing that the purpose to be achieved d by countermeasures shall be used as the benchmark. Countermeasures are instrumental, and their purposes are to force the injuring State to cease its wrongful act and to comply with its international obligations, so that the relations between the two States can be restored. Therefore, the proportionality of countermeasures should be assessed against its purpose, irrespective of whether they exceed the intensity of the wrongful act.⁸⁹\nIn April 2007, Estonia suffered a three-week-long DDoS cyberattack and a large number of critical infrastructure websites, including those of government agencies, were forced to shut down, resulting in network paralysis and service disruption with severe damage.⁹⁰ If the cyberattack could be attributed to Russia, Estonia could respond with DDoS countermeasures. In terms of the intensity, Estonia may not achieve its purpose if the countermeasures were of equivalent magnitude as that of the cyberattack because Russia's size and strength are far greater than Estonia's. Achieving the purpose of inducing Russia to cease its internationally wrongful act would likely require countermeasures that far exceed the damage caused by Russia's wrongful act. Therefore, taking the purpose of countermeasures as the benchmark is more in line with their very aim. Meanwhile, such approach taking into consideration the differences in strength of nations, prevents the abuse by stronger State, thus more fair and equitable.\nTherefore, the principle of proportionality lacks clear rules and is full of uncertainties. Its application in cyberspace is even more challenging.⁹¹ This is because cyberspace is interconnected and cyberattacks are dynamic and constantly changing, making it difficult and time-consuming to assess the damage caused. The injured State shall be extremely cautious when evaluating the proportionality of the countermeasures. This will not preclude the possibility for taking countermeasures in response to cyberattacks. A practical approach is to adopt cyber measures as an effective response to cyberattacks,⁹² because this type of countermeasures is of the same nature as the wrongful act and is more likely to be regarded as consistent with the principle of proportionality.⁹³\n⁸⁹ See Enzo Cannizzaro, *The Role of Proportionality in the Law of International Countermeasure*, 12 European Journal of International Law 889 (2001).\n⁹⁰ See Ma Chunmao, *A Review of Estonia’s Cyber Warfare*, at https://tech.sina.com.cn/i/2009-02-04/08172791102.shtml (last visited June 3, 2019).\n⁹¹ See Nicholas Tsagourias, *The Law Applicable to Countermeasures against Low Intensity Cyber Operations*, 14 Baltic Yearbook of International Law Online 105 (2015).\n⁹² Proportionality does not mean reciprocity. The obligation breached by countermeasures does not necessarily need to be same as the obligation breached by the responsible State, nor does the nature and means of the countermeasure.\n⁹³ See Paragraph 5 of the commentary to the introductory part of Chapter II in Part Three of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States.\nThe Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law\nTraditionally cyberattacks are dealt with through a passive defense system, consisting of a firewall, intrusion detection and prevention mechanism with antivirus software as the commonly deployed technology. Under such system, only after it is attacked will the antivirus software be able to obtain the vital information and code of the virus and update its database. So that the same viruses can be detected and removed next time they appear. The inherent deficiency is that only after the virus attacks can loopholes in the system be identified and fixed. Thus the antivirus software is always behind the virus and even the most sophisticated firewall may be breached. As a result, passive defense cannot does not offer satisfactory solution to network security. Modern network security is increasingly rely on active defense through early detection of cyberattacks and deception techniques to contain and constrain the attacks. For example, sandbox and honeypot are commonly used technical methods, which in fact deliberately expose some vulnerabilities for attackers and then to obtain critical information of the attackers when they intrude the system. These techniques offers protection to the system and buys time for the injured State to examine the cyberattack and to develop appropriate countermeasures.[94] Such means do not compromise or damage the attacker's network facilities or computer systems, thus consistent with the principle of proportionality.\nMore extreme active defenses measures are even aggressive in nature, i.e., hacking back. Such technics involve hacking into the attacker's computer system, erasing the stolen data, or even planting ransomware. This type of defense involves cyber measures thus similar to cyberattacks in nature. However, this does not necessarily mean such measures fulfill the proportionality test because equivalence in nature is only one of the factors considered in the evaluation of proportionality. In practice, it is still necessary to consider other factors of the proportionality test and keeping cyber countermeasures within the reasonable limits allowed by international law.\nIn summary, the application of the principle proportionality is controversial and challenging. The Draft Articles on Responsibility of States fails to provide clear guidance, but only lists the factors to be considered. Furthermore, the benchmark against which proportionality is assessed against is not without controversy. Considerable uncertainties remain with regard to the application of countermeasures in cyberspace. A practical and effective approach is to adopt cyber countermeasures in response to cyberattacks and ensure the impact of such measures are within a reasonable limit.\n# VI. Conclusion\nThe fundamental aim of international law on the countermeasure is to limit it to a reasonable extent and prevent such measures being abused leading to the escalation of disputes. However, the boundaries of countermeasures permitted by international law remains unsettled. During the\n[94] If the attacker took advantage of the vulnerabilities of the honeypot to launch a cyberattack against a third country, the State that set up the honeypot may be found violating its due diligence obligations.\nWuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers\ndrafting process of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States, every rule on countermeasures had been a matter of controversy. Major differences among States on this issue were also highlighted at the 2017 Session of the UNGGE, where disagreements led to the absence of a consensus report and the breakdown of negotiations. The function and mission of the UNGGE is not to create or modify the rules of international law in cyberspace, but to discuss how international law is applied. Thus despite the failure of the negotiation process of the UNGGE, international law, including rules on countermeasures, is still applicable to cyberspace. This basic position has been confirmed by the International Group of Experts in its 2015 report.\nCompared with the traditional physical space of State sovereignty, cyberspace as a relatively new domain has its own unique features, creating new issues to the application of countermeasures. Current international law on the countermeasure as articulated in the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States, imposing stringent conditions to prevent its abuse, are ill-equipped to deal with cyberattacks. It adopts the basic position that countermeasure is illegal per se, to discourage its usage in practice. The prerequisites for taking countermeasures is the existence of internationally wrongful acts; in cyberspace the attribution of cyberattacks to States is challenging. In addition, the procedural requirements for taking countermeasure are impractical in cyberspace and the proportionality test is highly subjective and unpredictable. These facts have greatly diminished the effectiveness and certainty of the application of countermeasures in cyberspace. This is one of the major reason why there are few cases where state invoked countermeasures. Therefore, current international law does not offer clear rules and guidance on how to apply countermeasures in cyberspace. The international law regime on this issue is still at the early stage of development and is still evolving.\n(Translators: Meng Chao &amp; Wang Yi)",

Introduction\nIn recent years, cyberattacks have become more frequent. How to respond to cyberattacks and maintain cyber security has become an issue with significant strategic and practical implications that needs to be addressed urgently in the international community. Under international law, the injured State enjoys the right of self-defense against internationally wrongful acts that have reached the level of armed attack. However, in practice, most cyberattacks do not reach the required threshold of use of force, letting alone an armed attack. Taking the 2010 “Stuxnet” Incident for example, the prevailing view was that the cyberattacks did not constitute an armed attack in international law, notwithstanding that the virus had led to the damage of thousands of Iranian uranium enrichment centrifuges. Therefore, in most cases, a State is not able to exercise its right to self-defense against a cyberattack.\n* ZHU Lei (朱磊), Ph.D. in Law, associate professor at the Wuhan University Institute of International Law in China.\n Armed attacks are the most serious type of use of force, according to the International Court of Justice’s opinion in the Nicaragua case. See Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), Judgement, ICJ Reports 1986, para.191.\n See Michael N. Schmitt ed., Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations, at 538–531 (2nd edition, Cambridge University Press 2017). The book propose eight factors for assessing whether a cyberattack constitutes the use of force, including, severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability of effects, military character, state involvement and presumptive legality.\n See Robin Geiss &amp; Henning Lahmann, Freedom and Security in Cyberspace: Shifting the Focus Away from Military Responses towards Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention, in Katharina Ziolkowski ed., Peacetime Regime for State Activities in Cyberspace: International Law, International Relations and Diplomacy, at 628 (NATO CCDCOE Publication 2013).\nWuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers\nIn response to these cyberattacks which do not rise to the level of an armed attack, States tend to respond in a non-forceful and peaceful manner in practice. For example, in January 2015, the United States (\"USA\") imposed economic sanctions on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea as a response to the cyberattack on Sony Pictures Entertainment. In response to the allegation that Russia had interfered in the United States' General Election through cyberattacks, the USA announced the expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats in December 2016.\nCyberspace is considered as the new frontier of national sovereignty and international law is applicable in this area. The legal nature and status of the actions taken by the injured State in response to cyberattacks under international law is an issue that deserves serious consideration, in which the central issue involved is that of countermeasures. Similar to the right of self-defense, it allows a State to take its own measures of private remedies against an internationally wrongful act. Where certain conditions are met, it can preclude the wrongfulness of those measures and thereby relieve the responsibility of the State.\nThe countermeasure as a customary international law with a long history is controversial in international law. Its application to cyberspace is even more challenging because as an emerging field of science and technology, cyberspace has characteristics different from those areas of traditional State sovereignty. This paper analyzes how countermeasures in international law are applied to cyberspace in light of the characteristics of cyberspace, and examines the main issues and controversies in the application of countermeasures to cyberspace.\n## II. The Historical Development and Inherent Contradictories of Countermeasures\n## 1. Historical Development of Countermeasures\nThe term \"countermeasure\" was first used by the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office of the United Kingdom in 1916 in its correspondences with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Sweden. And the first detailed discussion on countermeasures was in the *Air Services Agreement* arbitration case in 1978. In this case, the USA made its claim based on countermeasures, which\n See Zhuang Xiaodan, *Revenge for Sony Pictures? US Launches New Round of Sanctions against North Korea*, at https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_1290937 (last visited June 3, 2023).\n See Lu Jiafei &amp; Xu Jianmei, *U.S. Announces Sanctions against Russia for Alleged Cyberattacks to Interfere in U.S. Election*, at https://world.huanqiu.com/article/9CaKrnJZtjV (last visited June 3, 2019).\n UN Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (\"UNGGE\"), the main platform and mechanism for official intergovernmental dialogue on international law in cyberspace, acknowledged in its 2013 report that international law applies in cyberspace. See UN, A/68/98.\n See Omer Yousif Elagab, *The Place of Non-Forcible Counter-Measures in Contemporary International Law*, in Guy S. Goodwin-Gill &amp; Stefan Talmon eds., *The Reality of International Law: Essays in Honour of Ian Brownlie*, at 125 (Oxford University Press 1999).\n See the *Air Service Agreement* of 27 March 1946 between the United States of America and France (1978) 18 RIAA 417.\nThe Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law\nwas upheld by the Arbitral Tribunal. The term was widely used after the Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (“Draft Articles on Responsibility of States”), adopted by the International Law Commission of the United Nations (“UNILC”) in 2001, which used the term and contained detailed rules on countermeasures in seven articles.\nThe historical root of countermeasures is found in the traditional international law concept of reprisals, which is essentially a mechanism of private remedy. The concept of “countermeasures” is used as a synonym for “reprisals” and inherits the key elements of the latter. The institution of reprisals in international law has a long history and its development can be divided into three stages.\nThe first stage was a completely liberal private reprisal, which was common in the early stage of the development of the rule of law, during which the State apparatus was not yet in place and public enforcement mechanisms for the law were missing. Where the rights of individuals were violated without remedy from public power, they could take it upon themselves to enforce the law and take reprisals as a means of obtaining the relief. In ancient Greece, the customary law of seizing foreigners existed in the city-states of Athens. Where a citizen of a city-state was killed by a foreigner or the government, the relatives of the victim enjoyed the right to capture and detain three citizens of that foreign state as hostages and demand that the perpetrator be presented or compensated. Where the claim was not met, the victim’s relatives would enjoy the right to kill the hostages to pay back the blood debt.\nThe second stage was the reprisal authorized by the State, essentially to incorporate reprisal into the framework of State regulation. The letter of reprisal offers a good example. It has its roots in Roman law. In ancient Rome, public authorities became involved in the system of reprisals and regulated it strictly. If the rights of a Roman citizen (especially a merchant) were violated by an alien, the victim could seize the citizen of that State to retaliate with procedural and substantive restrictions. Before the reprisal could be carried out, the victim must apply to the relevant State authority for a permit to do so. The precondition of obtaining the permit is that the victim had been treated unfairly by the courts of a foreign State and that his or her damages could not be compensated and his or her rights could not be remedied. The scope must be limited to the actual damage suffered by the victim and the seizure by force can be carried out only within the Roman territory or on international waters.\n Omer Yousif Elagab, supra note 7, at 125–126.\n The International Court of Justice referred to the term twice in 1980 in the United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran case, and several times in the Nicaragua case in 1986.\n See Malcolm N. Shaw, International Law 794 (Cambridge University Press 2008).\n See David J. Bederman, International Law in Antiquity, at 123 (Cambridge University Press 2007).\n Letter of reprisal is also known as letter of marquee.\n Its modern formulation can be found in the Constitution of the United States of America, which in Section 8 of Article 1 authorizes the Congress to grant letters of marque and reprisal.\n See Wilhelm G. Grewe, The Epochs of International Law, at 117 (De Gruyter 2000).\nWuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers\nDuring the medieval period, reprisals centered on the letter of marquee, whereby armed privateers, with government concession, may chase and destroy foreign lawbreakers and fleets, as well as attack and plunder enemy merchant ships. By the 16th Century, wartime plundering became quite widespread and many States began to legislate and regulate the granting of such letters. Hugo Grotius in his book (1604), *De Jure Praedae*, legally defended the act of Dutch ships attacking Portuguese and Spanish ships. He argued that the granting of permit was akin to declaring a “private war,” justified by the fact that the laws of each State had no effective jurisdiction over the seas and that merchant ships had to arm themselves in self-defense.^[16]^\nThe third stage was to prohibit the use of forcible reprisal. Traditional reprisal includes both forcible and non-forcible means, the majority of which is forcible. In the early 20th Century, the international community restricted the use of force through a series of conventions. Modern international law prohibits the use of force and the Charter of the United Nations explicitly prohibits the use of force and the threat of force. As a result, forcible reprisal eventually receded from the stage of history. Accordingly, the term “countermeasures,” also known as “non-forcible reprisal,” was adopted to conform to the development of modern international law, which corresponded to reprisals by non-forcible means. In this way, the term can distinguish itself from reprisals by force and avoid the negative connotations associated with the concept of reprisals in traditional international law.^[17]^\n## 2. The Inherent Contradictories of Countermeasures\nA review of the historical development reveals its inherent tensions and contradictories, which is also the core issue to be addressed in contemporary international law. On the one hand, the existence of countermeasures is justified. In the absence of adequate public enforcement mechanisms when the rule of law is weak, reprisal offers a workable and efficient private solution. In domestic law, with the development of the rule of law, private enforcement of the law was increasingly limited and ultimately superseded by public enforcement of the law. By contrast, international law is based on the principle of sovereign equality and the international community is an egalitarian society. International law has an inherent flaw in that it lacks a centralized enforcement mechanism with enforcement authority that overrides the State, resulting in inadequate supply of public remedies. Therefore, it is necessary to have countermeasures as a form of private national remedies.\nThe essence of countermeasures, on the other hand, is to leave law enforcement in private hands, which could be harmful and even dangerous. Without any constraints, reprisal is highly vulnerable to abuse, plunging the international law into law of the jungle. Though the medieval letter of marquee was under the State’s regulation, it was often no different than piracy in practice. Bartolus de Saxoferrato (1314-1357), a famous European medieval jurist, wrote in a work published in\n^[16] See Hugo Grotius, *Commentary on the Law of Prize and Booty*, at 62 (Liberty Fund 2012).\n^[17] See Mary Ellen O’Connell, *The Power and Purpose of International Law: Insights from the Theory and Practice of Enforcement*, at 233 (Oxford University Press 2011).\nThe Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law\n\nBut, how can the balance between the reasonableness and the harm of countermeasures be achieved? This is the most difficult and contentious issue in the modern international law regime on countermeasures, which is also evident in the drafting process of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States. Although the majority of States recognized the necessity of countermeasures, many expressed concerns about the harmfulness of countermeasures. Therefore, in order to prevent the abuse of countermeasures, the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States adopted the principle of “conditional lawfulness” for countermeasures and set strict requirements for their implementation, in an attempt to prevent such measures from becoming tools for strong States to oppress weak States. Only countermeasures that have met these conditions are lawful; otherwise, they would be considered as internationally wrongful acts.\nThe rules established in the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States are the authoritative expression of modern international law on countermeasures, but they are also highly contentious. The fundamental disagreement during the development of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States was over the legal status of countermeasures, especially whether they are lawful or unlawful in nature. Representatives of some States took a positive attitude towards countermeasures, proposing that countermeasures are lawful in themselves, which are the rights enjoyed by States in international law, and are unlawful only under certain exceptional circumstances. However, this view was not supported by the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States which regarded countermeasures as unlawful *per se*. Countermeasures are internationally wrongful act that are in breach of internationally law, with the possibility of excluding the international wrongfulness of the act under certain circumstances. Therefore, countermeasures involve a situation excluding the wrongfulness of the act and may be invoked a defense to the accusation of internationally wrongful act. This fundamental stance taken by the UNILC is to discourage rather than promote the use of countermeasures.\nIn summary, countermeasures are the private enforcement of the law and have certain negative consequences. The historical development of countermeasures is a process of introducing more restrictions on its use and to bring it under the regulation of the law. In the meanwhile, international community is egalitarian in nature, which provides the solid foundation for its existence as an accepted form of enforcement under customary international law. Setting clear requirements for their use, mitigating their harmfulness, and limiting their application within an acceptable boundary are the key purpose for modern international law regime on countermeasures.\n Wilhelm G. Grewe, *supra* note 15, at 117.\n This basic principle is also reflected in Tallinn Manual 2.0 on International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations. See Michael N. Schmitt, *supra* note 2, at 225.\nWuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers\n## III. Prerequisites for Taking Countermeasures in Cyberspace: Internationally Wrongful Acts in Cyberspace\n## 1. Temporal Limitation of Countermeasures\nThe existence of an internationally wrongful act is a prerequisite for taking countermeasures, which is the primary reason for the exclusion of its wrongfulness. Countermeasures are similar to self-defense in this regard, which are taken in response to a prior internationally wrongful act by another State. As a result, countermeasures should be considered as the “shield” for defense rather than the “spear” for offense. The absence of an effective enforcement mechanism in international law allows the injured State to suspend its international obligations only when the other State has violated the law in the first place. In other words, the essence of countermeasures is to counteract an internationally wrongful act with an illegal act, with the goal of forcing the injuring State to resume its international obligations and restore normal relations between the two nations. Therefore, countermeasures are a part of the enforcement mechanism of international law, through which the injured State are able to protect its own rights and interests, thus also a mechanism of remedy in international law.\nCountermeasures must be taken against an ongoing internationally wrongful act and are not preventive or prospective. Once the wrongful act ceases, the countermeasures must also be ceased. Thus, if a cyberattack has not yet occurred or has ended, the injured State shall not take countermeasures. This rule significantly limits the possibility of an injured State to take countermeasures in response to a cyber-related wrongful act, because unlike traditional internationally wrongful acts, most cyberattacks are sudden and short-lived, leaving only a relatively limited period of time for an injured State to respond and diminishing the possibility of taking countermeasures in response to a cyberattack.\nIt is worth noting that modern cyberattacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, often requiring a large investment of manpower and resources, and their complexity and destructive power may be no less than a small-scale war. Complex cyberattacks take a long time from planning to actual implementation involving multiple steps such as intelligence collection, vulnerability detection, intrusion and infiltration into the network, and virus implantation. They often require coordination and cooperation of a professional and technical team. The time span of cyberattacks provides the opportunities and possibilities for injured State to monitor and detect cyberattacks earlier.\n---\n See Denis Alland, *Countermeasures of General Interest*, 13 European Journal of International Law 1221 (2002).\n See Maurice Kamto, *The Time Factor in the Application of Countermeasures*, in James Crawford et al. eds., *The Law of International Responsibility*, at 1176 (Oxford University Press 2010).\n See Jiang Shibo, *Cyber Attacks and the Application of the Laws of War*, 16(2) Wuhan University International Law Review 43–70 (2014).\nThe Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law\nThe cyberattack on the Ukrainian power grid on 23 December 2015 offers a good illustration. The cyberattack began in the spring of 2014, when the attackers first spear-phished IT staff and system administrators, causing viruses to infect systems and opening backdoors for subsequent cyberattacks. Over the following months, the attackers conducted extensive network reconnaissance, exploration and mapping efforts and gained the ability to manage user accounts within the network and employee login credentials. The final step of the cyberattack consisted of a series of coordinated actions, including reconfiguring the uninterruptible power supply, disconnecting the circuit breaker to take the substation offline, and launching a denial-of-service attack on the customer call center.[23]\nIn order to deal with sophisticated cyberattacks, the injured State should develop and improve its capabilities of cyber-related technology, strengthen real-time supervision over cyberattacks, detect ongoing cyberattacks at an early stage, and fix vulnerabilities of the system and strengthen measures for cyber prevention and defense. If the cyberattack is still at such an early stage as the planning, vulnerability detection and intelligence gathering, the injured State should exercise restraint and should not take countermeasures; otherwise, it may cause miscalculation and lead to the escalation of disputes. Once a cyberattack enters the next stage of implementation, such as planting viruses and stealing account information, etc., it constitutes an internationally wrongful act in violation of international law, at which time the injured State may take countermeasures against the act without waiting for the final stage of the cyberattack to unfold.\n## 2. Attribution of Internationally Wrongful Acts\nUnder international law, countermeasures are measures taken by a state against another state, which carries two important implications. Although enterprises are frequently subject to cyberattacks,[24] the measures taken by enterprises in response to cyberattacks do not constitute the countermeasures under international law.[25] Second, the object of countermeasures must be the State rather than non-State actors. In reality, there are very few inter-State cyberattacks, and most of such attacks are initiated by private non-State actors (e.g., patriotic hackers and lone wolves).[26] The first issue to be addressed in determining whether there is an internationally wrongful act is the attribution of cyberattacks, i.e., whether privately committed acts can be attributed to the State and constitute acts of the State.[27] If a cyberattack committed by a non-State actor is not attributed to the State, it\n[23] See Kim Zetter, Inside the Cunning, Unprecedented Hack of Ukraine’s Power Grid, at https://www.wired.com/2016/03/inside-cunning-unprecedented-hack-ukraines-power-grid/ (last visited June 3, 2023).\n[24] The 2017 Annual Internet Security Report released by Tencent Security pointed out that up to 86% of companies worldwide had experienced at least one cyberattack in 2017. Tencent’s 2017 Annual Internet Security Report: Nearly 90% of Global Companies Suffered Cyber Attacks, at http://tech.chinadaily.com.cn/2018-01/31/content_35621606.htm (last visited June 3, 2019).\n[25] See Michael N. Schmitt, Below the Threshold Cyber Operations: The Counter-Measures Response Option and International Law, 54 Virginia Journal of International Law 697 (2014).\n[26] See Michael N. Schmitt, In Defense of Due Diligence in Cyberspace, 125 Yale Law Journal Forum 77 (2015).\n[27] See Tom Ruys, Sanctions, Retorsions and Countermeasures: Concepts and International Legal Framework, in Larissa van den Herik ed., Research Handbook on UN Sanctions and International Law, at 14 (Edward Elgar Publishing 2016).\nWuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers\nmay constitute a violation of domestic law, but not an internationally wrongful act in violation of international law, and the injured State cannot take countermeasures against such acts.\nAttribution is an extremely challenging issue in identifying State responsibility in cyberspace, involving three layers of attribution. First, from the technical perspective, unlike traditional physical domains such as sea, land and air, the cyberspace is a decentralized system. Cyberspace is open, pluralistic, interoperable, and anonymous, and attackers often use encryption technology to transmit information in packets to hide their identities and sources, making the investigation of the source of cyberattacks quite complex, costly and protracted.\nSecond, after locating the source of cyberattacks through technical means, the subject behind the cyberattacks also needs to be identified. Even if the IP address is traced to a State's cyber infrastructure, it may not meet the criteria of burden of proof for attribution because IP addresses can be spoofed. For example, in 2013, an organization impersonating its IP address as from the Ukrainian government conducted cyber operations against the NATO Cyber Cooperative Defense Center of Excellence, the Estonian Defense Forces, and the armed forces of other NATO countries. Clearly, the conduct could not be attributed to the Ukrainian government.\nFinally, it remains to determine whether the act committed by the attackers constitutes the act of a State, i.e., legal attribution. The key issue is whether cyberattacks committed by non-State actors can be attributed to the State and constitute internationally wrongful acts that entails State responsibility. The challenge is degree of connection required for attribution to the State the cyberattacks committed by non-State actors. Under Article 8 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States, the conduct of non-State actors acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of a State is attributable to that State. The International Court of Justice (\"ICJ\") established the doctrine of \"effective control\" in the Nicaragua case in 1987. In that case, the USA played a significant and decisive role in financing, organizing, training, supplying, and equipping the Nicaraguan Contras, but the ICJ found that the series of U.S. acts did not constitute \"effective control\" and thus could not meet the standard of attribution.\nThe doctrine of effective control requires the State play a direct and a leading role in the cyberattacks, not just a supporting one, setting a higher threshold for State responsibility for private conduct. For example, the USA believed that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea played a \"central role\" in the 2014 cyberattack on Sony Pictures, which rose to the level of effective control and imposed\n See Michael N. Schmitt, *Peacetime Cyber Responses and Wartime Cyber Operations under International Law: An Analytical Vade Mecum*, 8 Harvard National Security Journal 260 (2017).\n See Huang Zhixiong ed., *On Cyber Sovereignty—Jurisprudence, Policy and Practice*, at 39 (Social Sciences Academic Press 2017).\n See Michael N. Schmitt, *supra* note 2, at 203.\n *Supra* note 1, at para. 115.\nThe Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law\nsanctions against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. In contrast, Iranian hackers conducted DDoS cyberattacks against a number of U.S. financial institutions between 2011 and 2013. Although these hackers had ties to the Iranian government, such ties did not rise to the level of effective control and therefore the attacks could not be attributed to Iran and the USA could not take countermeasures against Iran accordingly.\nThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 on International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations (“Tallinn Manual 2.0”) adopts the ICJ’s standard of effective control. It gives the following illustrative example. A State plans and oversees an operation to use a software update to implant a new vulnerability in software widely used by another state in its governmental computers. The former State enters into a confidential contract with the company that produced the software to embed the vulnerability and directs the course of action. In such a case the State planned, directed, and supervised over a particular cyberattack and took a leading and direct role in the operation, which is fundamentally different from the ancillary role played by the US government in the Nicaragua case and thus the company’s conduct is attributable to the State.\nThe doctrine of effective control adopts a relatively stringent criterion of attribution, which makes it difficult for the injured State to prove, thus severely limiting the application of countermeasures. In practice, the injuring State may not directly organize the implementation of cyberattacks, but indirectly support cyberattacks as a way to avoid State responsibility. Moreover, cyberattacks are secretive and complex, and attackers often use technical means to hide the source of the attack, so it is not easy to obtain conclusive evidence to prove the extent of State involvement in such cyberattacks and the role played by the State. And such evidence is often located in the injuring State or even across the globe, which is difficult to obtain and even if obtained, the timing for taking countermeasures may has already elapsed. For example, Estonia was subjected to a DDoS attack in 2007 and investigation revealed that the source of the attack was computers from 178 countries, including Vietnam and the USA. The cyberattack lasted for three weeks, providing a valuable time for evidence collection and attribution. However, to date, there is still no conclusive evidence of to attribute the responsibility to Russia.\nIn summary, the rules on attribution in international law are established for traditional internationally wrongful acts and thus are difficult to apply to cyberspace. It has the effect of greatly limiting the possibility of taking countermeasures in cyberspace. Some scholars argued that the constraints of existing customary law should be lifted and States should be allowed to take countermeasures\n Zhuang Xiaodan, supra note 4.\n See BBC: US Indicts 7 Iranian Hackers for Breaching Multiple Financial Firms, at https://news.youth.cn/gj/201603/t20160325_7779822.htm (last visited June 3, 2019).\n See Michael N.

It essentially treats non-State actors as the subject of responsibility in international law, thus a departure from the basic principle of international law, which may have disturbing and far-reaching impact on the existing international order.\n## 3. Due Diligence\nTo address the difficulty of attribution under the doctrine of effective control, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 introduces due diligence into cyberspace, proposing that a State must exercise due diligence in not allowing its territory, or territory or cyber infrastructure under its governmental control, to be used for cyber operations that affect the rights of, and produce serious adverse consequences for, other States. This lowers the criterion of attribution required by the doctrine of effective control and reduces the threshold of State responsibility for acts of private subjects, essentially as a type of vicarious liability. This is an important development and breakthrough compared to the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (Tallinn Manual 1.0).\nThe ICJ has affirmed the doctrine of due diligence in the Corfu Channel case, the Tehran Hostage case, and the Nicaragua case. For example, in the Corfu Channel case, although the mines were not laid by Albania, the area where the incident occurred was Albanian territorial waters and Albania should bear the regulatory responsibility for that area. Also, judging from the geographical location and expertise, Albania had the knowledge of the mines laid in the Corfu Channel, but failed to take relevant measures, and therefore should bear responsibility. The ICJ stated that every State has an obligation “not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States.”\nUnder the doctrine of due diligence, a State must take active measures to prevent, reduce or limit the occurrence of damage, which is essentially an obligation to prevent transnational damage. The infrastructure on which cyberspace is based is physical, located in a particular State, and falls within the sovereign jurisdiction of that State, and due diligence is equally applicable. This basic position was also adopted by the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Information Security (“UNGGE”) in its report issued in 2015. Therefore, if a State violates due diligence in\n See Gary Corn &amp; Eric Talbot Jensen, *The Use of Force and Cyber Countermeasures*, 32 Temple International &amp; Comparative Law Journal 127 (2018).\n See Michael N. Schmitt, *supra* note 2, at 128.\n See Huang Zhixiong, *The Attribution of Cyberattacks in International Law*, 5 Global Law Review 164 (2014).\n See Corfu Channel (United Kingdom v. Albania), Judgment, ICJ Reports 1949, at 22.\n See the United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran (United States v. Iran), Judgment, ICJ Report 1980, para. 63.\n *Supra* note 1, at para.157.\n *Supra* note 40, at para. 65.\n *Supra* note 40, at para. 67.\n See UN, A/70/174.\nThe Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law\ncyberspace, it constitutes an internationally wrongful act and the injured State is entitled to take countermeasures.\nThe most controversial issue in practice is the scope of the obligation assumed by a State under the doctrine of due diligence. On this issue, two extreme positions should be avoided. If a liberal approach is adopted, i.e., a State assumes little or even no obligation, this will lead to the abuse of the principle of sovereignty, allowing the use of network facilities to infringe upon the interests of other States.\nOn the other hand, an expanded interpretation would broaden the scope of due diligence, constitute an unreasonable restriction on State sovereignty, which lacks a basis in international law. In this regard, the view of U.S. military judge Matthew J. Sklerov is quite representative. He advocated that strict criminal legislation and law enforcement could effectively prevent cyberattacks, and argued that the State's obligation in cyberspace includes passing stringent criminal laws, conducting vigorous investigations, prosecuting attackers, and, during the investigation and prosecution, cooperating with the victim state of cyberattacks that originated from within their borders. According to this view, knowledge of the occurrence of the damage is also not a requirement for the assumption of due diligence. In other words, the State has the obligation to take active criminal action to prevent and stop illegal cyberattacks, and the State's negligence or omission in any respect constitutes tacit approval and sheltering of such attacks and constitutes a violation of due diligence.\nIn practice, however, cyberattacks are often deceptive and disguised, and attackers may use the network infrastructure of other States to carry out remote attacks. Matthew J. Sklerov's view underestimated the complexity of cyberattacks in practice, which may lead to a misjudgment on state responsibility of cyberattacks. The USA, with its significant political, economic, and military position in the world, is often the target of cyberattacks, but it is difficult to hold the relevant States responsible in practice due to the problem of attribution. This view which expands the scope of due diligence attempts to lift the constraints and limitations under traditional rules of international law and to lower the threshold of State responsibility, thus enabling the USA to take countermeasures against other States more easily. Such practice should come under close scrutiny.\nThe appropriate approach on this issue is to return to the current framework of international law under which a State assumes due diligence responsibility only to the extent of knowledge on the occurrence of damage. This basic principle was also endorsed in the report of the UNGGE issued in 2015, and is a commonly held position by States. Under this doctrine, knowledge may be actual\n See Matthew J. Sklerov, Solving the Dilemma of State Responses to Cyberattacks: A Justification for the Use of Active Defenses against States Who Neglect Their Duty to Prevent, 201 Military Law Review 71 (2009).\n Id., at 62.\n Id., at 71.\n Id.\n Supra note 40, at para.18.\nWuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers\nor constructive. A State may be found to have actual knowledge of a cyberattack if it has detected or has been notified by the injured State of an attack originating from that country.^[51]^ The essence of constructive knowledge is the reverse of the burden of proof. The challenge of attribution in cyberspace is evidence, and in the case of constructive knowledge the burden of proof is shifted to the territorial State where the cyberattack originated which have more evidence than the victim state. Therefore it is presumed to have knowledge of the cyberattack with the possibility of rebuttal.^[52]^\nWith the sheer number of Internet users and the technology to hide their identities and even erase traces of Internet access, it is almost impossible to achieve complete and comprehensive regulation in cyberspace. But this does not mean that the State is unaware of cyber operations within its borders. Whether a State is aware of cyberattacks is closely related to its technical capacities and the regulatory policy it adopts in cyberspace.\nCyberspace is highly complex and technical in nature, and cyber regulation relies on the relevant cyber technical capacities which many developing countries may lack. This is an important factor that must be taken into account when assessing knowledge. Otherwise, it may unduly expand the scope of due diligence obligations. On the other hand, every State regulates cyber activities within its territory to some extent, and an absolutely free cyberspace does not exist. Title V of the Convention on Cybercrime explicitly requires contracting parties to collect and record computer data in real time, which does not only include traffic data, but also content data.\nCyber supervision and regulation is common practice among states, and the difference lies in the degree of its stringency. If a State has strict supervision over cyberspace, it is more likely to know that a cyberattack has occurred, and it can even constitute \"constructive knowledge.\" For example, in May 2013, the U.S. energy security was significantly threatened by a cyberattack on the critical control systems of energy companies and attackers were even able to manipulate the oil and gas pipelines. The U.S. officials said that although there was no conclusive evidence that the cyberattack was supported by the Iranian government, it was unlikely that the Iranian government was unaware of the attack because the Iranian government had centralized control over the cyberspace.^[53]^ This offers a good example of the how the constructive knowledge may be applied in practice.\nIn summary, the precondition for taking countermeasures is the existence of an internationally wrongful act. What is challenging in cyberspace is how to attribute cyberattacks committed by non-State actors to the State. Under the traditional doctrine of effective control, the threshold for attribution is high and difficult to reach in cyberspace. While the doctrine of due diligence may\n^[51]^ See Wolff Heintschel von Heinegg, *Legal Implications of Territorial Sovereignty in Cyberspace*, in Christian Czosseck *et al.* eds., 2012 4th International Conference on Cyber Conflict (NATO CCDCOE Publications, Tallin, 2012).\n^[52]^ For example, if a government-dedicated network infrastructure is used to carry out a cyberattack, there is a presumption that the government of that State had knowledge of the cyberattack because the network was under the full control and supervision of the government.\n^[53]^ See N. Perlroth &amp; D.

A balanced approach is that State responsibility only limited cyberattacks to which the State has knowledge of.\n## IV. Procedural Requirements for Taking Countermeasures in Cyberspace\n## 1. The Instrumentality of Countermeasures\nIn the application of countermeasures, the determination of an internationally wrongful act is unilateral in nature. The injured State makes its own judgment as to the existence of the internationally wrongful act and the gravity of the damage caused by such act, and makes its own decision as to whether or not and what countermeasures to take.^[54]^ For example, when the Sony Pictures Entertainment suffered a cyberattack in 2014, the U.S. Government, based on the information available to its intelligence community, believed that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea played a central role in the cyberattack, which constituted a State act. It then imposed economic sanctions on three Korean government agencies and officials.^[55]^ In this process, the US State had three roles to play, i.e., as the victim state of a cyberattack, the adjudicator of an internationally wrongful act, and implementer of countermeasures. This leads to an obvious conflict of interest and is prone to exaggerated assessment of the severity of the damage and the necessity of countermeasures, resulting in the escalation of disputes.^[56]^\nThe determination of an internationally wrongful act is a complex process of fact finding and application of law, which is not an easy task. There is no third-party body in the existing international law system to make an objective and neutral determination on the existence of an internationally wrongful act. In other words, countermeasures are taken on the basis of a one-sided claim of injured State and there is a possibility of abuse in practice. Some States may fabricate the existence of an internationally wrongful act and accuse another State of committing such act. Countermeasures may be used as a justification for the State to take measures such as sanctions, thus becoming a tool for strong countries to bully the weak. This is the greatest danger in the application of countermeasures in cyberspace, a cause for concern for developing countries in particular. Therefore, at the 2017 session of the UNGGE, developing countries, represented by Cuba, opposed the application of the right to self-defense and countermeasures to cyberspace.^[57]^\n^[54]^ Mary Ellen O’Connell, *supra* note 17, at 230.\n^[55]^ See Li Liangyong, *U.S. Sanctions North Korea over Sony “Hack,” No Response from North Korea*, at http://www.xinhuanet.com/world/2015-01/04/c_127354664.htm (last visited June 3, 2023).\n^[56]^ See N.

Countermeasures, which are instrumental in nature, are intended to induce the responsible State to cease its violations, to comply with and fulfill its international obligations again and to restore lawful relations between the two States. But, countermeasures are not the only way to achieve such end. The fundamental principle of peaceful settlement of international disputes is well established in modern international law[68] and Article 33 of the UN Charter provides a list of pacific methods,[59] which shall be given priority in international dispute settlement. In contrast, countermeasures are exceptional in nature[60] and shall be taken only as the last resort. The injured State should first seek to resolve the disputes through the usual dispute settlement methods contained in Article 33 of the UN Charter, rather than through countermeasures.\nThe victim State shall invoke State responsibility against the injuring State in the first instance. Countermeasures shall not be taken if the injuring State has ceased the wrongful act and undertaken to pay compensation. Second, the injured State should also comply with its obligation to notify in advance and to seek a negotiated settlement of the dispute; this is the second procedural requirement for the taking of countermeasures.[61] In this process, the case of state responsibility is presented to the injuring State and to put some pressure on it to cooperate, thus giving the injuring State a second chance.[62] Finally, an injured State may not take countermeasures when a dispute has already been submitted to a dispute settlement mechanism.\nThese procedural requirements for countermeasures apply equally in the cyberspace. In particular, the last two procedural requirements are controversial which triggered intense debate in the course of formulating the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States. Their application in cyberspace is even more challenging, which will be discussed below.\n## 2. Notification and Seeking to Settle Disputes through Negotiations\nIn order to prevent escalation of a dispute, the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States provides that the injured State should notify the responsible State of any decision to take countermeasures\nThe Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law\nand offer to negotiate with that State. In practice, notification and negotiation are not two separate steps. The purpose of notification is to give the injuring State an opportunity to respond. If the injuring State does so, it constitutes the start of negotiations between the Parties. In cyberspace, notification is necessary because cyberattacks are often covert. Notification gives the responsible State an opportunity for clarification and prevents misjudgment and the escalation of disputes.\nHowever, the obligation to notify as a procedural requirement in cyberspace faces a number of challenges. First, it is not supported by current state practice. When a State take measures to respond to an internationally wrongful act, usually it does not invoke countermeasure as a justification. Even the issue is subject to a dispute settlement procedure, the victim State usually argues that its act complies with international law in the first instance. Countermeasures come into play only when the act is found to be internationally wrongful, i.e., as a defense and exemption from state responsibility. Therefore, although there are a large number of cases in which countermeasures have been taken to respond to internationally wrongful acts, the number of cases in which countermeasures are invoked are very limited in practice. For example, the U.S. Government expelled Russian diplomatic officials in response to alleged Russia’s interference with the U.S. general election through cyberattacks in 2016, but it did not explicitly mention countermeasure as its legal basis.\nSecond, obligation to notify in cyberspace may be impractical. This is because the tracing the source of cyberattacks is complex and challenging. In practice, it is often difficult to identify who the attacker is and where it is originated, rendering notification being impossible. Furthermore, prior notification is likely to diminish the effectiveness of countermeasures in cyberspace. This is particularly the case if countermeasures are taken through cyber means. Once the injuring State becomes aware of the countermeasures, the cyber tools can be captured and reused. Moreover, an injuring State, having been notified of countermeasures, may temporarily suspend cyberattacks as a means of avoiding such measures, because countermeasures shall cease as well in such situation. Therefore, prior notification may render countermeasures meaningless and ineffective.\nThe obligation to notify is not absolute and the injured State may take such urgent countermeasures as necessary. This is also recognized by The Tallinn Manual 2.0 which points out that urgent\n A small number of experts argued that negotiation is also one of the prior procedural requirement for taking countermeasures. The majority of experts did not agree and were in the opinion that this may be an excuse for the responsible State to stall for time. See Michael N. Schmitt, supra note 2, at 152.\n Mary Ellen O’Connell, supra note 17, at 259.\n For example, in the Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project case, Slovakia did not claim that its actions constitute countermeasures, instead revoked other grounds as justification. The application of countermeasures arose only after its claims had not been upheld and its actions were found internationally wrongful. See the Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project (Hungary/Slovakia), Judgment, ICJ Reports 1997, para. 82.\n Lu Jiafei &amp; Xu Jianmei, supra note 5.\n Gary Corn &amp; Eric Talbot Jensen, supra note 37.\n See Article 52 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States.\nWuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers\ncountermeasures are highly likely in cyberspace. Cyberattacks are often both unpredictable and can spread rapidly over a short period of time, even capable of significantly impairing critical infrastructure. Thus any delay in time may cause unknown and even irreparable damage. In such circumstances, the victim State may take urgent countermeasures without prior notification to the injuring State. For example, a State is being attacked by a serious internationally wrongful cyber operation. The injured State intends to respond by blocking all electronic access to the bank accounts of the responsible State. If the responsible State is notified of that intention, it will have the opportunity to transfer the assets out of the country, effectively depriving the injured State of the possibility of taking such countermeasure. Therefore, urgent countermeasure is of significant practical implications as they may be used more widely in cyberspace.\n## 3. Dispute Settlement Mechanisms\nInternational laws provide for dispute settlement mechanisms capable of rendering a binding decision on a dispute, thus offering relief to the injured State. This would undermine the very underlying reason that justify countermeasure, i.e., international law lacks a centralized enforcement mechanism. In addition, such mechanisms may reach a final resolution of the disputes between the states. By contrast, countermeasures are temporary in nature and cannot solve the dispute definitively, and the dispute may eventually be submitted to dispute settlement procedures. Thus the countermeasure is a less favored means of dispute resolution.\nThe relationship between countermeasures and dispute settlement mechanisms was one of the most controversial issues in the formulation of Draft Articles on Responsibility of States. The special rapporteur, Gaetano Arangio Ruiz, advocated the idea that the injured State is obliged to submit the dispute to the dispute settlement procedure before resorting to countermeasures, which is also reflected in the text he drafted. However, this view was not supported by States. The final text provides, in Article 52(3), that Countermeasures may not be taken, and if already taken must be suspended without undue delay if the dispute is pending before a court or tribunal which has the authority to make decisions binding on the parties.\nIn the process of formulating the Tallinn Manual 2.0, the majority of the International Group of Experts adopted the position of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States. However, the application of the rule was not without controversy. Members of the International Group of Experts were divided on whether or not such obligation is absolute. Some experts held the opinion that such\n See Katharine C. Hinkle, Countermeasures in the Cyber Context: One More Thing to Worry about, 37 Yale Journal of International Law Online 11 (2011).\n See Michael N. Schmitt, supra note 2, at 234–235.\n Mary Ellen O’Connell, supra note 17, at 258.\n The phrase “court or tribunal” refers to any third-party dispute settlement procedure, whatever its designation. The court or tribunal must have the power to order interim measures that are capable of protecting the purportedly injured State. See Michael N. Schmitt, supra note 2, at 235.\nThe Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law\na dispute settlement mechanism is mandatory if it is explicitly required by international law. On the other hand, a minority of the experts argued that, rather than creating an absolute obligation, a case-by-case analysis should be undertaken to evaluate whether a third-party dispute settlement body had sufficient capacities to protect the rights of the injured State thus providing an effective alternative to countermeasures.^[73]^\nIt is submitted that dispute settlement mechanisms do not exclude countermeasures and resort to dispute settlement procedure is not a prerequisite procedural requirement for the taking of countermeasures. Under current international law, dispute settlement mechanisms are not substitute for countermeasures and provisional and urgent countermeasures are allowed even after a dispute has been submitted to a mandatory dispute settlement mechanism.^[74]^ This is particularly the case in cyberspace. Damage caused by cyberattacks could spread rapidly in a short period of time, sometimes even beyond the control of the attackers, which traditional dispute settlement mechanisms of international law may be ill-equipped to address.^[75]^ Therefore, countermeasures may be excluded only if treaties between the states involved contain technical defensive measures that are effective in induce the responsible State to comply with its international obligations and to prevent further damage, thus able to provide the victim State appropriate mechanism for remedy. Otherwise, the taking of countermeasures should not be precluded in cyberspace, even if the dispute is subject to a dispute settlement process.\n## V. Substantive Requirement for Taking Countermeasures in Cyberspace: The Principle of Proportionality\nCountermeasures taken by the injured State must comply with the principle of proportionality. If the countermeasures exceed the reasonable boundary set by the proportionality test, they will be punitive and retaliatory in nature and will no longer be legitimate under international law but rather an internationally wrongful act.^[76]^ Article 51 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States provides that countermeasures must be commensurate with the injury suffered. Under the proportionality test, countermeasures are assessed against the injuries suffered, not only in purely “quantitative” terms but also “qualitative” factors. This proportionality is equally applicable to countermeasures in cyberspace, which was clearly confirmed in the report published by the UNGGE in 2015.^[77]^\n^[73]^ *Id.*, at 235.\n^[74]^ *Id.*, at 236.\n^[75]^ Trojans can have multiple variants as they spread.

Cases Applying the Principle of Proportionality\nAssessing the proportionality of a countermeasure is not only controversial$^{78}$ but also challenging.$^{79}$ The principle of proportionality is concerned with the intensity of countermeasures, aiming to establish a benchmark for countermeasures and restrict them within a reasonable limit. Such test essentially is matter of degree and the outcome of applying the principle of proportionality is unpredictable. The International Law Commission points out explicitly that what is proportionate is not a matter which can be determined precisely and can at best be accomplished by approximation.$^{80}$ The Draft Articles on Responsibility of States does not set out any specific rules on the application of the proportionality test, but only provide the factors to be considered: (1) the extent of the injury suffered; (2) the gravity of the internationally wrongful act; (3) the rights of the injured and responsible State (and interests of other States) that are affected; and (4) the necessity of inducing the responsible State to fulfill its obligations.$^{81}$ This exercise involves value judgment and balancing of interests, thus subjective in nature. Moreover, the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States does not articulate the hierarchy of these factors elements. Therefore, there is still no clear guidance on the application of the principle of proportionality, lacking much-needed predictability and certainty.\nThere are very few cases concerning the proportionality of countermeasures in current international law, among which the only successful one is the Air Service Agreement arbitration case in 1978.$^{82}$ In 1946, France and the USA signed a bilateral agreement to open international air routes between the two States. Disputes arose between the two countries when France refused to allow a change of gauge in London by American flights. As a countermeasure, the USA planned to suspend some flights from Paris to the U.S. In its award, the arbitral tribunal did not make a quantitative analysis of the damage caused by the French wrongful act and the impact of the American countermeasure, but rather a qualitative analysis of the impact of the French illegal act. The key factor considered by the Tribunal was the importance of legal principles involved to the USA, and especially its impact on American aviation policy.$^{83}$ Since the 1970s, the USA has pursued the policy of aviation liberalization and concluded a number of air transport agreements with other States, promoting the opening of international air transport market. The French act restricted the freedom of air transportation, which was incompatible with American aviation policy. In addition, bilateral treaties signed by the USA with other States also contained similar provisions on change of gauge. The French act would affect the interpretation and application of these provisions, which may have significant adverse impact on America. Therefore, the arbitral tribunal concluded that the U.S. countermeasure did not obviously violate the principle of proportionality.$^{84}$ In this case, the key\n\nThe Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law\nfactors considered by the tribunal, i.e., the importance of the aviation policy and the potential impact of the damage, involves qualitative evaluation which is a general approximation rather than an accurate quantitative measurement.\nAnother one is the Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project case in 1997 in which the principle of proportionality was applied and a negative conclusion was made. In this case, Hungary and Slovakia signed an agreement to jointly build a dam on the Danube in 1977. During the implementation of the agreement, Hungary unilaterally terminated the construction of the dam. As a countermeasure, Slovakia diverted the Danube in its territory to intercept water resources. Different from the Air Service Agreement case, the ICJ combined quantitative and qualitative analysis in this case. First, from a qualitative perspective, the Court pointed out that the countermeasure had affected Hungary's important rights to equitable and reasonable share of natural resources of the Danube, including both navigational and non-navigational use. Second, the Court analyzed the intensity of the countermeasure taken by Slovakia. It held that Slovakia had unilaterally diversified and controlled 80% to 90% of water resources of the Danube. Measures with such magnitude will have a significant impact on the ecosystem of the Danube basin, clearly exceeding the reasonable limit, and thus inconsistent with the principle of proportionality. In this case, the Danube is an important international river. The sheer volume of water being diversified, 80% to 90%, was a prima facie indication that the measure was probably out of proportionality. Thus it is a relatively easy case to adjudicate. However, if the amount of water resources affected by the countermeasure was in the range of 10% to 50%, the issue of proportionality would be in the grey area.\n## 2. The Benchmark for the Proportionality test\nThe benchmark for the proportionality test is also a controversial issue. The Draft Articles on Responsibility of States set injury as the benchmark for evaluating proportionality, allowing the injured State to retaliate against the injuring State with an equivalent damage, and thus forcing the injuring State to cease the infringement. This is not fundamentally different from the private retaliation of \"an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.\" It may lead to countermeasure going beyond what is strictly necessary for its very purpose and become punitive in nature. Therefore, there are inherent contradictions in the regime on countermeasures as set out by the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States. This benchmark works well only among States with comparable strength. On the other hand, if there is a significant gap in strength between the countries involved,\n See the Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project (Hungary/Slovakia), Judgment, ICJ Reports 1997.\n In the judgment, the ICJ adopted a two-step approach. First, the Court found that Hungary violated the treaty concluded by both parties, which constituted an internationally wrongful act. Secondly, the Court discussed whether Slovakia's acts constituted countermeasures, one of the most important factor of which was the principle of proportionality. *Id.*, at para. 82.\n *Id.*, at paras. 85–86.\n See Nigel White &amp; Ademola Abass, *Countermeasures and Sanctions*, in Malcolm Evans ed., International Law, at 513 (Cambridge University Press 2018).\nWuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers\ncountermeasure as under the current proportionality test may be abused by those powerful States as an excuse to bully the weak ones.\nIn recent years, some scholars proposed a functional approach towards the proportionality test, arguing that the purpose to be achieved d by countermeasures shall be used as the benchmark. Countermeasures are instrumental, and their purposes are to force the injuring State to cease its wrongful act and to comply with its international obligations, so that the relations between the two States can be restored. Therefore, the proportionality of countermeasures should be assessed against its purpose, irrespective of whether they exceed the intensity of the wrongful act.\nIn April 2007, Estonia suffered a three-week-long DDoS cyberattack and a large number of critical infrastructure websites, including those of government agencies, were forced to shut down, resulting in network paralysis and service disruption with severe damage. If the cyberattack could be attributed to Russia, Estonia could respond with DDoS countermeasures. In terms of the intensity, Estonia may not achieve its purpose if the countermeasures were of equivalent magnitude as that of the cyberattack because Russia's size and strength are far greater than Estonia's. Achieving the purpose of inducing Russia to cease its internationally wrongful act would likely require countermeasures that far exceed the damage caused by Russia's wrongful act. Therefore, taking the purpose of countermeasures as the benchmark is more in line with their very aim. Meanwhile, such approach taking into consideration the differences in strength of nations, prevents the abuse by stronger State, thus more fair and equitable.\nTherefore, the principle of proportionality lacks clear rules and is full of uncertainties. Its application in cyberspace is even more challenging. This is because cyberspace is interconnected and cyberattacks are dynamic and constantly changing, making it difficult and time-consuming to assess the damage caused. The injured State shall be extremely cautious when evaluating the proportionality of the countermeasures. This will not preclude the possibility for taking countermeasures in response to cyberattacks. A practical approach is to adopt cyber measures as an effective response to cyberattacks, because this type of countermeasures is of the same nature as the wrongful act and is more likely to be regarded as consistent with the principle of proportionality.\n See Enzo Cannizzaro, *The Role of Proportionality in the Law of International Countermeasure*, 12 European Journal of International Law 889 (2001).\n See Ma Chunmao, *A Review of Estonia’s Cyber Warfare*, at https://tech.sina.com.cn/i/2009-02-04/08172791102.shtml (last visited June 3, 2019).\n See Nicholas Tsagourias, *The Law Applicable to Countermeasures against Low Intensity Cyber Operations*, 14 Baltic Yearbook of International Law Online 105 (2015).\n Proportionality does not mean reciprocity. The obligation breached by countermeasures does not necessarily need to be same as the obligation breached by the responsible State, nor does the nature and means of the countermeasure.\n See Paragraph 5 of the commentary to the introductory part of Chapter II in Part Three of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States.\nThe Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law\nTraditionally cyberattacks are dealt with through a passive defense system, consisting of a firewall, intrusion detection and prevention mechanism with antivirus software as the commonly deployed technology. Under such system, only after it is attacked will the antivirus software be able to obtain the vital information and code of the virus and update its database. So that the same viruses can be detected and removed next time they appear. The inherent deficiency is that only after the virus attacks can loopholes in the system be identified and fixed. Thus the antivirus software is always behind the virus and even the most sophisticated firewall may be breached. As a result, passive defense cannot does not offer satisfactory solution to network security. Modern network security is increasingly rely on active defense through early detection of cyberattacks and deception techniques to contain and constrain the attacks. For example, sandbox and honeypot are commonly used technical methods, which in fact deliberately expose some vulnerabilities for attackers and then to obtain critical information of the attackers when they intrude the system. These techniques offers protection to the system and buys time for the injured State to examine the cyberattack and to develop appropriate countermeasures.[94] Such means do not compromise or damage the attacker's network facilities or computer systems, thus consistent with the principle of proportionality.\nMore extreme active defenses measures are even aggressive in nature, i.e., hacking back. Such technics involve hacking into the attacker's computer system, erasing the stolen data, or even planting ransomware. This type of defense involves cyber measures thus similar to cyberattacks in nature. However, this does not necessarily mean such measures fulfill the proportionality test because equivalence in nature is only one of the factors considered in the evaluation of proportionality. In practice, it is still necessary to consider other factors of the proportionality test and keeping cyber countermeasures within the reasonable limits allowed by international law.\nIn summary, the application of the principle proportionality is controversial and challenging. The Draft Articles on Responsibility of States fails to provide clear guidance, but only lists the factors to be considered. Furthermore, the benchmark against which proportionality is assessed against is not without controversy. Considerable uncertainties remain with regard to the application of countermeasures in cyberspace. A practical and effective approach is to adopt cyber countermeasures in response to cyberattacks and ensure the impact of such measures are within a reasonable limit.\n# VI. Conclusion\nThe fundamental aim of international law on the countermeasure is to limit it to a reasonable extent and prevent such measures being abused leading to the escalation of disputes. However, the boundaries of countermeasures permitted by international law remains unsettled. During the\n[94] If the attacker took advantage of the vulnerabilities of the honeypot to launch a cyberattack against a third country, the State that set up the honeypot may be found violating its due diligence obligations.\nWuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers\ndrafting process of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States, every rule on countermeasures had been a matter of controversy. Major differences among States on this issue were also highlighted at the 2017 Session of the UNGGE, where disagreements led to the absence of a consensus report and the breakdown of negotiations. The function and mission of the UNGGE is not to create or modify the rules of international law in cyberspace, but to discuss how international law is applied. Thus despite the failure of the negotiation process of the UNGGE, international law, including rules on countermeasures, is still applicable to cyberspace. This basic position has been confirmed by the International Group of Experts in its 2015 report.\nCompared with the traditional physical space of State sovereignty, cyberspace as a relatively new domain has its own unique features, creating new issues to the application of countermeasures. Current international law on the countermeasure as articulated in the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States, imposing stringent conditions to prevent its abuse, are ill-equipped to deal with cyberattacks. It adopts the basic position that countermeasure is illegal per se, to discourage its usage in practice. The prerequisites for taking countermeasures is the existence of internationally wrongful acts; in cyberspace the attribution of cyberattacks to States is challenging. In addition, the procedural requirements for taking countermeasure are impractical in cyberspace and the proportionality test is highly subjective and unpredictable. These facts have greatly diminished the effectiveness and certainty of the application of countermeasures in cyberspace. This is one of the major reason why there are few cases where state invoked countermeasures. Therefore, current international law does not offer clear rules and guidance on how to apply countermeasures in cyberspace. The international law regime on this issue is still at the early stage of development and is still evolving.\n(Translators: Meng Chao &amp; Wang Yi)",

Although enterprises are frequently subject to cyberattacks,[24] the measures taken by enterprises in response to cyberattacks do not constitute the countermeasures under international law.[25] Second, the object of countermeasures must be the State rather than non-State actors. In reality, there are very few inter-State cyberattacks, and most of such attacks are initiated by private non-State actors (e.g., patriotic hackers and lone wolves).[26] The first issue to be addressed in determining whether there is an internationally wrongful act is the attribution of cyberattacks, i.e., whether privately committed acts can be attributed to the State and constitute acts of the State.[27] If a cyberattack committed by a non-State actor is not attributed to the State, it [23] See Kim Zetter, Inside the Cunning, Unprecedented Hack of Ukraine’s Power Grid, at https://www.wired.com/2016/03/inside-cunning-unprecedented-hack-ukraines-power-grid/ (last visited June 3, 2023)."

The Instrumentality of Countermeasures In the application of countermeasures, the determination of an internationally wrongful act is unilateral in nature. The injured State makes its own judgment as to the existence of the internationally wrongful act and the gravity of the damage caused by such act, and makes its own decision as to whether or not and what countermeasures to take.^[54]^ For example, when the Sony Pictures Entertainment suffered a cyberattack in 2014, the U.S. Government, based on the information available to its intelligence community, believed that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea played a central role in the cyberattack, which constituted a State act. It then imposed economic sanctions on three Korean government agencies and officials.^[55]^ In this process, the US State had three roles to play, i.e., as the victim state of a cyberattack, the adjudicator of an internationally wrongful act, and implementer of countermeasures. This leads to an obvious conflict of interest and is prone to exaggerated assessment of the severity of the damage and the necessity of countermeasures, resulting in the escalation of disputes.^[56]^ The determination of an internationally wrongful act is a complex process of fact finding and application of law, which is not an easy task. There is no third-party body in the existing international law system to make an objective and neutral determination on the existence of an internationally wrongful act. In other words, countermeasures are taken on the basis of a one-sided claim of injured State and there is a possibility of abuse in practice. Some States may fabricate the existence of an internationally wrongful act and accuse another State of committing such act. Countermeasures may be used as a justification for the State to take measures such as sanctions, thus becoming a tool for strong countries to bully the weak. This is the greatest danger in the application of countermeasures in cyberspace, a cause for concern for developing countries in particular. Therefore, at the 2017 session of the UNGGE, developing countries, represented by Cuba, opposed the application of the right to self-defense and countermeasures to cyberspace.^[57]^ ^[54]^ Mary Ellen O’Connell, *supra* note 17, at 230."

Under the proportionality test, countermeasures are assessed against the injuries suffered, not only in purely “quantitative” terms but also “qualitative” factors. This proportionality is equally applicable to countermeasures in cyberspace, which was clearly confirmed in the report published by the UNGGE in 2015.^[77]^ ^[73]^ *Id.*, at 235."

      "## 2. The Benchmark for the Proportionality test The benchmark for the proportionality test is also a controversial issue. The Draft Articles on Responsibility of States set injury as the benchmark for evaluating proportionality, allowing the injured State to retaliate against the injuring State with an equivalent damage, and thus forcing the injuring State to cease the infringement. This is not fundamentally different from the private retaliation of\"an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.\"It may lead to countermeasure going beyond what is strictly necessary for its very purpose and become punitive in nature. Therefore, there are inherent contradictions in the regime on countermeasures as set out by the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States.⁸⁸ This benchmark works well only among States with comparable strength. On the other hand, if there is a significant gap in strength between the countries involved, ⁸⁵ See the Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project (Hungary/Slovakia), Judgment, ICJ Reports 1997."

Attribution of cyberattacks to the state is difficult. Though the doctrine of due diligence has the potential to addresses this problem by lowering the threshold of attribution, it may unduly expand the scope of State responsibility. In addition, the procedural requirements for takings countermeasures are impractical in cyberspace. The substantive requirement of proportionality is of fundamental importance, but lacks clear and workable benchmark. Therefore, application of countermeasures in cyberspace is fraught with uncertainties and international law on this issue remains unsettled.\nKeywords: cyberattack; countermeasures; attribution; principle of proportionality; due diligence # I. Introduction In recent years, cyberattacks have become more frequent. How to respond to cyberattacks and maintain cyber security has become an issue with significant strategic and practical implications that needs to be addressed urgently in the international community. Under international law, the injured State enjoys the right of self-defense against internationally wrongful acts that have reached the level of armed attack.¹ However, in practice, most cyberattacks do not reach the required threshold of use of force, letting alone an armed attack.² Taking the 2010 “Stuxnet” Incident for example, the prevailing view was that the cyberattacks did not constitute an armed attack in international law, notwithstanding that the virus had led to the damage of thousands of Iranian uranium enrichment centrifuges. Therefore, in most cases, a State is not able to exercise its right to self-defense against a cyberattack.³ * ZHU Lei (朱磊), Ph.D. in Law, associate professor at the Wuhan University Institute of International Law in China.\n¹ Armed attacks are the most serious type of use of force, according to the International Court of Justice’s opinion in the Nicaragua case. See Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), Judgement, ICJ Reports 1986, para.191.\n² See Michael N. Schmitt ed., Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations, at 538–531 (2nd edition, Cambridge University Press 2017). The book propose eight factors for assessing whether a cyberattack constitutes the use of force, including, severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability of effects, military character, state involvement and presumptive legality.\n³ See Robin Geiss &amp; Henning Lahmann, Freedom and Security in Cyberspace: Shifting the Focus Away from Military Responses towards Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention, in Katharina Ziolkowski ed., Peacetime Regime for State Activities in Cyberspace: International Law, International Relations and Diplomacy, at 628 (NATO CCDCOE Publication 2013).\nWuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers In response to these cyberattacks which do not rise to the level of an armed attack, States tend to respond in a non-forceful and peaceful manner in practice. For example, in January 2015, the United States (\"USA\") imposed economic sanctions on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea as a response to the cyberattack on Sony Pictures Entertainment.⁴ In response to the allegation that Russia had interfered in the United States' General Election through cyberattacks, the USA announced the expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats in December 2016.⁵ Cyberspace is considered as the new frontier of national sovereignty and international law is applicable in this area.⁶ The legal nature and status of the actions taken by the injured State in response to cyberattacks under international law is an issue that deserves serious consideration, in which the central issue involved is that of countermeasures. Similar to the right of self-defense, it allows a State to take its own measures of private remedies against an internationally wrongful act. Where certain conditions are met, it can preclude the wrongfulness of those measures and thereby relieve the responsibility of the State.\nThe countermeasure as a customary international law with a long history is controversial in international law. Its application to cyberspace is even more challenging because as an emerging field of science and technology, cyberspace has characteristics different from those areas of traditional State sovereignty. This paper analyzes how countermeasures in international law are applied to cyberspace in light of the characteristics of cyberspace, and examines the main issues and controversies in the application of countermeasures to cyberspace.",
    "## II. The Historical Development and Inherent Contradictories of Countermeasures ## 1. Historical Development of Countermeasures The term\"countermeasure\"was first used by the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office of the United Kingdom in 1916 in its correspondences with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Sweden.⁷ And the first detailed discussion on countermeasures was in the *Air Services Agreement* arbitration case in 1978.⁸ In this case, the USA made its claim based on countermeasures, which ⁴ See Zhuang Xiaodan, *Revenge for Sony Pictures? US Launches New Round of Sanctions against North Korea*, at https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_1290937 (last visited June 3, 2023).": "⁵ See Lu Jiafei &amp; Xu Jianmei, *U.S. Announces Sanctions against Russia for Alleged Cyberattacks to Interfere in U.S. Election*, at https://world.huanqiu.com/article/9CaKrnJZtjV (last visited June 3, 2019).\n⁶ UN Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (\"UNGGE\"), the main platform and mechanism for official intergovernmental dialogue on international law in cyberspace, acknowledged in its 2013 report that international law applies in cyberspace. See UN, A/68/98.\n⁷ See Omer Yousif Elagab, *The Place of Non-Forcible Counter-Measures in Contemporary International Law*, in Guy S. Goodwin-Gill &amp; Stefan Talmon eds., *The Reality of International Law: Essays in Honour of Ian Brownlie*, at 125 (Oxford University Press 1999).\n⁸ See the *Air Service Agreement* of 27 March 1946 between the United States of America and France (1978) 18 RIAA 417.\nThe Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law was upheld by the Arbitral Tribunal.⁹ The term was widely used after the Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (“Draft Articles on Responsibility of States”), adopted by the International Law Commission of the United Nations (“UNILC”) in 2001, which used the term and contained detailed rules on countermeasures in seven articles.¹⁰ The historical root of countermeasures is found in the traditional international law concept of reprisals,¹¹ which is essentially a mechanism of private remedy. The concept of “countermeasures” is used as a synonym for “reprisals” and inherits the key elements of the latter. The institution of reprisals in international law has a long history and its development can be divided into three stages.\nThe first stage was a completely liberal private reprisal, which was common in the early stage of the development of the rule of law, during which the State apparatus was not yet in place and public enforcement mechanisms for the law were missing. Where the rights of individuals were violated without remedy from public power, they could take it upon themselves to enforce the law and take reprisals as a means of obtaining the relief. In ancient Greece, the customary law of seizing foreigners existed in the city-states of Athens. Where a citizen of a city-state was killed by a foreigner or the government, the relatives of the victim enjoyed the right to capture and detain three citizens of that foreign state as hostages and demand that the perpetrator be presented or compensated. Where the claim was not met, the victim’s relatives would enjoy the right to kill the hostages to pay back the blood debt.¹² The second stage was the reprisal authorized by the State, essentially to incorporate reprisal into the framework of State regulation. The letter of reprisal¹³ offers a good example. It has its roots in Roman law.¹⁴ In ancient Rome, public authorities became involved in the system of reprisals and regulated it strictly. If the rights of a Roman citizen (especially a merchant) were violated by an alien, the victim could seize the citizen of that State to retaliate with procedural and substantive restrictions. Before the reprisal could be carried out, the victim must apply to the relevant State authority for a permit to do so. The precondition of obtaining the permit is that the victim had been treated unfairly by the courts of a foreign State and that his or her damages could not be compensated and his or her rights could not be remedied. The scope must be limited to the actual damage suffered by the victim and the seizure by force can be carried out only within the Roman territory or on international waters.¹⁵ ⁹ Omer Yousif Elagab, supra note 7, at 125–126.\n¹⁰ The International Court of Justice referred to the term twice in 1980 in the United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran case, and several times in the Nicaragua case in 1986.\n¹¹ See Malcolm N. Shaw, International Law 794 (Cambridge University Press 2008).\n¹² See David J. Bederman, International Law in Antiquity, at 123 (Cambridge University Press 2007).\n¹³ Letter of reprisal is also known as letter of marquee.\n¹⁴ Its modern formulation can be found in the Constitution of the United States of America, which in Section 8 of Article 1 authorizes the Congress to grant letters of marque and reprisal.\n¹⁵ See Wilhelm G. Grewe, The Epochs of International Law, at 117 (De Gruyter 2000).\nWuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers During the medieval period, reprisals centered on the letter of marquee, whereby armed privateers, with government concession, may chase and destroy foreign lawbreakers and fleets, as well as attack and plunder enemy merchant ships. By the 16th Century, wartime plundering became quite widespread and many States began to legislate and regulate the granting of such letters. Hugo Grotius in his book (1604), *De Jure Praedae*, legally defended the act of Dutch ships attacking Portuguese and Spanish ships. He argued that the granting of permit was akin to declaring a “private war,” justified by the fact that the laws of each State had no effective jurisdiction over the seas and that merchant ships had to arm themselves in self-defense.^[16]^ The third stage was to prohibit the use of forcible reprisal. Traditional reprisal includes both forcible and non-forcible means, the majority of which is forcible. In the early 20th Century, the international community restricted the use of force through a series of conventions. Modern international law prohibits the use of force and the Charter of the United Nations explicitly prohibits the use of force and the threat of force. As a result, forcible reprisal eventually receded from the stage of history. Accordingly, the term “countermeasures,” also known as “non-forcible reprisal,” was adopted to conform to the development of modern international law, which corresponded to reprisals by non-forcible means. In this way, the term can distinguish itself from reprisals by force and avoid the negative connotations associated with the concept of reprisals in traditional international law.^[17]^ ## 2. The Inherent Contradictories of Countermeasures A review of the historical development reveals its inherent tensions and contradictories, which is also the core issue to be addressed in contemporary international law. On the one hand, the existence of countermeasures is justified. In the absence of adequate public enforcement mechanisms when the rule of law is weak, reprisal offers a workable and efficient private solution. In domestic law, with the development of the rule of law, private enforcement of the law was increasingly limited and ultimately superseded by public enforcement of the law. By contrast, international law is based on the principle of sovereign equality and the international community is an egalitarian society. International law has an inherent flaw in that it lacks a centralized enforcement mechanism with enforcement authority that overrides the State, resulting in inadequate supply of public remedies. Therefore, it is necessary to have countermeasures as a form of private national remedies.\nThe essence of countermeasures, on the other hand, is to leave law enforcement in private hands, which could be harmful and even dangerous. Without any constraints, reprisal is highly vulnerable to abuse, plunging the international law into law of the jungle. Though the medieval letter of marquee was under the State’s regulation, it was often no different than piracy in practice. Bartolus de Saxoferrato (1314-1357), a famous European medieval jurist, wrote in a work published in ^[16] See Hugo Grotius, *Commentary on the Law of Prize and Booty*, at 62 (Liberty Fund 2012).\n^[17] See Mary Ellen O’Connell, *The Power and Purpose of International Law: Insights from the Theory and Practice of Enforcement*, at 233 (Oxford University Press 2011).\nThe Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law But, how can the balance between the reasonableness and the harm of countermeasures be achieved? This is the most difficult and contentious issue in the modern international law regime on countermeasures, which is also evident in the drafting process of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States. Although the majority of States recognized the necessity of countermeasures, many expressed concerns about the harmfulness of countermeasures. Therefore, in order to prevent the abuse of countermeasures, the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States adopted the principle of “conditional lawfulness” for countermeasures and set strict requirements for their implementation, in an attempt to prevent such measures from becoming tools for strong States to oppress weak States. Only countermeasures that have met these conditions are lawful; otherwise, they would be considered as internationally wrongful acts.\nThe rules established in the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States are the authoritative expression of modern international law on countermeasures, but they are also highly contentious. The fundamental disagreement during the development of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States was over the legal status of countermeasures, especially whether they are lawful or unlawful in nature. Representatives of some States took a positive attitude towards countermeasures, proposing that countermeasures are lawful in themselves, which are the rights enjoyed by States in international law, and are unlawful only under certain exceptional circumstances. However, this view was not supported by the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States which regarded countermeasures as unlawful *per se*.¹⁹ Countermeasures are internationally wrongful act that are in breach of internationally law, with the possibility of excluding the international wrongfulness of the act under certain circumstances. Therefore, countermeasures involve a situation excluding the wrongfulness of the act and may be invoked a defense to the accusation of internationally wrongful act. This fundamental stance taken by the UNILC is to discourage rather than promote the use of countermeasures.\nIn summary, countermeasures are the private enforcement of the law and have certain negative consequences. The historical development of countermeasures is a process of introducing more restrictions on its use and to bring it under the regulation of the law. In the meanwhile, international community is egalitarian in nature, which provides the solid foundation for its existence as an accepted form of enforcement under customary international law. Setting clear requirements for their use, mitigating their harmfulness, and limiting their application within an acceptable boundary are the key purpose for modern international law regime on countermeasures.\n¹⁸ Wilhelm G. Grewe, *supra* note 15, at 117.\n¹⁹ This basic principle is also reflected in Tallinn Manual 2.0 on International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations. See Michael N. Schmitt, *supra* note 2, at 225.\nWuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers ## III. Prerequisites for Taking Countermeasures in Cyberspace: Internationally Wrongful Acts in Cyberspace ## 1. Temporal Limitation of Countermeasures The existence of an internationally wrongful act is a prerequisite for taking countermeasures, which is the primary reason for the exclusion of its wrongfulness.²⁰ Countermeasures are similar to self-defense in this regard, which are taken in response to a prior internationally wrongful act by another State. As a result, countermeasures should be considered as the “shield” for defense rather than the “spear” for offense. The absence of an effective enforcement mechanism in international law allows the injured State to suspend its international obligations only when the other State has violated the law in the first place. In other words, the essence of countermeasures is to counteract an internationally wrongful act with an illegal act, with the goal of forcing the injuring State to resume its international obligations and restore normal relations between the two nations. Therefore, countermeasures are a part of the enforcement mechanism of international law, through which the injured State are able to protect its own rights and interests, thus also a mechanism of remedy in international law.\nCountermeasures must be taken against an ongoing internationally wrongful act and are not preventive or prospective. Once the wrongful act ceases, the countermeasures must also be ceased.²¹ Thus, if a cyberattack has not yet occurred or has ended, the injured State shall not take countermeasures. This rule significantly limits the possibility of an injured State to take countermeasures in response to a cyber-related wrongful act, because unlike traditional internationally wrongful acts, most cyberattacks are sudden and short-lived, leaving only a relatively limited period of time for an injured State to respond and diminishing the possibility of taking countermeasures in response to a cyberattack.\nIt is worth noting that modern cyberattacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, often requiring a large investment of manpower and resources, and their complexity and destructive power may be no less than a small-scale war.²² Complex cyberattacks take a long time from planning to actual implementation involving multiple steps such as intelligence collection, vulnerability detection, intrusion and infiltration into the network, and virus implantation. They often require coordination and cooperation of a professional and technical team. The time span of cyberattacks provides the opportunities and possibilities for injured State to monitor and detect cyberattacks earlier.\n--- ²⁰ See Denis Alland, *Countermeasures of General Interest*, 13 European Journal of International Law 1221 (2002).\n²¹ See Maurice Kamto, *The Time Factor in the Application of Countermeasures*, in James Crawford et al. eds., *The Law of International Responsibility*, at 1176 (Oxford University Press 2010).\n²² See Jiang Shibo, *Cyber Attacks and the Application of the Laws of War*, 16(2) Wuhan University International Law Review 43–70 (2014).\nThe Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law The cyberattack on the Ukrainian power grid on 23 December 2015 offers a good illustration. The cyberattack began in the spring of 2014, when the attackers first spear-phished IT staff and system administrators, causing viruses to infect systems and opening backdoors for subsequent cyberattacks. Over the following months, the attackers conducted extensive network reconnaissance, exploration and mapping efforts and gained the ability to manage user accounts within the network and employee login credentials. The final step of the cyberattack consisted of a series of coordinated actions, including reconfiguring the uninterruptible power supply, disconnecting the circuit breaker to take the substation offline, and launching a denial-of-service attack on the customer call center.[23] In order to deal with sophisticated cyberattacks, the injured State should develop and improve its capabilities of cyber-related technology, strengthen real-time supervision over cyberattacks, detect ongoing cyberattacks at an early stage, and fix vulnerabilities of the system and strengthen measures for cyber prevention and defense. If the cyberattack is still at such an early stage as the planning, vulnerability detection and intelligence gathering, the injured State should exercise restraint and should not take countermeasures; otherwise, it may cause miscalculation and lead to the escalation of disputes. Once a cyberattack enters the next stage of implementation, such as planting viruses and stealing account information, etc., it constitutes an internationally wrongful act in violation of international law, at which time the injured State may take countermeasures against the act without waiting for the final stage of the cyberattack to unfold.",
    "## 2. Attribution of Internationally Wrongful Acts Under international law, countermeasures are measures taken by a state against another state, which carries two important implications. Although enterprises are frequently subject to cyberattacks,[24] the measures taken by enterprises in response to cyberattacks do not constitute the countermeasures under international law.[25] Second, the object of countermeasures must be the State rather than non-State actors. In reality, there are very few inter-State cyberattacks, and most of such attacks are initiated by private non-State actors (e.g., patriotic hackers and lone wolves).[26] The first issue to be addressed in determining whether there is an internationally wrongful act is the attribution of cyberattacks, i.e., whether privately committed acts can be attributed to the State and constitute acts of the State.[27] If a cyberattack committed by a non-State actor is not attributed to the State, it [23] See Kim Zetter, Inside the Cunning, Unprecedented Hack of Ukraine’s Power Grid, at https://www.wired.com/2016/03/inside-cunning-unprecedented-hack-ukraines-power-grid/ (last visited June 3, 2023).": "[24] The 2017 Annual Internet Security Report released by Tencent Security pointed out that up to 86% of companies worldwide had experienced at least one cyberattack in 2017. Tencent’s 2017 Annual Internet Security Report: Nearly 90% of Global Companies Suffered Cyber Attacks, at http://tech.chinadaily.com.cn/2018-01/31/content_35621606.htm (last visited June 3, 2019).\n[25] See Michael N. Schmitt, Below the Threshold Cyber Operations: The Counter-Measures Response Option and International Law, 54 Virginia Journal of International Law 697 (2014).\n[26] See Michael N. Schmitt, In Defense of Due Diligence in Cyberspace, 125 Yale Law Journal Forum 77 (2015).\n[27] See Tom Ruys, Sanctions, Retorsions and Countermeasures: Concepts and International Legal Framework, in Larissa van den Herik ed., Research Handbook on UN Sanctions and International Law, at 14 (Edward Elgar Publishing 2016).\nWuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers may constitute a violation of domestic law, but not an internationally wrongful act in violation of international law, and the injured State cannot take countermeasures against such acts.²⁸ Attribution is an extremely challenging issue in identifying State responsibility in cyberspace, involving three layers of attribution. First, from the technical perspective, unlike traditional physical domains such as sea, land and air, the cyberspace is a decentralized system. Cyberspace is open, pluralistic, interoperable, and anonymous, and attackers often use encryption technology to transmit information in packets to hide their identities and sources, making the investigation of the source of cyberattacks quite complex, costly and protracted.²⁹ Second, after locating the source of cyberattacks through technical means, the subject behind the cyberattacks also needs to be identified. Even if the IP address is traced to a State's cyber infrastructure, it may not meet the criteria of burden of proof for attribution because IP addresses can be spoofed. For example, in 2013, an organization impersonating its IP address as from the Ukrainian government conducted cyber operations against the NATO Cyber Cooperative Defense Center of Excellence, the Estonian Defense Forces, and the armed forces of other NATO countries. Clearly, the conduct could not be attributed to the Ukrainian government.³⁰ Finally, it remains to determine whether the act committed by the attackers constitutes the act of a State, i.e., legal attribution. The key issue is whether cyberattacks committed by non-State actors can be attributed to the State and constitute internationally wrongful acts that entails State responsibility. The challenge is degree of connection required for attribution to the State the cyberattacks committed by non-State actors. Under Article 8 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States, the conduct of non-State actors acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of a State is attributable to that State. The International Court of Justice (\"ICJ\") established the doctrine of\"effective control\"in the Nicaragua case in 1987. In that case, the USA played a significant and decisive role in financing, organizing, training, supplying, and equipping the Nicaraguan Contras, but the ICJ found that the series of U.S. acts did not constitute\"effective control\"³¹ and thus could not meet the standard of attribution.\nThe doctrine of effective control requires the State play a direct and a leading role in the cyberattacks, not just a supporting one, setting a higher threshold for State responsibility for private conduct. For example, the USA believed that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea played a\"central role\"in the 2014 cyberattack on Sony Pictures, which rose to the level of effective control and imposed ²⁸ See Michael N. Schmitt, *Peacetime Cyber Responses and Wartime Cyber Operations under International Law: An Analytical Vade Mecum*, 8 Harvard National Security Journal 260 (2017).\n²⁹ See Huang Zhixiong ed., *On Cyber Sovereignty—Jurisprudence, Policy and Practice*, at 39 (Social Sciences Academic Press 2017).\n³⁰ See Michael N. Schmitt, *supra* note 2, at 203.\n³¹ *Supra* note 1, at para. 115.\nThe Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law sanctions against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.³² In contrast, Iranian hackers conducted DDoS cyberattacks against a number of U.S. financial institutions between 2011 and 2013. Although these hackers had ties to the Iranian government, such ties did not rise to the level of effective control and therefore the attacks could not be attributed to Iran and the USA could not take countermeasures against Iran accordingly.³³ The Tallinn Manual 2.0 on International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations (“Tallinn Manual 2.0”) adopts the ICJ’s standard of effective control. It gives the following illustrative example. A State plans and oversees an operation to use a software update to implant a new vulnerability in software widely used by another state in its governmental computers. The former State enters into a confidential contract with the company that produced the software to embed the vulnerability and directs the course of action. In such a case the State planned, directed, and supervised over a particular cyberattack and took a leading and direct role in the operation, which is fundamentally different from the ancillary role played by the US government in the Nicaragua case and thus the company’s conduct is attributable to the State.³⁴ The doctrine of effective control adopts a relatively stringent criterion of attribution, which makes it difficult for the injured State to prove, thus severely limiting the application of countermeasures. In practice, the injuring State may not directly organize the implementation of cyberattacks, but indirectly support cyberattacks as a way to avoid State responsibility. Moreover, cyberattacks are secretive and complex, and attackers often use technical means to hide the source of the attack, so it is not easy to obtain conclusive evidence to prove the extent of State involvement in such cyberattacks and the role played by the State. And such evidence is often located in the injuring State or even across the globe, which is difficult to obtain and even if obtained, the timing for taking countermeasures may has already elapsed.³⁵ For example, Estonia was subjected to a DDoS attack in 2007 and investigation revealed that the source of the attack was computers from 178 countries, including Vietnam and the USA. The cyberattack lasted for three weeks, providing a valuable time for evidence collection and attribution. However, to date, there is still no conclusive evidence of to attribute the responsibility to Russia.³⁶ In summary, the rules on attribution in international law are established for traditional internationally wrongful acts and thus are difficult to apply to cyberspace. It has the effect of greatly limiting the possibility of taking countermeasures in cyberspace. Some scholars argued that the constraints of existing customary law should be lifted and States should be allowed to take countermeasures ³² Zhuang Xiaodan, supra note 4.\n³³ See BBC: US Indicts 7 Iranian Hackers for Breaching Multiple Financial Firms, at https://news.youth.cn/gj/201603/t20160325_7779822.htm (last visited June 3, 2019).\n³⁴ See Michael N.

    "## 3. Due Diligence To address the difficulty of attribution under the doctrine of effective control, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 introduces due diligence into cyberspace, proposing that a State must exercise due diligence in not allowing its territory, or territory or cyber infrastructure under its governmental control, to be used for cyber operations that affect the rights of, and produce serious adverse consequences for, other States.³⁸ This lowers the criterion of attribution required by the doctrine of effective control and reduces the threshold of State responsibility for acts of private subjects, essentially as a type of vicarious liability.³⁹ This is an important development and breakthrough compared to the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (Tallinn Manual 1.0).": "The ICJ has affirmed the doctrine of due diligence in the Corfu Channel case,⁴⁰ the Tehran Hostage case,⁴¹ and the Nicaragua case.⁴² For example, in the Corfu Channel case, although the mines were not laid by Albania, the area where the incident occurred was Albanian territorial waters and Albania should bear the regulatory responsibility for that area. Also, judging from the geographical location and expertise, Albania had the knowledge of the mines laid in the Corfu Channel,⁴³ but failed to take relevant measures, and therefore should bear responsibility. The ICJ stated that every State has an obligation “not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States.”⁴⁴ Under the doctrine of due diligence, a State must take active measures to prevent, reduce or limit the occurrence of damage, which is essentially an obligation to prevent transnational damage. The infrastructure on which cyberspace is based is physical, located in a particular State, and falls within the sovereign jurisdiction of that State, and due diligence is equally applicable. This basic position was also adopted by the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Information Security (“UNGGE”) in its report issued in 2015.⁴⁵ Therefore, if a State violates due diligence in ³⁷ See Gary Corn &amp; Eric Talbot Jensen, *The Use of Force and Cyber Countermeasures*, 32 Temple International &amp; Comparative Law Journal 127 (2018).\n³⁸ See Michael N. Schmitt, *supra* note 2, at 128.\n³⁹ See Huang Zhixiong, *The Attribution of Cyberattacks in International Law*, 5 Global Law Review 164 (2014).\n⁴⁰ See Corfu Channel (United Kingdom v. Albania), Judgment, ICJ Reports 1949, at 22.\n⁴¹ See the United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran (United States v. Iran), Judgment, ICJ Report 1980, para. 63.\n⁴² *Supra* note 1, at para.157.\n⁴³ *Supra* note 40, at para. 65.\n⁴⁴ *Supra* note 40, at para. 67.\n⁴⁵ See UN, A/70/174.\nThe Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law cyberspace, it constitutes an internationally wrongful act and the injured State is entitled to take countermeasures.\nThe most controversial issue in practice is the scope of the obligation assumed by a State under the doctrine of due diligence. On this issue, two extreme positions should be avoided. If a liberal approach is adopted, i.e., a State assumes little or even no obligation, this will lead to the abuse of the principle of sovereignty, allowing the use of network facilities to infringe upon the interests of other States.\nOn the other hand, an expanded interpretation would broaden the scope of due diligence, constitute an unreasonable restriction on State sovereignty, which lacks a basis in international law. In this regard, the view of U.S. military judge Matthew J. Sklerov is quite representative. He advocated that strict criminal legislation and law enforcement could effectively prevent cyberattacks,⁴⁶ and argued that the State's obligation in cyberspace includes passing stringent criminal laws, conducting vigorous investigations, prosecuting attackers, and, during the investigation and prosecution, cooperating with the victim state of cyberattacks that originated from within their borders.⁴⁷ According to this view, knowledge of the occurrence of the damage is also not a requirement for the assumption of due diligence.⁴⁸ In other words, the State has the obligation to take active criminal action to prevent and stop illegal cyberattacks, and the State's negligence or omission in any respect constitutes tacit approval and sheltering of such attacks⁴⁹ and constitutes a violation of due diligence.\nIn practice, however, cyberattacks are often deceptive and disguised, and attackers may use the network infrastructure of other States to carry out remote attacks. Matthew J. Sklerov's view underestimated the complexity of cyberattacks in practice, which may lead to a misjudgment on state responsibility of cyberattacks. The USA, with its significant political, economic, and military position in the world, is often the target of cyberattacks, but it is difficult to hold the relevant States responsible in practice due to the problem of attribution. This view which expands the scope of due diligence attempts to lift the constraints and limitations under traditional rules of international law and to lower the threshold of State responsibility, thus enabling the USA to take countermeasures against other States more easily. Such practice should come under close scrutiny.\nThe appropriate approach on this issue is to return to the current framework of international law under which a State assumes due diligence responsibility only to the extent of knowledge on the occurrence of damage.⁵⁰ This basic principle was also endorsed in the report of the UNGGE issued in 2015, and is a commonly held position by States. Under this doctrine, knowledge may be actual ⁴⁶ See Matthew J. Sklerov, Solving the Dilemma of State Responses to Cyberattacks: A Justification for the Use of Active Defenses against States Who Neglect Their Duty to Prevent, 201 Military Law Review 71 (2009).\n⁴⁷ Id., at 62.\n⁴⁸ Id., at 71.\n⁴⁹ Id.\n⁵⁰ Supra note 40, at para.18.\nWuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers or constructive. A State may be found to have actual knowledge of a cyberattack if it has detected or has been notified by the injured State of an attack originating from that country.^[51]^ The essence of constructive knowledge is the reverse of the burden of proof. The challenge of attribution in cyberspace is evidence, and in the case of constructive knowledge the burden of proof is shifted to the territorial State where the cyberattack originated which have more evidence than the victim state. Therefore it is presumed to have knowledge of the cyberattack with the possibility of rebuttal.^[52]^ With the sheer number of Internet users and the technology to hide their identities and even erase traces of Internet access, it is almost impossible to achieve complete and comprehensive regulation in cyberspace. But this does not mean that the State is unaware of cyber operations within its borders. Whether a State is aware of cyberattacks is closely related to its technical capacities and the regulatory policy it adopts in cyberspace.\nCyberspace is highly complex and technical in nature, and cyber regulation relies on the relevant cyber technical capacities which many developing countries may lack. This is an important factor that must be taken into account when assessing knowledge. Otherwise, it may unduly expand the scope of due diligence obligations. On the other hand, every State regulates cyber activities within its territory to some extent, and an absolutely free cyberspace does not exist. Title V of the Convention on Cybercrime explicitly requires contracting parties to collect and record computer data in real time, which does not only include traffic data, but also content data.\nCyber supervision and regulation is common practice among states, and the difference lies in the degree of its stringency. If a State has strict supervision over cyberspace, it is more likely to know that a cyberattack has occurred, and it can even constitute\"constructive knowledge.\"For example, in May 2013, the U.S. energy security was significantly threatened by a cyberattack on the critical control systems of energy companies and attackers were even able to manipulate the oil and gas pipelines. The U.S. officials said that although there was no conclusive evidence that the cyberattack was supported by the Iranian government, it was unlikely that the Iranian government was unaware of the attack because the Iranian government had centralized control over the cyberspace.^[53]^ This offers a good example of the how the constructive knowledge may be applied in practice.\nIn summary, the precondition for taking countermeasures is the existence of an internationally wrongful act. What is challenging in cyberspace is how to attribute cyberattacks committed by non-State actors to the State. Under the traditional doctrine of effective control, the threshold for attribution is high and difficult to reach in cyberspace. While the doctrine of due diligence may ^[51]^ See Wolff Heintschel von Heinegg, *Legal Implications of Territorial Sovereignty in Cyberspace*, in Christian Czosseck *et al.* eds., 2012 4th International Conference on Cyber Conflict (NATO CCDCOE Publications, Tallin, 2012).\n^[52]^ For example, if a government-dedicated network infrastructure is used to carry out a cyberattack, there is a presumption that the government of that State had knowledge of the cyberattack because the network was under the full control and supervision of the government.\n^[53]^ See N. Perlroth &amp; D. Sanger, *New Computer Attacks Traced to Iran*, Officials Say, The New York Times (May 24, 2013).\nThe Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law step in to solve this problem, the danger is that the scope of due diligence may be overly broad. A balanced approach is that State responsibility only limited cyberattacks to which the State has knowledge of.",
    "## IV. Procedural Requirements for Taking Countermeasures in Cyberspace ## 1. The Instrumentality of Countermeasures In the application of countermeasures, the determination of an internationally wrongful act is unilateral in nature. The injured State makes its own judgment as to the existence of the internationally wrongful act and the gravity of the damage caused by such act, and makes its own decision as to whether or not and what countermeasures to take.^[54]^ For example, when the Sony Pictures Entertainment suffered a cyberattack in 2014, the U.S. Government, based on the information available to its intelligence community, believed that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea played a central role in the cyberattack, which constituted a State act. It then imposed economic sanctions on three Korean government agencies and officials.^[55]^ In this process, the US State had three roles to play, i.e., as the victim state of a cyberattack, the adjudicator of an internationally wrongful act, and implementer of countermeasures. This leads to an obvious conflict of interest and is prone to exaggerated assessment of the severity of the damage and the necessity of countermeasures, resulting in the escalation of disputes.^[56]^ The determination of an internationally wrongful act is a complex process of fact finding and application of law, which is not an easy task. There is no third-party body in the existing international law system to make an objective and neutral determination on the existence of an internationally wrongful act. In other words, countermeasures are taken on the basis of a one-sided claim of injured State and there is a possibility of abuse in practice. Some States may fabricate the existence of an internationally wrongful act and accuse another State of committing such act. Countermeasures may be used as a justification for the State to take measures such as sanctions, thus becoming a tool for strong countries to bully the weak. This is the greatest danger in the application of countermeasures in cyberspace, a cause for concern for developing countries in particular. Therefore, at the 2017 session of the UNGGE, developing countries, represented by Cuba, opposed the application of the right to self-defense and countermeasures to cyberspace.^[57]^ ^[54]^ Mary Ellen O’Connell, *supra* note 17, at 230.": "^[55]^ See Li Liangyong, *U.S. Sanctions North Korea over Sony “Hack,” No Response from North Korea*, at http://www.xinhuanet.com/world/2015-01/04/c_127354664.htm (last visited June 3, 2023).\n^[56]^ See N. Jansen Calamita, *Sanctions, Countermeasures, and the Iranian Nuclear Issue*, 42 Vanderbilt Journal of Transnational Law 1420 (2009).\n^[57]^ See Anders Henriksen, *The End of the Road for the UNGGE Process: The Future Regulation of Cyberspace*, 5 Journal of Cybersecurity 1 (2019).\nWuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers In order to prevent countermeasures from being abused and leading to the escalation of disputes, and to ensure that they are taken only when they are necessary to achieve their purpose, Article 52 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States set out a series of stringent procedural requirements for countermeasures. Countermeasures, which are instrumental in nature, are intended to induce the responsible State to cease its violations, to comply with and fulfill its international obligations again and to restore lawful relations between the two States. But, countermeasures are not the only way to achieve such end. The fundamental principle of peaceful settlement of international disputes is well established in modern international law[68] and Article 33 of the UN Charter provides a list of pacific methods,[59] which shall be given priority in international dispute settlement. In contrast, countermeasures are exceptional in nature[60] and shall be taken only as the last resort. The injured State should first seek to resolve the disputes through the usual dispute settlement methods contained in Article 33 of the UN Charter, rather than through countermeasures.\nThe victim State shall invoke State responsibility against the injuring State in the first instance. Countermeasures shall not be taken if the injuring State has ceased the wrongful act and undertaken to pay compensation. Second, the injured State should also comply with its obligation to notify in advance and to seek a negotiated settlement of the dispute; this is the second procedural requirement for the taking of countermeasures.[61] In this process, the case of state responsibility is presented to the injuring State and to put some pressure on it to cooperate, thus giving the injuring State a second chance.[62] Finally, an injured State may not take countermeasures when a dispute has already been submitted to a dispute settlement mechanism.\nThese procedural requirements for countermeasures apply equally in the cyberspace. In particular, the last two procedural requirements are controversial which triggered intense debate in the course of formulating the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States. Their application in cyberspace is even more challenging, which will be discussed below.",
    "## 2. Notification and Seeking to Settle Disputes through Negotiations In order to prevent escalation of a dispute, the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States provides that the injured State should notify the responsible State of any decision to take countermeasures The Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law and offer to negotiate with that State.⁶³ In practice, notification and negotiation are not two separate steps. The purpose of notification is to give the injuring State an opportunity to respond. If the injuring State does so, it constitutes the start of negotiations between the Parties.⁶⁴ In cyberspace, notification is necessary because cyberattacks are often covert. Notification gives the responsible State an opportunity for clarification and prevents misjudgment and the escalation of disputes.": "However, the obligation to notify as a procedural requirement in cyberspace faces a number of challenges. First, it is not supported by current state practice. When a State take measures to respond to an internationally wrongful act, usually it does not invoke countermeasure as a justification. Even the issue is subject to a dispute settlement procedure, the victim State usually argues that its act complies with international law in the first instance. Countermeasures come into play only when the act is found to be internationally wrongful, i.e., as a defense and exemption from state responsibility.⁶⁵ Therefore, although there are a large number of cases in which countermeasures have been taken to respond to internationally wrongful acts, the number of cases in which countermeasures are invoked are very limited in practice. For example, the U.S. Government expelled Russian diplomatic officials in response to alleged Russia’s interference with the U.S. general election through cyberattacks in 2016, but it did not explicitly mention countermeasure as its legal basis.⁶⁶ Second, obligation to notify in cyberspace may be impractical. This is because the tracing the source of cyberattacks is complex and challenging. In practice, it is often difficult to identify who the attacker is and where it is originated, rendering notification being impossible. Furthermore, prior notification is likely to diminish the effectiveness of countermeasures in cyberspace.⁶⁷ This is particularly the case if countermeasures are taken through cyber means. Once the injuring State becomes aware of the countermeasures, the cyber tools can be captured and reused. Moreover, an injuring State, having been notified of countermeasures, may temporarily suspend cyberattacks as a means of avoiding such measures, because countermeasures shall cease as well in such situation. Therefore, prior notification may render countermeasures meaningless and ineffective.\nThe obligation to notify is not absolute and the injured State may take such urgent countermeasures as necessary.⁶⁸ This is also recognized by The Tallinn Manual 2.0 which points out that urgent ⁶³ A small number of experts argued that negotiation is also one of the prior procedural requirement for taking countermeasures. The majority of experts did not agree and were in the opinion that this may be an excuse for the responsible State to stall for time. See Michael N. Schmitt, supra note 2, at 152.\n⁶⁴ Mary Ellen O’Connell, supra note 17, at 259.\n⁶⁵ For example, in the Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project case, Slovakia did not claim that its actions constitute countermeasures, instead revoked other grounds as justification. The application of countermeasures arose only after its claims had not been upheld and its actions were found internationally wrongful. See the Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project (Hungary/Slovakia), Judgment, ICJ Reports 1997, para. 82.\n⁶⁶ Lu Jiafei &amp; Xu Jianmei, supra note 5.\n⁶⁷ Gary Corn &amp; Eric Talbot Jensen, supra note 37.\n⁶⁸ See Article 52 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States.\nWuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers countermeasures are highly likely in cyberspace. Cyberattacks are often both unpredictable and can spread rapidly over a short period of time, even capable of significantly impairing critical infrastructure.⁶⁹ Thus any delay in time may cause unknown and even irreparable damage. In such circumstances, the victim State may take urgent countermeasures without prior notification to the injuring State. For example, a State is being attacked by a serious internationally wrongful cyber operation. The injured State intends to respond by blocking all electronic access to the bank accounts of the responsible State. If the responsible State is notified of that intention, it will have the opportunity to transfer the assets out of the country, effectively depriving the injured State of the possibility of taking such countermeasure.⁷⁰ Therefore, urgent countermeasure is of significant practical implications as they may be used more widely in cyberspace.",
    "## 3. Dispute Settlement Mechanisms International laws provide for dispute settlement mechanisms capable of rendering a binding decision on a dispute, thus offering relief to the injured State. This would undermine the very underlying reason that justify countermeasure, i.e., international law lacks a centralized enforcement mechanism. In addition, such mechanisms may reach a final resolution of the disputes between the states. By contrast, countermeasures are temporary in nature and cannot solve the dispute definitively, and the dispute may eventually be submitted to dispute settlement procedures. Thus the countermeasure is a less favored means of dispute resolution.": "The relationship between countermeasures and dispute settlement mechanisms was one of the most controversial issues in the formulation of Draft Articles on Responsibility of States. The special rapporteur, Gaetano Arangio Ruiz, advocated the idea that the injured State is obliged to submit the dispute to the dispute settlement procedure before resorting to countermeasures, which is also reflected in the text he drafted.⁷¹ However, this view was not supported by States. The final text provides, in Article 52(3), that Countermeasures may not be taken, and if already taken must be suspended without undue delay if the dispute is pending before a court or tribunal which has the authority to make decisions binding on the parties.⁷² In the process of formulating the Tallinn Manual 2.0, the majority of the International Group of Experts adopted the position of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States. However, the application of the rule was not without controversy. Members of the International Group of Experts were divided on whether or not such obligation is absolute. Some experts held the opinion that such ⁶⁹ See Katharine C. Hinkle, Countermeasures in the Cyber Context: One More Thing to Worry about, 37 Yale Journal of International Law Online 11 (2011).\n⁷⁰ See Michael N. Schmitt, supra note 2, at 234–235.\n⁷¹ Mary Ellen O’Connell, supra note 17, at 258.\n⁷² The phrase “court or tribunal” refers to any third-party dispute settlement procedure, whatever its designation. The court or tribunal must have the power to order interim measures that are capable of protecting the purportedly injured State. See Michael N. Schmitt, supra note 2, at 235.\nThe Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law a dispute settlement mechanism is mandatory if it is explicitly required by international law. On the other hand, a minority of the experts argued that, rather than creating an absolute obligation, a case-by-case analysis should be undertaken to evaluate whether a third-party dispute settlement body had sufficient capacities to protect the rights of the injured State thus providing an effective alternative to countermeasures.^[73]^ It is submitted that dispute settlement mechanisms do not exclude countermeasures and resort to dispute settlement procedure is not a prerequisite procedural requirement for the taking of countermeasures. Under current international law, dispute settlement mechanisms are not substitute for countermeasures and provisional and urgent countermeasures are allowed even after a dispute has been submitted to a mandatory dispute settlement mechanism.^[74]^ This is particularly the case in cyberspace. Damage caused by cyberattacks could spread rapidly in a short period of time, sometimes even beyond the control of the attackers, which traditional dispute settlement mechanisms of international law may be ill-equipped to address.^[75]^ Therefore, countermeasures may be excluded only if treaties between the states involved contain technical defensive measures that are effective in induce the responsible State to comply with its international obligations and to prevent further damage, thus able to provide the victim State appropriate mechanism for remedy. Otherwise, the taking of countermeasures should not be precluded in cyberspace, even if the dispute is subject to a dispute settlement process.",
    "## V. Substantive Requirement for Taking Countermeasures in Cyberspace: The Principle of Proportionality Countermeasures taken by the injured State must comply with the principle of proportionality. If the countermeasures exceed the reasonable boundary set by the proportionality test, they will be punitive and retaliatory in nature and will no longer be legitimate under international law but rather an internationally wrongful act.^[76]^ Article 51 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States provides that countermeasures must be commensurate with the injury suffered. Under the proportionality test, countermeasures are assessed against the injuries suffered, not only in purely “quantitative” terms but also “qualitative” factors. This proportionality is equally applicable to countermeasures in cyberspace, which was clearly confirmed in the report published by the UNGGE in 2015.^[77]^ ^[73]^ *Id.*, at 235.": "^[74]^ *Id.*, at 236.\n^[75]^ Trojans can have multiple variants as they spread.

Cases Applying the Principle of Proportionality Assessing the proportionality of a countermeasure is not only controversial but also challenging. The principle of proportionality is concerned with the intensity of countermeasures, aiming to establish a benchmark for countermeasures and restrict them within a reasonable limit. Such test essentially is matter of degree and the outcome of applying the principle of proportionality is unpredictable. The International Law Commission points out explicitly that what is proportionate is not a matter which can be determined precisely and can at best be accomplished by approximation. The Draft Articles on Responsibility of States does not set out any specific rules on the application of the proportionality test, but only provide the factors to be considered: (1) the extent of the injury suffered; (2) the gravity of the internationally wrongful act; (3) the rights of the injured and responsible State (and interests of other States) that are affected; and (4) the necessity of inducing the responsible State to fulfill its obligations. This exercise involves value judgment and balancing of interests, thus subjective in nature. Moreover, the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States does not articulate the hierarchy of these factors elements. Therefore, there is still no clear guidance on the application of the principle of proportionality, lacking much-needed predictability and certainty.\nThere are very few cases concerning the proportionality of countermeasures in current international law, among which the only successful one is the Air Service Agreement arbitration case in 1978. In 1946, France and the USA signed a bilateral agreement to open international air routes between the two States. Disputes arose between the two countries when France refused to allow a change of gauge in London by American flights. As a countermeasure, the USA planned to suspend some flights from Paris to the U.S. In its award, the arbitral tribunal did not make a quantitative analysis of the damage caused by the French wrongful act and the impact of the American countermeasure, but rather a qualitative analysis of the impact of the French illegal act. The key factor considered by the Tribunal was the importance of legal principles involved to the USA, and especially its impact on American aviation policy. Since the 1970s, the USA has pursued the policy of aviation liberalization and concluded a number of air transport agreements with other States, promoting the opening of international air transport market. The French act restricted the freedom of air transportation, which was incompatible with American aviation policy. In addition, bilateral treaties signed by the USA with other States also contained similar provisions on change of gauge. The French act would affect the interpretation and application of these provisions, which may have significant adverse impact on America. Therefore, the arbitral tribunal concluded that the U.S. countermeasure did not obviously violate the principle of proportionality. In this case, the key The Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law factors considered by the tribunal, i.e., the importance of the aviation policy and the potential impact of the damage, involves qualitative evaluation which is a general approximation rather than an accurate quantitative measurement.\nAnother one is the Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project case in 1997 in which the principle of proportionality was applied and a negative conclusion was made.⁸⁵ In this case, Hungary and Slovakia signed an agreement to jointly build a dam on the Danube in 1977. During the implementation of the agreement, Hungary unilaterally terminated the construction of the dam. As a countermeasure, Slovakia diverted the Danube in its territory to intercept water resources.⁸⁶ Different from the Air Service Agreement case, the ICJ combined quantitative and qualitative analysis in this case. First, from a qualitative perspective, the Court pointed out that the countermeasure had affected Hungary's important rights to equitable and reasonable share of natural resources of the Danube, including both navigational and non-navigational use. Second, the Court analyzed the intensity of the countermeasure taken by Slovakia. It held that Slovakia had unilaterally diversified and controlled 80% to 90% of water resources of the Danube. Measures with such magnitude will have a significant impact on the ecosystem of the Danube basin, clearly exceeding the reasonable limit, and thus inconsistent with the principle of proportionality.⁸⁷ In this case, the Danube is an important international river. The sheer volume of water being diversified, 80% to 90%, was a prima facie indication that the measure was probably out of proportionality. Thus it is a relatively easy case to adjudicate. However, if the amount of water resources affected by the countermeasure was in the range of 10% to 50%, the issue of proportionality would be in the grey area.",
    "## 2. The Benchmark for the Proportionality test The benchmark for the proportionality test is also a controversial issue. The Draft Articles on Responsibility of States set injury as the benchmark for evaluating proportionality, allowing the injured State to retaliate against the injuring State with an equivalent damage, and thus forcing the injuring State to cease the infringement. This is not fundamentally different from the private retaliation of\"an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.\"It may lead to countermeasure going beyond what is strictly necessary for its very purpose and become punitive in nature. Therefore, there are inherent contradictions in the regime on countermeasures as set out by the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States.⁸⁸ This benchmark works well only among States with comparable strength. On the other hand, if there is a significant gap in strength between the countries involved, ⁸⁵ See the Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project (Hungary/Slovakia), Judgment, ICJ Reports 1997.": "⁸⁶ In the judgment, the ICJ adopted a two-step approach. First, the Court found that Hungary violated the treaty concluded by both parties, which constituted an internationally wrongful act. Secondly, the Court discussed whether Slovakia's acts constituted countermeasures, one of the most important factor of which was the principle of proportionality. *Id.*, at para. 82.\n⁸⁷ *Id.*, at paras. 85–86.\n⁸⁸ See Nigel White &amp; Ademola Abass, *Countermeasures and Sanctions*, in Malcolm Evans ed., International Law, at 513 (Cambridge University Press 2018).\nWuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers countermeasure as under the current proportionality test may be abused by those powerful States as an excuse to bully the weak ones.\nIn recent years, some scholars proposed a functional approach towards the proportionality test, arguing that the purpose to be achieved d by countermeasures shall be used as the benchmark. Countermeasures are instrumental, and their purposes are to force the injuring State to cease its wrongful act and to comply with its international obligations, so that the relations between the two States can be restored. Therefore, the proportionality of countermeasures should be assessed against its purpose, irrespective of whether they exceed the intensity of the wrongful act.⁸⁹ In April 2007, Estonia suffered a three-week-long DDoS cyberattack and a large number of critical infrastructure websites, including those of government agencies, were forced to shut down, resulting in network paralysis and service disruption with severe damage.⁹⁰ If the cyberattack could be attributed to Russia, Estonia could respond with DDoS countermeasures. In terms of the intensity, Estonia may not achieve its purpose if the countermeasures were of equivalent magnitude as that of the cyberattack because Russia's size and strength are far greater than Estonia's. Achieving the purpose of inducing Russia to cease its internationally wrongful act would likely require countermeasures that far exceed the damage caused by Russia's wrongful act. Therefore, taking the purpose of countermeasures as the benchmark is more in line with their very aim. Meanwhile, such approach taking into consideration the differences in strength of nations, prevents the abuse by stronger State, thus more fair and equitable.\nTherefore, the principle of proportionality lacks clear rules and is full of uncertainties. Its application in cyberspace is even more challenging.⁹¹ This is because cyberspace is interconnected and cyberattacks are dynamic and constantly changing, making it difficult and time-consuming to assess the damage caused. The injured State shall be extremely cautious when evaluating the proportionality of the countermeasures. This will not preclude the possibility for taking countermeasures in response to cyberattacks. A practical approach is to adopt cyber measures as an effective response to cyberattacks,⁹² because this type of countermeasures is of the same nature as the wrongful act and is more likely to be regarded as consistent with the principle of proportionality.⁹³ ⁸⁹ See Enzo Cannizzaro, *The Role of Proportionality in the Law of International Countermeasure*, 12 European Journal of International Law 889 (2001).\n⁹⁰ See Ma Chunmao, *A Review of Estonia’s Cyber Warfare*, at https://tech.sina.com.cn/i/2009-02-04/08172791102.shtml (last visited June 3, 2019).\n⁹¹ See Nicholas Tsagourias, *The Law Applicable to Countermeasures against Low Intensity Cyber Operations*, 14 Baltic Yearbook of International Law Online 105 (2015).\n⁹² Proportionality does not mean reciprocity. The obligation breached by countermeasures does not necessarily need to be same as the obligation breached by the responsible State, nor does the nature and means of the countermeasure.\n⁹³ See Paragraph 5 of the commentary to the introductory part of Chapter II in Part Three of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States.\nThe Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law Traditionally cyberattacks are dealt with through a passive defense system, consisting of a firewall, intrusion detection and prevention mechanism with antivirus software as the commonly deployed technology. Under such system, only after it is attacked will the antivirus software be able to obtain the vital information and code of the virus and update its database. So that the same viruses can be detected and removed next time they appear. The inherent deficiency is that only after the virus attacks can loopholes in the system be identified and fixed. Thus the antivirus software is always behind the virus and even the most sophisticated firewall may be breached. As a result, passive defense cannot does not offer satisfactory solution to network security. Modern network security is increasingly rely on active defense through early detection of cyberattacks and deception techniques to contain and constrain the attacks. For example, sandbox and honeypot are commonly used technical methods, which in fact deliberately expose some vulnerabilities for attackers and then to obtain critical information of the attackers when they intrude the system. These techniques offers protection to the system and buys time for the injured State to examine the cyberattack and to develop appropriate countermeasures.[94] Such means do not compromise or damage the attacker's network facilities or computer systems, thus consistent with the principle of proportionality.\nMore extreme active defenses measures are even aggressive in nature, i.e., hacking back. Such technics involve hacking into the attacker's computer system, erasing the stolen data, or even planting ransomware. This type of defense involves cyber measures thus similar to cyberattacks in nature. However, this does not necessarily mean such measures fulfill the proportionality test because equivalence in nature is only one of the factors considered in the evaluation of proportionality. In practice, it is still necessary to consider other factors of the proportionality test and keeping cyber countermeasures within the reasonable limits allowed by international law.\nIn summary, the application of the principle proportionality is controversial and challenging. The Draft Articles on Responsibility of States fails to provide clear guidance, but only lists the factors to be considered. Furthermore, the benchmark against which proportionality is assessed against is not without controversy. Considerable uncertainties remain with regard to the application of countermeasures in cyberspace. A practical and effective approach is to adopt cyber countermeasures in response to cyberattacks and ensure the impact of such measures are within a reasonable limit.",
    "# VI. Conclusion The fundamental aim of international law on the countermeasure is to limit it to a reasonable extent and prevent such measures being abused leading to the escalation of disputes. However, the boundaries of countermeasures permitted by international law remains unsettled. During the [94] If the attacker took advantage of the vulnerabilities of the honeypot to launch a cyberattack against a third country, the State that set up the honeypot may be found violating its due diligence obligations.": "Wuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers drafting process of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States, every rule on countermeasures had been a matter of controversy. Major differences among States on this issue were also highlighted at the 2017 Session of the UNGGE, where disagreements led to the absence of a consensus report and the breakdown of negotiations. The function and mission of the UNGGE is not to create or modify the rules of international law in cyberspace, but to discuss how international law is applied. Thus despite the failure of the negotiation process of the UNGGE, international law, including rules on countermeasures, is still applicable to cyberspace. This basic position has been confirmed by the International Group of Experts in its 2015 report.\nCompared with the traditional physical space of State sovereignty, cyberspace as a relatively new domain has its own unique features, creating new issues to the application of countermeasures. Current international law on the countermeasure as articulated in the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States, imposing stringent conditions to prevent its abuse, are ill-equipped to deal with cyberattacks. It adopts the basic position that countermeasure is illegal per se, to discourage its usage in practice. The prerequisites for taking countermeasures is the existence of internationally wrongful acts; in cyberspace the attribution of cyberattacks to States is challenging. In addition, the procedural requirements for taking countermeasure are impractical in cyberspace and the proportionality test is highly subjective and unpredictable. These facts have greatly diminished the effectiveness and certainty of the application of countermeasures in cyberspace. This is one of the major reason why there are few cases where state invoked countermeasures. Therefore, current international law does not offer clear rules and guidance on how to apply countermeasures in cyberspace. The international law regime on this issue is still at the early stage of development and is still evolving.\n(Translators: Meng Chao &amp; Wang Yi)"

Attribution of cyberattacks to the state is difficult. Though the doctrine of due diligence has the potential to addresses this problem by lowering the threshold of attribution, it may unduly expand the scope of State responsibility. In addition, the procedural requirements for takings countermeasures are impractical in cyberspace. The substantive requirement of proportionality is of fundamental importance, but lacks clear and workable benchmark. Therefore, application of countermeasures in cyberspace is fraught with uncertainties and international law on this issue remains unsettled.\nKeywords: cyberattack; countermeasures; attribution; principle of proportionality; due diligence\n# I. Introduction\nIn recent years, cyberattacks have become more frequent. How to respond to cyberattacks and maintain cyber security has become an issue with significant strategic and practical implications that needs to be addressed urgently in the international community. Under international law, the injured State enjoys the right of self-defense against internationally wrongful acts that have reached the level of armed attack. However, in practice, most cyberattacks do not reach the required threshold of use of force, letting alone an armed attack. Taking the 2010 “Stuxnet” Incident for example, the prevailing view was that the cyberattacks did not constitute an armed attack in international law, notwithstanding that the virus had led to the damage of thousands of Iranian uranium enrichment centrifuges. Therefore, in most cases, a State is not able to exercise its right to self-defense against a cyberattack.\n* ZHU Lei (朱磊), Ph.D. in Law, associate professor at the Wuhan University Institute of International Law in China.\n Armed attacks are the most serious type of use of force, according to the International Court of Justice’s opinion in the Nicaragua case. See Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), Judgement, ICJ Reports 1986, para.191.\n See Michael N. Schmitt ed., Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations, at 538–531 (2nd edition, Cambridge University Press 2017). The book propose eight factors for assessing whether a cyberattack constitutes the use of force, including, severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability of effects, military character, state involvement and presumptive legality.\n See Robin Geiss &amp; Henning Lahmann, Freedom and Security in Cyberspace: Shifting the Focus Away from Military Responses towards Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention, in Katharina Ziolkowski ed., Peacetime Regime for State Activities in Cyberspace: International Law, International Relations and Diplomacy, at 628 (NATO CCDCOE Publication 2013).\nWuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers\nIn response to these cyberattacks which do not rise to the level of an armed attack, States tend to respond in a non-forceful and peaceful manner in practice. For example, in January 2015, the United States (\"USA\") imposed economic sanctions on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea as a response to the cyberattack on Sony Pictures Entertainment. In response to the allegation that Russia had interfered in the United States' General Election through cyberattacks, the USA announced the expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats in December 2016.\nCyberspace is considered as the new frontier of national sovereignty and international law is applicable in this area. The legal nature and status of the actions taken by the injured State in response to cyberattacks under international law is an issue that deserves serious consideration, in which the central issue involved is that of countermeasures. Similar to the right of self-defense, it allows a State to take its own measures of private remedies against an internationally wrongful act. Where certain conditions are met, it can preclude the wrongfulness of those measures and thereby relieve the responsibility of the State.\nThe countermeasure as a customary international law with a long history is controversial in international law. Its application to cyberspace is even more challenging because as an emerging field of science and technology, cyberspace has characteristics different from those areas of traditional State sovereignty. This paper analyzes how countermeasures in international law are applied to cyberspace in light of the characteristics of cyberspace, and examines the main issues and controversies in the application of countermeasures to cyberspace.\n## II. The Historical Development and Inherent Contradictories of Countermeasures\n## 1. Historical Development of Countermeasures\nThe term \"countermeasure\" was first used by the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office of the United Kingdom in 1916 in its correspondences with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Sweden. And the first detailed discussion on countermeasures was in the *Air Services Agreement* arbitration case in 1978. In this case, the USA made its claim based on countermeasures, which\n See Zhuang Xiaodan, *Revenge for Sony Pictures? US Launches New Round of Sanctions against North Korea*, at https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_1290937 (last visited June 3, 2023).\n See Lu Jiafei &amp; Xu Jianmei, *U.S. Announces Sanctions against Russia for Alleged Cyberattacks to Interfere in U.S. Election*, at https://world.huanqiu.com/article/9CaKrnJZtjV (last visited June 3, 2019).\n UN Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (\"UNGGE\"), the main platform and mechanism for official intergovernmental dialogue on international law in cyberspace, acknowledged in its 2013 report that international law applies in cyberspace. See UN, A/68/98.\n See Omer Yousif Elagab, *The Place of Non-Forcible Counter-Measures in Contemporary International Law*, in Guy S. Goodwin-Gill &amp; Stefan Talmon eds., *The Reality of International Law: Essays in Honour of Ian Brownlie*, at 125 (Oxford University Press 1999).\n See the *Air Service Agreement* of 27 March 1946 between the United States of America and France (1978) 18 RIAA 417.\nThe Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law\nwas upheld by the Arbitral Tribunal. The term was widely used after the Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (“Draft Articles on Responsibility of States”), adopted by the International Law Commission of the United Nations (“UNILC”) in 2001, which used the term and contained detailed rules on countermeasures in seven articles.\nThe historical root of countermeasures is found in the traditional international law concept of reprisals, which is essentially a mechanism of private remedy. The concept of “countermeasures” is used as a synonym for “reprisals” and inherits the key elements of the latter. The institution of reprisals in international law has a long history and its development can be divided into three stages.\nThe first stage was a completely liberal private reprisal, which was common in the early stage of the development of the rule of law, during which the State apparatus was not yet in place and public enforcement mechanisms for the law were missing. Where the rights of individuals were violated without remedy from public power, they could take it upon themselves to enforce the law and take reprisals as a means of obtaining the relief. In ancient Greece, the customary law of seizing foreigners existed in the city-states of Athens. Where a citizen of a city-state was killed by a foreigner or the government, the relatives of the victim enjoyed the right to capture and detain three citizens of that foreign state as hostages and demand that the perpetrator be presented or compensated. Where the claim was not met, the victim’s relatives would enjoy the right to kill the hostages to pay back the blood debt.\nThe second stage was the reprisal authorized by the State, essentially to incorporate reprisal into the framework of State regulation. The letter of reprisal offers a good example. It has its roots in Roman law. In ancient Rome, public authorities became involved in the system of reprisals and regulated it strictly. If the rights of a Roman citizen (especially a merchant) were violated by an alien, the victim could seize the citizen of that State to retaliate with procedural and substantive restrictions. Before the reprisal could be carried out, the victim must apply to the relevant State authority for a permit to do so. The precondition of obtaining the permit is that the victim had been treated unfairly by the courts of a foreign State and that his or her damages could not be compensated and his or her rights could not be remedied. The scope must be limited to the actual damage suffered by the victim and the seizure by force can be carried out only within the Roman territory or on international waters.\n Omer Yousif Elagab, supra note 7, at 125–126.\n The International Court of Justice referred to the term twice in 1980 in the United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran case, and several times in the Nicaragua case in 1986.\n See Malcolm N. Shaw, International Law 794 (Cambridge University Press 2008).\n See David J. Bederman, International Law in Antiquity, at 123 (Cambridge University Press 2007).\n Letter of reprisal is also known as letter of marquee.\n Its modern formulation can be found in the Constitution of the United States of America, which in Section 8 of Article 1 authorizes the Congress to grant letters of marque and reprisal.\n See Wilhelm G. Grewe, The Epochs of International Law, at 117 (De Gruyter 2000).\nWuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers\nDuring the medieval period, reprisals centered on the letter of marquee, whereby armed privateers, with government concession, may chase and destroy foreign lawbreakers and fleets, as well as attack and plunder enemy merchant ships. By the 16th Century, wartime plundering became quite widespread and many States began to legislate and regulate the granting of such letters. Hugo Grotius in his book (1604), *De Jure Praedae*, legally defended the act of Dutch ships attacking Portuguese and Spanish ships. He argued that the granting of permit was akin to declaring a “private war,” justified by the fact that the laws of each State had no effective jurisdiction over the seas and that merchant ships had to arm themselves in self-defense.^[16]^\nThe third stage was to prohibit the use of forcible reprisal. Traditional reprisal includes both forcible and non-forcible means, the majority of which is forcible. In the early 20th Century, the international community restricted the use of force through a series of conventions. Modern international law prohibits the use of force and the Charter of the United Nations explicitly prohibits the use of force and the threat of force. As a result, forcible reprisal eventually receded from the stage of history. Accordingly, the term “countermeasures,” also known as “non-forcible reprisal,” was adopted to conform to the development of modern international law, which corresponded to reprisals by non-forcible means. In this way, the term can distinguish itself from reprisals by force and avoid the negative connotations associated with the concept of reprisals in traditional international law.^[17]^\n## 2. The Inherent Contradictories of Countermeasures\nA review of the historical development reveals its inherent tensions and contradictories, which is also the core issue to be addressed in contemporary international law. On the one hand, the existence of countermeasures is justified. In the absence of adequate public enforcement mechanisms when the rule of law is weak, reprisal offers a workable and efficient private solution. In domestic law, with the development of the rule of law, private enforcement of the law was increasingly limited and ultimately superseded by public enforcement of the law. By contrast, international law is based on the principle of sovereign equality and the international community is an egalitarian society. International law has an inherent flaw in that it lacks a centralized enforcement mechanism with enforcement authority that overrides the State, resulting in inadequate supply of public remedies. Therefore, it is necessary to have countermeasures as a form of private national remedies.\nThe essence of countermeasures, on the other hand, is to leave law enforcement in private hands, which could be harmful and even dangerous. Without any constraints, reprisal is highly vulnerable to abuse, plunging the international law into law of the jungle. Though the medieval letter of marquee was under the State’s regulation, it was often no different than piracy in practice. Bartolus de Saxoferrato (1314-1357), a famous European medieval jurist, wrote in a work published in\n^[16] See Hugo Grotius, *Commentary on the Law of Prize and Booty*, at 62 (Liberty Fund 2012).\n^[17] See Mary Ellen O’Connell, *The Power and Purpose of International Law: Insights from the Theory and Practice of Enforcement*, at 233 (Oxford University Press 2011).\nThe Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law\n\nBut, how can the balance between the reasonableness and the harm of countermeasures be achieved? This is the most difficult and contentious issue in the modern international law regime on countermeasures, which is also evident in the drafting process of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States. Although the majority of States recognized the necessity of countermeasures, many expressed concerns about the harmfulness of countermeasures. Therefore, in order to prevent the abuse of countermeasures, the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States adopted the principle of “conditional lawfulness” for countermeasures and set strict requirements for their implementation, in an attempt to prevent such measures from becoming tools for strong States to oppress weak States. Only countermeasures that have met these conditions are lawful; otherwise, they would be considered as internationally wrongful acts.\nThe rules established in the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States are the authoritative expression of modern international law on countermeasures, but they are also highly contentious. The fundamental disagreement during the development of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States was over the legal status of countermeasures, especially whether they are lawful or unlawful in nature. Representatives of some States took a positive attitude towards countermeasures, proposing that countermeasures are lawful in themselves, which are the rights enjoyed by States in international law, and are unlawful only under certain exceptional circumstances. However, this view was not supported by the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States which regarded countermeasures as unlawful *per se*. Countermeasures are internationally wrongful act that are in breach of internationally law, with the possibility of excluding the international wrongfulness of the act under certain circumstances. Therefore, countermeasures involve a situation excluding the wrongfulness of the act and may be invoked a defense to the accusation of internationally wrongful act. This fundamental stance taken by the UNILC is to discourage rather than promote the use of countermeasures.\nIn summary, countermeasures are the private enforcement of the law and have certain negative consequences. The historical development of countermeasures is a process of introducing more restrictions on its use and to bring it under the regulation of the law. In the meanwhile, international community is egalitarian in nature, which provides the solid foundation for its existence as an accepted form of enforcement under customary international law. Setting clear requirements for their use, mitigating their harmfulness, and limiting their application within an acceptable boundary are the key purpose for modern international law regime on countermeasures.\n Wilhelm G. Grewe, *supra* note 15, at 117.\n This basic principle is also reflected in Tallinn Manual 2.0 on International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations. See Michael N. Schmitt, *supra* note 2, at 225.\nWuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers\n## III. Prerequisites for Taking Countermeasures in Cyberspace: Internationally Wrongful Acts in Cyberspace\n## 1. Temporal Limitation of Countermeasures\nThe existence of an internationally wrongful act is a prerequisite for taking countermeasures, which is the primary reason for the exclusion of its wrongfulness. Countermeasures are similar to self-defense in this regard, which are taken in response to a prior internationally wrongful act by another State. As a result, countermeasures should be considered as the “shield” for defense rather than the “spear” for offense. The absence of an effective enforcement mechanism in international law allows the injured State to suspend its international obligations only when the other State has violated the law in the first place. In other words, the essence of countermeasures is to counteract an internationally wrongful act with an illegal act, with the goal of forcing the injuring State to resume its international obligations and restore normal relations between the two nations. Therefore, countermeasures are a part of the enforcement mechanism of international law, through which the injured State are able to protect its own rights and interests, thus also a mechanism of remedy in international law.\nCountermeasures must be taken against an ongoing internationally wrongful act and are not preventive or prospective. Once the wrongful act ceases, the countermeasures must also be ceased. Thus, if a cyberattack has not yet occurred or has ended, the injured State shall not take countermeasures. This rule significantly limits the possibility of an injured State to take countermeasures in response to a cyber-related wrongful act, because unlike traditional internationally wrongful acts, most cyberattacks are sudden and short-lived, leaving only a relatively limited period of time for an injured State to respond and diminishing the possibility of taking countermeasures in response to a cyberattack.\nIt is worth noting that modern cyberattacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, often requiring a large investment of manpower and resources, and their complexity and destructive power may be no less than a small-scale war. Complex cyberattacks take a long time from planning to actual implementation involving multiple steps such as intelligence collection, vulnerability detection, intrusion and infiltration into the network, and virus implantation. They often require coordination and cooperation of a professional and technical team. The time span of cyberattacks provides the opportunities and possibilities for injured State to monitor and detect cyberattacks earlier.\n---\n See Denis Alland, *Countermeasures of General Interest*, 13 European Journal of International Law 1221 (2002).\n See Maurice Kamto, *The Time Factor in the Application of Countermeasures*, in James Crawford et al. eds., *The Law of International Responsibility*, at 1176 (Oxford University Press 2010).\n See Jiang Shibo, *Cyber Attacks and the Application of the Laws of War*, 16(2) Wuhan University International Law Review 43–70 (2014).\nThe Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law\nThe cyberattack on the Ukrainian power grid on 23 December 2015 offers a good illustration. The cyberattack began in the spring of 2014, when the attackers first spear-phished IT staff and system administrators, causing viruses to infect systems and opening backdoors for subsequent cyberattacks. Over the following months, the attackers conducted extensive network reconnaissance, exploration and mapping efforts and gained the ability to manage user accounts within the network and employee login credentials. The final step of the cyberattack consisted of a series of coordinated actions, including reconfiguring the uninterruptible power supply, disconnecting the circuit breaker to take the substation offline, and launching a denial-of-service attack on the customer call center.[23]\nIn order to deal with sophisticated cyberattacks, the injured State should develop and improve its capabilities of cyber-related technology, strengthen real-time supervision over cyberattacks, detect ongoing cyberattacks at an early stage, and fix vulnerabilities of the system and strengthen measures for cyber prevention and defense. If the cyberattack is still at such an early stage as the planning, vulnerability detection and intelligence gathering, the injured State should exercise restraint and should not take countermeasures; otherwise, it may cause miscalculation and lead to the escalation of disputes. Once a cyberattack enters the next stage of implementation, such as planting viruses and stealing account information, etc., it constitutes an internationally wrongful act in violation of international law, at which time the injured State may take countermeasures against the act without waiting for the final stage of the cyberattack to unfold.\n## 2. Attribution of Internationally Wrongful Acts\nUnder international law, countermeasures are measures taken by a state against another state, which carries two important implications. Although enterprises are frequently subject to cyberattacks,[24] the measures taken by enterprises in response to cyberattacks do not constitute the countermeasures under international law.[25] Second, the object of countermeasures must be the State rather than non-State actors. In reality, there are very few inter-State cyberattacks, and most of such attacks are initiated by private non-State actors (e.g., patriotic hackers and lone wolves).[26] The first issue to be addressed in determining whether there is an internationally wrongful act is the attribution of cyberattacks, i.e., whether privately committed acts can be attributed to the State and constitute acts of the State.[27] If a cyberattack committed by a non-State actor is not attributed to the State, it\n[23] See Kim Zetter, Inside the Cunning, Unprecedented Hack of Ukraine’s Power Grid, at https://www.wired.com/2016/03/inside-cunning-unprecedented-hack-ukraines-power-grid/ (last visited June 3, 2023).\n[24] The 2017 Annual Internet Security Report released by Tencent Security pointed out that up to 86% of companies worldwide had experienced at least one cyberattack in 2017. Tencent’s 2017 Annual Internet Security Report: Nearly 90% of Global Companies Suffered Cyber Attacks, at http://tech.chinadaily.com.cn/2018-01/31/content_35621606.htm (last visited June 3, 2019).\n[25] See Michael N. Schmitt, Below the Threshold Cyber Operations: The Counter-Measures Response Option and International Law, 54 Virginia Journal of International Law 697 (2014).\n[26] See Michael N. Schmitt, In Defense of Due Diligence in Cyberspace, 125 Yale Law Journal Forum 77 (2015).\n[27] See Tom Ruys, Sanctions, Retorsions and Countermeasures: Concepts and International Legal Framework, in Larissa van den Herik ed., Research Handbook on UN Sanctions and International Law, at 14 (Edward Elgar Publishing 2016).\nWuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers\nmay constitute a violation of domestic law, but not an internationally wrongful act in violation of international law, and the injured State cannot take countermeasures against such acts.\nAttribution is an extremely challenging issue in identifying State responsibility in cyberspace, involving three layers of attribution. First, from the technical perspective, unlike traditional physical domains such as sea, land and air, the cyberspace is a decentralized system. Cyberspace is open, pluralistic, interoperable, and anonymous, and attackers often use encryption technology to transmit information in packets to hide their identities and sources, making the investigation of the source of cyberattacks quite complex, costly and protracted.\nSecond, after locating the source of cyberattacks through technical means, the subject behind the cyberattacks also needs to be identified. Even if the IP address is traced to a State's cyber infrastructure, it may not meet the criteria of burden of proof for attribution because IP addresses can be spoofed. For example, in 2013, an organization impersonating its IP address as from the Ukrainian government conducted cyber operations against the NATO Cyber Cooperative Defense Center of Excellence, the Estonian Defense Forces, and the armed forces of other NATO countries. Clearly, the conduct could not be attributed to the Ukrainian government.\nFinally, it remains to determine whether the act committed by the attackers constitutes the act of a State, i.e., legal attribution. The key issue is whether cyberattacks committed by non-State actors can be attributed to the State and constitute internationally wrongful acts that entails State responsibility. The challenge is degree of connection required for attribution to the State the cyberattacks committed by non-State actors. Under Article 8 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States, the conduct of non-State actors acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of a State is attributable to that State. The International Court of Justice (\"ICJ\") established the doctrine of \"effective control\" in the Nicaragua case in 1987. In that case, the USA played a significant and decisive role in financing, organizing, training, supplying, and equipping the Nicaraguan Contras, but the ICJ found that the series of U.S. acts did not constitute \"effective control\" and thus could not meet the standard of attribution.\nThe doctrine of effective control requires the State play a direct and a leading role in the cyberattacks, not just a supporting one, setting a higher threshold for State responsibility for private conduct. For example, the USA believed that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea played a \"central role\" in the 2014 cyberattack on Sony Pictures, which rose to the level of effective control and imposed\n See Michael N. Schmitt, *Peacetime Cyber Responses and Wartime Cyber Operations under International Law: An Analytical Vade Mecum*, 8 Harvard National Security Journal 260 (2017).\n See Huang Zhixiong ed., *On Cyber Sovereignty—Jurisprudence, Policy and Practice*, at 39 (Social Sciences Academic Press 2017).\n See Michael N. Schmitt, *supra* note 2, at 203.\n *Supra* note 1, at para. 115.\nThe Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law\nsanctions against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. In contrast, Iranian hackers conducted DDoS cyberattacks against a number of U.S. financial institutions between 2011 and 2013. Although these hackers had ties to the Iranian government, such ties did not rise to the level of effective control and therefore the attacks could not be attributed to Iran and the USA could not take countermeasures against Iran accordingly.\nThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 on International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations (“Tallinn Manual 2.0”) adopts the ICJ’s standard of effective control. It gives the following illustrative example. A State plans and oversees an operation to use a software update to implant a new vulnerability in software widely used by another state in its governmental computers. The former State enters into a confidential contract with the company that produced the software to embed the vulnerability and directs the course of action. In such a case the State planned, directed, and supervised over a particular cyberattack and took a leading and direct role in the operation, which is fundamentally different from the ancillary role played by the US government in the Nicaragua case and thus the company’s conduct is attributable to the State.\nThe doctrine of effective control adopts a relatively stringent criterion of attribution, which makes it difficult for the injured State to prove, thus severely limiting the application of countermeasures. In practice, the injuring State may not directly organize the implementation of cyberattacks, but indirectly support cyberattacks as a way to avoid State responsibility. Moreover, cyberattacks are secretive and complex, and attackers often use technical means to hide the source of the attack, so it is not easy to obtain conclusive evidence to prove the extent of State involvement in such cyberattacks and the role played by the State. And such evidence is often located in the injuring State or even across the globe, which is difficult to obtain and even if obtained, the timing for taking countermeasures may has already elapsed. For example, Estonia was subjected to a DDoS attack in 2007 and investigation revealed that the source of the attack was computers from 178 countries, including Vietnam and the USA. The cyberattack lasted for three weeks, providing a valuable time for evidence collection and attribution. However, to date, there is still no conclusive evidence of to attribute the responsibility to Russia.\nIn summary, the rules on attribution in international law are established for traditional internationally wrongful acts and thus are difficult to apply to cyberspace. It has the effect of greatly limiting the possibility of taking countermeasures in cyberspace. Some scholars argued that the constraints of existing customary law should be lifted and States should be allowed to take countermeasures\n Zhuang Xiaodan, supra note 4.\n See BBC: US Indicts 7 Iranian Hackers for Breaching Multiple Financial Firms, at https://news.youth.cn/gj/201603/t20160325_7779822.htm (last visited June 3, 2019).\n See Michael N. Schmitt, supra note 2, at 209.\n See Article 53 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States.\n See Wang Shiying, Estonia’s Cybersecurity Policies and Practices and Its Role in the NATO Process, at http://www.sohu.com/a/138699619_257305 (last visited June 3, 2019).\nWuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers\nagainst non-State actors. It essentially treats non-State actors as the subject of responsibility in international law, thus a departure from the basic principle of international law, which may have disturbing and far-reaching impact on the existing international order.\n## 3. Due Diligence\nTo address the difficulty of attribution under the doctrine of effective control, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 introduces due diligence into cyberspace, proposing that a State must exercise due diligence in not allowing its territory, or territory or cyber infrastructure under its governmental control, to be used for cyber operations that affect the rights of, and produce serious adverse consequences for, other States. This lowers the criterion of attribution required by the doctrine of effective control and reduces the threshold of State responsibility for acts of private subjects, essentially as a type of vicarious liability. This is an important development and breakthrough compared to the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (Tallinn Manual 1.0).\nThe ICJ has affirmed the doctrine of due diligence in the Corfu Channel case, the Tehran Hostage case, and the Nicaragua case. For example, in the Corfu Channel case, although the mines were not laid by Albania, the area where the incident occurred was Albanian territorial waters and Albania should bear the regulatory responsibility for that area. Also, judging from the geographical location and expertise, Albania had the knowledge of the mines laid in the Corfu Channel, but failed to take relevant measures, and therefore should bear responsibility. The ICJ stated that every State has an obligation “not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States.”\nUnder the doctrine of due diligence, a State must take active measures to prevent, reduce or limit the occurrence of damage, which is essentially an obligation to prevent transnational damage. The infrastructure on which cyberspace is based is physical, located in a particular State, and falls within the sovereign jurisdiction of that State, and due diligence is equally applicable. This basic position was also adopted by the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Information Security (“UNGGE”) in its report issued in 2015. Therefore, if a State violates due diligence in\n See Gary Corn &amp; Eric Talbot Jensen, *The Use of Force and Cyber Countermeasures*, 32 Temple International &amp; Comparative Law Journal 127 (2018).\n See Michael N. Schmitt, *supra* note 2, at 128.\n See Huang Zhixiong, *The Attribution of Cyberattacks in International Law*, 5 Global Law Review 164 (2014).\n See Corfu Channel (United Kingdom v. Albania), Judgment, ICJ Reports 1949, at 22.\n See the United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran (United States v. Iran), Judgment, ICJ Report 1980, para. 63.\n *Supra* note 1, at para.157.\n *Supra* note 40, at para. 65.\n *Supra* note 40, at para. 67.\n See UN, A/70/174.\nThe Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law\ncyberspace, it constitutes an internationally wrongful act and the injured State is entitled to take countermeasures.\nThe most controversial issue in practice is the scope of the obligation assumed by a State under the doctrine of due diligence. On this issue, two extreme positions should be avoided. If a liberal approach is adopted, i.e., a State assumes little or even no obligation, this will lead to the abuse of the principle of sovereignty, allowing the use of network facilities to infringe upon the interests of other States.\nOn the other hand, an expanded interpretation would broaden the scope of due diligence, constitute an unreasonable restriction on State sovereignty, which lacks a basis in international law. In this regard, the view of U.S. military judge Matthew J. Sklerov is quite representative. He advocated that strict criminal legislation and law enforcement could effectively prevent cyberattacks, and argued that the State's obligation in cyberspace includes passing stringent criminal laws, conducting vigorous investigations, prosecuting attackers, and, during the investigation and prosecution, cooperating with the victim state of cyberattacks that originated from within their borders. According to this view, knowledge of the occurrence of the damage is also not a requirement for the assumption of due diligence. In other words, the State has the obligation to take active criminal action to prevent and stop illegal cyberattacks, and the State's negligence or omission in any respect constitutes tacit approval and sheltering of such attacks and constitutes a violation of due diligence.\nIn practice, however, cyberattacks are often deceptive and disguised, and attackers may use the network infrastructure of other States to carry out remote attacks. Matthew J. Sklerov's view underestimated the complexity of cyberattacks in practice, which may lead to a misjudgment on state responsibility of cyberattacks. The USA, with its significant political, economic, and military position in the world, is often the target of cyberattacks, but it is difficult to hold the relevant States responsible in practice due to the problem of attribution. This view which expands the scope of due diligence attempts to lift the constraints and limitations under traditional rules of international law and to lower the threshold of State responsibility, thus enabling the USA to take countermeasures against other States more easily. Such practice should come under close scrutiny.\nThe appropriate approach on this issue is to return to the current framework of international law under which a State assumes due diligence responsibility only to the extent of knowledge on the occurrence of damage. This basic principle was also endorsed in the report of the UNGGE issued in 2015, and is a commonly held position by States. Under this doctrine, knowledge may be actual\n See Matthew J. Sklerov, Solving the Dilemma of State Responses to Cyberattacks: A Justification for the Use of Active Defenses against States Who Neglect Their Duty to Prevent, 201 Military Law Review 71 (2009).\n Id., at 62.\n Id., at 71.\n Id.\n Supra note 40, at para.18.\nWuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers\nor constructive. A State may be found to have actual knowledge of a cyberattack if it has detected or has been notified by the injured State of an attack originating from that country.^[51]^ The essence of constructive knowledge is the reverse of the burden of proof. The challenge of attribution in cyberspace is evidence, and in the case of constructive knowledge the burden of proof is shifted to the territorial State where the cyberattack originated which have more evidence than the victim state. Therefore it is presumed to have knowledge of the cyberattack with the possibility of rebuttal.^[52]^\nWith the sheer number of Internet users and the technology to hide their identities and even erase traces of Internet access, it is almost impossible to achieve complete and comprehensive regulation in cyberspace. But this does not mean that the State is unaware of cyber operations within its borders. Whether a State is aware of cyberattacks is closely related to its technical capacities and the regulatory policy it adopts in cyberspace.\nCyberspace is highly complex and technical in nature, and cyber regulation relies on the relevant cyber technical capacities which many developing countries may lack. This is an important factor that must be taken into account when assessing knowledge. Otherwise, it may unduly expand the scope of due diligence obligations. On the other hand, every State regulates cyber activities within its territory to some extent, and an absolutely free cyberspace does not exist. Title V of the Convention on Cybercrime explicitly requires contracting parties to collect and record computer data in real time, which does not only include traffic data, but also content data.\nCyber supervision and regulation is common practice among states, and the difference lies in the degree of its stringency. If a State has strict supervision over cyberspace, it is more likely to know that a cyberattack has occurred, and it can even constitute \"constructive knowledge.\" For example, in May 2013, the U.S. energy security was significantly threatened by a cyberattack on the critical control systems of energy companies and attackers were even able to manipulate the oil and gas pipelines. The U.S. officials said that although there was no conclusive evidence that the cyberattack was supported by the Iranian government, it was unlikely that the Iranian government was unaware of the attack because the Iranian government had centralized control over the cyberspace.^[53]^ This offers a good example of the how the constructive knowledge may be applied in practice.\nIn summary, the precondition for taking countermeasures is the existence of an internationally wrongful act. What is challenging in cyberspace is how to attribute cyberattacks committed by non-State actors to the State. Under the traditional doctrine of effective control, the threshold for attribution is high and difficult to reach in cyberspace. While the doctrine of due diligence may\n^[51]^ See Wolff Heintschel von Heinegg, *Legal Implications of Territorial Sovereignty in Cyberspace*, in Christian Czosseck *et al.* eds., 2012 4th International Conference on Cyber Conflict (NATO CCDCOE Publications, Tallin, 2012).\n^[52]^ For example, if a government-dedicated network infrastructure is used to carry out a cyberattack, there is a presumption that the government of that State had knowledge of the cyberattack because the network was under the full control and supervision of the government.\n^[53]^ See N. Perlroth &amp; D. Sanger, *New Computer Attacks Traced to Iran*, Officials Say, The New York Times (May 24, 2013).\nThe Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law\nstep in to solve this problem, the danger is that the scope of due diligence may be overly broad. A balanced approach is that State responsibility only limited cyberattacks to which the State has knowledge of.\n## IV. Procedural Requirements for Taking Countermeasures in Cyberspace\n## 1. The Instrumentality of Countermeasures\nIn the application of countermeasures, the determination of an internationally wrongful act is unilateral in nature. The injured State makes its own judgment as to the existence of the internationally wrongful act and the gravity of the damage caused by such act, and makes its own decision as to whether or not and what countermeasures to take.^[54]^ For example, when the Sony Pictures Entertainment suffered a cyberattack in 2014, the U.S. Government, based on the information available to its intelligence community, believed that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea played a central role in the cyberattack, which constituted a State act. It then imposed economic sanctions on three Korean government agencies and officials.^[55]^ In this process, the US State had three roles to play, i.e., as the victim state of a cyberattack, the adjudicator of an internationally wrongful act, and implementer of countermeasures. This leads to an obvious conflict of interest and is prone to exaggerated assessment of the severity of the damage and the necessity of countermeasures, resulting in the escalation of disputes.^[56]^\nThe determination of an internationally wrongful act is a complex process of fact finding and application of law, which is not an easy task. There is no third-party body in the existing international law system to make an objective and neutral determination on the existence of an internationally wrongful act. In other words, countermeasures are taken on the basis of a one-sided claim of injured State and there is a possibility of abuse in practice. Some States may fabricate the existence of an internationally wrongful act and accuse another State of committing such act. Countermeasures may be used as a justification for the State to take measures such as sanctions, thus becoming a tool for strong countries to bully the weak. This is the greatest danger in the application of countermeasures in cyberspace, a cause for concern for developing countries in particular. Therefore, at the 2017 session of the UNGGE, developing countries, represented by Cuba, opposed the application of the right to self-defense and countermeasures to cyberspace.^[57]^\n^[54]^ Mary Ellen O’Connell, *supra* note 17, at 230.\n^[55]^ See Li Liangyong, *U.S. Sanctions North Korea over Sony “Hack,” No Response from North Korea*, at http://www.xinhuanet.com/world/2015-01/04/c_127354664.htm (last visited June 3, 2023).\n^[56]^ See N. Jansen Calamita, *Sanctions, Countermeasures, and the Iranian Nuclear Issue*, 42 Vanderbilt Journal of Transnational Law 1420 (2009).\n^[57]^ See Anders Henriksen, *The End of the Road for the UNGGE Process: The Future Regulation of Cyberspace*, 5 Journal of Cybersecurity 1 (2019).\nWuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers\nIn order to prevent countermeasures from being abused and leading to the escalation of disputes, and to ensure that they are taken only when they are necessary to achieve their purpose, Article 52 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States set out a series of stringent procedural requirements for countermeasures. Countermeasures, which are instrumental in nature, are intended to induce the responsible State to cease its violations, to comply with and fulfill its international obligations again and to restore lawful relations between the two States. But, countermeasures are not the only way to achieve such end. The fundamental principle of peaceful settlement of international disputes is well established in modern international law[68] and Article 33 of the UN Charter provides a list of pacific methods,[59] which shall be given priority in international dispute settlement. In contrast, countermeasures are exceptional in nature[60] and shall be taken only as the last resort. The injured State should first seek to resolve the disputes through the usual dispute settlement methods contained in Article 33 of the UN Charter, rather than through countermeasures.\nThe victim State shall invoke State responsibility against the injuring State in the first instance. Countermeasures shall not be taken if the injuring State has ceased the wrongful act and undertaken to pay compensation. Second, the injured State should also comply with its obligation to notify in advance and to seek a negotiated settlement of the dispute; this is the second procedural requirement for the taking of countermeasures.[61] In this process, the case of state responsibility is presented to the injuring State and to put some pressure on it to cooperate, thus giving the injuring State a second chance.[62] Finally, an injured State may not take countermeasures when a dispute has already been submitted to a dispute settlement mechanism.\nThese procedural requirements for countermeasures apply equally in the cyberspace. In particular, the last two procedural requirements are controversial which triggered intense debate in the course of formulating the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States. Their application in cyberspace is even more challenging, which will be discussed below.\n## 2. Notification and Seeking to Settle Disputes through Negotiations\nIn order to prevent escalation of a dispute, the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States provides that the injured State should notify the responsible State of any decision to take countermeasures\nThe Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law\nand offer to negotiate with that State. In practice, notification and negotiation are not two separate steps. The purpose of notification is to give the injuring State an opportunity to respond. If the injuring State does so, it constitutes the start of negotiations between the Parties. In cyberspace, notification is necessary because cyberattacks are often covert. Notification gives the responsible State an opportunity for clarification and prevents misjudgment and the escalation of disputes.\nHowever, the obligation to notify as a procedural requirement in cyberspace faces a number of challenges. First, it is not supported by current state practice. When a State take measures to respond to an internationally wrongful act, usually it does not invoke countermeasure as a justification. Even the issue is subject to a dispute settlement procedure, the victim State usually argues that its act complies with international law in the first instance. Countermeasures come into play only when the act is found to be internationally wrongful, i.e., as a defense and exemption from state responsibility. Therefore, although there are a large number of cases in which countermeasures have been taken to respond to internationally wrongful acts, the number of cases in which countermeasures are invoked are very limited in practice. For example, the U.S. Government expelled Russian diplomatic officials in response to alleged Russia’s interference with the U.S. general election through cyberattacks in 2016, but it did not explicitly mention countermeasure as its legal basis.\nSecond, obligation to notify in cyberspace may be impractical. This is because the tracing the source of cyberattacks is complex and challenging. In practice, it is often difficult to identify who the attacker is and where it is originated, rendering notification being impossible. Furthermore, prior notification is likely to diminish the effectiveness of countermeasures in cyberspace. This is particularly the case if countermeasures are taken through cyber means. Once the injuring State becomes aware of the countermeasures, the cyber tools can be captured and reused. Moreover, an injuring State, having been notified of countermeasures, may temporarily suspend cyberattacks as a means of avoiding such measures, because countermeasures shall cease as well in such situation. Therefore, prior notification may render countermeasures meaningless and ineffective.\nThe obligation to notify is not absolute and the injured State may take such urgent countermeasures as necessary. This is also recognized by The Tallinn Manual 2.0 which points out that urgent\n A small number of experts argued that negotiation is also one of the prior procedural requirement for taking countermeasures. The majority of experts did not agree and were in the opinion that this may be an excuse for the responsible State to stall for time. See Michael N. Schmitt, supra note 2, at 152.\n Mary Ellen O’Connell, supra note 17, at 259.\n For example, in the Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project case, Slovakia did not claim that its actions constitute countermeasures, instead revoked other grounds as justification. The application of countermeasures arose only after its claims had not been upheld and its actions were found internationally wrongful. See the Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project (Hungary/Slovakia), Judgment, ICJ Reports 1997, para. 82.\n Lu Jiafei &amp; Xu Jianmei, supra note 5.\n Gary Corn &amp; Eric Talbot Jensen, supra note 37.\n See Article 52 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States.\nWuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers\ncountermeasures are highly likely in cyberspace. Cyberattacks are often both unpredictable and can spread rapidly over a short period of time, even capable of significantly impairing critical infrastructure. Thus any delay in time may cause unknown and even irreparable damage. In such circumstances, the victim State may take urgent countermeasures without prior notification to the injuring State. For example, a State is being attacked by a serious internationally wrongful cyber operation. The injured State intends to respond by blocking all electronic access to the bank accounts of the responsible State. If the responsible State is notified of that intention, it will have the opportunity to transfer the assets out of the country, effectively depriving the injured State of the possibility of taking such countermeasure. Therefore, urgent countermeasure is of significant practical implications as they may be used more widely in cyberspace.\n## 3. Dispute Settlement Mechanisms\nInternational laws provide for dispute settlement mechanisms capable of rendering a binding decision on a dispute, thus offering relief to the injured State. This would undermine the very underlying reason that justify countermeasure, i.e., international law lacks a centralized enforcement mechanism. In addition, such mechanisms may reach a final resolution of the disputes between the states. By contrast, countermeasures are temporary in nature and cannot solve the dispute definitively, and the dispute may eventually be submitted to dispute settlement procedures. Thus the countermeasure is a less favored means of dispute resolution.\nThe relationship between countermeasures and dispute settlement mechanisms was one of the most controversial issues in the formulation of Draft Articles on Responsibility of States. The special rapporteur, Gaetano Arangio Ruiz, advocated the idea that the injured State is obliged to submit the dispute to the dispute settlement procedure before resorting to countermeasures, which is also reflected in the text he drafted. However, this view was not supported by States. The final text provides, in Article 52(3), that Countermeasures may not be taken, and if already taken must be suspended without undue delay if the dispute is pending before a court or tribunal which has the authority to make decisions binding on the parties.\nIn the process of formulating the Tallinn Manual 2.0, the majority of the International Group of Experts adopted the position of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States. However, the application of the rule was not without controversy. Members of the International Group of Experts were divided on whether or not such obligation is absolute. Some experts held the opinion that such\n See Katharine C. Hinkle, Countermeasures in the Cyber Context: One More Thing to Worry about, 37 Yale Journal of International Law Online 11 (2011).\n See Michael N. Schmitt, supra note 2, at 234–235.\n Mary Ellen O’Connell, supra note 17, at 258.\n The phrase “court or tribunal” refers to any third-party dispute settlement procedure, whatever its designation. The court or tribunal must have the power to order interim measures that are capable of protecting the purportedly injured State. See Michael N. Schmitt, supra note 2, at 235.\nThe Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law\na dispute settlement mechanism is mandatory if it is explicitly required by international law. On the other hand, a minority of the experts argued that, rather than creating an absolute obligation, a case-by-case analysis should be undertaken to evaluate whether a third-party dispute settlement body had sufficient capacities to protect the rights of the injured State thus providing an effective alternative to countermeasures.^[73]^\nIt is submitted that dispute settlement mechanisms do not exclude countermeasures and resort to dispute settlement procedure is not a prerequisite procedural requirement for the taking of countermeasures. Under current international law, dispute settlement mechanisms are not substitute for countermeasures and provisional and urgent countermeasures are allowed even after a dispute has been submitted to a mandatory dispute settlement mechanism.^[74]^ This is particularly the case in cyberspace. Damage caused by cyberattacks could spread rapidly in a short period of time, sometimes even beyond the control of the attackers, which traditional dispute settlement mechanisms of international law may be ill-equipped to address.^[75]^ Therefore, countermeasures may be excluded only if treaties between the states involved contain technical defensive measures that are effective in induce the responsible State to comply with its international obligations and to prevent further damage, thus able to provide the victim State appropriate mechanism for remedy. Otherwise, the taking of countermeasures should not be precluded in cyberspace, even if the dispute is subject to a dispute settlement process.\n## V. Substantive Requirement for Taking Countermeasures in Cyberspace: The Principle of Proportionality\nCountermeasures taken by the injured State must comply with the principle of proportionality. If the countermeasures exceed the reasonable boundary set by the proportionality test, they will be punitive and retaliatory in nature and will no longer be legitimate under international law but rather an internationally wrongful act.^[76]^ Article 51 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States provides that countermeasures must be commensurate with the injury suffered. Under the proportionality test, countermeasures are assessed against the injuries suffered, not only in purely “quantitative” terms but also “qualitative” factors. This proportionality is equally applicable to countermeasures in cyberspace, which was clearly confirmed in the report published by the UNGGE in 2015.^[77]^\n^[73]^ *Id.*, at 235.\n^[74]^ *Id.*, at 236.\n^[75]^ Trojans can have multiple variants as they spread.

Cases Applying the Principle of Proportionality\nAssessing the proportionality of a countermeasure is not only controversial$^{78}$ but also challenging.$^{79}$ The principle of proportionality is concerned with the intensity of countermeasures, aiming to establish a benchmark for countermeasures and restrict them within a reasonable limit. Such test essentially is matter of degree and the outcome of applying the principle of proportionality is unpredictable. The International Law Commission points out explicitly that what is proportionate is not a matter which can be determined precisely and can at best be accomplished by approximation.$^{80}$ The Draft Articles on Responsibility of States does not set out any specific rules on the application of the proportionality test, but only provide the factors to be considered: (1) the extent of the injury suffered; (2) the gravity of the internationally wrongful act; (3) the rights of the injured and responsible State (and interests of other States) that are affected; and (4) the necessity of inducing the responsible State to fulfill its obligations.$^{81}$ This exercise involves value judgment and balancing of interests, thus subjective in nature. Moreover, the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States does not articulate the hierarchy of these factors elements. Therefore, there is still no clear guidance on the application of the principle of proportionality, lacking much-needed predictability and certainty.\nThere are very few cases concerning the proportionality of countermeasures in current international law, among which the only successful one is the Air Service Agreement arbitration case in 1978.$^{82}$ In 1946, France and the USA signed a bilateral agreement to open international air routes between the two States. Disputes arose between the two countries when France refused to allow a change of gauge in London by American flights. As a countermeasure, the USA planned to suspend some flights from Paris to the U.S. In its award, the arbitral tribunal did not make a quantitative analysis of the damage caused by the French wrongful act and the impact of the American countermeasure, but rather a qualitative analysis of the impact of the French illegal act. The key factor considered by the Tribunal was the importance of legal principles involved to the USA, and especially its impact on American aviation policy.$^{83}$ Since the 1970s, the USA has pursued the policy of aviation liberalization and concluded a number of air transport agreements with other States, promoting the opening of international air transport market. The French act restricted the freedom of air transportation, which was incompatible with American aviation policy. In addition, bilateral treaties signed by the USA with other States also contained similar provisions on change of gauge. The French act would affect the interpretation and application of these provisions, which may have significant adverse impact on America. Therefore, the arbitral tribunal concluded that the U.S. countermeasure did not obviously violate the principle of proportionality.$^{84}$ In this case, the key\n\nThe Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law\nfactors considered by the tribunal, i.e., the importance of the aviation policy and the potential impact of the damage, involves qualitative evaluation which is a general approximation rather than an accurate quantitative measurement.\nAnother one is the Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project case in 1997 in which the principle of proportionality was applied and a negative conclusion was made. In this case, Hungary and Slovakia signed an agreement to jointly build a dam on the Danube in 1977. During the implementation of the agreement, Hungary unilaterally terminated the construction of the dam. As a countermeasure, Slovakia diverted the Danube in its territory to intercept water resources. Different from the Air Service Agreement case, the ICJ combined quantitative and qualitative analysis in this case. First, from a qualitative perspective, the Court pointed out that the countermeasure had affected Hungary's important rights to equitable and reasonable share of natural resources of the Danube, including both navigational and non-navigational use. Second, the Court analyzed the intensity of the countermeasure taken by Slovakia. It held that Slovakia had unilaterally diversified and controlled 80% to 90% of water resources of the Danube. Measures with such magnitude will have a significant impact on the ecosystem of the Danube basin, clearly exceeding the reasonable limit, and thus inconsistent with the principle of proportionality. In this case, the Danube is an important international river. The sheer volume of water being diversified, 80% to 90%, was a prima facie indication that the measure was probably out of proportionality. Thus it is a relatively easy case to adjudicate. However, if the amount of water resources affected by the countermeasure was in the range of 10% to 50%, the issue of proportionality would be in the grey area.\n## 2. The Benchmark for the Proportionality test\nThe benchmark for the proportionality test is also a controversial issue. The Draft Articles on Responsibility of States set injury as the benchmark for evaluating proportionality, allowing the injured State to retaliate against the injuring State with an equivalent damage, and thus forcing the injuring State to cease the infringement. This is not fundamentally different from the private retaliation of \"an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.\" It may lead to countermeasure going beyond what is strictly necessary for its very purpose and become punitive in nature. Therefore, there are inherent contradictions in the regime on countermeasures as set out by the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States. This benchmark works well only among States with comparable strength. On the other hand, if there is a significant gap in strength between the countries involved,\n See the Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project (Hungary/Slovakia), Judgment, ICJ Reports 1997.\n In the judgment, the ICJ adopted a two-step approach. First, the Court found that Hungary violated the treaty concluded by both parties, which constituted an internationally wrongful act. Secondly, the Court discussed whether Slovakia's acts constituted countermeasures, one of the most important factor of which was the principle of proportionality. *Id.*, at para. 82.\n *Id.*, at paras. 85–86.\n See Nigel White &amp; Ademola Abass, *Countermeasures and Sanctions*, in Malcolm Evans ed., International Law, at 513 (Cambridge University Press 2018).\nWuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers\ncountermeasure as under the current proportionality test may be abused by those powerful States as an excuse to bully the weak ones.\nIn recent years, some scholars proposed a functional approach towards the proportionality test, arguing that the purpose to be achieved d by countermeasures shall be used as the benchmark. Countermeasures are instrumental, and their purposes are to force the injuring State to cease its wrongful act and to comply with its international obligations, so that the relations between the two States can be restored. Therefore, the proportionality of countermeasures should be assessed against its purpose, irrespective of whether they exceed the intensity of the wrongful act.\nIn April 2007, Estonia suffered a three-week-long DDoS cyberattack and a large number of critical infrastructure websites, including those of government agencies, were forced to shut down, resulting in network paralysis and service disruption with severe damage. If the cyberattack could be attributed to Russia, Estonia could respond with DDoS countermeasures. In terms of the intensity, Estonia may not achieve its purpose if the countermeasures were of equivalent magnitude as that of the cyberattack because Russia's size and strength are far greater than Estonia's. Achieving the purpose of inducing Russia to cease its internationally wrongful act would likely require countermeasures that far exceed the damage caused by Russia's wrongful act. Therefore, taking the purpose of countermeasures as the benchmark is more in line with their very aim. Meanwhile, such approach taking into consideration the differences in strength of nations, prevents the abuse by stronger State, thus more fair and equitable.\nTherefore, the principle of proportionality lacks clear rules and is full of uncertainties. Its application in cyberspace is even more challenging. This is because cyberspace is interconnected and cyberattacks are dynamic and constantly changing, making it difficult and time-consuming to assess the damage caused. The injured State shall be extremely cautious when evaluating the proportionality of the countermeasures. This will not preclude the possibility for taking countermeasures in response to cyberattacks. A practical approach is to adopt cyber measures as an effective response to cyberattacks, because this type of countermeasures is of the same nature as the wrongful act and is more likely to be regarded as consistent with the principle of proportionality.\n See Enzo Cannizzaro, *The Role of Proportionality in the Law of International Countermeasure*, 12 European Journal of International Law 889 (2001).\n See Ma Chunmao, *A Review of Estonia’s Cyber Warfare*, at https://tech.sina.com.cn/i/2009-02-04/08172791102.shtml (last visited June 3, 2019).\n See Nicholas Tsagourias, *The Law Applicable to Countermeasures against Low Intensity Cyber Operations*, 14 Baltic Yearbook of International Law Online 105 (2015).\n Proportionality does not mean reciprocity. The obligation breached by countermeasures does not necessarily need to be same as the obligation breached by the responsible State, nor does the nature and means of the countermeasure.\n See Paragraph 5 of the commentary to the introductory part of Chapter II in Part Three of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States.\nThe Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law\nTraditionally cyberattacks are dealt with through a passive defense system, consisting of a firewall, intrusion detection and prevention mechanism with antivirus software as the commonly deployed technology. Under such system, only after it is attacked will the antivirus software be able to obtain the vital information and code of the virus and update its database. So that the same viruses can be detected and removed next time they appear. The inherent deficiency is that only after the virus attacks can loopholes in the system be identified and fixed. Thus the antivirus software is always behind the virus and even the most sophisticated firewall may be breached. As a result, passive defense cannot does not offer satisfactory solution to network security. Modern network security is increasingly rely on active defense through early detection of cyberattacks and deception techniques to contain and constrain the attacks. For example, sandbox and honeypot are commonly used technical methods, which in fact deliberately expose some vulnerabilities for attackers and then to obtain critical information of the attackers when they intrude the system. These techniques offers protection to the system and buys time for the injured State to examine the cyberattack and to develop appropriate countermeasures.[94] Such means do not compromise or damage the attacker's network facilities or computer systems, thus consistent with the principle of proportionality.\nMore extreme active defenses measures are even aggressive in nature, i.e., hacking back. Such technics involve hacking into the attacker's computer system, erasing the stolen data, or even planting ransomware. This type of defense involves cyber measures thus similar to cyberattacks in nature. However, this does not necessarily mean such measures fulfill the proportionality test because equivalence in nature is only one of the factors considered in the evaluation of proportionality. In practice, it is still necessary to consider other factors of the proportionality test and keeping cyber countermeasures within the reasonable limits allowed by international law.\nIn summary, the application of the principle proportionality is controversial and challenging. The Draft Articles on Responsibility of States fails to provide clear guidance, but only lists the factors to be considered. Furthermore, the benchmark against which proportionality is assessed against is not without controversy. Considerable uncertainties remain with regard to the application of countermeasures in cyberspace. A practical and effective approach is to adopt cyber countermeasures in response to cyberattacks and ensure the impact of such measures are within a reasonable limit.\n# VI. Conclusion\nThe fundamental aim of international law on the countermeasure is to limit it to a reasonable extent and prevent such measures being abused leading to the escalation of disputes. However, the boundaries of countermeasures permitted by international law remains unsettled. During the\n[94] If the attacker took advantage of the vulnerabilities of the honeypot to launch a cyberattack against a third country, the State that set up the honeypot may be found violating its due diligence obligations.\nWuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers\ndrafting process of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States, every rule on countermeasures had been a matter of controversy. Major differences among States on this issue were also highlighted at the 2017 Session of the UNGGE, where disagreements led to the absence of a consensus report and the breakdown of negotiations. The function and mission of the UNGGE is not to create or modify the rules of international law in cyberspace, but to discuss how international law is applied. Thus despite the failure of the negotiation process of the UNGGE, international law, including rules on countermeasures, is still applicable to cyberspace. This basic position has been confirmed by the International Group of Experts in its 2015 report.\nCompared with the traditional physical space of State sovereignty, cyberspace as a relatively new domain has its own unique features, creating new issues to the application of countermeasures. Current international law on the countermeasure as articulated in the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States, imposing stringent conditions to prevent its abuse, are ill-equipped to deal with cyberattacks. It adopts the basic position that countermeasure is illegal per se, to discourage its usage in practice. The prerequisites for taking countermeasures is the existence of internationally wrongful acts; in cyberspace the attribution of cyberattacks to States is challenging. In addition, the procedural requirements for taking countermeasure are impractical in cyberspace and the proportionality test is highly subjective and unpredictable. These facts have greatly diminished the effectiveness and certainty of the application of countermeasures in cyberspace. This is one of the major reason why there are few cases where state invoked countermeasures. Therefore, current international law does not offer clear rules and guidance on how to apply countermeasures in cyberspace. The international law regime on this issue is still at the early stage of development and is still evolving.\n(Translators: Meng Chao &amp; Wang Yi)",

Attribution of cyberattacks to the state is difficult. Though the doctrine of due diligence has the potential to addresses this problem by lowering the threshold of attribution, it may unduly expand the scope of State responsibility. In addition, the procedural requirements for takings countermeasures are impractical in cyberspace. The substantive requirement of proportionality is of fundamental importance, but lacks clear and workable benchmark. Therefore, application of countermeasures in cyberspace is fraught with uncertainties and international law on this issue remains unsettled.\nKeywords: cyberattack; countermeasures; attribution; principle of proportionality; due diligence\n# I. Introduction\nIn recent years, cyberattacks have become more frequent. How to respond to cyberattacks and maintain cyber security has become an issue with significant strategic and practical implications that needs to be addressed urgently in the international community. Under international law, the injured State enjoys the right of self-defense against internationally wrongful acts that have reached the level of armed attack. However, in practice, most cyberattacks do not reach the required threshold of use of force, letting alone an armed attack. Taking the 2010 “Stuxnet” Incident for example, the prevailing view was that the cyberattacks did not constitute an armed attack in international law, notwithstanding that the virus had led to the damage of thousands of Iranian uranium enrichment centrifuges. Therefore, in most cases, a State is not able to exercise its right to self-defense against a cyberattack.\n* ZHU Lei (朱磊), Ph.D. in Law, associate professor at the Wuhan University Institute of International Law in China.\n Armed attacks are the most serious type of use of force, according to the International Court of Justice’s opinion in the Nicaragua case. See Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), Judgement, ICJ Reports 1986, para.191.\n See Michael N. Schmitt ed., Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations, at 538–531 (2nd edition, Cambridge University Press 2017). The book propose eight factors for assessing whether a cyberattack constitutes the use of force, including, severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability of effects, military character, state involvement and presumptive legality.\n See Robin Geiss &amp; Henning Lahmann, Freedom and Security in Cyberspace: Shifting the Focus Away from Military Responses towards Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention, in Katharina Ziolkowski ed., Peacetime Regime for State Activities in Cyberspace: International Law, International Relations and Diplomacy, at 628 (NATO CCDCOE Publication 2013).\nWuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers\nIn response to these cyberattacks which do not rise to the level of an armed attack, States tend to respond in a non-forceful and peaceful manner in practice. For example, in January 2015, the United States (\"USA\") imposed economic sanctions on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea as a response to the cyberattack on Sony Pictures Entertainment. In response to the allegation that Russia had interfered in the United States' General Election through cyberattacks, the USA announced the expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats in December 2016.\nCyberspace is considered as the new frontier of national sovereignty and international law is applicable in this area. The legal nature and status of the actions taken by the injured State in response to cyberattacks under international law is an issue that deserves serious consideration, in which the central issue involved is that of countermeasures. Similar to the right of self-defense, it allows a State to take its own measures of private remedies against an internationally wrongful act. Where certain conditions are met, it can preclude the wrongfulness of those measures and thereby relieve the responsibility of the State.\nThe countermeasure as a customary international law with a long history is controversial in international law. Its application to cyberspace is even more challenging because as an emerging field of science and technology, cyberspace has characteristics different from those areas of traditional State sovereignty. This paper analyzes how countermeasures in international law are applied to cyberspace in light of the characteristics of cyberspace, and examines the main issues and controversies in the application of countermeasures to cyberspace.\n## II. The Historical Development and Inherent Contradictories of Countermeasures\n## 1. Historical Development of Countermeasures\nThe term \"countermeasure\" was first used by the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office of the United Kingdom in 1916 in its correspondences with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Sweden. And the first detailed discussion on countermeasures was in the *Air Services Agreement* arbitration case in 1978. In this case, the USA made its claim based on countermeasures, which\n See Zhuang Xiaodan, *Revenge for Sony Pictures? US Launches New Round of Sanctions against North Korea*, at https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_1290937 (last visited June 3, 2023).\n See Lu Jiafei &amp; Xu Jianmei, *U.S. Announces Sanctions against Russia for Alleged Cyberattacks to Interfere in U.S. Election*, at https://world.huanqiu.com/article/9CaKrnJZtjV (last visited June 3, 2019).\n UN Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (\"UNGGE\"), the main platform and mechanism for official intergovernmental dialogue on international law in cyberspace, acknowledged in its 2013 report that international law applies in cyberspace. See UN, A/68/98.\n See Omer Yousif Elagab, *The Place of Non-Forcible Counter-Measures in Contemporary International Law*, in Guy S. Goodwin-Gill &amp; Stefan Talmon eds., *The Reality of International Law: Essays in Honour of Ian Brownlie*, at 125 (Oxford University Press 1999).\n See the *Air Service Agreement* of 27 March 1946 between the United States of America and France (1978) 18 RIAA 417.\nThe Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law\nwas upheld by the Arbitral Tribunal. The term was widely used after the Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (“Draft Articles on Responsibility of States”), adopted by the International Law Commission of the United Nations (“UNILC”) in 2001, which used the term and contained detailed rules on countermeasures in seven articles.\nThe historical root of countermeasures is found in the traditional international law concept of reprisals, which is essentially a mechanism of private remedy. The concept of “countermeasures” is used as a synonym for “reprisals” and inherits the key elements of the latter. The institution of reprisals in international law has a long history and its development can be divided into three stages.\nThe first stage was a completely liberal private reprisal, which was common in the early stage of the development of the rule of law, during which the State apparatus was not yet in place and public enforcement mechanisms for the law were missing. Where the rights of individuals were violated without remedy from public power, they could take it upon themselves to enforce the law and take reprisals as a means of obtaining the relief. In ancient Greece, the customary law of seizing foreigners existed in the city-states of Athens. Where a citizen of a city-state was killed by a foreigner or the government, the relatives of the victim enjoyed the right to capture and detain three citizens of that foreign state as hostages and demand that the perpetrator be presented or compensated. Where the claim was not met, the victim’s relatives would enjoy the right to kill the hostages to pay back the blood debt.\nThe second stage was the reprisal authorized by the State, essentially to incorporate reprisal into the framework of State regulation. The letter of reprisal offers a good example. It has its roots in Roman law. In ancient Rome, public authorities became involved in the system of reprisals and regulated it strictly. If the rights of a Roman citizen (especially a merchant) were violated by an alien, the victim could seize the citizen of that State to retaliate with procedural and substantive restrictions. Before the reprisal could be carried out, the victim must apply to the relevant State authority for a permit to do so. The precondition of obtaining the permit is that the victim had been treated unfairly by the courts of a foreign State and that his or her damages could not be compensated and his or her rights could not be remedied. The scope must be limited to the actual damage suffered by the victim and the seizure by force can be carried out only within the Roman territory or on international waters.\n Omer Yousif Elagab, supra note 7, at 125–126.\n The International Court of Justice referred to the term twice in 1980 in the United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran case, and several times in the Nicaragua case in 1986.\n See Malcolm N. Shaw, International Law 794 (Cambridge University Press 2008).\n See David J. Bederman, International Law in Antiquity, at 123 (Cambridge University Press 2007).\n Letter of reprisal is also known as letter of marquee.\n Its modern formulation can be found in the Constitution of the United States of America, which in Section 8 of Article 1 authorizes the Congress to grant letters of marque and reprisal.\n See Wilhelm G. Grewe, The Epochs of International Law, at 117 (De Gruyter 2000).\nWuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers\nDuring the medieval period, reprisals centered on the letter of marquee, whereby armed privateers, with government concession, may chase and destroy foreign lawbreakers and fleets, as well as attack and plunder enemy merchant ships. By the 16th Century, wartime plundering became quite widespread and many States began to legislate and regulate the granting of such letters. Hugo Grotius in his book (1604), *De Jure Praedae*, legally defended the act of Dutch ships attacking Portuguese and Spanish ships. He argued that the granting of permit was akin to declaring a “private war,” justified by the fact that the laws of each State had no effective jurisdiction over the seas and that merchant ships had to arm themselves in self-defense.^[16]^\nThe third stage was to prohibit the use of forcible reprisal. Traditional reprisal includes both forcible and non-forcible means, the majority of which is forcible. In the early 20th Century, the international community restricted the use of force through a series of conventions. Modern international law prohibits the use of force and the Charter of the United Nations explicitly prohibits the use of force and the threat of force. As a result, forcible reprisal eventually receded from the stage of history. Accordingly, the term “countermeasures,” also known as “non-forcible reprisal,” was adopted to conform to the development of modern international law, which corresponded to reprisals by non-forcible means. In this way, the term can distinguish itself from reprisals by force and avoid the negative connotations associated with the concept of reprisals in traditional international law.^[17]^\n## 2. The Inherent Contradictories of Countermeasures\nA review of the historical development reveals its inherent tensions and contradictories, which is also the core issue to be addressed in contemporary international law. On the one hand, the existence of countermeasures is justified. In the absence of adequate public enforcement mechanisms when the rule of law is weak, reprisal offers a workable and efficient private solution. In domestic law, with the development of the rule of law, private enforcement of the law was increasingly limited and ultimately superseded by public enforcement of the law. By contrast, international law is based on the principle of sovereign equality and the international community is an egalitarian society. International law has an inherent flaw in that it lacks a centralized enforcement mechanism with enforcement authority that overrides the State, resulting in inadequate supply of public remedies. Therefore, it is necessary to have countermeasures as a form of private national remedies.\nThe essence of countermeasures, on the other hand, is to leave law enforcement in private hands, which could be harmful and even dangerous. Without any constraints, reprisal is highly vulnerable to abuse, plunging the international law into law of the jungle. Though the medieval letter of marquee was under the State’s regulation, it was often no different than piracy in practice. Bartolus de Saxoferrato (1314-1357), a famous European medieval jurist, wrote in a work published in\n^[16] See Hugo Grotius, *Commentary on the Law of Prize and Booty*, at 62 (Liberty Fund 2012).\n^[17] See Mary Ellen O’Connell, *The Power and Purpose of International Law: Insights from the Theory and Practice of Enforcement*, at 233 (Oxford University Press 2011).\nThe Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law\n\nBut, how can the balance between the reasonableness and the harm of countermeasures be achieved? This is the most difficult and contentious issue in the modern international law regime on countermeasures, which is also evident in the drafting process of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States. Although the majority of States recognized the necessity of countermeasures, many expressed concerns about the harmfulness of countermeasures. Therefore, in order to prevent the abuse of countermeasures, the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States adopted the principle of “conditional lawfulness” for countermeasures and set strict requirements for their implementation, in an attempt to prevent such measures from becoming tools for strong States to oppress weak States. Only countermeasures that have met these conditions are lawful; otherwise, they would be considered as internationally wrongful acts.\nThe rules established in the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States are the authoritative expression of modern international law on countermeasures, but they are also highly contentious. The fundamental disagreement during the development of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States was over the legal status of countermeasures, especially whether they are lawful or unlawful in nature. Representatives of some States took a positive attitude towards countermeasures, proposing that countermeasures are lawful in themselves, which are the rights enjoyed by States in international law, and are unlawful only under certain exceptional circumstances. However, this view was not supported by the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States which regarded countermeasures as unlawful *per se*. Countermeasures are internationally wrongful act that are in breach of internationally law, with the possibility of excluding the international wrongfulness of the act under certain circumstances. Therefore, countermeasures involve a situation excluding the wrongfulness of the act and may be invoked a defense to the accusation of internationally wrongful act. This fundamental stance taken by the UNILC is to discourage rather than promote the use of countermeasures.\nIn summary, countermeasures are the private enforcement of the law and have certain negative consequences. The historical development of countermeasures is a process of introducing more restrictions on its use and to bring it under the regulation of the law. In the meanwhile, international community is egalitarian in nature, which provides the solid foundation for its existence as an accepted form of enforcement under customary international law. Setting clear requirements for their use, mitigating their harmfulness, and limiting their application within an acceptable boundary are the key purpose for modern international law regime on countermeasures.\n Wilhelm G. Grewe, *supra* note 15, at 117.\n This basic principle is also reflected in Tallinn Manual 2.0 on International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations. See Michael N. Schmitt, *supra* note 2, at 225.\nWuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers\n## III. Prerequisites for Taking Countermeasures in Cyberspace: Internationally Wrongful Acts in Cyberspace\n## 1. Temporal Limitation of Countermeasures\nThe existence of an internationally wrongful act is a prerequisite for taking countermeasures, which is the primary reason for the exclusion of its wrongfulness. Countermeasures are similar to self-defense in this regard, which are taken in response to a prior internationally wrongful act by another State. As a result, countermeasures should be considered as the “shield” for defense rather than the “spear” for offense. The absence of an effective enforcement mechanism in international law allows the injured State to suspend its international obligations only when the other State has violated the law in the first place. In other words, the essence of countermeasures is to counteract an internationally wrongful act with an illegal act, with the goal of forcing the injuring State to resume its international obligations and restore normal relations between the two nations. Therefore, countermeasures are a part of the enforcement mechanism of international law, through which the injured State are able to protect its own rights and interests, thus also a mechanism of remedy in international law.\nCountermeasures must be taken against an ongoing internationally wrongful act and are not preventive or prospective. Once the wrongful act ceases, the countermeasures must also be ceased. Thus, if a cyberattack has not yet occurred or has ended, the injured State shall not take countermeasures. This rule significantly limits the possibility of an injured State to take countermeasures in response to a cyber-related wrongful act, because unlike traditional internationally wrongful acts, most cyberattacks are sudden and short-lived, leaving only a relatively limited period of time for an injured State to respond and diminishing the possibility of taking countermeasures in response to a cyberattack.\nIt is worth noting that modern cyberattacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, often requiring a large investment of manpower and resources, and their complexity and destructive power may be no less than a small-scale war. Complex cyberattacks take a long time from planning to actual implementation involving multiple steps such as intelligence collection, vulnerability detection, intrusion and infiltration into the network, and virus implantation. They often require coordination and cooperation of a professional and technical team. The time span of cyberattacks provides the opportunities and possibilities for injured State to monitor and detect cyberattacks earlier.\n---\n See Denis Alland, *Countermeasures of General Interest*, 13 European Journal of International Law 1221 (2002).\n See Maurice Kamto, *The Time Factor in the Application of Countermeasures*, in James Crawford et al. eds., *The Law of International Responsibility*, at 1176 (Oxford University Press 2010).\n See Jiang Shibo, *Cyber Attacks and the Application of the Laws of War*, 16(2) Wuhan University International Law Review 43–70 (2014).\nThe Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law\nThe cyberattack on the Ukrainian power grid on 23 December 2015 offers a good illustration. The cyberattack began in the spring of 2014, when the attackers first spear-phished IT staff and system administrators, causing viruses to infect systems and opening backdoors for subsequent cyberattacks. Over the following months, the attackers conducted extensive network reconnaissance, exploration and mapping efforts and gained the ability to manage user accounts within the network and employee login credentials. The final step of the cyberattack consisted of a series of coordinated actions, including reconfiguring the uninterruptible power supply, disconnecting the circuit breaker to take the substation offline, and launching a denial-of-service attack on the customer call center.[23]\nIn order to deal with sophisticated cyberattacks, the injured State should develop and improve its capabilities of cyber-related technology, strengthen real-time supervision over cyberattacks, detect ongoing cyberattacks at an early stage, and fix vulnerabilities of the system and strengthen measures for cyber prevention and defense. If the cyberattack is still at such an early stage as the planning, vulnerability detection and intelligence gathering, the injured State should exercise restraint and should not take countermeasures; otherwise, it may cause miscalculation and lead to the escalation of disputes. Once a cyberattack enters the next stage of implementation, such as planting viruses and stealing account information, etc., it constitutes an internationally wrongful act in violation of international law, at which time the injured State may take countermeasures against the act without waiting for the final stage of the cyberattack to unfold.\n## 2. Attribution of Internationally Wrongful Acts\nUnder international law, countermeasures are measures taken by a state against another state, which carries two important implications. Although enterprises are frequently subject to cyberattacks,[24] the measures taken by enterprises in response to cyberattacks do not constitute the countermeasures under international law.[25] Second, the object of countermeasures must be the State rather than non-State actors. In reality, there are very few inter-State cyberattacks, and most of such attacks are initiated by private non-State actors (e.g., patriotic hackers and lone wolves).[26] The first issue to be addressed in determining whether there is an internationally wrongful act is the attribution of cyberattacks, i.e., whether privately committed acts can be attributed to the State and constitute acts of the State.[27] If a cyberattack committed by a non-State actor is not attributed to the State, it\n[23] See Kim Zetter, Inside the Cunning, Unprecedented Hack of Ukraine’s Power Grid, at https://www.wired.com/2016/03/inside-cunning-unprecedented-hack-ukraines-power-grid/ (last visited June 3, 2023).\n[24] The 2017 Annual Internet Security Report released by Tencent Security pointed out that up to 86% of companies worldwide had experienced at least one cyberattack in 2017. Tencent’s 2017 Annual Internet Security Report: Nearly 90% of Global Companies Suffered Cyber Attacks, at http://tech.chinadaily.com.cn/2018-01/31/content_35621606.htm (last visited June 3, 2019).\n[25] See Michael N. Schmitt, Below the Threshold Cyber Operations: The Counter-Measures Response Option and International Law, 54 Virginia Journal of International Law 697 (2014).\n[26] See Michael N. Schmitt, In Defense of Due Diligence in Cyberspace, 125 Yale Law Journal Forum 77 (2015).\n[27] See Tom Ruys, Sanctions, Retorsions and Countermeasures: Concepts and International Legal Framework, in Larissa van den Herik ed., Research Handbook on UN Sanctions and International Law, at 14 (Edward Elgar Publishing 2016).\nWuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers\nmay constitute a violation of domestic law, but not an internationally wrongful act in violation of international law, and the injured State cannot take countermeasures against such acts.\nAttribution is an extremely challenging issue in identifying State responsibility in cyberspace, involving three layers of attribution. First, from the technical perspective, unlike traditional physical domains such as sea, land and air, the cyberspace is a decentralized system. Cyberspace is open, pluralistic, interoperable, and anonymous, and attackers often use encryption technology to transmit information in packets to hide their identities and sources, making the investigation of the source of cyberattacks quite complex, costly and protracted.\nSecond, after locating the source of cyberattacks through technical means, the subject behind the cyberattacks also needs to be identified. Even if the IP address is traced to a State's cyber infrastructure, it may not meet the criteria of burden of proof for attribution because IP addresses can be spoofed. For example, in 2013, an organization impersonating its IP address as from the Ukrainian government conducted cyber operations against the NATO Cyber Cooperative Defense Center of Excellence, the Estonian Defense Forces, and the armed forces of other NATO countries. Clearly, the conduct could not be attributed to the Ukrainian government.\nFinally, it remains to determine whether the act committed by the attackers constitutes the act of a State, i.e., legal attribution. The key issue is whether cyberattacks committed by non-State actors can be attributed to the State and constitute internationally wrongful acts that entails State responsibility. The challenge is degree of connection required for attribution to the State the cyberattacks committed by non-State actors. Under Article 8 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States, the conduct of non-State actors acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of a State is attributable to that State. The International Court of Justice (\"ICJ\") established the doctrine of \"effective control\" in the Nicaragua case in 1987. In that case, the USA played a significant and decisive role in financing, organizing, training, supplying, and equipping the Nicaraguan Contras, but the ICJ found that the series of U.S. acts did not constitute \"effective control\" and thus could not meet the standard of attribution.\nThe doctrine of effective control requires the State play a direct and a leading role in the cyberattacks, not just a supporting one, setting a higher threshold for State responsibility for private conduct. For example, the USA believed that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea played a \"central role\" in the 2014 cyberattack on Sony Pictures, which rose to the level of effective control and imposed\n See Michael N. Schmitt, *Peacetime Cyber Responses and Wartime Cyber Operations under International Law: An Analytical Vade Mecum*, 8 Harvard National Security Journal 260 (2017).\n See Huang Zhixiong ed., *On Cyber Sovereignty—Jurisprudence, Policy and Practice*, at 39 (Social Sciences Academic Press 2017).\n See Michael N. Schmitt, *supra* note 2, at 203.\n *Supra* note 1, at para. 115.\nThe Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law\nsanctions against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. In contrast, Iranian hackers conducted DDoS cyberattacks against a number of U.S. financial institutions between 2011 and 2013. Although these hackers had ties to the Iranian government, such ties did not rise to the level of effective control and therefore the attacks could not be attributed to Iran and the USA could not take countermeasures against Iran accordingly.\nThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 on International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations (“Tallinn Manual 2.0”) adopts the ICJ’s standard of effective control. It gives the following illustrative example. A State plans and oversees an operation to use a software update to implant a new vulnerability in software widely used by another state in its governmental computers. The former State enters into a confidential contract with the company that produced the software to embed the vulnerability and directs the course of action. In such a case the State planned, directed, and supervised over a particular cyberattack and took a leading and direct role in the operation, which is fundamentally different from the ancillary role played by the US government in the Nicaragua case and thus the company’s conduct is attributable to the State.\nThe doctrine of effective control adopts a relatively stringent criterion of attribution, which makes it difficult for the injured State to prove, thus severely limiting the application of countermeasures. In practice, the injuring State may not directly organize the implementation of cyberattacks, but indirectly support cyberattacks as a way to avoid State responsibility. Moreover, cyberattacks are secretive and complex, and attackers often use technical means to hide the source of the attack, so it is not easy to obtain conclusive evidence to prove the extent of State involvement in such cyberattacks and the role played by the State. And such evidence is often located in the injuring State or even across the globe, which is difficult to obtain and even if obtained, the timing for taking countermeasures may has already elapsed. For example, Estonia was subjected to a DDoS attack in 2007 and investigation revealed that the source of the attack was computers from 178 countries, including Vietnam and the USA. The cyberattack lasted for three weeks, providing a valuable time for evidence collection and attribution. However, to date, there is still no conclusive evidence of to attribute the responsibility to Russia.\nIn summary, the rules on attribution in international law are established for traditional internationally wrongful acts and thus are difficult to apply to cyberspace. It has the effect of greatly limiting the possibility of taking countermeasures in cyberspace. Some scholars argued that the constraints of existing customary law should be lifted and States should be allowed to take countermeasures\n Zhuang Xiaodan, supra note 4.\n See BBC: US Indicts 7 Iranian Hackers for Breaching Multiple Financial Firms, at https://news.youth.cn/gj/201603/t20160325_7779822.htm (last visited June 3, 2019).\n See Michael N.

It essentially treats non-State actors as the subject of responsibility in international law, thus a departure from the basic principle of international law, which may have disturbing and far-reaching impact on the existing international order.\n## 3. Due Diligence\nTo address the difficulty of attribution under the doctrine of effective control, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 introduces due diligence into cyberspace, proposing that a State must exercise due diligence in not allowing its territory, or territory or cyber infrastructure under its governmental control, to be used for cyber operations that affect the rights of, and produce serious adverse consequences for, other States. This lowers the criterion of attribution required by the doctrine of effective control and reduces the threshold of State responsibility for acts of private subjects, essentially as a type of vicarious liability. This is an important development and breakthrough compared to the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (Tallinn Manual 1.0).\nThe ICJ has affirmed the doctrine of due diligence in the Corfu Channel case, the Tehran Hostage case, and the Nicaragua case. For example, in the Corfu Channel case, although the mines were not laid by Albania, the area where the incident occurred was Albanian territorial waters and Albania should bear the regulatory responsibility for that area. Also, judging from the geographical location and expertise, Albania had the knowledge of the mines laid in the Corfu Channel, but failed to take relevant measures, and therefore should bear responsibility. The ICJ stated that every State has an obligation “not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States.”\nUnder the doctrine of due diligence, a State must take active measures to prevent, reduce or limit the occurrence of damage, which is essentially an obligation to prevent transnational damage. The infrastructure on which cyberspace is based is physical, located in a particular State, and falls within the sovereign jurisdiction of that State, and due diligence is equally applicable. This basic position was also adopted by the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Information Security (“UNGGE”) in its report issued in 2015. Therefore, if a State violates due diligence in\n See Gary Corn &amp; Eric Talbot Jensen, *The Use of Force and Cyber Countermeasures*, 32 Temple International &amp; Comparative Law Journal 127 (2018).\n See Michael N. Schmitt, *supra* note 2, at 128.\n See Huang Zhixiong, *The Attribution of Cyberattacks in International Law*, 5 Global Law Review 164 (2014).\n See Corfu Channel (United Kingdom v. Albania), Judgment, ICJ Reports 1949, at 22.\n See the United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran (United States v. Iran), Judgment, ICJ Report 1980, para. 63.\n *Supra* note 1, at para.157.\n *Supra* note 40, at para. 65.\n *Supra* note 40, at para. 67.\n See UN, A/70/174.\nThe Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law\ncyberspace, it constitutes an internationally wrongful act and the injured State is entitled to take countermeasures.\nThe most controversial issue in practice is the scope of the obligation assumed by a State under the doctrine of due diligence. On this issue, two extreme positions should be avoided. If a liberal approach is adopted, i.e., a State assumes little or even no obligation, this will lead to the abuse of the principle of sovereignty, allowing the use of network facilities to infringe upon the interests of other States.\nOn the other hand, an expanded interpretation would broaden the scope of due diligence, constitute an unreasonable restriction on State sovereignty, which lacks a basis in international law. In this regard, the view of U.S. military judge Matthew J. Sklerov is quite representative. He advocated that strict criminal legislation and law enforcement could effectively prevent cyberattacks, and argued that the State's obligation in cyberspace includes passing stringent criminal laws, conducting vigorous investigations, prosecuting attackers, and, during the investigation and prosecution, cooperating with the victim state of cyberattacks that originated from within their borders. According to this view, knowledge of the occurrence of the damage is also not a requirement for the assumption of due diligence. In other words, the State has the obligation to take active criminal action to prevent and stop illegal cyberattacks, and the State's negligence or omission in any respect constitutes tacit approval and sheltering of such attacks and constitutes a violation of due diligence.\nIn practice, however, cyberattacks are often deceptive and disguised, and attackers may use the network infrastructure of other States to carry out remote attacks. Matthew J. Sklerov's view underestimated the complexity of cyberattacks in practice, which may lead to a misjudgment on state responsibility of cyberattacks. The USA, with its significant political, economic, and military position in the world, is often the target of cyberattacks, but it is difficult to hold the relevant States responsible in practice due to the problem of attribution. This view which expands the scope of due diligence attempts to lift the constraints and limitations under traditional rules of international law and to lower the threshold of State responsibility, thus enabling the USA to take countermeasures against other States more easily. Such practice should come under close scrutiny.\nThe appropriate approach on this issue is to return to the current framework of international law under which a State assumes due diligence responsibility only to the extent of knowledge on the occurrence of damage. This basic principle was also endorsed in the report of the UNGGE issued in 2015, and is a commonly held position by States. Under this doctrine, knowledge may be actual\n See Matthew J. Sklerov, Solving the Dilemma of State Responses to Cyberattacks: A Justification for the Use of Active Defenses against States Who Neglect Their Duty to Prevent, 201 Military Law Review 71 (2009).\n Id., at 62.\n Id., at 71.\n Id.\n Supra note 40, at para.18.\nWuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers\nor constructive. A State may be found to have actual knowledge of a cyberattack if it has detected or has been notified by the injured State of an attack originating from that country.^[51]^ The essence of constructive knowledge is the reverse of the burden of proof. The challenge of attribution in cyberspace is evidence, and in the case of constructive knowledge the burden of proof is shifted to the territorial State where the cyberattack originated which have more evidence than the victim state. Therefore it is presumed to have knowledge of the cyberattack with the possibility of rebuttal.^[52]^\nWith the sheer number of Internet users and the technology to hide their identities and even erase traces of Internet access, it is almost impossible to achieve complete and comprehensive regulation in cyberspace. But this does not mean that the State is unaware of cyber operations within its borders. Whether a State is aware of cyberattacks is closely related to its technical capacities and the regulatory policy it adopts in cyberspace.\nCyberspace is highly complex and technical in nature, and cyber regulation relies on the relevant cyber technical capacities which many developing countries may lack. This is an important factor that must be taken into account when assessing knowledge. Otherwise, it may unduly expand the scope of due diligence obligations. On the other hand, every State regulates cyber activities within its territory to some extent, and an absolutely free cyberspace does not exist. Title V of the Convention on Cybercrime explicitly requires contracting parties to collect and record computer data in real time, which does not only include traffic data, but also content data.\nCyber supervision and regulation is common practice among states, and the difference lies in the degree of its stringency. If a State has strict supervision over cyberspace, it is more likely to know that a cyberattack has occurred, and it can even constitute \"constructive knowledge.\" For example, in May 2013, the U.S. energy security was significantly threatened by a cyberattack on the critical control systems of energy companies and attackers were even able to manipulate the oil and gas pipelines. The U.S. officials said that although there was no conclusive evidence that the cyberattack was supported by the Iranian government, it was unlikely that the Iranian government was unaware of the attack because the Iranian government had centralized control over the cyberspace.^[53]^ This offers a good example of the how the constructive knowledge may be applied in practice.\nIn summary, the precondition for taking countermeasures is the existence of an internationally wrongful act. What is challenging in cyberspace is how to attribute cyberattacks committed by non-State actors to the State. Under the traditional doctrine of effective control, the threshold for attribution is high and difficult to reach in cyberspace. While the doctrine of due diligence may\n^[51]^ See Wolff Heintschel von Heinegg, *Legal Implications of Territorial Sovereignty in Cyberspace*, in Christian Czosseck *et al.* eds., 2012 4th International Conference on Cyber Conflict (NATO CCDCOE Publications, Tallin, 2012).\n^[52]^ For example, if a government-dedicated network infrastructure is used to carry out a cyberattack, there is a presumption that the government of that State had knowledge of the cyberattack because the network was under the full control and supervision of the government.\n^[53]^ See N. Perlroth &amp; D. Sanger, *New Computer Attacks Traced to Iran*, Officials Say, The New York Times (May 24, 2013).\nThe Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law\nstep in to solve this problem, the danger is that the scope of due diligence may be overly broad. A balanced approach is that State responsibility only limited cyberattacks to which the State has knowledge of.\n## IV. Procedural Requirements for Taking Countermeasures in Cyberspace\n## 1. The Instrumentality of Countermeasures\nIn the application of countermeasures, the determination of an internationally wrongful act is unilateral in nature. The injured State makes its own judgment as to the existence of the internationally wrongful act and the gravity of the damage caused by such act, and makes its own decision as to whether or not and what countermeasures to take.^[54]^ For example, when the Sony Pictures Entertainment suffered a cyberattack in 2014, the U.S. Government, based on the information available to its intelligence community, believed that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea played a central role in the cyberattack, which constituted a State act. It then imposed economic sanctions on three Korean government agencies and officials.^[55]^ In this process, the US State had three roles to play, i.e., as the victim state of a cyberattack, the adjudicator of an internationally wrongful act, and implementer of countermeasures. This leads to an obvious conflict of interest and is prone to exaggerated assessment of the severity of the damage and the necessity of countermeasures, resulting in the escalation of disputes.^[56]^\nThe determination of an internationally wrongful act is a complex process of fact finding and application of law, which is not an easy task. There is no third-party body in the existing international law system to make an objective and neutral determination on the existence of an internationally wrongful act. In other words, countermeasures are taken on the basis of a one-sided claim of injured State and there is a possibility of abuse in practice. Some States may fabricate the existence of an internationally wrongful act and accuse another State of committing such act. Countermeasures may be used as a justification for the State to take measures such as sanctions, thus becoming a tool for strong countries to bully the weak. This is the greatest danger in the application of countermeasures in cyberspace, a cause for concern for developing countries in particular. Therefore, at the 2017 session of the UNGGE, developing countries, represented by Cuba, opposed the application of the right to self-defense and countermeasures to cyberspace.^[57]^\n^[54]^ Mary Ellen O’Connell, *supra* note 17, at 230.\n^[55]^ See Li Liangyong, *U.S. Sanctions North Korea over Sony “Hack,” No Response from North Korea*, at http://www.xinhuanet.com/world/2015-01/04/c_127354664.htm (last visited June 3, 2023).\n^[56]^ See N. Jansen Calamita, *Sanctions, Countermeasures, and the Iranian Nuclear Issue*, 42 Vanderbilt Journal of Transnational Law 1420 (2009).\n^[57]^ See Anders Henriksen, *The End of the Road for the UNGGE Process: The Future Regulation of Cyberspace*, 5 Journal of Cybersecurity 1 (2019).\nWuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers\nIn order to prevent countermeasures from being abused and leading to the escalation of disputes, and to ensure that they are taken only when they are necessary to achieve their purpose, Article 52 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States set out a series of stringent procedural requirements for countermeasures. Countermeasures, which are instrumental in nature, are intended to induce the responsible State to cease its violations, to comply with and fulfill its international obligations again and to restore lawful relations between the two States. But, countermeasures are not the only way to achieve such end. The fundamental principle of peaceful settlement of international disputes is well established in modern international law[68] and Article 33 of the UN Charter provides a list of pacific methods,[59] which shall be given priority in international dispute settlement. In contrast, countermeasures are exceptional in nature[60] and shall be taken only as the last resort. The injured State should first seek to resolve the disputes through the usual dispute settlement methods contained in Article 33 of the UN Charter, rather than through countermeasures.\nThe victim State shall invoke State responsibility against the injuring State in the first instance. Countermeasures shall not be taken if the injuring State has ceased the wrongful act and undertaken to pay compensation. Second, the injured State should also comply with its obligation to notify in advance and to seek a negotiated settlement of the dispute; this is the second procedural requirement for the taking of countermeasures.[61] In this process, the case of state responsibility is presented to the injuring State and to put some pressure on it to cooperate, thus giving the injuring State a second chance.[62] Finally, an injured State may not take countermeasures when a dispute has already been submitted to a dispute settlement mechanism.\nThese procedural requirements for countermeasures apply equally in the cyberspace. In particular, the last two procedural requirements are controversial which triggered intense debate in the course of formulating the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States. Their application in cyberspace is even more challenging, which will be discussed below.\n## 2. Notification and Seeking to Settle Disputes through Negotiations\nIn order to prevent escalation of a dispute, the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States provides that the injured State should notify the responsible State of any decision to take countermeasures\nThe Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law\nand offer to negotiate with that State. In practice, notification and negotiation are not two separate steps. The purpose of notification is to give the injuring State an opportunity to respond. If the injuring State does so, it constitutes the start of negotiations between the Parties. In cyberspace, notification is necessary because cyberattacks are often covert. Notification gives the responsible State an opportunity for clarification and prevents misjudgment and the escalation of disputes.\nHowever, the obligation to notify as a procedural requirement in cyberspace faces a number of challenges. First, it is not supported by current state practice. When a State take measures to respond to an internationally wrongful act, usually it does not invoke countermeasure as a justification. Even the issue is subject to a dispute settlement procedure, the victim State usually argues that its act complies with international law in the first instance. Countermeasures come into play only when the act is found to be internationally wrongful, i.e., as a defense and exemption from state responsibility. Therefore, although there are a large number of cases in which countermeasures have been taken to respond to internationally wrongful acts, the number of cases in which countermeasures are invoked are very limited in practice. For example, the U.S. Government expelled Russian diplomatic officials in response to alleged Russia’s interference with the U.S. general election through cyberattacks in 2016, but it did not explicitly mention countermeasure as its legal basis.\nSecond, obligation to notify in cyberspace may be impractical. This is because the tracing the source of cyberattacks is complex and challenging. In practice, it is often difficult to identify who the attacker is and where it is originated, rendering notification being impossible. Furthermore, prior notification is likely to diminish the effectiveness of countermeasures in cyberspace. This is particularly the case if countermeasures are taken through cyber means. Once the injuring State becomes aware of the countermeasures, the cyber tools can be captured and reused. Moreover, an injuring State, having been notified of countermeasures, may temporarily suspend cyberattacks as a means of avoiding such measures, because countermeasures shall cease as well in such situation. Therefore, prior notification may render countermeasures meaningless and ineffective.\nThe obligation to notify is not absolute and the injured State may take such urgent countermeasures as necessary. This is also recognized by The Tallinn Manual 2.0 which points out that urgent\n A small number of experts argued that negotiation is also one of the prior procedural requirement for taking countermeasures. The majority of experts did not agree and were in the opinion that this may be an excuse for the responsible State to stall for time. See Michael N. Schmitt, supra note 2, at 152.\n Mary Ellen O’Connell, supra note 17, at 259.\n For example, in the Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project case, Slovakia did not claim that its actions constitute countermeasures, instead revoked other grounds as justification. The application of countermeasures arose only after its claims had not been upheld and its actions were found internationally wrongful. See the Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project (Hungary/Slovakia), Judgment, ICJ Reports 1997, para. 82.\n Lu Jiafei &amp; Xu Jianmei, supra note 5.\n Gary Corn &amp; Eric Talbot Jensen, supra note 37.\n See Article 52 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States.\nWuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers\ncountermeasures are highly likely in cyberspace. Cyberattacks are often both unpredictable and can spread rapidly over a short period of time, even capable of significantly impairing critical infrastructure. Thus any delay in time may cause unknown and even irreparable damage. In such circumstances, the victim State may take urgent countermeasures without prior notification to the injuring State. For example, a State is being attacked by a serious internationally wrongful cyber operation. The injured State intends to respond by blocking all electronic access to the bank accounts of the responsible State. If the responsible State is notified of that intention, it will have the opportunity to transfer the assets out of the country, effectively depriving the injured State of the possibility of taking such countermeasure. Therefore, urgent countermeasure is of significant practical implications as they may be used more widely in cyberspace.\n## 3. Dispute Settlement Mechanisms\nInternational laws provide for dispute settlement mechanisms capable of rendering a binding decision on a dispute, thus offering relief to the injured State. This would undermine the very underlying reason that justify countermeasure, i.e., international law lacks a centralized enforcement mechanism. In addition, such mechanisms may reach a final resolution of the disputes between the states. By contrast, countermeasures are temporary in nature and cannot solve the dispute definitively, and the dispute may eventually be submitted to dispute settlement procedures. Thus the countermeasure is a less favored means of dispute resolution.\nThe relationship between countermeasures and dispute settlement mechanisms was one of the most controversial issues in the formulation of Draft Articles on Responsibility of States. The special rapporteur, Gaetano Arangio Ruiz, advocated the idea that the injured State is obliged to submit the dispute to the dispute settlement procedure before resorting to countermeasures, which is also reflected in the text he drafted. However, this view was not supported by States. The final text provides, in Article 52(3), that Countermeasures may not be taken, and if already taken must be suspended without undue delay if the dispute is pending before a court or tribunal which has the authority to make decisions binding on the parties.\nIn the process of formulating the Tallinn Manual 2.0, the majority of the International Group of Experts adopted the position of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States. However, the application of the rule was not without controversy. Members of the International Group of Experts were divided on whether or not such obligation is absolute. Some experts held the opinion that such\n See Katharine C. Hinkle, Countermeasures in the Cyber Context: One More Thing to Worry about, 37 Yale Journal of International Law Online 11 (2011).\n See Michael N. Schmitt, supra note 2, at 234–235.\n Mary Ellen O’Connell, supra note 17, at 258.\n The phrase “court or tribunal” refers to any third-party dispute settlement procedure, whatever its designation. The court or tribunal must have the power to order interim measures that are capable of protecting the purportedly injured State. See Michael N. Schmitt, supra note 2, at 235.\nThe Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law\na dispute settlement mechanism is mandatory if it is explicitly required by international law. On the other hand, a minority of the experts argued that, rather than creating an absolute obligation, a case-by-case analysis should be undertaken to evaluate whether a third-party dispute settlement body had sufficient capacities to protect the rights of the injured State thus providing an effective alternative to countermeasures.^[73]^\nIt is submitted that dispute settlement mechanisms do not exclude countermeasures and resort to dispute settlement procedure is not a prerequisite procedural requirement for the taking of countermeasures. Under current international law, dispute settlement mechanisms are not substitute for countermeasures and provisional and urgent countermeasures are allowed even after a dispute has been submitted to a mandatory dispute settlement mechanism.^[74]^ This is particularly the case in cyberspace. Damage caused by cyberattacks could spread rapidly in a short period of time, sometimes even beyond the control of the attackers, which traditional dispute settlement mechanisms of international law may be ill-equipped to address.^[75]^ Therefore, countermeasures may be excluded only if treaties between the states involved contain technical defensive measures that are effective in induce the responsible State to comply with its international obligations and to prevent further damage, thus able to provide the victim State appropriate mechanism for remedy. Otherwise, the taking of countermeasures should not be precluded in cyberspace, even if the dispute is subject to a dispute settlement process.\n## V. Substantive Requirement for Taking Countermeasures in Cyberspace: The Principle of Proportionality\nCountermeasures taken by the injured State must comply with the principle of proportionality. If the countermeasures exceed the reasonable boundary set by the proportionality test, they will be punitive and retaliatory in nature and will no longer be legitimate under international law but rather an internationally wrongful act.^[76]^ Article 51 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States provides that countermeasures must be commensurate with the injury suffered. Under the proportionality test, countermeasures are assessed against the injuries suffered, not only in purely “quantitative” terms but also “qualitative” factors. This proportionality is equally applicable to countermeasures in cyberspace, which was clearly confirmed in the report published by the UNGGE in 2015.^[77]^\n^[73]^ *Id.*, at 235.\n^[74]^ *Id.*, at 236.\n^[75]^ Trojans can have multiple variants as they spread.

Cases Applying the Principle of Proportionality\nAssessing the proportionality of a countermeasure is not only controversial$^{78}$ but also challenging.$^{79}$ The principle of proportionality is concerned with the intensity of countermeasures, aiming to establish a benchmark for countermeasures and restrict them within a reasonable limit. Such test essentially is matter of degree and the outcome of applying the principle of proportionality is unpredictable. The International Law Commission points out explicitly that what is proportionate is not a matter which can be determined precisely and can at best be accomplished by approximation.$^{80}$ The Draft Articles on Responsibility of States does not set out any specific rules on the application of the proportionality test, but only provide the factors to be considered: (1) the extent of the injury suffered; (2) the gravity of the internationally wrongful act; (3) the rights of the injured and responsible State (and interests of other States) that are affected; and (4) the necessity of inducing the responsible State to fulfill its obligations.$^{81}$ This exercise involves value judgment and balancing of interests, thus subjective in nature. Moreover, the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States does not articulate the hierarchy of these factors elements. Therefore, there is still no clear guidance on the application of the principle of proportionality, lacking much-needed predictability and certainty.\nThere are very few cases concerning the proportionality of countermeasures in current international law, among which the only successful one is the Air Service Agreement arbitration case in 1978.$^{82}$ In 1946, France and the USA signed a bilateral agreement to open international air routes between the two States. Disputes arose between the two countries when France refused to allow a change of gauge in London by American flights. As a countermeasure, the USA planned to suspend some flights from Paris to the U.S. In its award, the arbitral tribunal did not make a quantitative analysis of the damage caused by the French wrongful act and the impact of the American countermeasure, but rather a qualitative analysis of the impact of the French illegal act. The key factor considered by the Tribunal was the importance of legal principles involved to the USA, and especially its impact on American aviation policy.$^{83}$ Since the 1970s, the USA has pursued the policy of aviation liberalization and concluded a number of air transport agreements with other States, promoting the opening of international air transport market. The French act restricted the freedom of air transportation, which was incompatible with American aviation policy. In addition, bilateral treaties signed by the USA with other States also contained similar provisions on change of gauge. The French act would affect the interpretation and application of these provisions, which may have significant adverse impact on America. Therefore, the arbitral tribunal concluded that the U.S. countermeasure did not obviously violate the principle of proportionality.$^{84}$ In this case, the key\n\nThe Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law\nfactors considered by the tribunal, i.e., the importance of the aviation policy and the potential impact of the damage, involves qualitative evaluation which is a general approximation rather than an accurate quantitative measurement.\nAnother one is the Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project case in 1997 in which the principle of proportionality was applied and a negative conclusion was made. In this case, Hungary and Slovakia signed an agreement to jointly build a dam on the Danube in 1977. During the implementation of the agreement, Hungary unilaterally terminated the construction of the dam. As a countermeasure, Slovakia diverted the Danube in its territory to intercept water resources. Different from the Air Service Agreement case, the ICJ combined quantitative and qualitative analysis in this case. First, from a qualitative perspective, the Court pointed out that the countermeasure had affected Hungary's important rights to equitable and reasonable share of natural resources of the Danube, including both navigational and non-navigational use. Second, the Court analyzed the intensity of the countermeasure taken by Slovakia. It held that Slovakia had unilaterally diversified and controlled 80% to 90% of water resources of the Danube. Measures with such magnitude will have a significant impact on the ecosystem of the Danube basin, clearly exceeding the reasonable limit, and thus inconsistent with the principle of proportionality. In this case, the Danube is an important international river. The sheer volume of water being diversified, 80% to 90%, was a prima facie indication that the measure was probably out of proportionality. Thus it is a relatively easy case to adjudicate. However, if the amount of water resources affected by the countermeasure was in the range of 10% to 50%, the issue of proportionality would be in the grey area.\n## 2. The Benchmark for the Proportionality test\nThe benchmark for the proportionality test is also a controversial issue. The Draft Articles on Responsibility of States set injury as the benchmark for evaluating proportionality, allowing the injured State to retaliate against the injuring State with an equivalent damage, and thus forcing the injuring State to cease the infringement. This is not fundamentally different from the private retaliation of \"an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.\" It may lead to countermeasure going beyond what is strictly necessary for its very purpose and become punitive in nature. Therefore, there are inherent contradictions in the regime on countermeasures as set out by the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States. This benchmark works well only among States with comparable strength. On the other hand, if there is a significant gap in strength between the countries involved,\n See the Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project (Hungary/Slovakia), Judgment, ICJ Reports 1997.\n In the judgment, the ICJ adopted a two-step approach. First, the Court found that Hungary violated the treaty concluded by both parties, which constituted an internationally wrongful act. Secondly, the Court discussed whether Slovakia's acts constituted countermeasures, one of the most important factor of which was the principle of proportionality. *Id.*, at para. 82.\n *Id.*, at paras. 85–86.\n See Nigel White &amp; Ademola Abass, *Countermeasures and Sanctions*, in Malcolm Evans ed., International Law, at 513 (Cambridge University Press 2018).\nWuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers\ncountermeasure as under the current proportionality test may be abused by those powerful States as an excuse to bully the weak ones.\nIn recent years, some scholars proposed a functional approach towards the proportionality test, arguing that the purpose to be achieved d by countermeasures shall be used as the benchmark. Countermeasures are instrumental, and their purposes are to force the injuring State to cease its wrongful act and to comply with its international obligations, so that the relations between the two States can be restored. Therefore, the proportionality of countermeasures should be assessed against its purpose, irrespective of whether they exceed the intensity of the wrongful act.\nIn April 2007, Estonia suffered a three-week-long DDoS cyberattack and a large number of critical infrastructure websites, including those of government agencies, were forced to shut down, resulting in network paralysis and service disruption with severe damage. If the cyberattack could be attributed to Russia, Estonia could respond with DDoS countermeasures. In terms of the intensity, Estonia may not achieve its purpose if the countermeasures were of equivalent magnitude as that of the cyberattack because Russia's size and strength are far greater than Estonia's. Achieving the purpose of inducing Russia to cease its internationally wrongful act would likely require countermeasures that far exceed the damage caused by Russia's wrongful act. Therefore, taking the purpose of countermeasures as the benchmark is more in line with their very aim. Meanwhile, such approach taking into consideration the differences in strength of nations, prevents the abuse by stronger State, thus more fair and equitable.\nTherefore, the principle of proportionality lacks clear rules and is full of uncertainties. Its application in cyberspace is even more challenging. This is because cyberspace is interconnected and cyberattacks are dynamic and constantly changing, making it difficult and time-consuming to assess the damage caused. The injured State shall be extremely cautious when evaluating the proportionality of the countermeasures. This will not preclude the possibility for taking countermeasures in response to cyberattacks. A practical approach is to adopt cyber measures as an effective response to cyberattacks, because this type of countermeasures is of the same nature as the wrongful act and is more likely to be regarded as consistent with the principle of proportionality.\n See Enzo Cannizzaro, *The Role of Proportionality in the Law of International Countermeasure*, 12 European Journal of International Law 889 (2001).\n See Ma Chunmao, *A Review of Estonia’s Cyber Warfare*, at https://tech.sina.com.cn/i/2009-02-04/08172791102.shtml (last visited June 3, 2019).\n See Nicholas Tsagourias, *The Law Applicable to Countermeasures against Low Intensity Cyber Operations*, 14 Baltic Yearbook of International Law Online 105 (2015).\n Proportionality does not mean reciprocity. The obligation breached by countermeasures does not necessarily need to be same as the obligation breached by the responsible State, nor does the nature and means of the countermeasure.\n See Paragraph 5 of the commentary to the introductory part of Chapter II in Part Three of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States.\nThe Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law\nTraditionally cyberattacks are dealt with through a passive defense system, consisting of a firewall, intrusion detection and prevention mechanism with antivirus software as the commonly deployed technology. Under such system, only after it is attacked will the antivirus software be able to obtain the vital information and code of the virus and update its database. So that the same viruses can be detected and removed next time they appear. The inherent deficiency is that only after the virus attacks can loopholes in the system be identified and fixed. Thus the antivirus software is always behind the virus and even the most sophisticated firewall may be breached. As a result, passive defense cannot does not offer satisfactory solution to network security. Modern network security is increasingly rely on active defense through early detection of cyberattacks and deception techniques to contain and constrain the attacks. For example, sandbox and honeypot are commonly used technical methods, which in fact deliberately expose some vulnerabilities for attackers and then to obtain critical information of the attackers when they intrude the system. These techniques offers protection to the system and buys time for the injured State to examine the cyberattack and to develop appropriate countermeasures.[94] Such means do not compromise or damage the attacker's network facilities or computer systems, thus consistent with the principle of proportionality.\nMore extreme active defenses measures are even aggressive in nature, i.e., hacking back. Such technics involve hacking into the attacker's computer system, erasing the stolen data, or even planting ransomware. This type of defense involves cyber measures thus similar to cyberattacks in nature. However, this does not necessarily mean such measures fulfill the proportionality test because equivalence in nature is only one of the factors considered in the evaluation of proportionality. In practice, it is still necessary to consider other factors of the proportionality test and keeping cyber countermeasures within the reasonable limits allowed by international law.\nIn summary, the application of the principle proportionality is controversial and challenging. The Draft Articles on Responsibility of States fails to provide clear guidance, but only lists the factors to be considered. Furthermore, the benchmark against which proportionality is assessed against is not without controversy. Considerable uncertainties remain with regard to the application of countermeasures in cyberspace. A practical and effective approach is to adopt cyber countermeasures in response to cyberattacks and ensure the impact of such measures are within a reasonable limit.\n# VI. Conclusion\nThe fundamental aim of international law on the countermeasure is to limit it to a reasonable extent and prevent such measures being abused leading to the escalation of disputes. However, the boundaries of countermeasures permitted by international law remains unsettled. During the\n[94] If the attacker took advantage of the vulnerabilities of the honeypot to launch a cyberattack against a third country, the State that set up the honeypot may be found violating its due diligence obligations.\nWuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers\ndrafting process of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States, every rule on countermeasures had been a matter of controversy. Major differences among States on this issue were also highlighted at the 2017 Session of the UNGGE, where disagreements led to the absence of a consensus report and the breakdown of negotiations. The function and mission of the UNGGE is not to create or modify the rules of international law in cyberspace, but to discuss how international law is applied. Thus despite the failure of the negotiation process of the UNGGE, international law, including rules on countermeasures, is still applicable to cyberspace. This basic position has been confirmed by the International Group of Experts in its 2015 report.\nCompared with the traditional physical space of State sovereignty, cyberspace as a relatively new domain has its own unique features, creating new issues to the application of countermeasures. Current international law on the countermeasure as articulated in the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States, imposing stringent conditions to prevent its abuse, are ill-equipped to deal with cyberattacks. It adopts the basic position that countermeasure is illegal per se, to discourage its usage in practice. The prerequisites for taking countermeasures is the existence of internationally wrongful acts; in cyberspace the attribution of cyberattacks to States is challenging. In addition, the procedural requirements for taking countermeasure are impractical in cyberspace and the proportionality test is highly subjective and unpredictable. These facts have greatly diminished the effectiveness and certainty of the application of countermeasures in cyberspace. This is one of the major reason why there are few cases where state invoked countermeasures. Therefore, current international law does not offer clear rules and guidance on how to apply countermeasures in cyberspace. The international law regime on this issue is still at the early stage of development and is still evolving.\n(Translators: Meng Chao &amp; Wang Yi)"

Attribution of cyberattacks to the state is difficult. Though the doctrine of due diligence has the potential to addresses this problem by lowering the threshold of attribution, it may unduly expand the scope of State responsibility. In addition, the procedural requirements for takings countermeasures are impractical in cyberspace. The substantive requirement of proportionality is of fundamental importance, but lacks clear and workable benchmark. Therefore, application of countermeasures in cyberspace is fraught with uncertainties and international law on this issue remains unsettled.\nKeywords: cyberattack; countermeasures; attribution; principle of proportionality; due diligence\n# I. Introduction\nIn recent years, cyberattacks have become more frequent. How to respond to cyberattacks and maintain cyber security has become an issue with significant strategic and practical implications that needs to be addressed urgently in the international community. Under international law, the injured State enjoys the right of self-defense against internationally wrongful acts that have reached the level of armed attack.¹ However, in practice, most cyberattacks do not reach the required threshold of use of force, letting alone an armed attack.² Taking the 2010 “Stuxnet” Incident for example, the prevailing view was that the cyberattacks did not constitute an armed attack in international law, notwithstanding that the virus had led to the damage of thousands of Iranian uranium enrichment centrifuges. Therefore, in most cases, a State is not able to exercise its right to self-defense against a cyberattack.³\n* ZHU Lei (朱磊), Ph.D. in Law, associate professor at the Wuhan University Institute of International Law in China.\n¹ Armed attacks are the most serious type of use of force, according to the International Court of Justice’s opinion in the Nicaragua case. See Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), Judgement, ICJ Reports 1986, para.191.\n² See Michael N. Schmitt ed., Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations, at 538–531 (2nd edition, Cambridge University Press 2017). The book propose eight factors for assessing whether a cyberattack constitutes the use of force, including, severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability of effects, military character, state involvement and presumptive legality.\n³ See Robin Geiss &amp; Henning Lahmann, Freedom and Security in Cyberspace: Shifting the Focus Away from Military Responses towards Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention, in Katharina Ziolkowski ed., Peacetime Regime for State Activities in Cyberspace: International Law, International Relations and Diplomacy, at 628 (NATO CCDCOE Publication 2013).\nWuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers\nIn response to these cyberattacks which do not rise to the level of an armed attack, States tend to respond in a non-forceful and peaceful manner in practice. For example, in January 2015, the United States (\"USA\") imposed economic sanctions on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea as a response to the cyberattack on Sony Pictures Entertainment.⁴ In response to the allegation that Russia had interfered in the United States' General Election through cyberattacks, the USA announced the expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats in December 2016.⁵\nCyberspace is considered as the new frontier of national sovereignty and international law is applicable in this area.⁶ The legal nature and status of the actions taken by the injured State in response to cyberattacks under international law is an issue that deserves serious consideration, in which the central issue involved is that of countermeasures. Similar to the right of self-defense, it allows a State to take its own measures of private remedies against an internationally wrongful act. Where certain conditions are met, it can preclude the wrongfulness of those measures and thereby relieve the responsibility of the State.\nThe countermeasure as a customary international law with a long history is controversial in international law. Its application to cyberspace is even more challenging because as an emerging field of science and technology, cyberspace has characteristics different from those areas of traditional State sovereignty. This paper analyzes how countermeasures in international law are applied to cyberspace in light of the characteristics of cyberspace, and examines the main issues and controversies in the application of countermeasures to cyberspace.\n## II. The Historical Development and Inherent Contradictories of Countermeasures\n## 1. Historical Development of Countermeasures\nThe term \"countermeasure\" was first used by the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office of the United Kingdom in 1916 in its correspondences with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Sweden.⁷ And the first detailed discussion on countermeasures was in the *Air Services Agreement* arbitration case in 1978.⁸ In this case, the USA made its claim based on countermeasures, which\n⁴ See Zhuang Xiaodan, *Revenge for Sony Pictures? US Launches New Round of Sanctions against North Korea*, at https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_1290937 (last visited June 3, 2023).\n⁵ See Lu Jiafei &amp; Xu Jianmei, *U.S. Announces Sanctions against Russia for Alleged Cyberattacks to Interfere in U.S. Election*, at https://world.huanqiu.com/article/9CaKrnJZtjV (last visited June 3, 2019).\n⁶ UN Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (\"UNGGE\"), the main platform and mechanism for official intergovernmental dialogue on international law in cyberspace, acknowledged in its 2013 report that international law applies in cyberspace. See UN, A/68/98.\n⁷ See Omer Yousif Elagab, *The Place of Non-Forcible Counter-Measures in Contemporary International Law*, in Guy S. Goodwin-Gill &amp; Stefan Talmon eds., *The Reality of International Law: Essays in Honour of Ian Brownlie*, at 125 (Oxford University Press 1999).\n⁸ See the *Air Service Agreement* of 27 March 1946 between the United States of America and France (1978) 18 RIAA 417.\nThe Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law\nwas upheld by the Arbitral Tribunal.⁹ The term was widely used after the Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (“Draft Articles on Responsibility of States”), adopted by the International Law Commission of the United Nations (“UNILC”) in 2001, which used the term and contained detailed rules on countermeasures in seven articles.¹⁰\nThe historical root of countermeasures is found in the traditional international law concept of reprisals,¹¹ which is essentially a mechanism of private remedy. The concept of “countermeasures” is used as a synonym for “reprisals” and inherits the key elements of the latter. The institution of reprisals in international law has a long history and its development can be divided into three stages.\nThe first stage was a completely liberal private reprisal, which was common in the early stage of the development of the rule of law, during which the State apparatus was not yet in place and public enforcement mechanisms for the law were missing. Where the rights of individuals were violated without remedy from public power, they could take it upon themselves to enforce the law and take reprisals as a means of obtaining the relief. In ancient Greece, the customary law of seizing foreigners existed in the city-states of Athens. Where a citizen of a city-state was killed by a foreigner or the government, the relatives of the victim enjoyed the right to capture and detain three citizens of that foreign state as hostages and demand that the perpetrator be presented or compensated. Where the claim was not met, the victim’s relatives would enjoy the right to kill the hostages to pay back the blood debt.¹²\nThe second stage was the reprisal authorized by the State, essentially to incorporate reprisal into the framework of State regulation. The letter of reprisal¹³ offers a good example. It has its roots in Roman law.¹⁴ In ancient Rome, public authorities became involved in the system of reprisals and regulated it strictly. If the rights of a Roman citizen (especially a merchant) were violated by an alien, the victim could seize the citizen of that State to retaliate with procedural and substantive restrictions. Before the reprisal could be carried out, the victim must apply to the relevant State authority for a permit to do so. The precondition of obtaining the permit is that the victim had been treated unfairly by the courts of a foreign State and that his or her damages could not be compensated and his or her rights could not be remedied. The scope must be limited to the actual damage suffered by the victim and the seizure by force can be carried out only within the Roman territory or on international waters.¹⁵\n⁹ Omer Yousif Elagab, supra note 7, at 125–126.\n¹⁰ The International Court of Justice referred to the term twice in 1980 in the United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran case, and several times in the Nicaragua case in 1986.\n¹¹ See Malcolm N. Shaw, International Law 794 (Cambridge University Press 2008).\n¹² See David J. Bederman, International Law in Antiquity, at 123 (Cambridge University Press 2007).\n¹³ Letter of reprisal is also known as letter of marquee.\n¹⁴ Its modern formulation can be found in the Constitution of the United States of America, which in Section 8 of Article 1 authorizes the Congress to grant letters of marque and reprisal.\n¹⁵ See Wilhelm G. Grewe, The Epochs of International Law, at 117 (De Gruyter 2000).\nWuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers\nDuring the medieval period, reprisals centered on the letter of marquee, whereby armed privateers, with government concession, may chase and destroy foreign lawbreakers and fleets, as well as attack and plunder enemy merchant ships. By the 16th Century, wartime plundering became quite widespread and many States began to legislate and regulate the granting of such letters. Hugo Grotius in his book (1604), *De Jure Praedae*, legally defended the act of Dutch ships attacking Portuguese and Spanish ships. He argued that the granting of permit was akin to declaring a “private war,” justified by the fact that the laws of each State had no effective jurisdiction over the seas and that merchant ships had to arm themselves in self-defense.^^\nThe third stage was to prohibit the use of forcible reprisal. Traditional reprisal includes both forcible and non-forcible means, the majority of which is forcible. In the early 20th Century, the international community restricted the use of force through a series of conventions. Modern international law prohibits the use of force and the Charter of the United Nations explicitly prohibits the use of force and the threat of force. As a result, forcible reprisal eventually receded from the stage of history. Accordingly, the term “countermeasures,” also known as “non-forcible reprisal,” was adopted to conform to the development of modern international law, which corresponded to reprisals by non-forcible means. In this way, the term can distinguish itself from reprisals by force and avoid the negative connotations associated with the concept of reprisals in traditional international law.^^\n## 2. The Inherent Contradictories of Countermeasures\nA review of the historical development reveals its inherent tensions and contradictories, which is also the core issue to be addressed in contemporary international law. On the one hand, the existence of countermeasures is justified. In the absence of adequate public enforcement mechanisms when the rule of law is weak, reprisal offers a workable and efficient private solution. In domestic law, with the development of the rule of law, private enforcement of the law was increasingly limited and ultimately superseded by public enforcement of the law. By contrast, international law is based on the principle of sovereign equality and the international community is an egalitarian society. International law has an inherent flaw in that it lacks a centralized enforcement mechanism with enforcement authority that overrides the State, resulting in inadequate supply of public remedies. Therefore, it is necessary to have countermeasures as a form of private national remedies.\nThe essence of countermeasures, on the other hand, is to leave law enforcement in private hands, which could be harmful and even dangerous. Without any constraints, reprisal is highly vulnerable to abuse, plunging the international law into law of the jungle. Though the medieval letter of marquee was under the State’s regulation, it was often no different than piracy in practice. Bartolus de Saxoferrato (1314-1357), a famous European medieval jurist, wrote in a work published in\n^ See Hugo Grotius, *Commentary on the Law of Prize and Booty*, at 62 (Liberty Fund 2012).\n^ See Mary Ellen O’Connell, *The Power and Purpose of International Law: Insights from the Theory and Practice of Enforcement*, at 233 (Oxford University Press 2011).\nThe Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law\n1354 that reprisal was an “odious remedy” that could result in counter-retaliation, intensifying conflicts between the two nations, and sabotage their interactions as well as their economic and trade relations.¹⁸ He, therefore, pushed for tight restrictions on reprisals.\nBut, how can the balance between the reasonableness and the harm of countermeasures be achieved? This is the most difficult and contentious issue in the modern international law regime on countermeasures, which is also evident in the drafting process of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States. Although the majority of States recognized the necessity of countermeasures, many expressed concerns about the harmfulness of countermeasures. Therefore, in order to prevent the abuse of countermeasures, the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States adopted the principle of “conditional lawfulness” for countermeasures and set strict requirements for their implementation, in an attempt to prevent such measures from becoming tools for strong States to oppress weak States. Only countermeasures that have met these conditions are lawful; otherwise, they would be considered as internationally wrongful acts.\nThe rules established in the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States are the authoritative expression of modern international law on countermeasures, but they are also highly contentious. The fundamental disagreement during the development of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States was over the legal status of countermeasures, especially whether they are lawful or unlawful in nature. Representatives of some States took a positive attitude towards countermeasures, proposing that countermeasures are lawful in themselves, which are the rights enjoyed by States in international law, and are unlawful only under certain exceptional circumstances. However, this view was not supported by the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States which regarded countermeasures as unlawful *per se*.¹⁹ Countermeasures are internationally wrongful act that are in breach of internationally law, with the possibility of excluding the international wrongfulness of the act under certain circumstances. Therefore, countermeasures involve a situation excluding the wrongfulness of the act and may be invoked a defense to the accusation of internationally wrongful act. This fundamental stance taken by the UNILC is to discourage rather than promote the use of countermeasures.\nIn summary, countermeasures are the private enforcement of the law and have certain negative consequences. The historical development of countermeasures is a process of introducing more restrictions on its use and to bring it under the regulation of the law. In the meanwhile, international community is egalitarian in nature, which provides the solid foundation for its existence as an accepted form of enforcement under customary international law. Setting clear requirements for their use, mitigating their harmfulness, and limiting their application within an acceptable boundary are the key purpose for modern international law regime on countermeasures.\n¹⁸ Wilhelm G. Grewe, *supra* note 15, at 117.\n¹⁹ This basic principle is also reflected in Tallinn Manual 2.0 on International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations. See Michael N. Schmitt, *supra* note 2, at 225.\nWuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers\n## III. Prerequisites for Taking Countermeasures in Cyberspace: Internationally Wrongful Acts in Cyberspace\n## 1. Temporal Limitation of Countermeasures\nThe existence of an internationally wrongful act is a prerequisite for taking countermeasures, which is the primary reason for the exclusion of its wrongfulness.²⁰ Countermeasures are similar to self-defense in this regard, which are taken in response to a prior internationally wrongful act by another State. As a result, countermeasures should be considered as the “shield” for defense rather than the “spear” for offense. The absence of an effective enforcement mechanism in international law allows the injured State to suspend its international obligations only when the other State has violated the law in the first place. In other words, the essence of countermeasures is to counteract an internationally wrongful act with an illegal act, with the goal of forcing the injuring State to resume its international obligations and restore normal relations between the two nations. Therefore, countermeasures are a part of the enforcement mechanism of international law, through which the injured State are able to protect its own rights and interests, thus also a mechanism of remedy in international law.\nCountermeasures must be taken against an ongoing internationally wrongful act and are not preventive or prospective. Once the wrongful act ceases, the countermeasures must also be ceased.²¹ Thus, if a cyberattack has not yet occurred or has ended, the injured State shall not take countermeasures. This rule significantly limits the possibility of an injured State to take countermeasures in response to a cyber-related wrongful act, because unlike traditional internationally wrongful acts, most cyberattacks are sudden and short-lived, leaving only a relatively limited period of time for an injured State to respond and diminishing the possibility of taking countermeasures in response to a cyberattack.\nIt is worth noting that modern cyberattacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, often requiring a large investment of manpower and resources, and their complexity and destructive power may be no less than a small-scale war.²² Complex cyberattacks take a long time from planning to actual implementation involving multiple steps such as intelligence collection, vulnerability detection, intrusion and infiltration into the network, and virus implantation. They often require coordination and cooperation of a professional and technical team. The time span of cyberattacks provides the opportunities and possibilities for injured State to monitor and detect cyberattacks earlier.\n---\n²⁰ See Denis Alland, *Countermeasures of General Interest*, 13 European Journal of International Law 1221 (2002).\n²¹ See Maurice Kamto, *The Time Factor in the Application of Countermeasures*, in James Crawford et al. eds., *The Law of International Responsibility*, at 1176 (Oxford University Press 2010).\n²² See Jiang Shibo, *Cyber Attacks and the Application of the Laws of War*, 16(2) Wuhan University International Law Review 43–70 (2014).\nThe Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law\nThe cyberattack on the Ukrainian power grid on 23 December 2015 offers a good illustration. The cyberattack began in the spring of 2014, when the attackers first spear-phished IT staff and system administrators, causing viruses to infect systems and opening backdoors for subsequent cyberattacks. Over the following months, the attackers conducted extensive network reconnaissance, exploration and mapping efforts and gained the ability to manage user accounts within the network and employee login credentials. The final step of the cyberattack consisted of a series of coordinated actions, including reconfiguring the uninterruptible power supply, disconnecting the circuit breaker to take the substation offline, and launching a denial-of-service attack on the customer call center.\nIn order to deal with sophisticated cyberattacks, the injured State should develop and improve its capabilities of cyber-related technology, strengthen real-time supervision over cyberattacks, detect ongoing cyberattacks at an early stage, and fix vulnerabilities of the system and strengthen measures for cyber prevention and defense. If the cyberattack is still at such an early stage as the planning, vulnerability detection and intelligence gathering, the injured State should exercise restraint and should not take countermeasures; otherwise, it may cause miscalculation and lead to the escalation of disputes. Once a cyberattack enters the next stage of implementation, such as planting viruses and stealing account information, etc., it constitutes an internationally wrongful act in violation of international law, at which time the injured State may take countermeasures against the act without waiting for the final stage of the cyberattack to unfold.\n## 2. Attribution of Internationally Wrongful Acts\nUnder international law, countermeasures are measures taken by a state against another state, which carries two important implications. Although enterprises are frequently subject to cyberattacks, the measures taken by enterprises in response to cyberattacks do not constitute the countermeasures under international law. Second, the object of countermeasures must be the State rather than non-State actors. In reality, there are very few inter-State cyberattacks, and most of such attacks are initiated by private non-State actors (e.g., patriotic hackers and lone wolves). The first issue to be addressed in determining whether there is an internationally wrongful act is the attribution of cyberattacks, i.e., whether privately committed acts can be attributed to the State and constitute acts of the State. If a cyberattack committed by a non-State actor is not attributed to the State, it\n See Kim Zetter, Inside the Cunning, Unprecedented Hack of Ukraine’s Power Grid, at https://www.wired.com/2016/03/inside-cunning-unprecedented-hack-ukraines-power-grid/ (last visited June 3, 2023).\n The 2017 Annual Internet Security Report released by Tencent Security pointed out that up to 86% of companies worldwide had experienced at least one cyberattack in 2017. Tencent’s 2017 Annual Internet Security Report: Nearly 90% of Global Companies Suffered Cyber Attacks, at http://tech.chinadaily.com.cn/2018-01/31/content_35621606.htm (last visited June 3, 2019).\n See Michael N. Schmitt, Below the Threshold Cyber Operations: The Counter-Measures Response Option and International Law, 54 Virginia Journal of International Law 697 (2014).\n See Michael N. Schmitt, In Defense of Due Diligence in Cyberspace, 125 Yale Law Journal Forum 77 (2015).\n See Tom Ruys, Sanctions, Retorsions and Countermeasures: Concepts and International Legal Framework, in Larissa van den Herik ed., Research Handbook on UN Sanctions and International Law, at 14 (Edward Elgar Publishing 2016).\nWuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers\nmay constitute a violation of domestic law, but not an internationally wrongful act in violation of international law, and the injured State cannot take countermeasures against such acts.²⁸\nAttribution is an extremely challenging issue in identifying State responsibility in cyberspace, involving three layers of attribution. First, from the technical perspective, unlike traditional physical domains such as sea, land and air, the cyberspace is a decentralized system. Cyberspace is open, pluralistic, interoperable, and anonymous, and attackers often use encryption technology to transmit information in packets to hide their identities and sources, making the investigation of the source of cyberattacks quite complex, costly and protracted.²⁹\nSecond, after locating the source of cyberattacks through technical means, the subject behind the cyberattacks also needs to be identified. Even if the IP address is traced to a State's cyber infrastructure, it may not meet the criteria of burden of proof for attribution because IP addresses can be spoofed. For example, in 2013, an organization impersonating its IP address as from the Ukrainian government conducted cyber operations against the NATO Cyber Cooperative Defense Center of Excellence, the Estonian Defense Forces, and the armed forces of other NATO countries. Clearly, the conduct could not be attributed to the Ukrainian government.³⁰\nFinally, it remains to determine whether the act committed by the attackers constitutes the act of a State, i.e., legal attribution. The key issue is whether cyberattacks committed by non-State actors can be attributed to the State and constitute internationally wrongful acts that entails State responsibility. The challenge is degree of connection required for attribution to the State the cyberattacks committed by non-State actors. Under Article 8 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States, the conduct of non-State actors acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of a State is attributable to that State. The International Court of Justice (\"ICJ\") established the doctrine of \"effective control\" in the Nicaragua case in 1987. In that case, the USA played a significant and decisive role in financing, organizing, training, supplying, and equipping the Nicaraguan Contras, but the ICJ found that the series of U.S. acts did not constitute \"effective control\"³¹ and thus could not meet the standard of attribution.\nThe doctrine of effective control requires the State play a direct and a leading role in the cyberattacks, not just a supporting one, setting a higher threshold for State responsibility for private conduct. For example, the USA believed that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea played a \"central role\" in the 2014 cyberattack on Sony Pictures, which rose to the level of effective control and imposed\n²⁸ See Michael N. Schmitt, *Peacetime Cyber Responses and Wartime Cyber Operations under International Law: An Analytical Vade Mecum*, 8 Harvard National Security Journal 260 (2017).\n²⁹ See Huang Zhixiong ed., *On Cyber Sovereignty—Jurisprudence, Policy and Practice*, at 39 (Social Sciences Academic Press 2017).\n³⁰ See Michael N. Schmitt, *supra* note 2, at 203.\n³¹ *Supra* note 1, at para. 115.\nThe Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law\nsanctions against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.³² In contrast, Iranian hackers conducted DDoS cyberattacks against a number of U.S. financial institutions between 2011 and 2013. Although these hackers had ties to the Iranian government, such ties did not rise to the level of effective control and therefore the attacks could not be attributed to Iran and the USA could not take countermeasures against Iran accordingly.³³\nThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 on International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations (“Tallinn Manual 2.0”) adopts the ICJ’s standard of effective control. It gives the following illustrative example. A State plans and oversees an operation to use a software update to implant a new vulnerability in software widely used by another state in its governmental computers. The former State enters into a confidential contract with the company that produced the software to embed the vulnerability and directs the course of action. In such a case the State planned, directed, and supervised over a particular cyberattack and took a leading and direct role in the operation, which is fundamentally different from the ancillary role played by the US government in the Nicaragua case and thus the company’s conduct is attributable to the State.³⁴\nThe doctrine of effective control adopts a relatively stringent criterion of attribution, which makes it difficult for the injured State to prove, thus severely limiting the application of countermeasures. In practice, the injuring State may not directly organize the implementation of cyberattacks, but indirectly support cyberattacks as a way to avoid State responsibility. Moreover, cyberattacks are secretive and complex, and attackers often use technical means to hide the source of the attack, so it is not easy to obtain conclusive evidence to prove the extent of State involvement in such cyberattacks and the role played by the State. And such evidence is often located in the injuring State or even across the globe, which is difficult to obtain and even if obtained, the timing for taking countermeasures may has already elapsed.³⁵ For example, Estonia was subjected to a DDoS attack in 2007 and investigation revealed that the source of the attack was computers from 178 countries, including Vietnam and the USA. The cyberattack lasted for three weeks, providing a valuable time for evidence collection and attribution. However, to date, there is still no conclusive evidence of to attribute the responsibility to Russia.³⁶\nIn summary, the rules on attribution in international law are established for traditional internationally wrongful acts and thus are difficult to apply to cyberspace. It has the effect of greatly limiting the possibility of taking countermeasures in cyberspace. Some scholars argued that the constraints of existing customary law should be lifted and States should be allowed to take countermeasures\n³² Zhuang Xiaodan, supra note 4.\n³³ See BBC: US Indicts 7 Iranian Hackers for Breaching Multiple Financial Firms, at https://news.youth.cn/gj/201603/t20160325_7779822.htm (last visited June 3, 2019).\n³⁴ See Michael N.

Due Diligence\nTo address the difficulty of attribution under the doctrine of effective control, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 introduces due diligence into cyberspace, proposing that a State must exercise due diligence in not allowing its territory, or territory or cyber infrastructure under its governmental control, to be used for cyber operations that affect the rights of, and produce serious adverse consequences for, other States.³⁸ This lowers the criterion of attribution required by the doctrine of effective control and reduces the threshold of State responsibility for acts of private subjects, essentially as a type of vicarious liability.³⁹ This is an important development and breakthrough compared to the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (Tallinn Manual 1.0).\nThe ICJ has affirmed the doctrine of due diligence in the Corfu Channel case,⁴⁰ the Tehran Hostage case,⁴¹ and the Nicaragua case.⁴² For example, in the Corfu Channel case, although the mines were not laid by Albania, the area where the incident occurred was Albanian territorial waters and Albania should bear the regulatory responsibility for that area. Also, judging from the geographical location and expertise, Albania had the knowledge of the mines laid in the Corfu Channel,⁴³ but failed to take relevant measures, and therefore should bear responsibility. The ICJ stated that every State has an obligation “not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States.”⁴⁴\nUnder the doctrine of due diligence, a State must take active measures to prevent, reduce or limit the occurrence of damage, which is essentially an obligation to prevent transnational damage. The infrastructure on which cyberspace is based is physical, located in a particular State, and falls within the sovereign jurisdiction of that State, and due diligence is equally applicable. This basic position was also adopted by the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Information Security (“UNGGE”) in its report issued in 2015.⁴⁵ Therefore, if a State violates due diligence in\n³⁷ See Gary Corn &amp; Eric Talbot Jensen, *The Use of Force and Cyber Countermeasures*, 32 Temple International &amp; Comparative Law Journal 127 (2018).\n³⁸ See Michael N. Schmitt, *supra* note 2, at 128.\n³⁹ See Huang Zhixiong, *The Attribution of Cyberattacks in International Law*, 5 Global Law Review 164 (2014).\n⁴⁰ See Corfu Channel (United Kingdom v. Albania), Judgment, ICJ Reports 1949, at 22.\n⁴¹ See the United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran (United States v. Iran), Judgment, ICJ Report 1980, para. 63.\n⁴² *Supra* note 1, at para.157.\n⁴³ *Supra* note 40, at para. 65.\n⁴⁴ *Supra* note 40, at para. 67.\n⁴⁵ See UN, A/70/174.\nThe Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law\ncyberspace, it constitutes an internationally wrongful act and the injured State is entitled to take countermeasures.\nThe most controversial issue in practice is the scope of the obligation assumed by a State under the doctrine of due diligence. On this issue, two extreme positions should be avoided. If a liberal approach is adopted, i.e., a State assumes little or even no obligation, this will lead to the abuse of the principle of sovereignty, allowing the use of network facilities to infringe upon the interests of other States.\nOn the other hand, an expanded interpretation would broaden the scope of due diligence, constitute an unreasonable restriction on State sovereignty, which lacks a basis in international law. In this regard, the view of U.S. military judge Matthew J. Sklerov is quite representative. He advocated that strict criminal legislation and law enforcement could effectively prevent cyberattacks,⁴⁶ and argued that the State's obligation in cyberspace includes passing stringent criminal laws, conducting vigorous investigations, prosecuting attackers, and, during the investigation and prosecution, cooperating with the victim state of cyberattacks that originated from within their borders.⁴⁷ According to this view, knowledge of the occurrence of the damage is also not a requirement for the assumption of due diligence.⁴⁸ In other words, the State has the obligation to take active criminal action to prevent and stop illegal cyberattacks, and the State's negligence or omission in any respect constitutes tacit approval and sheltering of such attacks⁴⁹ and constitutes a violation of due diligence.\nIn practice, however, cyberattacks are often deceptive and disguised, and attackers may use the network infrastructure of other States to carry out remote attacks. Matthew J. Sklerov's view underestimated the complexity of cyberattacks in practice, which may lead to a misjudgment on state responsibility of cyberattacks. The USA, with its significant political, economic, and military position in the world, is often the target of cyberattacks, but it is difficult to hold the relevant States responsible in practice due to the problem of attribution. This view which expands the scope of due diligence attempts to lift the constraints and limitations under traditional rules of international law and to lower the threshold of State responsibility, thus enabling the USA to take countermeasures against other States more easily. Such practice should come under close scrutiny.\nThe appropriate approach on this issue is to return to the current framework of international law under which a State assumes due diligence responsibility only to the extent of knowledge on the occurrence of damage.⁵⁰ This basic principle was also endorsed in the report of the UNGGE issued in 2015, and is a commonly held position by States. Under this doctrine, knowledge may be actual\n⁴⁶ See Matthew J. Sklerov, Solving the Dilemma of State Responses to Cyberattacks: A Justification for the Use of Active Defenses against States Who Neglect Their Duty to Prevent, 201 Military Law Review 71 (2009).\n⁴⁷ Id., at 62.\n⁴⁸ Id., at 71.\n⁴⁹ Id.\n⁵⁰ Supra note 40, at para.18.\nWuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers\nor constructive. A State may be found to have actual knowledge of a cyberattack if it has detected or has been notified by the injured State of an attack originating from that country.^^ The essence of constructive knowledge is the reverse of the burden of proof. The challenge of attribution in cyberspace is evidence, and in the case of constructive knowledge the burden of proof is shifted to the territorial State where the cyberattack originated which have more evidence than the victim state. Therefore it is presumed to have knowledge of the cyberattack with the possibility of rebuttal.^^\nWith the sheer number of Internet users and the technology to hide their identities and even erase traces of Internet access, it is almost impossible to achieve complete and comprehensive regulation in cyberspace. But this does not mean that the State is unaware of cyber operations within its borders. Whether a State is aware of cyberattacks is closely related to its technical capacities and the regulatory policy it adopts in cyberspace.\nCyberspace is highly complex and technical in nature, and cyber regulation relies on the relevant cyber technical capacities which many developing countries may lack. This is an important factor that must be taken into account when assessing knowledge. Otherwise, it may unduly expand the scope of due diligence obligations. On the other hand, every State regulates cyber activities within its territory to some extent, and an absolutely free cyberspace does not exist. Title V of the Convention on Cybercrime explicitly requires contracting parties to collect and record computer data in real time, which does not only include traffic data, but also content data.\nCyber supervision and regulation is common practice among states, and the difference lies in the degree of its stringency. If a State has strict supervision over cyberspace, it is more likely to know that a cyberattack has occurred, and it can even constitute \"constructive knowledge.\" For example, in May 2013, the U.S. energy security was significantly threatened by a cyberattack on the critical control systems of energy companies and attackers were even able to manipulate the oil and gas pipelines. The U.S. officials said that although there was no conclusive evidence that the cyberattack was supported by the Iranian government, it was unlikely that the Iranian government was unaware of the attack because the Iranian government had centralized control over the cyberspace.^^ This offers a good example of the how the constructive knowledge may be applied in practice.\nIn summary, the precondition for taking countermeasures is the existence of an internationally wrongful act. What is challenging in cyberspace is how to attribute cyberattacks committed by non-State actors to the State. Under the traditional doctrine of effective control, the threshold for attribution is high and difficult to reach in cyberspace. While the doctrine of due diligence may\n^^ See Wolff Heintschel von Heinegg, *Legal Implications of Territorial Sovereignty in Cyberspace*, in Christian Czosseck *et al.* eds., 2012 4th International Conference on Cyber Conflict (NATO CCDCOE Publications, Tallin, 2012).\n^^ For example, if a government-dedicated network infrastructure is used to carry out a cyberattack, there is a presumption that the government of that State had knowledge of the cyberattack because the network was under the full control and supervision of the government.\n^^ See N. Perlroth &amp; D. Sanger, *New Computer Attacks Traced to Iran*, Officials Say, The New York Times (May 24, 2013).\nThe Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law\nstep in to solve this problem, the danger is that the scope of due diligence may be overly broad. A balanced approach is that State responsibility only limited cyberattacks to which the State has knowledge of.\n## IV. Procedural Requirements for Taking Countermeasures in Cyberspace\n## 1. The Instrumentality of Countermeasures\nIn the application of countermeasures, the determination of an internationally wrongful act is unilateral in nature. The injured State makes its own judgment as to the existence of the internationally wrongful act and the gravity of the damage caused by such act, and makes its own decision as to whether or not and what countermeasures to take.^^ For example, when the Sony Pictures Entertainment suffered a cyberattack in 2014, the U.S. Government, based on the information available to its intelligence community, believed that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea played a central role in the cyberattack, which constituted a State act. It then imposed economic sanctions on three Korean government agencies and officials.^^ In this process, the US State had three roles to play, i.e., as the victim state of a cyberattack, the adjudicator of an internationally wrongful act, and implementer of countermeasures. This leads to an obvious conflict of interest and is prone to exaggerated assessment of the severity of the damage and the necessity of countermeasures, resulting in the escalation of disputes.^^\nThe determination of an internationally wrongful act is a complex process of fact finding and application of law, which is not an easy task. There is no third-party body in the existing international law system to make an objective and neutral determination on the existence of an internationally wrongful act. In other words, countermeasures are taken on the basis of a one-sided claim of injured State and there is a possibility of abuse in practice. Some States may fabricate the existence of an internationally wrongful act and accuse another State of committing such act. Countermeasures may be used as a justification for the State to take measures such as sanctions, thus becoming a tool for strong countries to bully the weak. This is the greatest danger in the application of countermeasures in cyberspace, a cause for concern for developing countries in particular. Therefore, at the 2017 session of the UNGGE, developing countries, represented by Cuba, opposed the application of the right to self-defense and countermeasures to cyberspace.^^\n^^ Mary Ellen O’Connell, *supra* note 17, at 230.\n^^ See Li Liangyong, *U.S. Sanctions North Korea over Sony “Hack,” No Response from North Korea*, at http://www.xinhuanet.com/world/2015-01/04/c_127354664.htm (last visited June 3, 2023).\n^^ See N. Jansen Calamita, *Sanctions, Countermeasures, and the Iranian Nuclear Issue*, 42 Vanderbilt Journal of Transnational Law 1420 (2009).\n^^ See Anders Henriksen, *The End of the Road for the UNGGE Process: The Future Regulation of Cyberspace*, 5 Journal of Cybersecurity 1 (2019).\nWuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers\nIn order to prevent countermeasures from being abused and leading to the escalation of disputes, and to ensure that they are taken only when they are necessary to achieve their purpose, Article 52 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States set out a series of stringent procedural requirements for countermeasures. Countermeasures, which are instrumental in nature, are intended to induce the responsible State to cease its violations, to comply with and fulfill its international obligations again and to restore lawful relations between the two States. But, countermeasures are not the only way to achieve such end. The fundamental principle of peaceful settlement of international disputes is well established in modern international law and Article 33 of the UN Charter provides a list of pacific methods, which shall be given priority in international dispute settlement. In contrast, countermeasures are exceptional in nature and shall be taken only as the last resort. The injured State should first seek to resolve the disputes through the usual dispute settlement methods contained in Article 33 of the UN Charter, rather than through countermeasures.\nThe victim State shall invoke State responsibility against the injuring State in the first instance. Countermeasures shall not be taken if the injuring State has ceased the wrongful act and undertaken to pay compensation. Second, the injured State should also comply with its obligation to notify in advance and to seek a negotiated settlement of the dispute; this is the second procedural requirement for the taking of countermeasures. In this process, the case of state responsibility is presented to the injuring State and to put some pressure on it to cooperate, thus giving the injuring State a second chance. Finally, an injured State may not take countermeasures when a dispute has already been submitted to a dispute settlement mechanism.\nThese procedural requirements for countermeasures apply equally in the cyberspace. In particular, the last two procedural requirements are controversial which triggered intense debate in the course of formulating the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States. Their application in cyberspace is even more challenging, which will be discussed below.\n## 2. Notification and Seeking to Settle Disputes through Negotiations\nIn order to prevent escalation of a dispute, the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States provides that the injured State should notify the responsible State of any decision to take countermeasures\nThe Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law\nand offer to negotiate with that State.⁶³ In practice, notification and negotiation are not two separate steps. The purpose of notification is to give the injuring State an opportunity to respond. If the injuring State does so, it constitutes the start of negotiations between the Parties.⁶⁴ In cyberspace, notification is necessary because cyberattacks are often covert. Notification gives the responsible State an opportunity for clarification and prevents misjudgment and the escalation of disputes.\nHowever, the obligation to notify as a procedural requirement in cyberspace faces a number of challenges. First, it is not supported by current state practice. When a State take measures to respond to an internationally wrongful act, usually it does not invoke countermeasure as a justification. Even the issue is subject to a dispute settlement procedure, the victim State usually argues that its act complies with international law in the first instance. Countermeasures come into play only when the act is found to be internationally wrongful, i.e., as a defense and exemption from state responsibility.⁶⁵ Therefore, although there are a large number of cases in which countermeasures have been taken to respond to internationally wrongful acts, the number of cases in which countermeasures are invoked are very limited in practice. For example, the U.S. Government expelled Russian diplomatic officials in response to alleged Russia’s interference with the U.S. general election through cyberattacks in 2016, but it did not explicitly mention countermeasure as its legal basis.⁶⁶\nSecond, obligation to notify in cyberspace may be impractical. This is because the tracing the source of cyberattacks is complex and challenging. In practice, it is often difficult to identify who the attacker is and where it is originated, rendering notification being impossible. Furthermore, prior notification is likely to diminish the effectiveness of countermeasures in cyberspace.⁶⁷ This is particularly the case if countermeasures are taken through cyber means. Once the injuring State becomes aware of the countermeasures, the cyber tools can be captured and reused. Moreover, an injuring State, having been notified of countermeasures, may temporarily suspend cyberattacks as a means of avoiding such measures, because countermeasures shall cease as well in such situation. Therefore, prior notification may render countermeasures meaningless and ineffective.\nThe obligation to notify is not absolute and the injured State may take such urgent countermeasures as necessary.⁶⁸ This is also recognized by The Tallinn Manual 2.0 which points out that urgent\n⁶³ A small number of experts argued that negotiation is also one of the prior procedural requirement for taking countermeasures. The majority of experts did not agree and were in the opinion that this may be an excuse for the responsible State to stall for time. See Michael N. Schmitt, supra note 2, at 152.\n⁶⁴ Mary Ellen O’Connell, supra note 17, at 259.\n⁶⁵ For example, in the Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project case, Slovakia did not claim that its actions constitute countermeasures, instead revoked other grounds as justification. The application of countermeasures arose only after its claims had not been upheld and its actions were found internationally wrongful. See the Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project (Hungary/Slovakia), Judgment, ICJ Reports 1997, para. 82.\n⁶⁶ Lu Jiafei &amp; Xu Jianmei, supra note 5.\n⁶⁷ Gary Corn &amp; Eric Talbot Jensen, supra note 37.\n⁶⁸ See Article 52 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States.\nWuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers\ncountermeasures are highly likely in cyberspace. Cyberattacks are often both unpredictable and can spread rapidly over a short period of time, even capable of significantly impairing critical infrastructure.⁶⁹ Thus any delay in time may cause unknown and even irreparable damage. In such circumstances, the victim State may take urgent countermeasures without prior notification to the injuring State. For example, a State is being attacked by a serious internationally wrongful cyber operation. The injured State intends to respond by blocking all electronic access to the bank accounts of the responsible State. If the responsible State is notified of that intention, it will have the opportunity to transfer the assets out of the country, effectively depriving the injured State of the possibility of taking such countermeasure.⁷⁰ Therefore, urgent countermeasure is of significant practical implications as they may be used more widely in cyberspace.\n## 3. Dispute Settlement Mechanisms\nInternational laws provide for dispute settlement mechanisms capable of rendering a binding decision on a dispute, thus offering relief to the injured State. This would undermine the very underlying reason that justify countermeasure, i.e., international law lacks a centralized enforcement mechanism. In addition, such mechanisms may reach a final resolution of the disputes between the states. By contrast, countermeasures are temporary in nature and cannot solve the dispute definitively, and the dispute may eventually be submitted to dispute settlement procedures. Thus the countermeasure is a less favored means of dispute resolution.\nThe relationship between countermeasures and dispute settlement mechanisms was one of the most controversial issues in the formulation of Draft Articles on Responsibility of States. The special rapporteur, Gaetano Arangio Ruiz, advocated the idea that the injured State is obliged to submit the dispute to the dispute settlement procedure before resorting to countermeasures, which is also reflected in the text he drafted.⁷¹ However, this view was not supported by States. The final text provides, in Article 52(3), that Countermeasures may not be taken, and if already taken must be suspended without undue delay if the dispute is pending before a court or tribunal which has the authority to make decisions binding on the parties.⁷²\nIn the process of formulating the Tallinn Manual 2.0, the majority of the International Group of Experts adopted the position of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States. However, the application of the rule was not without controversy. Members of the International Group of Experts were divided on whether or not such obligation is absolute. Some experts held the opinion that such\n⁶⁹ See Katharine C. Hinkle, Countermeasures in the Cyber Context: One More Thing to Worry about, 37 Yale Journal of International Law Online 11 (2011).\n⁷⁰ See Michael N. Schmitt, supra note 2, at 234–235.\n⁷¹ Mary Ellen O’Connell, supra note 17, at 258.\n⁷² The phrase “court or tribunal” refers to any third-party dispute settlement procedure, whatever its designation. The court or tribunal must have the power to order interim measures that are capable of protecting the purportedly injured State. See Michael N. Schmitt, supra note 2, at 235.\nThe Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law\na dispute settlement mechanism is mandatory if it is explicitly required by international law. On the other hand, a minority of the experts argued that, rather than creating an absolute obligation, a case-by-case analysis should be undertaken to evaluate whether a third-party dispute settlement body had sufficient capacities to protect the rights of the injured State thus providing an effective alternative to countermeasures.^^\nIt is submitted that dispute settlement mechanisms do not exclude countermeasures and resort to dispute settlement procedure is not a prerequisite procedural requirement for the taking of countermeasures. Under current international law, dispute settlement mechanisms are not substitute for countermeasures and provisional and urgent countermeasures are allowed even after a dispute has been submitted to a mandatory dispute settlement mechanism.^^ This is particularly the case in cyberspace. Damage caused by cyberattacks could spread rapidly in a short period of time, sometimes even beyond the control of the attackers, which traditional dispute settlement mechanisms of international law may be ill-equipped to address.^^ Therefore, countermeasures may be excluded only if treaties between the states involved contain technical defensive measures that are effective in induce the responsible State to comply with its international obligations and to prevent further damage, thus able to provide the victim State appropriate mechanism for remedy. Otherwise, the taking of countermeasures should not be precluded in cyberspace, even if the dispute is subject to a dispute settlement process.\n## V. Substantive Requirement for Taking Countermeasures in Cyberspace: The Principle of Proportionality\nCountermeasures taken by the injured State must comply with the principle of proportionality. If the countermeasures exceed the reasonable boundary set by the proportionality test, they will be punitive and retaliatory in nature and will no longer be legitimate under international law but rather an internationally wrongful act.^^ Article 51 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States provides that countermeasures must be commensurate with the injury suffered. Under the proportionality test, countermeasures are assessed against the injuries suffered, not only in purely “quantitative” terms but also “qualitative” factors. This proportionality is equally applicable to countermeasures in cyberspace, which was clearly confirmed in the report published by the UNGGE in 2015.^^\n^^ *Id.*, at 235.\n^^ *Id.*, at 236.\n^^ Trojans can have multiple variants as they spread.

Cases Applying the Principle of Proportionality\nAssessing the proportionality of a countermeasure is not only controversial$^{78}$ but also challenging.$^{79}$ The principle of proportionality is concerned with the intensity of countermeasures, aiming to establish a benchmark for countermeasures and restrict them within a reasonable limit. Such test essentially is matter of degree and the outcome of applying the principle of proportionality is unpredictable. The International Law Commission points out explicitly that what is proportionate is not a matter which can be determined precisely and can at best be accomplished by approximation.$^{80}$ The Draft Articles on Responsibility of States does not set out any specific rules on the application of the proportionality test, but only provide the factors to be considered: (1) the extent of the injury suffered; (2) the gravity of the internationally wrongful act; (3) the rights of the injured and responsible State (and interests of other States) that are affected; and (4) the necessity of inducing the responsible State to fulfill its obligations.$^{81}$ This exercise involves value judgment and balancing of interests, thus subjective in nature. Moreover, the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States does not articulate the hierarchy of these factors elements. Therefore, there is still no clear guidance on the application of the principle of proportionality, lacking much-needed predictability and certainty.\nThere are very few cases concerning the proportionality of countermeasures in current international law, among which the only successful one is the Air Service Agreement arbitration case in 1978.$^{82}$ In 1946, France and the USA signed a bilateral agreement to open international air routes between the two States. Disputes arose between the two countries when France refused to allow a change of gauge in London by American flights. As a countermeasure, the USA planned to suspend some flights from Paris to the U.S. In its award, the arbitral tribunal did not make a quantitative analysis of the damage caused by the French wrongful act and the impact of the American countermeasure, but rather a qualitative analysis of the impact of the French illegal act. The key factor considered by the Tribunal was the importance of legal principles involved to the USA, and especially its impact on American aviation policy.$^{83}$ Since the 1970s, the USA has pursued the policy of aviation liberalization and concluded a number of air transport agreements with other States, promoting the opening of international air transport market. The French act restricted the freedom of air transportation, which was incompatible with American aviation policy. In addition, bilateral treaties signed by the USA with other States also contained similar provisions on change of gauge. The French act would affect the interpretation and application of these provisions, which may have significant adverse impact on America. Therefore, the arbitral tribunal concluded that the U.S. countermeasure did not obviously violate the principle of proportionality.$^{84}$ In this case, the key\n78 See David J. Bederman, Counterintuiting Countermeasures, 96 The American Journal of International Law 821 (2002).\n79 Supra note 76, at Paragraph 3.\n80 Id., Paragraphs 5 and 3 respectively.\n81 Id., Paragraph 6. See also Michael N. Schmitt, supra note 2, at 241–242.\n82 Supra note 8.\n83 The Original text reads ‘the importance of the questions of principle arising from the alleged breach’. Supra note 8, at para. 83.\n84 Supra note 8.\nThe Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law\nfactors considered by the tribunal, i.e., the importance of the aviation policy and the potential impact of the damage, involves qualitative evaluation which is a general approximation rather than an accurate quantitative measurement.\nAnother one is the Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project case in 1997 in which the principle of proportionality was applied and a negative conclusion was made.⁸⁵ In this case, Hungary and Slovakia signed an agreement to jointly build a dam on the Danube in 1977. During the implementation of the agreement, Hungary unilaterally terminated the construction of the dam. As a countermeasure, Slovakia diverted the Danube in its territory to intercept water resources.⁸⁶ Different from the Air Service Agreement case, the ICJ combined quantitative and qualitative analysis in this case. First, from a qualitative perspective, the Court pointed out that the countermeasure had affected Hungary's important rights to equitable and reasonable share of natural resources of the Danube, including both navigational and non-navigational use. Second, the Court analyzed the intensity of the countermeasure taken by Slovakia. It held that Slovakia had unilaterally diversified and controlled 80% to 90% of water resources of the Danube. Measures with such magnitude will have a significant impact on the ecosystem of the Danube basin, clearly exceeding the reasonable limit, and thus inconsistent with the principle of proportionality.⁸⁷ In this case, the Danube is an important international river. The sheer volume of water being diversified, 80% to 90%, was a prima facie indication that the measure was probably out of proportionality. Thus it is a relatively easy case to adjudicate. However, if the amount of water resources affected by the countermeasure was in the range of 10% to 50%, the issue of proportionality would be in the grey area.\n## 2. The Benchmark for the Proportionality test\nThe benchmark for the proportionality test is also a controversial issue. The Draft Articles on Responsibility of States set injury as the benchmark for evaluating proportionality, allowing the injured State to retaliate against the injuring State with an equivalent damage, and thus forcing the injuring State to cease the infringement. This is not fundamentally different from the private retaliation of \"an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.\" It may lead to countermeasure going beyond what is strictly necessary for its very purpose and become punitive in nature. Therefore, there are inherent contradictions in the regime on countermeasures as set out by the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States.⁸⁸ This benchmark works well only among States with comparable strength. On the other hand, if there is a significant gap in strength between the countries involved,\n⁸⁵ See the Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project (Hungary/Slovakia), Judgment, ICJ Reports 1997.\n⁸⁶ In the judgment, the ICJ adopted a two-step approach. First, the Court found that Hungary violated the treaty concluded by both parties, which constituted an internationally wrongful act. Secondly, the Court discussed whether Slovakia's acts constituted countermeasures, one of the most important factor of which was the principle of proportionality. *Id.*, at para. 82.\n⁸⁷ *Id.*, at paras. 85–86.\n⁸⁸ See Nigel White &amp; Ademola Abass, *Countermeasures and Sanctions*, in Malcolm Evans ed., International Law, at 513 (Cambridge University Press 2018).\nWuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers\ncountermeasure as under the current proportionality test may be abused by those powerful States as an excuse to bully the weak ones.\nIn recent years, some scholars proposed a functional approach towards the proportionality test, arguing that the purpose to be achieved d by countermeasures shall be used as the benchmark. Countermeasures are instrumental, and their purposes are to force the injuring State to cease its wrongful act and to comply with its international obligations, so that the relations between the two States can be restored. Therefore, the proportionality of countermeasures should be assessed against its purpose, irrespective of whether they exceed the intensity of the wrongful act.⁸⁹\nIn April 2007, Estonia suffered a three-week-long DDoS cyberattack and a large number of critical infrastructure websites, including those of government agencies, were forced to shut down, resulting in network paralysis and service disruption with severe damage.⁹⁰ If the cyberattack could be attributed to Russia, Estonia could respond with DDoS countermeasures. In terms of the intensity, Estonia may not achieve its purpose if the countermeasures were of equivalent magnitude as that of the cyberattack because Russia's size and strength are far greater than Estonia's. Achieving the purpose of inducing Russia to cease its internationally wrongful act would likely require countermeasures that far exceed the damage caused by Russia's wrongful act. Therefore, taking the purpose of countermeasures as the benchmark is more in line with their very aim. Meanwhile, such approach taking into consideration the differences in strength of nations, prevents the abuse by stronger State, thus more fair and equitable.\nTherefore, the principle of proportionality lacks clear rules and is full of uncertainties. Its application in cyberspace is even more challenging.⁹¹ This is because cyberspace is interconnected and cyberattacks are dynamic and constantly changing, making it difficult and time-consuming to assess the damage caused. The injured State shall be extremely cautious when evaluating the proportionality of the countermeasures. This will not preclude the possibility for taking countermeasures in response to cyberattacks. A practical approach is to adopt cyber measures as an effective response to cyberattacks,⁹² because this type of countermeasures is of the same nature as the wrongful act and is more likely to be regarded as consistent with the principle of proportionality.⁹³\n⁸⁹ See Enzo Cannizzaro, *The Role of Proportionality in the Law of International Countermeasure*, 12 European Journal of International Law 889 (2001).\n⁹⁰ See Ma Chunmao, *A Review of Estonia’s Cyber Warfare*, at https://tech.sina.com.cn/i/2009-02-04/08172791102.shtml (last visited June 3, 2019).\n⁹¹ See Nicholas Tsagourias, *The Law Applicable to Countermeasures against Low Intensity Cyber Operations*, 14 Baltic Yearbook of International Law Online 105 (2015).\n⁹² Proportionality does not mean reciprocity. The obligation breached by countermeasures does not necessarily need to be same as the obligation breached by the responsible State, nor does the nature and means of the countermeasure.\n⁹³ See Paragraph 5 of the commentary to the introductory part of Chapter II in Part Three of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States.\nThe Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law\nTraditionally cyberattacks are dealt with through a passive defense system, consisting of a firewall, intrusion detection and prevention mechanism with antivirus software as the commonly deployed technology. Under such system, only after it is attacked will the antivirus software be able to obtain the vital information and code of the virus and update its database. So that the same viruses can be detected and removed next time they appear. The inherent deficiency is that only after the virus attacks can loopholes in the system be identified and fixed. Thus the antivirus software is always behind the virus and even the most sophisticated firewall may be breached. As a result, passive defense cannot does not offer satisfactory solution to network security. Modern network security is increasingly rely on active defense through early detection of cyberattacks and deception techniques to contain and constrain the attacks. For example, sandbox and honeypot are commonly used technical methods, which in fact deliberately expose some vulnerabilities for attackers and then to obtain critical information of the attackers when they intrude the system. These techniques offers protection to the system and buys time for the injured State to examine the cyberattack and to develop appropriate countermeasures. Such means do not compromise or damage the attacker's network facilities or computer systems, thus consistent with the principle of proportionality.\nMore extreme active defenses measures are even aggressive in nature, i.e., hacking back. Such technics involve hacking into the attacker's computer system, erasing the stolen data, or even planting ransomware. This type of defense involves cyber measures thus similar to cyberattacks in nature. However, this does not necessarily mean such measures fulfill the proportionality test because equivalence in nature is only one of the factors considered in the evaluation of proportionality. In practice, it is still necessary to consider other factors of the proportionality test and keeping cyber countermeasures within the reasonable limits allowed by international law.\nIn summary, the application of the principle proportionality is controversial and challenging. The Draft Articles on Responsibility of States fails to provide clear guidance, but only lists the factors to be considered. Furthermore, the benchmark against which proportionality is assessed against is not without controversy. Considerable uncertainties remain with regard to the application of countermeasures in cyberspace. A practical and effective approach is to adopt cyber countermeasures in response to cyberattacks and ensure the impact of such measures are within a reasonable limit.\n# VI. Conclusion\nThe fundamental aim of international law on the countermeasure is to limit it to a reasonable extent and prevent such measures being abused leading to the escalation of disputes. However, the boundaries of countermeasures permitted by international law remains unsettled. During the\n If the attacker took advantage of the vulnerabilities of the honeypot to launch a cyberattack against a third country, the State that set up the honeypot may be found violating its due diligence obligations.\nWuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers\ndrafting process of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States, every rule on countermeasures had been a matter of controversy. Major differences among States on this issue were also highlighted at the 2017 Session of the UNGGE, where disagreements led to the absence of a consensus report and the breakdown of negotiations. The function and mission of the UNGGE is not to create or modify the rules of international law in cyberspace, but to discuss how international law is applied. Thus despite the failure of the negotiation process of the UNGGE, international law, including rules on countermeasures, is still applicable to cyberspace. This basic position has been confirmed by the International Group of Experts in its 2015 report.\nCompared with the traditional physical space of State sovereignty, cyberspace as a relatively new domain has its own unique features, creating new issues to the application of countermeasures. Current international law on the countermeasure as articulated in the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States, imposing stringent conditions to prevent its abuse, are ill-equipped to deal with cyberattacks. It adopts the basic position that countermeasure is illegal per se, to discourage its usage in practice. The prerequisites for taking countermeasures is the existence of internationally wrongful acts; in cyberspace the attribution of cyberattacks to States is challenging. In addition, the procedural requirements for taking countermeasure are impractical in cyberspace and the proportionality test is highly subjective and unpredictable. These facts have greatly diminished the effectiveness and certainty of the application of countermeasures in cyberspace. This is one of the major reason why there are few cases where state invoked countermeasures. Therefore, current international law does not offer clear rules and guidance on how to apply countermeasures in cyberspace. The international law regime on this issue is still at the early stage of development and is still evolving.\n(Translators: Meng Chao &amp; Wang Yi)"

Attribution of cyberattacks to the state is difficult. Though the doctrine of due diligence has the potential to addresses this problem by lowering the threshold of attribution, it may unduly expand the scope of State responsibility. In addition, the procedural requirements for takings countermeasures are impractical in cyberspace. The substantive requirement of proportionality is of fundamental importance, but lacks clear and workable benchmark. Therefore, application of countermeasures in cyberspace is fraught with uncertainties and international law on this issue remains unsettled.\nKeywords: cyberattack; countermeasures; attribution; principle of proportionality; due diligence # I. Introduction In recent years, cyberattacks have become more frequent. How to respond to cyberattacks and maintain cyber security has become an issue with significant strategic and practical implications that needs to be addressed urgently in the international community. Under international law, the injured State enjoys the right of self-defense against internationally wrongful acts that have reached the level of armed attack.¹ However, in practice, most cyberattacks do not reach the required threshold of use of force, letting alone an armed attack.² Taking the 2010 “Stuxnet” Incident for example, the prevailing view was that the cyberattacks did not constitute an armed attack in international law, notwithstanding that the virus had led to the damage of thousands of Iranian uranium enrichment centrifuges. Therefore, in most cases, a State is not able to exercise its right to self-defense against a cyberattack.³ * ZHU Lei (朱磊), Ph.D. in Law, associate professor at the Wuhan University Institute of International Law in China.\n¹ Armed attacks are the most serious type of use of force, according to the International Court of Justice’s opinion in the Nicaragua case. See Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), Judgement, ICJ Reports 1986, para.191.\n² See Michael N. Schmitt ed., Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations, at 538–531 (2nd edition, Cambridge University Press 2017). The book propose eight factors for assessing whether a cyberattack constitutes the use of force, including, severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability of effects, military character, state involvement and presumptive legality.\n³ See Robin Geiss &amp; Henning Lahmann, Freedom and Security in Cyberspace: Shifting the Focus Away from Military Responses towards Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention, in Katharina Ziolkowski ed., Peacetime Regime for State Activities in Cyberspace: International Law, International Relations and Diplomacy, at 628 (NATO CCDCOE Publication 2013).\nWuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers In response to these cyberattacks which do not rise to the level of an armed attack, States tend to respond in a non-forceful and peaceful manner in practice. For example, in January 2015, the United States (\"USA\") imposed economic sanctions on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea as a response to the cyberattack on Sony Pictures Entertainment.⁴ In response to the allegation that Russia had interfered in the United States' General Election through cyberattacks, the USA announced the expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats in December 2016.⁵ Cyberspace is considered as the new frontier of national sovereignty and international law is applicable in this area.⁶ The legal nature and status of the actions taken by the injured State in response to cyberattacks under international law is an issue that deserves serious consideration, in which the central issue involved is that of countermeasures. Similar to the right of self-defense, it allows a State to take its own measures of private remedies against an internationally wrongful act. Where certain conditions are met, it can preclude the wrongfulness of those measures and thereby relieve the responsibility of the State.\nThe countermeasure as a customary international law with a long history is controversial in international law. Its application to cyberspace is even more challenging because as an emerging field of science and technology, cyberspace has characteristics different from those areas of traditional State sovereignty. This paper analyzes how countermeasures in international law are applied to cyberspace in light of the characteristics of cyberspace, and examines the main issues and controversies in the application of countermeasures to cyberspace.\n## II. The Historical Development and Inherent Contradictories of Countermeasures ## 1. Historical Development of Countermeasures The term\"countermeasure\"was first used by the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office of the United Kingdom in 1916 in its correspondences with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Sweden.⁷ And the first detailed discussion on countermeasures was in the *Air Services Agreement* arbitration case in 1978.⁸ In this case, the USA made its claim based on countermeasures, which ⁴ See Zhuang Xiaodan, *Revenge for Sony Pictures? US Launches New Round of Sanctions against North Korea*, at https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_1290937 (last visited June 3, 2023).\n⁵ See Lu Jiafei &amp; Xu Jianmei, *U.S. Announces Sanctions against Russia for Alleged Cyberattacks to Interfere in U.S. Election*, at https://world.huanqiu.com/article/9CaKrnJZtjV (last visited June 3, 2019).\n⁶ UN Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (\"UNGGE\"), the main platform and mechanism for official intergovernmental dialogue on international law in cyberspace, acknowledged in its 2013 report that international law applies in cyberspace. See UN, A/68/98.\n⁷ See Omer Yousif Elagab, *The Place of Non-Forcible Counter-Measures in Contemporary International Law*, in Guy S. Goodwin-Gill &amp; Stefan Talmon eds., *The Reality of International Law: Essays in Honour of Ian Brownlie*, at 125 (Oxford University Press 1999).\n⁸ See the *Air Service Agreement* of 27 March 1946 between the United States of America and France (1978) 18 RIAA 417.\nThe Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law was upheld by the Arbitral Tribunal.⁹ The term was widely used after the Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (“Draft Articles on Responsibility of States”), adopted by the International Law Commission of the United Nations (“UNILC”) in 2001, which used the term and contained detailed rules on countermeasures in seven articles.¹⁰ The historical root of countermeasures is found in the traditional international law concept of reprisals,¹¹ which is essentially a mechanism of private remedy. The concept of “countermeasures” is used as a synonym for “reprisals” and inherits the key elements of the latter. The institution of reprisals in international law has a long history and its development can be divided into three stages.\nThe first stage was a completely liberal private reprisal, which was common in the early stage of the development of the rule of law, during which the State apparatus was not yet in place and public enforcement mechanisms for the law were missing. Where the rights of individuals were violated without remedy from public power, they could take it upon themselves to enforce the law and take reprisals as a means of obtaining the relief. In ancient Greece, the customary law of seizing foreigners existed in the city-states of Athens. Where a citizen of a city-state was killed by a foreigner or the government, the relatives of the victim enjoyed the right to capture and detain three citizens of that foreign state as hostages and demand that the perpetrator be presented or compensated. Where the claim was not met, the victim’s relatives would enjoy the right to kill the hostages to pay back the blood debt.¹² The second stage was the reprisal authorized by the State, essentially to incorporate reprisal into the framework of State regulation. The letter of reprisal¹³ offers a good example. It has its roots in Roman law.¹⁴ In ancient Rome, public authorities became involved in the system of reprisals and regulated it strictly. If the rights of a Roman citizen (especially a merchant) were violated by an alien, the victim could seize the citizen of that State to retaliate with procedural and substantive restrictions. Before the reprisal could be carried out, the victim must apply to the relevant State authority for a permit to do so. The precondition of obtaining the permit is that the victim had been treated unfairly by the courts of a foreign State and that his or her damages could not be compensated and his or her rights could not be remedied. The scope must be limited to the actual damage suffered by the victim and the seizure by force can be carried out only within the Roman territory or on international waters.¹⁵ ⁹ Omer Yousif Elagab, supra note 7, at 125–126.\n¹⁰ The International Court of Justice referred to the term twice in 1980 in the United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran case, and several times in the Nicaragua case in 1986.\n¹¹ See Malcolm N. Shaw, International Law 794 (Cambridge University Press 2008).\n¹² See David J. Bederman, International Law in Antiquity, at 123 (Cambridge University Press 2007).\n¹³ Letter of reprisal is also known as letter of marquee.\n¹⁴ Its modern formulation can be found in the Constitution of the United States of America, which in Section 8 of Article 1 authorizes the Congress to grant letters of marque and reprisal.\n¹⁵ See Wilhelm G. Grewe, The Epochs of International Law, at 117 (De Gruyter 2000).\nWuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers During the medieval period, reprisals centered on the letter of marquee, whereby armed privateers, with government concession, may chase and destroy foreign lawbreakers and fleets, as well as attack and plunder enemy merchant ships. By the 16th Century, wartime plundering became quite widespread and many States began to legislate and regulate the granting of such letters. Hugo Grotius in his book (1604), *De Jure Praedae*, legally defended the act of Dutch ships attacking Portuguese and Spanish ships. He argued that the granting of permit was akin to declaring a “private war,” justified by the fact that the laws of each State had no effective jurisdiction over the seas and that merchant ships had to arm themselves in self-defense.^[16]^ The third stage was to prohibit the use of forcible reprisal. Traditional reprisal includes both forcible and non-forcible means, the majority of which is forcible. In the early 20th Century, the international community restricted the use of force through a series of conventions. Modern international law prohibits the use of force and the Charter of the United Nations explicitly prohibits the use of force and the threat of force. As a result, forcible reprisal eventually receded from the stage of history. Accordingly, the term “countermeasures,” also known as “non-forcible reprisal,” was adopted to conform to the development of modern international law, which corresponded to reprisals by non-forcible means. In this way, the term can distinguish itself from reprisals by force and avoid the negative connotations associated with the concept of reprisals in traditional international law.^[17]^ ## 2. The Inherent Contradictories of Countermeasures A review of the historical development reveals its inherent tensions and contradictories, which is also the core issue to be addressed in contemporary international law. On the one hand, the existence of countermeasures is justified. In the absence of adequate public enforcement mechanisms when the rule of law is weak, reprisal offers a workable and efficient private solution. In domestic law, with the development of the rule of law, private enforcement of the law was increasingly limited and ultimately superseded by public enforcement of the law. By contrast, international law is based on the principle of sovereign equality and the international community is an egalitarian society. International law has an inherent flaw in that it lacks a centralized enforcement mechanism with enforcement authority that overrides the State, resulting in inadequate supply of public remedies. Therefore, it is necessary to have countermeasures as a form of private national remedies.\nThe essence of countermeasures, on the other hand, is to leave law enforcement in private hands, which could be harmful and even dangerous. Without any constraints, reprisal is highly vulnerable to abuse, plunging the international law into law of the jungle. Though the medieval letter of marquee was under the State’s regulation, it was often no different than piracy in practice. Bartolus de Saxoferrato (1314-1357), a famous European medieval jurist, wrote in a work published in ^[16] See Hugo Grotius, *Commentary on the Law of Prize and Booty*, at 62 (Liberty Fund 2012).\n^[17] See Mary Ellen O’Connell, *The Power and Purpose of International Law: Insights from the Theory and Practice of Enforcement*, at 233 (Oxford University Press 2011).\nThe Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law But, how can the balance between the reasonableness and the harm of countermeasures be achieved? This is the most difficult and contentious issue in the modern international law regime on countermeasures, which is also evident in the drafting process of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States. Although the majority of States recognized the necessity of countermeasures, many expressed concerns about the harmfulness of countermeasures. Therefore, in order to prevent the abuse of countermeasures, the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States adopted the principle of “conditional lawfulness” for countermeasures and set strict requirements for their implementation, in an attempt to prevent such measures from becoming tools for strong States to oppress weak States. Only countermeasures that have met these conditions are lawful; otherwise, they would be considered as internationally wrongful acts.\nThe rules established in the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States are the authoritative expression of modern international law on countermeasures, but they are also highly contentious. The fundamental disagreement during the development of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States was over the legal status of countermeasures, especially whether they are lawful or unlawful in nature. Representatives of some States took a positive attitude towards countermeasures, proposing that countermeasures are lawful in themselves, which are the rights enjoyed by States in international law, and are unlawful only under certain exceptional circumstances. However, this view was not supported by the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States which regarded countermeasures as unlawful *per se*.¹⁹ Countermeasures are internationally wrongful act that are in breach of internationally law, with the possibility of excluding the international wrongfulness of the act under certain circumstances. Therefore, countermeasures involve a situation excluding the wrongfulness of the act and may be invoked a defense to the accusation of internationally wrongful act. This fundamental stance taken by the UNILC is to discourage rather than promote the use of countermeasures.\nIn summary, countermeasures are the private enforcement of the law and have certain negative consequences. The historical development of countermeasures is a process of introducing more restrictions on its use and to bring it under the regulation of the law. In the meanwhile, international community is egalitarian in nature, which provides the solid foundation for its existence as an accepted form of enforcement under customary international law. Setting clear requirements for their use, mitigating their harmfulness, and limiting their application within an acceptable boundary are the key purpose for modern international law regime on countermeasures.\n¹⁸ Wilhelm G. Grewe, *supra* note 15, at 117.\n¹⁹ This basic principle is also reflected in Tallinn Manual 2.0 on International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations. See Michael N. Schmitt, *supra* note 2, at 225.\nWuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers ## III. Prerequisites for Taking Countermeasures in Cyberspace: Internationally Wrongful Acts in Cyberspace ## 1. Temporal Limitation of Countermeasures The existence of an internationally wrongful act is a prerequisite for taking countermeasures, which is the primary reason for the exclusion of its wrongfulness.²⁰ Countermeasures are similar to self-defense in this regard, which are taken in response to a prior internationally wrongful act by another State. As a result, countermeasures should be considered as the “shield” for defense rather than the “spear” for offense. The absence of an effective enforcement mechanism in international law allows the injured State to suspend its international obligations only when the other State has violated the law in the first place. In other words, the essence of countermeasures is to counteract an internationally wrongful act with an illegal act, with the goal of forcing the injuring State to resume its international obligations and restore normal relations between the two nations. Therefore, countermeasures are a part of the enforcement mechanism of international law, through which the injured State are able to protect its own rights and interests, thus also a mechanism of remedy in international law.\nCountermeasures must be taken against an ongoing internationally wrongful act and are not preventive or prospective. Once the wrongful act ceases, the countermeasures must also be ceased.²¹ Thus, if a cyberattack has not yet occurred or has ended, the injured State shall not take countermeasures. This rule significantly limits the possibility of an injured State to take countermeasures in response to a cyber-related wrongful act, because unlike traditional internationally wrongful acts, most cyberattacks are sudden and short-lived, leaving only a relatively limited period of time for an injured State to respond and diminishing the possibility of taking countermeasures in response to a cyberattack.\nIt is worth noting that modern cyberattacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, often requiring a large investment of manpower and resources, and their complexity and destructive power may be no less than a small-scale war.²² Complex cyberattacks take a long time from planning to actual implementation involving multiple steps such as intelligence collection, vulnerability detection, intrusion and infiltration into the network, and virus implantation. They often require coordination and cooperation of a professional and technical team. The time span of cyberattacks provides the opportunities and possibilities for injured State to monitor and detect cyberattacks earlier.\n--- ²⁰ See Denis Alland, *Countermeasures of General Interest*, 13 European Journal of International Law 1221 (2002).\n²¹ See Maurice Kamto, *The Time Factor in the Application of Countermeasures*, in James Crawford et al. eds., *The Law of International Responsibility*, at 1176 (Oxford University Press 2010).\n²² See Jiang Shibo, *Cyber Attacks and the Application of the Laws of War*, 16(2) Wuhan University International Law Review 43–70 (2014).\nThe Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law The cyberattack on the Ukrainian power grid on 23 December 2015 offers a good illustration. The cyberattack began in the spring of 2014, when the attackers first spear-phished IT staff and system administrators, causing viruses to infect systems and opening backdoors for subsequent cyberattacks. Over the following months, the attackers conducted extensive network reconnaissance, exploration and mapping efforts and gained the ability to manage user accounts within the network and employee login credentials. The final step of the cyberattack consisted of a series of coordinated actions, including reconfiguring the uninterruptible power supply, disconnecting the circuit breaker to take the substation offline, and launching a denial-of-service attack on the customer call center.[23] In order to deal with sophisticated cyberattacks, the injured State should develop and improve its capabilities of cyber-related technology, strengthen real-time supervision over cyberattacks, detect ongoing cyberattacks at an early stage, and fix vulnerabilities of the system and strengthen measures for cyber prevention and defense. If the cyberattack is still at such an early stage as the planning, vulnerability detection and intelligence gathering, the injured State should exercise restraint and should not take countermeasures; otherwise, it may cause miscalculation and lead to the escalation of disputes. Once a cyberattack enters the next stage of implementation, such as planting viruses and stealing account information, etc., it constitutes an internationally wrongful act in violation of international law, at which time the injured State may take countermeasures against the act without waiting for the final stage of the cyberattack to unfold.\n## 2. Attribution of Internationally Wrongful Acts Under international law, countermeasures are measures taken by a state against another state, which carries two important implications. Although enterprises are frequently subject to cyberattacks,[24] the measures taken by enterprises in response to cyberattacks do not constitute the countermeasures under international law.[25] Second, the object of countermeasures must be the State rather than non-State actors. In reality, there are very few inter-State cyberattacks, and most of such attacks are initiated by private non-State actors (e.g., patriotic hackers and lone wolves).[26] The first issue to be addressed in determining whether there is an internationally wrongful act is the attribution of cyberattacks, i.e., whether privately committed acts can be attributed to the State and constitute acts of the State.[27] If a cyberattack committed by a non-State actor is not attributed to the State, it [23] See Kim Zetter, Inside the Cunning, Unprecedented Hack of Ukraine’s Power Grid, at https://www.wired.com/2016/03/inside-cunning-unprecedented-hack-ukraines-power-grid/ (last visited June 3, 2023).\n[24] The 2017 Annual Internet Security Report released by Tencent Security pointed out that up to 86% of companies worldwide had experienced at least one cyberattack in 2017.

Schmitt, Below the Threshold Cyber Operations: The Counter-Measures Response Option and International Law, 54 Virginia Journal of International Law 697 (2014).\n[26] See Michael N. Schmitt, In Defense of Due Diligence in Cyberspace, 125 Yale Law Journal Forum 77 (2015).\n[27] See Tom Ruys, Sanctions, Retorsions and Countermeasures: Concepts and International Legal Framework, in Larissa van den Herik ed., Research Handbook on UN Sanctions and International Law, at 14 (Edward Elgar Publishing 2016).\nWuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers may constitute a violation of domestic law, but not an internationally wrongful act in violation of international law, and the injured State cannot take countermeasures against such acts.²⁸ Attribution is an extremely challenging issue in identifying State responsibility in cyberspace, involving three layers of attribution. First, from the technical perspective, unlike traditional physical domains such as sea, land and air, the cyberspace is a decentralized system. Cyberspace is open, pluralistic, interoperable, and anonymous, and attackers often use encryption technology to transmit information in packets to hide their identities and sources, making the investigation of the source of cyberattacks quite complex, costly and protracted.²⁹ Second, after locating the source of cyberattacks through technical means, the subject behind the cyberattacks also needs to be identified. Even if the IP address is traced to a State's cyber infrastructure, it may not meet the criteria of burden of proof for attribution because IP addresses can be spoofed. For example, in 2013, an organization impersonating its IP address as from the Ukrainian government conducted cyber operations against the NATO Cyber Cooperative Defense Center of Excellence, the Estonian Defense Forces, and the armed forces of other NATO countries. Clearly, the conduct could not be attributed to the Ukrainian government.³⁰ Finally, it remains to determine whether the act committed by the attackers constitutes the act of a State, i.e., legal attribution. The key issue is whether cyberattacks committed by non-State actors can be attributed to the State and constitute internationally wrongful acts that entails State responsibility. The challenge is degree of connection required for attribution to the State the cyberattacks committed by non-State actors. Under Article 8 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States, the conduct of non-State actors acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of a State is attributable to that State. The International Court of Justice (\"ICJ\") established the doctrine of\"effective control\"in the Nicaragua case in 1987. In that case, the USA played a significant and decisive role in financing, organizing, training, supplying, and equipping the Nicaraguan Contras, but the ICJ found that the series of U.S. acts did not constitute\"effective control\"³¹ and thus could not meet the standard of attribution.\nThe doctrine of effective control requires the State play a direct and a leading role in the cyberattacks, not just a supporting one, setting a higher threshold for State responsibility for private conduct. For example, the USA believed that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea played a\"central role\"in the 2014 cyberattack on Sony Pictures, which rose to the level of effective control and imposed ²⁸ See Michael N. Schmitt, *Peacetime Cyber Responses and Wartime Cyber Operations under International Law: An Analytical Vade Mecum*, 8 Harvard National Security Journal 260 (2017).\n²⁹ See Huang Zhixiong ed., *On Cyber Sovereignty—Jurisprudence, Policy and Practice*, at 39 (Social Sciences Academic Press 2017).\n³⁰ See Michael N. Schmitt, *supra* note 2, at 203.\n³¹ *Supra* note 1, at para. 115.\nThe Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law sanctions against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.³² In contrast, Iranian hackers conducted DDoS cyberattacks against a number of U.S. financial institutions between 2011 and 2013. Although these hackers had ties to the Iranian government, such ties did not rise to the level of effective control and therefore the attacks could not be attributed to Iran and the USA could not take countermeasures against Iran accordingly.³³ The Tallinn Manual 2.0 on International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations (“Tallinn Manual 2.0”) adopts the ICJ’s standard of effective control. It gives the following illustrative example. A State plans and oversees an operation to use a software update to implant a new vulnerability in software widely used by another state in its governmental computers. The former State enters into a confidential contract with the company that produced the software to embed the vulnerability and directs the course of action. In such a case the State planned, directed, and supervised over a particular cyberattack and took a leading and direct role in the operation, which is fundamentally different from the ancillary role played by the US government in the Nicaragua case and thus the company’s conduct is attributable to the State.³⁴ The doctrine of effective control adopts a relatively stringent criterion of attribution, which makes it difficult for the injured State to prove, thus severely limiting the application of countermeasures. In practice, the injuring State may not directly organize the implementation of cyberattacks, but indirectly support cyberattacks as a way to avoid State responsibility. Moreover, cyberattacks are secretive and complex, and attackers often use technical means to hide the source of the attack, so it is not easy to obtain conclusive evidence to prove the extent of State involvement in such cyberattacks and the role played by the State. And such evidence is often located in the injuring State or even across the globe, which is difficult to obtain and even if obtained, the timing for taking countermeasures may has already elapsed.³⁵ For example, Estonia was subjected to a DDoS attack in 2007 and investigation revealed that the source of the attack was computers from 178 countries, including Vietnam and the USA. The cyberattack lasted for three weeks, providing a valuable time for evidence collection and attribution. However, to date, there is still no conclusive evidence of to attribute the responsibility to Russia.³⁶ In summary, the rules on attribution in international law are established for traditional internationally wrongful acts and thus are difficult to apply to cyberspace. It has the effect of greatly limiting the possibility of taking countermeasures in cyberspace. Some scholars argued that the constraints of existing customary law should be lifted and States should be allowed to take countermeasures ³² Zhuang Xiaodan, supra note 4.\n³³ See BBC: US Indicts 7 Iranian Hackers for Breaching Multiple Financial Firms, at https://news.youth.cn/gj/201603/t20160325_7779822.htm (last visited June 3, 2019).\n³⁴ See Michael N.

Due Diligence To address the difficulty of attribution under the doctrine of effective control, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 introduces due diligence into cyberspace, proposing that a State must exercise due diligence in not allowing its territory, or territory or cyber infrastructure under its governmental control, to be used for cyber operations that affect the rights of, and produce serious adverse consequences for, other States.³⁸ This lowers the criterion of attribution required by the doctrine of effective control and reduces the threshold of State responsibility for acts of private subjects, essentially as a type of vicarious liability.³⁹ This is an important development and breakthrough compared to the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (Tallinn Manual 1.0).\nThe ICJ has affirmed the doctrine of due diligence in the Corfu Channel case,⁴⁰ the Tehran Hostage case,⁴¹ and the Nicaragua case.⁴² For example, in the Corfu Channel case, although the mines were not laid by Albania, the area where the incident occurred was Albanian territorial waters and Albania should bear the regulatory responsibility for that area. Also, judging from the geographical location and expertise, Albania had the knowledge of the mines laid in the Corfu Channel,⁴³ but failed to take relevant measures, and therefore should bear responsibility. The ICJ stated that every State has an obligation “not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States.”⁴⁴ Under the doctrine of due diligence, a State must take active measures to prevent, reduce or limit the occurrence of damage, which is essentially an obligation to prevent transnational damage. The infrastructure on which cyberspace is based is physical, located in a particular State, and falls within the sovereign jurisdiction of that State, and due diligence is equally applicable. This basic position was also adopted by the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Information Security (“UNGGE”) in its report issued in 2015.⁴⁵ Therefore, if a State violates due diligence in ³⁷ See Gary Corn &amp; Eric Talbot Jensen, *The Use of Force and Cyber Countermeasures*, 32 Temple International &amp; Comparative Law Journal 127 (2018).\n³⁸ See Michael N. Schmitt, *supra* note 2, at 128.\n³⁹ See Huang Zhixiong, *The Attribution of Cyberattacks in International Law*, 5 Global Law Review 164 (2014).\n⁴⁰ See Corfu Channel (United Kingdom v. Albania), Judgment, ICJ Reports 1949, at 22.\n⁴¹ See the United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran (United States v. Iran), Judgment, ICJ Report 1980, para. 63.\n⁴² *Supra* note 1, at para.157.\n⁴³ *Supra* note 40, at para. 65.\n⁴⁴ *Supra* note 40, at para. 67.\n⁴⁵ See UN, A/70/174.\nThe Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law cyberspace, it constitutes an internationally wrongful act and the injured State is entitled to take countermeasures.\nThe most controversial issue in practice is the scope of the obligation assumed by a State under the doctrine of due diligence. On this issue, two extreme positions should be avoided. If a liberal approach is adopted, i.e., a State assumes little or even no obligation, this will lead to the abuse of the principle of sovereignty, allowing the use of network facilities to infringe upon the interests of other States.\nOn the other hand, an expanded interpretation would broaden the scope of due diligence, constitute an unreasonable restriction on State sovereignty, which lacks a basis in international law. In this regard, the view of U.S. military judge Matthew J. Sklerov is quite representative. He advocated that strict criminal legislation and law enforcement could effectively prevent cyberattacks,⁴⁶ and argued that the State's obligation in cyberspace includes passing stringent criminal laws, conducting vigorous investigations, prosecuting attackers, and, during the investigation and prosecution, cooperating with the victim state of cyberattacks that originated from within their borders.⁴⁷ According to this view, knowledge of the occurrence of the damage is also not a requirement for the assumption of due diligence.⁴⁸ In other words, the State has the obligation to take active criminal action to prevent and stop illegal cyberattacks, and the State's negligence or omission in any respect constitutes tacit approval and sheltering of such attacks⁴⁹ and constitutes a violation of due diligence.\nIn practice, however, cyberattacks are often deceptive and disguised, and attackers may use the network infrastructure of other States to carry out remote attacks. Matthew J. Sklerov's view underestimated the complexity of cyberattacks in practice, which may lead to a misjudgment on state responsibility of cyberattacks. The USA, with its significant political, economic, and military position in the world, is often the target of cyberattacks, but it is difficult to hold the relevant States responsible in practice due to the problem of attribution. This view which expands the scope of due diligence attempts to lift the constraints and limitations under traditional rules of international law and to lower the threshold of State responsibility, thus enabling the USA to take countermeasures against other States more easily. Such practice should come under close scrutiny.\nThe appropriate approach on this issue is to return to the current framework of international law under which a State assumes due diligence responsibility only to the extent of knowledge on the occurrence of damage.⁵⁰ This basic principle was also endorsed in the report of the UNGGE issued in 2015, and is a commonly held position by States. Under this doctrine, knowledge may be actual ⁴⁶ See Matthew J. Sklerov, Solving the Dilemma of State Responses to Cyberattacks: A Justification for the Use of Active Defenses against States Who Neglect Their Duty to Prevent, 201 Military Law Review 71 (2009).\n⁴⁷ Id., at 62.\n⁴⁸ Id., at 71.\n⁴⁹ Id.\n⁵⁰ Supra note 40, at para.18.\nWuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers or constructive. A State may be found to have actual knowledge of a cyberattack if it has detected or has been notified by the injured State of an attack originating from that country.^[51]^ The essence of constructive knowledge is the reverse of the burden of proof. The challenge of attribution in cyberspace is evidence, and in the case of constructive knowledge the burden of proof is shifted to the territorial State where the cyberattack originated which have more evidence than the victim state. Therefore it is presumed to have knowledge of the cyberattack with the possibility of rebuttal.^[52]^ With the sheer number of Internet users and the technology to hide their identities and even erase traces of Internet access, it is almost impossible to achieve complete and comprehensive regulation in cyberspace. But this does not mean that the State is unaware of cyber operations within its borders. Whether a State is aware of cyberattacks is closely related to its technical capacities and the regulatory policy it adopts in cyberspace.\nCyberspace is highly complex and technical in nature, and cyber regulation relies on the relevant cyber technical capacities which many developing countries may lack. This is an important factor that must be taken into account when assessing knowledge. Otherwise, it may unduly expand the scope of due diligence obligations. On the other hand, every State regulates cyber activities within its territory to some extent, and an absolutely free cyberspace does not exist. Title V of the Convention on Cybercrime explicitly requires contracting parties to collect and record computer data in real time, which does not only include traffic data, but also content data.\nCyber supervision and regulation is common practice among states, and the difference lies in the degree of its stringency. If a State has strict supervision over cyberspace, it is more likely to know that a cyberattack has occurred, and it can even constitute\"constructive knowledge.\"For example, in May 2013, the U.S. energy security was significantly threatened by a cyberattack on the critical control systems of energy companies and attackers were even able to manipulate the oil and gas pipelines. The U.S. officials said that although there was no conclusive evidence that the cyberattack was supported by the Iranian government, it was unlikely that the Iranian government was unaware of the attack because the Iranian government had centralized control over the cyberspace.^[53]^ This offers a good example of the how the constructive knowledge may be applied in practice.\nIn summary, the precondition for taking countermeasures is the existence of an internationally wrongful act. What is challenging in cyberspace is how to attribute cyberattacks committed by non-State actors to the State. Under the traditional doctrine of effective control, the threshold for attribution is high and difficult to reach in cyberspace. While the doctrine of due diligence may ^[51]^ See Wolff Heintschel von Heinegg, *Legal Implications of Territorial Sovereignty in Cyberspace*, in Christian Czosseck *et al.* eds., 2012 4th International Conference on Cyber Conflict (NATO CCDCOE Publications, Tallin, 2012).\n^[52]^ For example, if a government-dedicated network infrastructure is used to carry out a cyberattack, there is a presumption that the government of that State had knowledge of the cyberattack because the network was under the full control and supervision of the government.\n^[53]^ See N. Perlroth &amp; D. Sanger, *New Computer Attacks Traced to Iran*, Officials Say, The New York Times (May 24, 2013).\nThe Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law step in to solve this problem, the danger is that the scope of due diligence may be overly broad. A balanced approach is that State responsibility only limited cyberattacks to which the State has knowledge of.\n## IV. Procedural Requirements for Taking Countermeasures in Cyberspace ## 1. The Instrumentality of Countermeasures In the application of countermeasures, the determination of an internationally wrongful act is unilateral in nature. The injured State makes its own judgment as to the existence of the internationally wrongful act and the gravity of the damage caused by such act, and makes its own decision as to whether or not and what countermeasures to take.^[54]^ For example, when the Sony Pictures Entertainment suffered a cyberattack in 2014, the U.S. Government, based on the information available to its intelligence community, believed that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea played a central role in the cyberattack, which constituted a State act. It then imposed economic sanctions on three Korean government agencies and officials.^[55]^ In this process, the US State had three roles to play, i.e., as the victim state of a cyberattack, the adjudicator of an internationally wrongful act, and implementer of countermeasures. This leads to an obvious conflict of interest and is prone to exaggerated assessment of the severity of the damage and the necessity of countermeasures, resulting in the escalation of disputes.^[56]^ The determination of an internationally wrongful act is a complex process of fact finding and application of law, which is not an easy task. There is no third-party body in the existing international law system to make an objective and neutral determination on the existence of an internationally wrongful act. In other words, countermeasures are taken on the basis of a one-sided claim of injured State and there is a possibility of abuse in practice. Some States may fabricate the existence of an internationally wrongful act and accuse another State of committing such act. Countermeasures may be used as a justification for the State to take measures such as sanctions, thus becoming a tool for strong countries to bully the weak. This is the greatest danger in the application of countermeasures in cyberspace, a cause for concern for developing countries in particular. Therefore, at the 2017 session of the UNGGE, developing countries, represented by Cuba, opposed the application of the right to self-defense and countermeasures to cyberspace.^[57]^ ^[54]^ Mary Ellen O’Connell, *supra* note 17, at 230.\n^[55]^ See Li Liangyong, *U.S. Sanctions North Korea over Sony “Hack,” No Response from North Korea*, at http://www.xinhuanet.com/world/2015-01/04/c_127354664.htm (last visited June 3, 2023).\n^[56]^ See N. Jansen Calamita, *Sanctions, Countermeasures, and the Iranian Nuclear Issue*, 42 Vanderbilt Journal of Transnational Law 1420 (2009).\n^[57]^ See Anders Henriksen, *The End of the Road for the UNGGE Process: The Future Regulation of Cyberspace*, 5 Journal of Cybersecurity 1 (2019).\nWuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers In order to prevent countermeasures from being abused and leading to the escalation of disputes, and to ensure that they are taken only when they are necessary to achieve their purpose, Article 52 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States set out a series of stringent procedural requirements for countermeasures. Countermeasures, which are instrumental in nature, are intended to induce the responsible State to cease its violations, to comply with and fulfill its international obligations again and to restore lawful relations between the two States. But, countermeasures are not the only way to achieve such end. The fundamental principle of peaceful settlement of international disputes is well established in modern international law[68] and Article 33 of the UN Charter provides a list of pacific methods,[59] which shall be given priority in international dispute settlement. In contrast, countermeasures are exceptional in nature[60] and shall be taken only as the last resort. The injured State should first seek to resolve the disputes through the usual dispute settlement methods contained in Article 33 of the UN Charter, rather than through countermeasures.\nThe victim State shall invoke State responsibility against the injuring State in the first instance. Countermeasures shall not be taken if the injuring State has ceased the wrongful act and undertaken to pay compensation. Second, the injured State should also comply with its obligation to notify in advance and to seek a negotiated settlement of the dispute; this is the second procedural requirement for the taking of countermeasures.[61] In this process, the case of state responsibility is presented to the injuring State and to put some pressure on it to cooperate, thus giving the injuring State a second chance.[62] Finally, an injured State may not take countermeasures when a dispute has already been submitted to a dispute settlement mechanism.\nThese procedural requirements for countermeasures apply equally in the cyberspace. In particular, the last two procedural requirements are controversial which triggered intense debate in the course of formulating the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States. Their application in cyberspace is even more challenging, which will be discussed below.\n## 2. Notification and Seeking to Settle Disputes through Negotiations In order to prevent escalation of a dispute, the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States provides that the injured State should notify the responsible State of any decision to take countermeasures The Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law and offer to negotiate with that State.⁶³ In practice, notification and negotiation are not two separate steps. The purpose of notification is to give the injuring State an opportunity to respond. If the injuring State does so, it constitutes the start of negotiations between the Parties.⁶⁴ In cyberspace, notification is necessary because cyberattacks are often covert. Notification gives the responsible State an opportunity for clarification and prevents misjudgment and the escalation of disputes.\nHowever, the obligation to notify as a procedural requirement in cyberspace faces a number of challenges. First, it is not supported by current state practice. When a State take measures to respond to an internationally wrongful act, usually it does not invoke countermeasure as a justification. Even the issue is subject to a dispute settlement procedure, the victim State usually argues that its act complies with international law in the first instance. Countermeasures come into play only when the act is found to be internationally wrongful, i.e., as a defense and exemption from state responsibility.⁶⁵ Therefore, although there are a large number of cases in which countermeasures have been taken to respond to internationally wrongful acts, the number of cases in which countermeasures are invoked are very limited in practice. For example, the U.S. Government expelled Russian diplomatic officials in response to alleged Russia’s interference with the U.S. general election through cyberattacks in 2016, but it did not explicitly mention countermeasure as its legal basis.⁶⁶ Second, obligation to notify in cyberspace may be impractical. This is because the tracing the source of cyberattacks is complex and challenging. In practice, it is often difficult to identify who the attacker is and where it is originated, rendering notification being impossible. Furthermore, prior notification is likely to diminish the effectiveness of countermeasures in cyberspace.⁶⁷ This is particularly the case if countermeasures are taken through cyber means. Once the injuring State becomes aware of the countermeasures, the cyber tools can be captured and reused. Moreover, an injuring State, having been notified of countermeasures, may temporarily suspend cyberattacks as a means of avoiding such measures, because countermeasures shall cease as well in such situation. Therefore, prior notification may render countermeasures meaningless and ineffective.\nThe obligation to notify is not absolute and the injured State may take such urgent countermeasures as necessary.⁶⁸ This is also recognized by The Tallinn Manual 2.0 which points out that urgent ⁶³ A small number of experts argued that negotiation is also one of the prior procedural requirement for taking countermeasures. The majority of experts did not agree and were in the opinion that this may be an excuse for the responsible State to stall for time. See Michael N. Schmitt, supra note 2, at 152.\n⁶⁴ Mary Ellen O’Connell, supra note 17, at 259.\n⁶⁵ For example, in the Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project case, Slovakia did not claim that its actions constitute countermeasures, instead revoked other grounds as justification. The application of countermeasures arose only after its claims had not been upheld and its actions were found internationally wrongful. See the Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project (Hungary/Slovakia), Judgment, ICJ Reports 1997, para. 82.\n⁶⁶ Lu Jiafei &amp; Xu Jianmei, supra note 5.\n⁶⁷ Gary Corn &amp; Eric Talbot Jensen, supra note 37.\n⁶⁸ See Article 52 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States.\nWuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers countermeasures are highly likely in cyberspace. Cyberattacks are often both unpredictable and can spread rapidly over a short period of time, even capable of significantly impairing critical infrastructure.⁶⁹ Thus any delay in time may cause unknown and even irreparable damage. In such circumstances, the victim State may take urgent countermeasures without prior notification to the injuring State. For example, a State is being attacked by a serious internationally wrongful cyber operation. The injured State intends to respond by blocking all electronic access to the bank accounts of the responsible State. If the responsible State is notified of that intention, it will have the opportunity to transfer the assets out of the country, effectively depriving the injured State of the possibility of taking such countermeasure.⁷⁰ Therefore, urgent countermeasure is of significant practical implications as they may be used more widely in cyberspace.\n## 3. Dispute Settlement Mechanisms International laws provide for dispute settlement mechanisms capable of rendering a binding decision on a dispute, thus offering relief to the injured State. This would undermine the very underlying reason that justify countermeasure, i.e., international law lacks a centralized enforcement mechanism. In addition, such mechanisms may reach a final resolution of the disputes between the states. By contrast, countermeasures are temporary in nature and cannot solve the dispute definitively, and the dispute may eventually be submitted to dispute settlement procedures. Thus the countermeasure is a less favored means of dispute resolution.\nThe relationship between countermeasures and dispute settlement mechanisms was one of the most controversial issues in the formulation of Draft Articles on Responsibility of States. The special rapporteur, Gaetano Arangio Ruiz, advocated the idea that the injured State is obliged to submit the dispute to the dispute settlement procedure before resorting to countermeasures, which is also reflected in the text he drafted.⁷¹ However, this view was not supported by States. The final text provides, in Article 52(3), that Countermeasures may not be taken, and if already taken must be suspended without undue delay if the dispute is pending before a court or tribunal which has the authority to make decisions binding on the parties.⁷² In the process of formulating the Tallinn Manual 2.0, the majority of the International Group of Experts adopted the position of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States. However, the application of the rule was not without controversy. Members of the International Group of Experts were divided on whether or not such obligation is absolute. Some experts held the opinion that such ⁶⁹ See Katharine C. Hinkle, Countermeasures in the Cyber Context: One More Thing to Worry about, 37 Yale Journal of International Law Online 11 (2011).\n⁷⁰ See Michael N. Schmitt, supra note 2, at 234–235.\n⁷¹ Mary Ellen O’Connell, supra note 17, at 258.\n⁷² The phrase “court or tribunal” refers to any third-party dispute settlement procedure, whatever its designation. The court or tribunal must have the power to order interim measures that are capable of protecting the purportedly injured State. See Michael N. Schmitt, supra note 2, at 235.\nThe Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law a dispute settlement mechanism is mandatory if it is explicitly required by international law. On the other hand, a minority of the experts argued that, rather than creating an absolute obligation, a case-by-case analysis should be undertaken to evaluate whether a third-party dispute settlement body had sufficient capacities to protect the rights of the injured State thus providing an effective alternative to countermeasures.^[73]^ It is submitted that dispute settlement mechanisms do not exclude countermeasures and resort to dispute settlement procedure is not a prerequisite procedural requirement for the taking of countermeasures. Under current international law, dispute settlement mechanisms are not substitute for countermeasures and provisional and urgent countermeasures are allowed even after a dispute has been submitted to a mandatory dispute settlement mechanism.^[74]^ This is particularly the case in cyberspace. Damage caused by cyberattacks could spread rapidly in a short period of time, sometimes even beyond the control of the attackers, which traditional dispute settlement mechanisms of international law may be ill-equipped to address.^[75]^ Therefore, countermeasures may be excluded only if treaties between the states involved contain technical defensive measures that are effective in induce the responsible State to comply with its international obligations and to prevent further damage, thus able to provide the victim State appropriate mechanism for remedy. Otherwise, the taking of countermeasures should not be precluded in cyberspace, even if the dispute is subject to a dispute settlement process.\n## V. Substantive Requirement for Taking Countermeasures in Cyberspace: The Principle of Proportionality Countermeasures taken by the injured State must comply with the principle of proportionality. If the countermeasures exceed the reasonable boundary set by the proportionality test, they will be punitive and retaliatory in nature and will no longer be legitimate under international law but rather an internationally wrongful act.^[76]^ Article 51 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States provides that countermeasures must be commensurate with the injury suffered. Under the proportionality test, countermeasures are assessed against the injuries suffered, not only in purely “quantitative” terms but also “qualitative” factors. This proportionality is equally applicable to countermeasures in cyberspace, which was clearly confirmed in the report published by the UNGGE in 2015.^[77]^ ^[73]^ *Id.*, at 235.\n^[74]^ *Id.*, at 236.\n^[75]^ Trojans can have multiple variants as they spread.

Cases Applying the Principle of Proportionality Assessing the proportionality of a countermeasure is not only controversial but also challenging. The principle of proportionality is concerned with the intensity of countermeasures, aiming to establish a benchmark for countermeasures and restrict them within a reasonable limit. Such test essentially is matter of degree and the outcome of applying the principle of proportionality is unpredictable. The International Law Commission points out explicitly that what is proportionate is not a matter which can be determined precisely and can at best be accomplished by approximation. The Draft Articles on Responsibility of States does not set out any specific rules on the application of the proportionality test, but only provide the factors to be considered: (1) the extent of the injury suffered; (2) the gravity of the internationally wrongful act; (3) the rights of the injured and responsible State (and interests of other States) that are affected; and (4) the necessity of inducing the responsible State to fulfill its obligations. This exercise involves value judgment and balancing of interests, thus subjective in nature. Moreover, the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States does not articulate the hierarchy of these factors elements. Therefore, there is still no clear guidance on the application of the principle of proportionality, lacking much-needed predictability and certainty.\nThere are very few cases concerning the proportionality of countermeasures in current international law, among which the only successful one is the Air Service Agreement arbitration case in 1978. In 1946, France and the USA signed a bilateral agreement to open international air routes between the two States. Disputes arose between the two countries when France refused to allow a change of gauge in London by American flights. As a countermeasure, the USA planned to suspend some flights from Paris to the U.S. In its award, the arbitral tribunal did not make a quantitative analysis of the damage caused by the French wrongful act and the impact of the American countermeasure, but rather a qualitative analysis of the impact of the French illegal act. The key factor considered by the Tribunal was the importance of legal principles involved to the USA, and especially its impact on American aviation policy. Since the 1970s, the USA has pursued the policy of aviation liberalization and concluded a number of air transport agreements with other States, promoting the opening of international air transport market. The French act restricted the freedom of air transportation, which was incompatible with American aviation policy. In addition, bilateral treaties signed by the USA with other States also contained similar provisions on change of gauge. The French act would affect the interpretation and application of these provisions, which may have significant adverse impact on America. Therefore, the arbitral tribunal concluded that the U.S. countermeasure did not obviously violate the principle of proportionality. In this case, the key The Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law factors considered by the tribunal, i.e., the importance of the aviation policy and the potential impact of the damage, involves qualitative evaluation which is a general approximation rather than an accurate quantitative measurement.\nAnother one is the Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project case in 1997 in which the principle of proportionality was applied and a negative conclusion was made.⁸⁵ In this case, Hungary and Slovakia signed an agreement to jointly build a dam on the Danube in 1977. During the implementation of the agreement, Hungary unilaterally terminated the construction of the dam. As a countermeasure, Slovakia diverted the Danube in its territory to intercept water resources.⁸⁶ Different from the Air Service Agreement case, the ICJ combined quantitative and qualitative analysis in this case. First, from a qualitative perspective, the Court pointed out that the countermeasure had affected Hungary's important rights to equitable and reasonable share of natural resources of the Danube, including both navigational and non-navigational use. Second, the Court analyzed the intensity of the countermeasure taken by Slovakia. It held that Slovakia had unilaterally diversified and controlled 80% to 90% of water resources of the Danube. Measures with such magnitude will have a significant impact on the ecosystem of the Danube basin, clearly exceeding the reasonable limit, and thus inconsistent with the principle of proportionality.⁸⁷ In this case, the Danube is an important international river. The sheer volume of water being diversified, 80% to 90%, was a prima facie indication that the measure was probably out of proportionality. Thus it is a relatively easy case to adjudicate. However, if the amount of water resources affected by the countermeasure was in the range of 10% to 50%, the issue of proportionality would be in the grey area.\n## 2. The Benchmark for the Proportionality test The benchmark for the proportionality test is also a controversial issue. The Draft Articles on Responsibility of States set injury as the benchmark for evaluating proportionality, allowing the injured State to retaliate against the injuring State with an equivalent damage, and thus forcing the injuring State to cease the infringement. This is not fundamentally different from the private retaliation of\"an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.\"It may lead to countermeasure going beyond what is strictly necessary for its very purpose and become punitive in nature. Therefore, there are inherent contradictions in the regime on countermeasures as set out by the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States.⁸⁸ This benchmark works well only among States with comparable strength. On the other hand, if there is a significant gap in strength between the countries involved, ⁸⁵ See the Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project (Hungary/Slovakia), Judgment, ICJ Reports 1997.\n⁸⁶ In the judgment, the ICJ adopted a two-step approach. First, the Court found that Hungary violated the treaty concluded by both parties, which constituted an internationally wrongful act. Secondly, the Court discussed whether Slovakia's acts constituted countermeasures, one of the most important factor of which was the principle of proportionality. *Id.*, at para. 82.\n⁸⁷ *Id.*, at paras. 85–86.\n⁸⁸ See Nigel White &amp; Ademola Abass, *Countermeasures and Sanctions*, in Malcolm Evans ed., International Law, at 513 (Cambridge University Press 2018).\nWuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers countermeasure as under the current proportionality test may be abused by those powerful States as an excuse to bully the weak ones.\nIn recent years, some scholars proposed a functional approach towards the proportionality test, arguing that the purpose to be achieved d by countermeasures shall be used as the benchmark. Countermeasures are instrumental, and their purposes are to force the injuring State to cease its wrongful act and to comply with its international obligations, so that the relations between the two States can be restored. Therefore, the proportionality of countermeasures should be assessed against its purpose, irrespective of whether they exceed the intensity of the wrongful act.⁸⁹ In April 2007, Estonia suffered a three-week-long DDoS cyberattack and a large number of critical infrastructure websites, including those of government agencies, were forced to shut down, resulting in network paralysis and service disruption with severe damage.⁹⁰ If the cyberattack could be attributed to Russia, Estonia could respond with DDoS countermeasures. In terms of the intensity, Estonia may not achieve its purpose if the countermeasures were of equivalent magnitude as that of the cyberattack because Russia's size and strength are far greater than Estonia's. Achieving the purpose of inducing Russia to cease its internationally wrongful act would likely require countermeasures that far exceed the damage caused by Russia's wrongful act. Therefore, taking the purpose of countermeasures as the benchmark is more in line with their very aim. Meanwhile, such approach taking into consideration the differences in strength of nations, prevents the abuse by stronger State, thus more fair and equitable.\nTherefore, the principle of proportionality lacks clear rules and is full of uncertainties. Its application in cyberspace is even more challenging.⁹¹ This is because cyberspace is interconnected and cyberattacks are dynamic and constantly changing, making it difficult and time-consuming to assess the damage caused. The injured State shall be extremely cautious when evaluating the proportionality of the countermeasures. This will not preclude the possibility for taking countermeasures in response to cyberattacks. A practical approach is to adopt cyber measures as an effective response to cyberattacks,⁹² because this type of countermeasures is of the same nature as the wrongful act and is more likely to be regarded as consistent with the principle of proportionality.⁹³ ⁸⁹ See Enzo Cannizzaro, *The Role of Proportionality in the Law of International Countermeasure*, 12 European Journal of International Law 889 (2001).\n⁹⁰ See Ma Chunmao, *A Review of Estonia’s Cyber Warfare*, at https://tech.sina.com.cn/i/2009-02-04/08172791102.shtml (last visited June 3, 2019).\n⁹¹ See Nicholas Tsagourias, *The Law Applicable to Countermeasures against Low Intensity Cyber Operations*, 14 Baltic Yearbook of International Law Online 105 (2015).\n⁹² Proportionality does not mean reciprocity. The obligation breached by countermeasures does not necessarily need to be same as the obligation breached by the responsible State, nor does the nature and means of the countermeasure.\n⁹³ See Paragraph 5 of the commentary to the introductory part of Chapter II in Part Three of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States.\nThe Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law Traditionally cyberattacks are dealt with through a passive defense system, consisting of a firewall, intrusion detection and prevention mechanism with antivirus software as the commonly deployed technology. Under such system, only after it is attacked will the antivirus software be able to obtain the vital information and code of the virus and update its database. So that the same viruses can be detected and removed next time they appear. The inherent deficiency is that only after the virus attacks can loopholes in the system be identified and fixed. Thus the antivirus software is always behind the virus and even the most sophisticated firewall may be breached. As a result, passive defense cannot does not offer satisfactory solution to network security. Modern network security is increasingly rely on active defense through early detection of cyberattacks and deception techniques to contain and constrain the attacks. For example, sandbox and honeypot are commonly used technical methods, which in fact deliberately expose some vulnerabilities for attackers and then to obtain critical information of the attackers when they intrude the system. These techniques offers protection to the system and buys time for the injured State to examine the cyberattack and to develop appropriate countermeasures.[94] Such means do not compromise or damage the attacker's network facilities or computer systems, thus consistent with the principle of proportionality.\nMore extreme active defenses measures are even aggressive in nature, i.e., hacking back. Such technics involve hacking into the attacker's computer system, erasing the stolen data, or even planting ransomware. This type of defense involves cyber measures thus similar to cyberattacks in nature. However, this does not necessarily mean such measures fulfill the proportionality test because equivalence in nature is only one of the factors considered in the evaluation of proportionality. In practice, it is still necessary to consider other factors of the proportionality test and keeping cyber countermeasures within the reasonable limits allowed by international law.\nIn summary, the application of the principle proportionality is controversial and challenging. The Draft Articles on Responsibility of States fails to provide clear guidance, but only lists the factors to be considered. Furthermore, the benchmark against which proportionality is assessed against is not without controversy. Considerable uncertainties remain with regard to the application of countermeasures in cyberspace. A practical and effective approach is to adopt cyber countermeasures in response to cyberattacks and ensure the impact of such measures are within a reasonable limit.\n# VI. Conclusion The fundamental aim of international law on the countermeasure is to limit it to a reasonable extent and prevent such measures being abused leading to the escalation of disputes. However, the boundaries of countermeasures permitted by international law remains unsettled. During the [94] If the attacker took advantage of the vulnerabilities of the honeypot to launch a cyberattack against a third country, the State that set up the honeypot may be found violating its due diligence obligations.\nWuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers drafting process of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States, every rule on countermeasures had been a matter of controversy. Major differences among States on this issue were also highlighted at the 2017 Session of the UNGGE, where disagreements led to the absence of a consensus report and the breakdown of negotiations. The function and mission of the UNGGE is not to create or modify the rules of international law in cyberspace, but to discuss how international law is applied. Thus despite the failure of the negotiation process of the UNGGE, international law, including rules on countermeasures, is still applicable to cyberspace. This basic position has been confirmed by the International Group of Experts in its 2015 report.\nCompared with the traditional physical space of State sovereignty, cyberspace as a relatively new domain has its own unique features, creating new issues to the application of countermeasures. Current international law on the countermeasure as articulated in the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States, imposing stringent conditions to prevent its abuse, are ill-equipped to deal with cyberattacks. It adopts the basic position that countermeasure is illegal per se, to discourage its usage in practice. The prerequisites for taking countermeasures is the existence of internationally wrongful acts; in cyberspace the attribution of cyberattacks to States is challenging. In addition, the procedural requirements for taking countermeasure are impractical in cyberspace and the proportionality test is highly subjective and unpredictable. These facts have greatly diminished the effectiveness and certainty of the application of countermeasures in cyberspace. This is one of the major reason why there are few cases where state invoked countermeasures. Therefore, current international law does not offer clear rules and guidance on how to apply countermeasures in cyberspace. The international law regime on this issue is still at the early stage of development and is still evolving.\n(Translators: Meng Chao &amp; Wang Yi)"

Introduction In recent years, cyberattacks have become more frequent. How to respond to cyberattacks and maintain cyber security has become an issue with significant strategic and practical implications that needs to be addressed urgently in the international community. Under international law, the injured State enjoys the right of self-defense against internationally wrongful acts that have reached the level of armed attack.¹ However, in practice, most cyberattacks do not reach the required threshold of use of force, letting alone an armed attack.² Taking the 2010 “Stuxnet” Incident for example, the prevailing view was that the cyberattacks did not constitute an armed attack in international law, notwithstanding that the virus had led to the damage of thousands of Iranian uranium enrichment centrifuges. Therefore, in most cases, a State is not able to exercise its right to self-defense against a cyberattack.³ * ZHU Lei (朱磊), Ph.D. in Law, associate professor at the Wuhan University Institute of International Law in China.\n¹ Armed attacks are the most serious type of use of force, according to the International Court of Justice’s opinion in the Nicaragua case. See Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), Judgement, ICJ Reports 1986, para.191.\n² See Michael N. Schmitt ed., Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations, at 538–531 (2nd edition, Cambridge University Press 2017). The book propose eight factors for assessing whether a cyberattack constitutes the use of force, including, severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability of effects, military character, state involvement and presumptive legality.\n³ See Robin Geiss &amp; Henning Lahmann, Freedom and Security in Cyberspace: Shifting the Focus Away from Military Responses towards Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention, in Katharina Ziolkowski ed., Peacetime Regime for State Activities in Cyberspace: International Law, International Relations and Diplomacy, at 628 (NATO CCDCOE Publication 2013).\nWuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers In response to these cyberattacks which do not rise to the level of an armed attack, States tend to respond in a non-forceful and peaceful manner in practice. For example, in January 2015, the United States (\"USA\") imposed economic sanctions on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea as a response to the cyberattack on Sony Pictures Entertainment.⁴ In response to the allegation that Russia had interfered in the United States' General Election through cyberattacks, the USA announced the expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats in December 2016.⁵ Cyberspace is considered as the new frontier of national sovereignty and international law is applicable in this area.⁶ The legal nature and status of the actions taken by the injured State in response to cyberattacks under international law is an issue that deserves serious consideration, in which the central issue involved is that of countermeasures. Similar to the right of self-defense, it allows a State to take its own measures of private remedies against an internationally wrongful act. Where certain conditions are met, it can preclude the wrongfulness of those measures and thereby relieve the responsibility of the State.\nThe countermeasure as a customary international law with a long history is controversial in international law. Its application to cyberspace is even more challenging because as an emerging field of science and technology, cyberspace has characteristics different from those areas of traditional State sovereignty. This paper analyzes how countermeasures in international law are applied to cyberspace in light of the characteristics of cyberspace, and examines the main issues and controversies in the application of countermeasures to cyberspace.\n\n---\n\n## # VI.

Its application to cyberspace is even more challenging because as an emerging field of science and technology, cyberspace has characteristics different from those areas of traditional State sovereignty. This paper analyzes how countermeasures in international law are applied to cyberspace in light of the characteristics of cyberspace, and examines the main issues and controversies in the application of countermeasures to cyberspace.\n\n## II. The Historical Development and Inherent Contradictories of Countermeasures\n\n## 1. Historical Development of Countermeasures\n\nThe term \"countermeasure\" was first used by the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office of the United Kingdom in 1916 in its correspondences with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Sweden.⁷ And the first detailed discussion on countermeasures was in the *Air Services Agreement* arbitration case in 1978.⁸ In this case, the USA made its claim based on countermeasures, which\n\n⁴ See Zhuang Xiaodan, *Revenge for Sony Pictures?

See UN, A/68/98.\n\n⁷ See Omer Yousif Elagab, *The Place of Non-Forcible Counter-Measures in Contemporary International Law*, in Guy S. Goodwin-Gill &amp; Stefan Talmon eds., *The Reality of International Law: Essays in Honour of Ian Brownlie*, at 125 (Oxford University Press 1999).\n\n⁸ See the *Air Service Agreement* of 27 March 1946 between the United States of America and France (1978) 18 RIAA 417.",
    "The Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law\n\nwas upheld by the Arbitral Tribunal.⁹ The term was widely used after the Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (“Draft Articles on Responsibility of States”), adopted by the International Law Commission of the United Nations (“UNILC”) in 2001, which used the term and contained detailed rules on countermeasures in seven articles.¹⁰\n\nThe historical root of countermeasures is found in the traditional international law concept of reprisals,¹¹ which is essentially a mechanism of private remedy. The concept of “countermeasures” is used as a synonym for “reprisals” and inherits the key elements of the latter. The institution of reprisals in international law has a long history and its development can be divided into three stages.\n\nThe first stage was a completely liberal private reprisal, which was common in the early stage of the development of the rule of law, during which the State apparatus was not yet in place and public enforcement mechanisms for the law were missing. Where the rights of individuals were violated without remedy from public power, they could take it upon themselves to enforce the law and take reprisals as a means of obtaining the relief. In ancient Greece, the customary law of seizing foreigners existed in the city-states of Athens. Where a citizen of a city-state was killed by a foreigner or the government, the relatives of the victim enjoyed the right to capture and detain three citizens of that foreign state as hostages and demand that the perpetrator be presented or compensated. Where the claim was not met, the victim’s relatives would enjoy the right to kill the hostages to pay back the blood debt.¹²\n\nThe second stage was the reprisal authorized by the State, essentially to incorporate reprisal into the framework of State regulation. The letter of reprisal¹³ offers a good example. It has its roots in Roman law.¹⁴ In ancient Rome, public authorities became involved in the system of reprisals and regulated it strictly. If the rights of a Roman citizen (especially a merchant) were violated by an alien, the victim could seize the citizen of that State to retaliate with procedural and substantive restrictions. Before the reprisal could be carried out, the victim must apply to the relevant State authority for a permit to do so. The precondition of obtaining the permit is that the victim had been treated unfairly by the courts of a foreign State and that his or her damages could not be compensated and his or her rights could not be remedied. The scope must be limited to the actual damage suffered by the victim and the seizure by force can be carried out only within the Roman territory or on international waters.¹⁵\n\n⁹ Omer Yousif Elagab, supra note 7, at 125–126.\n\n¹⁰ The International Court of Justice referred to the term twice in 1980 in the United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran case, and several times in the Nicaragua case in 1986.\n\n¹¹ See Malcolm N. Shaw, International Law 794 (Cambridge University Press 2008).\n\n¹² See David J. Bederman, International Law in Antiquity, at 123 (Cambridge University Press 2007).\n\n¹³ Letter of reprisal is also known as letter of marquee.\n\n¹⁴ Its modern formulation can be found in the Constitution of the United States of America, which in Section 8 of Article 1 authorizes the Congress to grant letters of marque and reprisal.\n\n¹⁵ See Wilhelm G. Grewe, The Epochs of International Law, at 117 (De Gruyter 2000).",
    "Wuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers\n\nDuring the medieval period, reprisals centered on the letter of marquee, whereby armed privateers, with government concession, may chase and destroy foreign lawbreakers and fleets, as well as attack and plunder enemy merchant ships. By the 16th Century, wartime plundering became quite widespread and many States began to legislate and regulate the granting of such letters. Hugo Grotius in his book (1604), *De Jure Praedae*, legally defended the act of Dutch ships attacking Portuguese and Spanish ships. He argued that the granting of permit was akin to declaring a “private war,” justified by the fact that the laws of each State had no effective jurisdiction over the seas and that merchant ships had to arm themselves in self-defense.^[16]^\n\nThe third stage was to prohibit the use of forcible reprisal. Traditional reprisal includes both forcible and non-forcible means, the majority of which is forcible. In the early 20th Century, the international community restricted the use of force through a series of conventions. Modern international law prohibits the use of force and the Charter of the United Nations explicitly prohibits the use of force and the threat of force. As a result, forcible reprisal eventually receded from the stage of history. Accordingly, the term “countermeasures,” also known as “non-forcible reprisal,” was adopted to conform to the development of modern international law, which corresponded to reprisals by non-forcible means. In this way, the term can distinguish itself from reprisals by force and avoid the negative connotations associated with the concept of reprisals in traditional international law.^[17]^\n\n## 2. The Inherent Contradictories of Countermeasures\n\nA review of the historical development reveals its inherent tensions and contradictories, which is also the core issue to be addressed in contemporary international law. On the one hand, the existence of countermeasures is justified. In the absence of adequate public enforcement mechanisms when the rule of law is weak, reprisal offers a workable and efficient private solution. In domestic law, with the development of the rule of law, private enforcement of the law was increasingly limited and ultimately superseded by public enforcement of the law. By contrast, international law is based on the principle of sovereign equality and the international community is an egalitarian society. International law has an inherent flaw in that it lacks a centralized enforcement mechanism with enforcement authority that overrides the State, resulting in inadequate supply of public remedies. Therefore, it is necessary to have countermeasures as a form of private national remedies.\n\nThe essence of countermeasures, on the other hand, is to leave law enforcement in private hands, which could be harmful and even dangerous. Without any constraints, reprisal is highly vulnerable to abuse, plunging the international law into law of the jungle. Though the medieval letter of marquee was under the State’s regulation, it was often no different than piracy in practice. Bartolus de Saxoferrato (1314-1357), a famous European medieval jurist, wrote in a work published in\n\n^[16] See Hugo Grotius, *Commentary on the Law of Prize and Booty*, at 62 (Liberty Fund 2012).\n\n^[17] See Mary Ellen O’Connell, *The Power and Purpose of International Law: Insights from the Theory and Practice of Enforcement*, at 233 (Oxford University Press 2011).",
    "The Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law\n\n1354 that reprisal was an “odious remedy” that could result in counter-retaliation, intensifying conflicts between the two nations, and sabotage their interactions as well as their economic and trade relations.¹⁸ He, therefore, pushed for tight restrictions on reprisals.\n\nBut, how can the balance between the reasonableness and the harm of countermeasures be achieved? This is the most difficult and contentious issue in the modern international law regime on countermeasures, which is also evident in the drafting process of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States. Although the majority of States recognized the necessity of countermeasures, many expressed concerns about the harmfulness of countermeasures. Therefore, in order to prevent the abuse of countermeasures, the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States adopted the principle of “conditional lawfulness” for countermeasures and set strict requirements for their implementation, in an attempt to prevent such measures from becoming tools for strong States to oppress weak States. Only countermeasures that have met these conditions are lawful; otherwise, they would be considered as internationally wrongful acts.\n\nThe rules established in the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States are the authoritative expression of modern international law on countermeasures, but they are also highly contentious. The fundamental disagreement during the development of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States was over the legal status of countermeasures, especially whether they are lawful or unlawful in nature. Representatives of some States took a positive attitude towards countermeasures, proposing that countermeasures are lawful in themselves, which are the rights enjoyed by States in international law, and are unlawful only under certain exceptional circumstances. However, this view was not supported by the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States which regarded countermeasures as unlawful *per se*.¹⁹ Countermeasures are internationally wrongful act that are in breach of internationally law, with the possibility of excluding the international wrongfulness of the act under certain circumstances. Therefore, countermeasures involve a situation excluding the wrongfulness of the act and may be invoked a defense to the accusation of internationally wrongful act. This fundamental stance taken by the UNILC is to discourage rather than promote the use of countermeasures.\n\nIn summary, countermeasures are the private enforcement of the law and have certain negative consequences. The historical development of countermeasures is a process of introducing more restrictions on its use and to bring it under the regulation of the law. In the meanwhile, international community is egalitarian in nature, which provides the solid foundation for its existence as an accepted form of enforcement under customary international law. Setting clear requirements for their use, mitigating their harmfulness, and limiting their application within an acceptable boundary are the key purpose for modern international law regime on countermeasures.\n\n¹⁸ Wilhelm G. Grewe, *supra* note 15, at 117.\n\n¹⁹ This basic principle is also reflected in Tallinn Manual 2.0 on International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations. See Michael N. Schmitt, *supra* note 2, at 225.",
    "Wuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers\n\n## III. Prerequisites for Taking Countermeasures in Cyberspace: Internationally Wrongful Acts in Cyberspace\n\n## 1. Temporal Limitation of Countermeasures\n\nThe existence of an internationally wrongful act is a prerequisite for taking countermeasures, which is the primary reason for the exclusion of its wrongfulness.²⁰ Countermeasures are similar to self-defense in this regard, which are taken in response to a prior internationally wrongful act by another State. As a result, countermeasures should be considered as the “shield” for defense rather than the “spear” for offense. The absence of an effective enforcement mechanism in international law allows the injured State to suspend its international obligations only when the other State has violated the law in the first place. In other words, the essence of countermeasures is to counteract an internationally wrongful act with an illegal act, with the goal of forcing the injuring State to resume its international obligations and restore normal relations between the two nations. Therefore, countermeasures are a part of the enforcement mechanism of international law, through which the injured State are able to protect its own rights and interests, thus also a mechanism of remedy in international law.\n\nCountermeasures must be taken against an ongoing internationally wrongful act and are not preventive or prospective. Once the wrongful act ceases, the countermeasures must also be ceased.²¹ Thus, if a cyberattack has not yet occurred or has ended, the injured State shall not take countermeasures. This rule significantly limits the possibility of an injured State to take countermeasures in response to a cyber-related wrongful act, because unlike traditional internationally wrongful acts, most cyberattacks are sudden and short-lived, leaving only a relatively limited period of time for an injured State to respond and diminishing the possibility of taking countermeasures in response to a cyberattack.\n\nIt is worth noting that modern cyberattacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, often requiring a large investment of manpower and resources, and their complexity and destructive power may be no less than a small-scale war.²² Complex cyberattacks take a long time from planning to actual implementation involving multiple steps such as intelligence collection, vulnerability detection, intrusion and infiltration into the network, and virus implantation. They often require coordination and cooperation of a professional and technical team. The time span of cyberattacks provides the opportunities and possibilities for injured State to monitor and detect cyberattacks earlier.\n\n---\n\n²⁰ See Denis Alland, *Countermeasures of General Interest*, 13 European Journal of International Law 1221 (2002).\n\n²¹ See Maurice Kamto, *The Time Factor in the Application of Countermeasures*, in James Crawford et al. eds., *The Law of International Responsibility*, at 1176 (Oxford University Press 2010).\n\n²² See Jiang Shibo, *Cyber Attacks and the Application of the Laws of War*, 16(2) Wuhan University International Law Review 43–70 (2014).",
    "The Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law\n\nThe cyberattack on the Ukrainian power grid on 23 December 2015 offers a good illustration. The cyberattack began in the spring of 2014, when the attackers first spear-phished IT staff and system administrators, causing viruses to infect systems and opening backdoors for subsequent cyberattacks. Over the following months, the attackers conducted extensive network reconnaissance, exploration and mapping efforts and gained the ability to manage user accounts within the network and employee login credentials. The final step of the cyberattack consisted of a series of coordinated actions, including reconfiguring the uninterruptible power supply, disconnecting the circuit breaker to take the substation offline, and launching a denial-of-service attack on the customer call center.[23]\n\nIn order to deal with sophisticated cyberattacks, the injured State should develop and improve its capabilities of cyber-related technology, strengthen real-time supervision over cyberattacks, detect ongoing cyberattacks at an early stage, and fix vulnerabilities of the system and strengthen measures for cyber prevention and defense. If the cyberattack is still at such an early stage as the planning, vulnerability detection and intelligence gathering, the injured State should exercise restraint and should not take countermeasures; otherwise, it may cause miscalculation and lead to the escalation of disputes. Once a cyberattack enters the next stage of implementation, such as planting viruses and stealing account information, etc., it constitutes an internationally wrongful act in violation of international law, at which time the injured State may take countermeasures against the act without waiting for the final stage of the cyberattack to unfold.\n\n## 2. Attribution of Internationally Wrongful Acts\n\nUnder international law, countermeasures are measures taken by a state against another state, which carries two important implications. Although enterprises are frequently subject to cyberattacks,[24] the measures taken by enterprises in response to cyberattacks do not constitute the countermeasures under international law.[25] Second, the object of countermeasures must be the State rather than non-State actors. In reality, there are very few inter-State cyberattacks, and most of such attacks are initiated by private non-State actors (e.g., patriotic hackers and lone wolves).[26] The first issue to be addressed in determining whether there is an internationally wrongful act is the attribution of cyberattacks, i.e., whether privately committed acts can be attributed to the State and constitute acts of the State.[27] If a cyberattack committed by a non-State actor is not attributed to the State, it\n\n[23] See Kim Zetter, Inside the Cunning, Unprecedented Hack of Ukraine’s Power Grid, at https://www.wired.com/2016/03/inside-cunning-unprecedented-hack-ukraines-power-grid/ (last visited June 3, 2023).\n\n[24] The 2017 Annual Internet Security Report released by Tencent Security pointed out that up to 86% of companies worldwide had experienced at least one cyberattack in 2017.

    "Wuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers\n\nmay constitute a violation of domestic law, but not an internationally wrongful act in violation of international law, and the injured State cannot take countermeasures against such acts.²⁸\n\nAttribution is an extremely challenging issue in identifying State responsibility in cyberspace, involving three layers of attribution. First, from the technical perspective, unlike traditional physical domains such as sea, land and air, the cyberspace is a decentralized system. Cyberspace is open, pluralistic, interoperable, and anonymous, and attackers often use encryption technology to transmit information in packets to hide their identities and sources, making the investigation of the source of cyberattacks quite complex, costly and protracted.²⁹\n\nSecond, after locating the source of cyberattacks through technical means, the subject behind the cyberattacks also needs to be identified. Even if the IP address is traced to a State's cyber infrastructure, it may not meet the criteria of burden of proof for attribution because IP addresses can be spoofed. For example, in 2013, an organization impersonating its IP address as from the Ukrainian government conducted cyber operations against the NATO Cyber Cooperative Defense Center of Excellence, the Estonian Defense Forces, and the armed forces of other NATO countries. Clearly, the conduct could not be attributed to the Ukrainian government.³⁰\n\nFinally, it remains to determine whether the act committed by the attackers constitutes the act of a State, i.e., legal attribution. The key issue is whether cyberattacks committed by non-State actors can be attributed to the State and constitute internationally wrongful acts that entails State responsibility. The challenge is degree of connection required for attribution to the State the cyberattacks committed by non-State actors. Under Article 8 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States, the conduct of non-State actors acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of a State is attributable to that State. The International Court of Justice (\"ICJ\") established the doctrine of \"effective control\" in the Nicaragua case in 1987. In that case, the USA played a significant and decisive role in financing, organizing, training, supplying, and equipping the Nicaraguan Contras, but the ICJ found that the series of U.S. acts did not constitute \"effective control\"³¹ and thus could not meet the standard of attribution.\n\nThe doctrine of effective control requires the State play a direct and a leading role in the cyberattacks, not just a supporting one, setting a higher threshold for State responsibility for private conduct. For example, the USA believed that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea played a \"central role\" in the 2014 cyberattack on Sony Pictures, which rose to the level of effective control and imposed\n\n²⁸ See Michael N. Schmitt, *Peacetime Cyber Responses and Wartime Cyber Operations under International Law: An Analytical Vade Mecum*, 8 Harvard National Security Journal 260 (2017).\n\n²⁹ See Huang Zhixiong ed., *On Cyber Sovereignty—Jurisprudence, Policy and Practice*, at 39 (Social Sciences Academic Press 2017).\n\n³⁰ See Michael N.

Although these hackers had ties to the Iranian government, such ties did not rise to the level of effective control and therefore the attacks could not be attributed to Iran and the USA could not take countermeasures against Iran accordingly.³³\n\nThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 on International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations (“Tallinn Manual 2.0”) adopts the ICJ’s standard of effective control. It gives the following illustrative example. A State plans and oversees an operation to use a software update to implant a new vulnerability in software widely used by another state in its governmental computers. The former State enters into a confidential contract with the company that produced the software to embed the vulnerability and directs the course of action. In such a case the State planned, directed, and supervised over a particular cyberattack and took a leading and direct role in the operation, which is fundamentally different from the ancillary role played by the US government in the Nicaragua case and thus the company’s conduct is attributable to the State.³⁴\n\nThe doctrine of effective control adopts a relatively stringent criterion of attribution, which makes it difficult for the injured State to prove, thus severely limiting the application of countermeasures. In practice, the injuring State may not directly organize the implementation of cyberattacks, but indirectly support cyberattacks as a way to avoid State responsibility. Moreover, cyberattacks are secretive and complex, and attackers often use technical means to hide the source of the attack, so it is not easy to obtain conclusive evidence to prove the extent of State involvement in such cyberattacks and the role played by the State. And such evidence is often located in the injuring State or even across the globe, which is difficult to obtain and even if obtained, the timing for taking countermeasures may has already elapsed.³⁵ For example, Estonia was subjected to a DDoS attack in 2007 and investigation revealed that the source of the attack was computers from 178 countries, including Vietnam and the USA. The cyberattack lasted for three weeks, providing a valuable time for evidence collection and attribution. However, to date, there is still no conclusive evidence of to attribute the responsibility to Russia.³⁶\n\nIn summary, the rules on attribution in international law are established for traditional internationally wrongful acts and thus are difficult to apply to cyberspace. It has the effect of greatly limiting the possibility of taking countermeasures in cyberspace. Some scholars argued that the constraints of existing customary law should be lifted and States should be allowed to take countermeasures\n\n³² Zhuang Xiaodan, supra note 4.\n³³ See BBC: US Indicts 7 Iranian Hackers for Breaching Multiple Financial Firms, at https://news.youth.cn/gj/201603/t20160325_7779822.htm (last visited June 3, 2019).\n³⁴ See Michael N.

Due Diligence\n\nTo address the difficulty of attribution under the doctrine of effective control, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 introduces due diligence into cyberspace, proposing that a State must exercise due diligence in not allowing its territory, or territory or cyber infrastructure under its governmental control, to be used for cyber operations that affect the rights of, and produce serious adverse consequences for, other States.³⁸ This lowers the criterion of attribution required by the doctrine of effective control and reduces the threshold of State responsibility for acts of private subjects, essentially as a type of vicarious liability.³⁹ This is an important development and breakthrough compared to the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (Tallinn Manual 1.0).\n\nThe ICJ has affirmed the doctrine of due diligence in the Corfu Channel case,⁴⁰ the Tehran Hostage case,⁴¹ and the Nicaragua case.⁴² For example, in the Corfu Channel case, although the mines were not laid by Albania, the area where the incident occurred was Albanian territorial waters and Albania should bear the regulatory responsibility for that area. Also, judging from the geographical location and expertise, Albania had the knowledge of the mines laid in the Corfu Channel,⁴³ but failed to take relevant measures, and therefore should bear responsibility. The ICJ stated that every State has an obligation “not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States.”⁴⁴\n\nUnder the doctrine of due diligence, a State must take active measures to prevent, reduce or limit the occurrence of damage, which is essentially an obligation to prevent transnational damage. The infrastructure on which cyberspace is based is physical, located in a particular State, and falls within the sovereign jurisdiction of that State, and due diligence is equally applicable. This basic position was also adopted by the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Information Security (“UNGGE”) in its report issued in 2015.⁴⁵ Therefore, if a State violates due diligence in\n\n³⁷ See Gary Corn &amp; Eric Talbot Jensen, *The Use of Force and Cyber Countermeasures*, 32 Temple International &amp; Comparative Law Journal 127 (2018).\n\n³⁸ See Michael N.

    "The Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law\n\ncyberspace, it constitutes an internationally wrongful act and the injured State is entitled to take countermeasures.\n\nThe most controversial issue in practice is the scope of the obligation assumed by a State under the doctrine of due diligence. On this issue, two extreme positions should be avoided. If a liberal approach is adopted, i.e., a State assumes little or even no obligation, this will lead to the abuse of the principle of sovereignty, allowing the use of network facilities to infringe upon the interests of other States.\n\nOn the other hand, an expanded interpretation would broaden the scope of due diligence, constitute an unreasonable restriction on State sovereignty, which lacks a basis in international law. In this regard, the view of U.S. military judge Matthew J. Sklerov is quite representative. He advocated that strict criminal legislation and law enforcement could effectively prevent cyberattacks,⁴⁶ and argued that the State's obligation in cyberspace includes passing stringent criminal laws, conducting vigorous investigations, prosecuting attackers, and, during the investigation and prosecution, cooperating with the victim state of cyberattacks that originated from within their borders.⁴⁷ According to this view, knowledge of the occurrence of the damage is also not a requirement for the assumption of due diligence.⁴⁸ In other words, the State has the obligation to take active criminal action to prevent and stop illegal cyberattacks, and the State's negligence or omission in any respect constitutes tacit approval and sheltering of such attacks⁴⁹ and constitutes a violation of due diligence.\n\nIn practice, however, cyberattacks are often deceptive and disguised, and attackers may use the network infrastructure of other States to carry out remote attacks. Matthew J. Sklerov's view underestimated the complexity of cyberattacks in practice, which may lead to a misjudgment on state responsibility of cyberattacks. The USA, with its significant political, economic, and military position in the world, is often the target of cyberattacks, but it is difficult to hold the relevant States responsible in practice due to the problem of attribution. This view which expands the scope of due diligence attempts to lift the constraints and limitations under traditional rules of international law and to lower the threshold of State responsibility, thus enabling the USA to take countermeasures against other States more easily. Such practice should come under close scrutiny.\n\nThe appropriate approach on this issue is to return to the current framework of international law under which a State assumes due diligence responsibility only to the extent of knowledge on the occurrence of damage.⁵⁰ This basic principle was also endorsed in the report of the UNGGE issued in 2015, and is a commonly held position by States. Under this doctrine, knowledge may be actual\n\n⁴⁶ See Matthew J.

A State may be found to have actual knowledge of a cyberattack if it has detected or has been notified by the injured State of an attack originating from that country.^[51]^ The essence of constructive knowledge is the reverse of the burden of proof. The challenge of attribution in cyberspace is evidence, and in the case of constructive knowledge the burden of proof is shifted to the territorial State where the cyberattack originated which have more evidence than the victim state. Therefore it is presumed to have knowledge of the cyberattack with the possibility of rebuttal.^[52]^\n\nWith the sheer number of Internet users and the technology to hide their identities and even erase traces of Internet access, it is almost impossible to achieve complete and comprehensive regulation in cyberspace. But this does not mean that the State is unaware of cyber operations within its borders. Whether a State is aware of cyberattacks is closely related to its technical capacities and the regulatory policy it adopts in cyberspace.\n\nCyberspace is highly complex and technical in nature, and cyber regulation relies on the relevant cyber technical capacities which many developing countries may lack. This is an important factor that must be taken into account when assessing knowledge. Otherwise, it may unduly expand the scope of due diligence obligations. On the other hand, every State regulates cyber activities within its territory to some extent, and an absolutely free cyberspace does not exist. Title V of the Convention on Cybercrime explicitly requires contracting parties to collect and record computer data in real time, which does not only include traffic data, but also content data.\n\nCyber supervision and regulation is common practice among states, and the difference lies in the degree of its stringency. If a State has strict supervision over cyberspace, it is more likely to know that a cyberattack has occurred, and it can even constitute \"constructive knowledge.\" For example, in May 2013, the U.S. energy security was significantly threatened by a cyberattack on the critical control systems of energy companies and attackers were even able to manipulate the oil and gas pipelines. The U.S. officials said that although there was no conclusive evidence that the cyberattack was supported by the Iranian government, it was unlikely that the Iranian government was unaware of the attack because the Iranian government had centralized control over the cyberspace.^[53]^ This offers a good example of the how the constructive knowledge may be applied in practice.\n\nIn summary, the precondition for taking countermeasures is the existence of an internationally wrongful act. What is challenging in cyberspace is how to attribute cyberattacks committed by non-State actors to the State. Under the traditional doctrine of effective control, the threshold for attribution is high and difficult to reach in cyberspace.

A balanced approach is that State responsibility only limited cyberattacks to which the State has knowledge of.\n\n## IV. Procedural Requirements for Taking Countermeasures in Cyberspace\n\n## 1. The Instrumentality of Countermeasures\n\nIn the application of countermeasures, the determination of an internationally wrongful act is unilateral in nature. The injured State makes its own judgment as to the existence of the internationally wrongful act and the gravity of the damage caused by such act, and makes its own decision as to whether or not and what countermeasures to take.^[54]^ For example, when the Sony Pictures Entertainment suffered a cyberattack in 2014, the U.S. Government, based on the information available to its intelligence community, believed that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea played a central role in the cyberattack, which constituted a State act. It then imposed economic sanctions on three Korean government agencies and officials.^[55]^ In this process, the US State had three roles to play, i.e., as the victim state of a cyberattack, the adjudicator of an internationally wrongful act, and implementer of countermeasures. This leads to an obvious conflict of interest and is prone to exaggerated assessment of the severity of the damage and the necessity of countermeasures, resulting in the escalation of disputes.^[56]^\n\nThe determination of an internationally wrongful act is a complex process of fact finding and application of law, which is not an easy task. There is no third-party body in the existing international law system to make an objective and neutral determination on the existence of an internationally wrongful act. In other words, countermeasures are taken on the basis of a one-sided claim of injured State and there is a possibility of abuse in practice. Some States may fabricate the existence of an internationally wrongful act and accuse another State of committing such act. Countermeasures may be used as a justification for the State to take measures such as sanctions, thus becoming a tool for strong countries to bully the weak. This is the greatest danger in the application of countermeasures in cyberspace, a cause for concern for developing countries in particular. Therefore, at the 2017 session of the UNGGE, developing countries, represented by Cuba, opposed the application of the right to self-defense and countermeasures to cyberspace.^[57]^\n\n^[54]^ Mary Ellen O’Connell, *supra* note 17, at 230.\n\n^[55]^ See Li Liangyong, *U.S. Sanctions North Korea over Sony “Hack,” No Response from North Korea*, at http://www.xinhuanet.com/world/2015-01/04/c_127354664.htm (last visited June 3, 2023).\n\n^[56]^ See N.

    "Wuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers\n\nIn order to prevent countermeasures from being abused and leading to the escalation of disputes, and to ensure that they are taken only when they are necessary to achieve their purpose, Article 52 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States set out a series of stringent procedural requirements for countermeasures. Countermeasures, which are instrumental in nature, are intended to induce the responsible State to cease its violations, to comply with and fulfill its international obligations again and to restore lawful relations between the two States. But, countermeasures are not the only way to achieve such end. The fundamental principle of peaceful settlement of international disputes is well established in modern international law[68] and Article 33 of the UN Charter provides a list of pacific methods,[59] which shall be given priority in international dispute settlement. In contrast, countermeasures are exceptional in nature[60] and shall be taken only as the last resort. The injured State should first seek to resolve the disputes through the usual dispute settlement methods contained in Article 33 of the UN Charter, rather than through countermeasures.\n\nThe victim State shall invoke State responsibility against the injuring State in the first instance. Countermeasures shall not be taken if the injuring State has ceased the wrongful act and undertaken to pay compensation. Second, the injured State should also comply with its obligation to notify in advance and to seek a negotiated settlement of the dispute; this is the second procedural requirement for the taking of countermeasures.[61] In this process, the case of state responsibility is presented to the injuring State and to put some pressure on it to cooperate, thus giving the injuring State a second chance.[62] Finally, an injured State may not take countermeasures when a dispute has already been submitted to a dispute settlement mechanism.\n\nThese procedural requirements for countermeasures apply equally in the cyberspace. In particular, the last two procedural requirements are controversial which triggered intense debate in the course of formulating the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States. Their application in cyberspace is even more challenging, which will be discussed below.\n\n## 2. Notification and Seeking to Settle Disputes through Negotiations\n\nIn order to prevent escalation of a dispute, the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States provides that the injured State should notify the responsible State of any decision to take countermeasures",
    "The Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law\n\nand offer to negotiate with that State.⁶³ In practice, notification and negotiation are not two separate steps. The purpose of notification is to give the injuring State an opportunity to respond. If the injuring State does so, it constitutes the start of negotiations between the Parties.⁶⁴ In cyberspace, notification is necessary because cyberattacks are often covert. Notification gives the responsible State an opportunity for clarification and prevents misjudgment and the escalation of disputes.\n\nHowever, the obligation to notify as a procedural requirement in cyberspace faces a number of challenges. First, it is not supported by current state practice. When a State take measures to respond to an internationally wrongful act, usually it does not invoke countermeasure as a justification. Even the issue is subject to a dispute settlement procedure, the victim State usually argues that its act complies with international law in the first instance. Countermeasures come into play only when the act is found to be internationally wrongful, i.e., as a defense and exemption from state responsibility.⁶⁵ Therefore, although there are a large number of cases in which countermeasures have been taken to respond to internationally wrongful acts, the number of cases in which countermeasures are invoked are very limited in practice. For example, the U.S. Government expelled Russian diplomatic officials in response to alleged Russia’s interference with the U.S. general election through cyberattacks in 2016, but it did not explicitly mention countermeasure as its legal basis.⁶⁶\n\nSecond, obligation to notify in cyberspace may be impractical. This is because the tracing the source of cyberattacks is complex and challenging. In practice, it is often difficult to identify who the attacker is and where it is originated, rendering notification being impossible. Furthermore, prior notification is likely to diminish the effectiveness of countermeasures in cyberspace.⁶⁷ This is particularly the case if countermeasures are taken through cyber means. Once the injuring State becomes aware of the countermeasures, the cyber tools can be captured and reused. Moreover, an injuring State, having been notified of countermeasures, may temporarily suspend cyberattacks as a means of avoiding such measures, because countermeasures shall cease as well in such situation. Therefore, prior notification may render countermeasures meaningless and ineffective.\n\nThe obligation to notify is not absolute and the injured State may take such urgent countermeasures as necessary.⁶⁸ This is also recognized by The Tallinn Manual 2.0 which points out that urgent\n\n⁶³ A small number of experts argued that negotiation is also one of the prior procedural requirement for taking countermeasures. The majority of experts did not agree and were in the opinion that this may be an excuse for the responsible State to stall for time. See Michael N. Schmitt, supra note 2, at 152.\n\n⁶⁴ Mary Ellen O’Connell, supra note 17, at 259.\n\n⁶⁵ For example, in the Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project case, Slovakia did not claim that its actions constitute countermeasures, instead revoked other grounds as justification. The application of countermeasures arose only after its claims had not been upheld and its actions were found internationally wrongful. See the Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project (Hungary/Slovakia), Judgment, ICJ Reports 1997, para. 82.\n\n⁶⁶ Lu Jiafei &amp; Xu Jianmei, supra note 5.\n\n⁶⁷ Gary Corn &amp; Eric Talbot Jensen, supra note 37.\n\n⁶⁸ See Article 52 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States.",
    "Wuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers\n\ncountermeasures are highly likely in cyberspace. Cyberattacks are often both unpredictable and can spread rapidly over a short period of time, even capable of significantly impairing critical infrastructure.⁶⁹ Thus any delay in time may cause unknown and even irreparable damage. In such circumstances, the victim State may take urgent countermeasures without prior notification to the injuring State. For example, a State is being attacked by a serious internationally wrongful cyber operation. The injured State intends to respond by blocking all electronic access to the bank accounts of the responsible State. If the responsible State is notified of that intention, it will have the opportunity to transfer the assets out of the country, effectively depriving the injured State of the possibility of taking such countermeasure.⁷⁰ Therefore, urgent countermeasure is of significant practical implications as they may be used more widely in cyberspace.\n\n## 3. Dispute Settlement Mechanisms\n\nInternational laws provide for dispute settlement mechanisms capable of rendering a binding decision on a dispute, thus offering relief to the injured State. This would undermine the very underlying reason that justify countermeasure, i.e., international law lacks a centralized enforcement mechanism. In addition, such mechanisms may reach a final resolution of the disputes between the states. By contrast, countermeasures are temporary in nature and cannot solve the dispute definitively, and the dispute may eventually be submitted to dispute settlement procedures. Thus the countermeasure is a less favored means of dispute resolution.\n\nThe relationship between countermeasures and dispute settlement mechanisms was one of the most controversial issues in the formulation of Draft Articles on Responsibility of States. The special rapporteur, Gaetano Arangio Ruiz, advocated the idea that the injured State is obliged to submit the dispute to the dispute settlement procedure before resorting to countermeasures, which is also reflected in the text he drafted.⁷¹ However, this view was not supported by States. The final text provides, in Article 52(3), that Countermeasures may not be taken, and if already taken must be suspended without undue delay if the dispute is pending before a court or tribunal which has the authority to make decisions binding on the parties.⁷²\n\nIn the process of formulating the Tallinn Manual 2.0, the majority of the International Group of Experts adopted the position of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States. However, the application of the rule was not without controversy. Members of the International Group of Experts were divided on whether or not such obligation is absolute. Some experts held the opinion that such\n\n⁶⁹ See Katharine C. Hinkle, Countermeasures in the Cyber Context: One More Thing to Worry about, 37 Yale Journal of International Law Online 11 (2011).\n\n⁷⁰ See Michael N. Schmitt, supra note 2, at 234–235.\n\n⁷¹ Mary Ellen O’Connell, supra note 17, at 258.\n\n⁷² The phrase “court or tribunal” refers to any third-party dispute settlement procedure, whatever its designation. The court or tribunal must have the power to order interim measures that are capable of protecting the purportedly injured State. See Michael N. Schmitt, supra note 2, at 235.",
    "The Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law\n\na dispute settlement mechanism is mandatory if it is explicitly required by international law. On the other hand, a minority of the experts argued that, rather than creating an absolute obligation, a case-by-case analysis should be undertaken to evaluate whether a third-party dispute settlement body had sufficient capacities to protect the rights of the injured State thus providing an effective alternative to countermeasures.^[73]^\n\nIt is submitted that dispute settlement mechanisms do not exclude countermeasures and resort to dispute settlement procedure is not a prerequisite procedural requirement for the taking of countermeasures. Under current international law, dispute settlement mechanisms are not substitute for countermeasures and provisional and urgent countermeasures are allowed even after a dispute has been submitted to a mandatory dispute settlement mechanism.^[74]^ This is particularly the case in cyberspace. Damage caused by cyberattacks could spread rapidly in a short period of time, sometimes even beyond the control of the attackers, which traditional dispute settlement mechanisms of international law may be ill-equipped to address.^[75]^ Therefore, countermeasures may be excluded only if treaties between the states involved contain technical defensive measures that are effective in induce the responsible State to comply with its international obligations and to prevent further damage, thus able to provide the victim State appropriate mechanism for remedy. Otherwise, the taking of countermeasures should not be precluded in cyberspace, even if the dispute is subject to a dispute settlement process.\n\n## V. Substantive Requirement for Taking Countermeasures in Cyberspace: The Principle of Proportionality\n\nCountermeasures taken by the injured State must comply with the principle of proportionality. If the countermeasures exceed the reasonable boundary set by the proportionality test, they will be punitive and retaliatory in nature and will no longer be legitimate under international law but rather an internationally wrongful act.^[76]^ Article 51 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States provides that countermeasures must be commensurate with the injury suffered. Under the proportionality test, countermeasures are assessed against the injuries suffered, not only in purely “quantitative” terms but also “qualitative” factors. This proportionality is equally applicable to countermeasures in cyberspace, which was clearly confirmed in the report published by the UNGGE in 2015.^[77]^\n\n^[73]^ *Id.*, at 235.\n\n^[74]^ *Id.*, at 236.\n\n^[75]^ Trojans can have multiple variants as they spread.

    "Wuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers\n\n# 1. Cases Applying the Principle of Proportionality\n\nAssessing the proportionality of a countermeasure is not only controversial$^{78}$ but also challenging.$^{79}$ The principle of proportionality is concerned with the intensity of countermeasures, aiming to establish a benchmark for countermeasures and restrict them within a reasonable limit. Such test essentially is matter of degree and the outcome of applying the principle of proportionality is unpredictable. The International Law Commission points out explicitly that what is proportionate is not a matter which can be determined precisely and can at best be accomplished by approximation.$^{80}$ The Draft Articles on Responsibility of States does not set out any specific rules on the application of the proportionality test, but only provide the factors to be considered: (1) the extent of the injury suffered; (2) the gravity of the internationally wrongful act; (3) the rights of the injured and responsible State (and interests of other States) that are affected; and (4) the necessity of inducing the responsible State to fulfill its obligations.$^{81}$ This exercise involves value judgment and balancing of interests, thus subjective in nature. Moreover, the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States does not articulate the hierarchy of these factors elements. Therefore, there is still no clear guidance on the application of the principle of proportionality, lacking much-needed predictability and certainty.\n\nThere are very few cases concerning the proportionality of countermeasures in current international law, among which the only successful one is the Air Service Agreement arbitration case in 1978.$^{82}$ In 1946, France and the USA signed a bilateral agreement to open international air routes between the two States. Disputes arose between the two countries when France refused to allow a change of gauge in London by American flights. As a countermeasure, the USA planned to suspend some flights from Paris to the U.S. In its award, the arbitral tribunal did not make a quantitative analysis of the damage caused by the French wrongful act and the impact of the American countermeasure, but rather a qualitative analysis of the impact of the French illegal act. The key factor considered by the Tribunal was the importance of legal principles involved to the USA, and especially its impact on American aviation policy.$^{83}$ Since the 1970s, the USA has pursued the policy of aviation liberalization and concluded a number of air transport agreements with other States, promoting the opening of international air transport market. The French act restricted the freedom of air transportation, which was incompatible with American aviation policy. In addition, bilateral treaties signed by the USA with other States also contained similar provisions on change of gauge. The French act would affect the interpretation and application of these provisions, which may have significant adverse impact on America. Therefore, the arbitral tribunal concluded that the U.S. countermeasure did not obviously violate the principle of proportionality.$^{84}$ In this case, the key\n\n78 See David J. Bederman, Counterintuiting Countermeasures, 96 The American Journal of International Law 821 (2002).\n79 Supra note 76, at Paragraph 3.\n80 Id., Paragraphs 5 and 3 respectively.\n81 Id., Paragraph 6.

    "The Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law\n\nfactors considered by the tribunal, i.e., the importance of the aviation policy and the potential impact of the damage, involves qualitative evaluation which is a general approximation rather than an accurate quantitative measurement.\n\nAnother one is the Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project case in 1997 in which the principle of proportionality was applied and a negative conclusion was made.⁸⁵ In this case, Hungary and Slovakia signed an agreement to jointly build a dam on the Danube in 1977. During the implementation of the agreement, Hungary unilaterally terminated the construction of the dam. As a countermeasure, Slovakia diverted the Danube in its territory to intercept water resources.⁸⁶ Different from the Air Service Agreement case, the ICJ combined quantitative and qualitative analysis in this case. First, from a qualitative perspective, the Court pointed out that the countermeasure had affected Hungary's important rights to equitable and reasonable share of natural resources of the Danube, including both navigational and non-navigational use. Second, the Court analyzed the intensity of the countermeasure taken by Slovakia. It held that Slovakia had unilaterally diversified and controlled 80% to 90% of water resources of the Danube. Measures with such magnitude will have a significant impact on the ecosystem of the Danube basin, clearly exceeding the reasonable limit, and thus inconsistent with the principle of proportionality.⁸⁷ In this case, the Danube is an important international river. The sheer volume of water being diversified, 80% to 90%, was a prima facie indication that the measure was probably out of proportionality. Thus it is a relatively easy case to adjudicate. However, if the amount of water resources affected by the countermeasure was in the range of 10% to 50%, the issue of proportionality would be in the grey area.\n\n## 2. The Benchmark for the Proportionality test\n\nThe benchmark for the proportionality test is also a controversial issue. The Draft Articles on Responsibility of States set injury as the benchmark for evaluating proportionality, allowing the injured State to retaliate against the injuring State with an equivalent damage, and thus forcing the injuring State to cease the infringement. This is not fundamentally different from the private retaliation of \"an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.\" It may lead to countermeasure going beyond what is strictly necessary for its very purpose and become punitive in nature. Therefore, there are inherent contradictions in the regime on countermeasures as set out by the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States.⁸⁸ This benchmark works well only among States with comparable strength. On the other hand, if there is a significant gap in strength between the countries involved,\n\n⁸⁵ See the Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project (Hungary/Slovakia), Judgment, ICJ Reports 1997.\n\n⁸⁶ In the judgment, the ICJ adopted a two-step approach. First, the Court found that Hungary violated the treaty concluded by both parties, which constituted an internationally wrongful act. Secondly, the Court discussed whether Slovakia's acts constituted countermeasures, one of the most important factor of which was the principle of proportionality. *Id.*, at para. 82.\n\n⁸⁷ *Id.*, at paras. 85–86.\n\n⁸⁸ See Nigel White &amp; Ademola Abass, *Countermeasures and Sanctions*, in Malcolm Evans ed., International Law, at 513 (Cambridge University Press 2018).",
    "Wuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers\n\ncountermeasure as under the current proportionality test may be abused by those powerful States as an excuse to bully the weak ones.\n\nIn recent years, some scholars proposed a functional approach towards the proportionality test, arguing that the purpose to be achieved d by countermeasures shall be used as the benchmark. Countermeasures are instrumental, and their purposes are to force the injuring State to cease its wrongful act and to comply with its international obligations, so that the relations between the two States can be restored. Therefore, the proportionality of countermeasures should be assessed against its purpose, irrespective of whether they exceed the intensity of the wrongful act.⁸⁹\n\nIn April 2007, Estonia suffered a three-week-long DDoS cyberattack and a large number of critical infrastructure websites, including those of government agencies, were forced to shut down, resulting in network paralysis and service disruption with severe damage.⁹⁰ If the cyberattack could be attributed to Russia, Estonia could respond with DDoS countermeasures. In terms of the intensity, Estonia may not achieve its purpose if the countermeasures were of equivalent magnitude as that of the cyberattack because Russia's size and strength are far greater than Estonia's. Achieving the purpose of inducing Russia to cease its internationally wrongful act would likely require countermeasures that far exceed the damage caused by Russia's wrongful act. Therefore, taking the purpose of countermeasures as the benchmark is more in line with their very aim. Meanwhile, such approach taking into consideration the differences in strength of nations, prevents the abuse by stronger State, thus more fair and equitable.\n\nTherefore, the principle of proportionality lacks clear rules and is full of uncertainties. Its application in cyberspace is even more challenging.⁹¹ This is because cyberspace is interconnected and cyberattacks are dynamic and constantly changing, making it difficult and time-consuming to assess the damage caused. The injured State shall be extremely cautious when evaluating the proportionality of the countermeasures. This will not preclude the possibility for taking countermeasures in response to cyberattacks. A practical approach is to adopt cyber measures as an effective response to cyberattacks,⁹² because this type of countermeasures is of the same nature as the wrongful act and is more likely to be regarded as consistent with the principle of proportionality.⁹³\n\n⁸⁹ See Enzo Cannizzaro, *The Role of Proportionality in the Law of International Countermeasure*, 12 European Journal of International Law 889 (2001).\n\n⁹⁰ See Ma Chunmao, *A Review of Estonia’s Cyber Warfare*, at https://tech.sina.com.cn/i/2009-02-04/08172791102.shtml (last visited June 3, 2019).\n\n⁹¹ See Nicholas Tsagourias, *The Law Applicable to Countermeasures against Low Intensity Cyber Operations*, 14 Baltic Yearbook of International Law Online 105 (2015).\n\n⁹² Proportionality does not mean reciprocity. The obligation breached by countermeasures does not necessarily need to be same as the obligation breached by the responsible State, nor does the nature and means of the countermeasure.\n\n⁹³ See Paragraph 5 of the commentary to the introductory part of Chapter II in Part Three of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States.",
    "The Application of Countermeasures in Cyberspace under International Law\n\nTraditionally cyberattacks are dealt with through a passive defense system, consisting of a firewall, intrusion detection and prevention mechanism with antivirus software as the commonly deployed technology. Under such system, only after it is attacked will the antivirus software be able to obtain the vital information and code of the virus and update its database. So that the same viruses can be detected and removed next time they appear. The inherent deficiency is that only after the virus attacks can loopholes in the system be identified and fixed. Thus the antivirus software is always behind the virus and even the most sophisticated firewall may be breached. As a result, passive defense cannot does not offer satisfactory solution to network security. Modern network security is increasingly rely on active defense through early detection of cyberattacks and deception techniques to contain and constrain the attacks. For example, sandbox and honeypot are commonly used technical methods, which in fact deliberately expose some vulnerabilities for attackers and then to obtain critical information of the attackers when they intrude the system. These techniques offers protection to the system and buys time for the injured State to examine the cyberattack and to develop appropriate countermeasures.[94] Such means do not compromise or damage the attacker's network facilities or computer systems, thus consistent with the principle of proportionality.\n\nMore extreme active defenses measures are even aggressive in nature, i.e., hacking back. Such technics involve hacking into the attacker's computer system, erasing the stolen data, or even planting ransomware. This type of defense involves cyber measures thus similar to cyberattacks in nature. However, this does not necessarily mean such measures fulfill the proportionality test because equivalence in nature is only one of the factors considered in the evaluation of proportionality. In practice, it is still necessary to consider other factors of the proportionality test and keeping cyber countermeasures within the reasonable limits allowed by international law.\n\nIn summary, the application of the principle proportionality is controversial and challenging. The Draft Articles on Responsibility of States fails to provide clear guidance, but only lists the factors to be considered. Furthermore, the benchmark against which proportionality is assessed against is not without controversy. Considerable uncertainties remain with regard to the application of countermeasures in cyberspace. A practical and effective approach is to adopt cyber countermeasures in response to cyberattacks and ensure the impact of such measures are within a reasonable limit.\n\n# VI. Conclusion\n\nThe fundamental aim of international law on the countermeasure is to limit it to a reasonable extent and prevent such measures being abused leading to the escalation of disputes. However, the boundaries of countermeasures permitted by international law remains unsettled. During the\n\n[94] If the attacker took advantage of the vulnerabilities of the honeypot to launch a cyberattack against a third country, the State that set up the honeypot may be found violating its due diligence obligations.",
    "Wuhan University International Law Review Selected Papers\n\ndrafting process of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States, every rule on countermeasures had been a matter of controversy. Major differences among States on this issue were also highlighted at the 2017 Session of the UNGGE, where disagreements led to the absence of a consensus report and the breakdown of negotiations. The function and mission of the UNGGE is not to create or modify the rules of international law in cyberspace, but to discuss how international law is applied. Thus despite the failure of the negotiation process of the UNGGE, international law, including rules on countermeasures, is still applicable to cyberspace. This basic position has been confirmed by the International Group of Experts in its 2015 report.\n\nCompared with the traditional physical space of State sovereignty, cyberspace as a relatively new domain has its own unique features, creating new issues to the application of countermeasures. Current international law on the countermeasure as articulated in the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States, imposing stringent conditions to prevent its abuse, are ill-equipped to deal with cyberattacks. It adopts the basic position that countermeasure is illegal per se, to discourage its usage in practice. The prerequisites for taking countermeasures is the existence of internationally wrongful acts; in cyberspace the attribution of cyberattacks to States is challenging. In addition, the procedural requirements for taking countermeasure are impractical in cyberspace and the proportionality test is highly subjective and unpredictable. These facts have greatly diminished the effectiveness and certainty of the application of countermeasures in cyberspace. This is one of the major reason why there are few cases where state invoked countermeasures. Therefore, current international law does not offer clear rules and guidance on how to apply countermeasures in cyberspace. The international law regime on this issue is still at the early stage of development and is still evolving.\n\n(Translators: Meng Chao &amp; Wang Yi)"
