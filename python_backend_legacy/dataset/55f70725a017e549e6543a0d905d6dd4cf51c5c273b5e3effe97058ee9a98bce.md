This draft paper provides an overview of the legal frameworks for sanctioning malicious cyber actors and the set of relevant sanctions imposed to date. Despite an emphasis on the goal of deterrence, both policymakers and academics have difficulty determining whether sanctions deter malicious cyber activity. Considering the continued use of cyber sanctions, this paper highlights key considerations for policymakers to evaluate whether sanctions can deter wrongful behavior in cyberspace.\nKeywords: sanctions, economic statecraft, cyber, deterrence, descriptive studies, policy evaluation\n*Research Assistant, Cyber Policy Initiative, Technology and International Affairs Program, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Washington, DC, USA\nContact: thompsonr.natalie@gmail.com\nSpecial thanks go to my colleagues—especially Tim Maurer, George Perkovich, Jon Bateman, Ariel Levite, and Arthur Nelson—for supporting this research.

State (and non-state) actors are acquiring offensive cyber capabilities and have demonstrated a willingness to use them—states have conducted at least 358 hostile cyber operations² since 2005, more than half of which have occurred since 2017.³\nThe increasing number of attacks puts pressure on governments to counter malicious cyber activity and to promote norms of responsible behavior in cyberspace. States have relied on a mix of diplomatic, informational, economic, and law enforcement options to respond to malicious cyber activity. Some refer to these tools as the DIME(LE) set of instruments available to states seeking to influence others’ behavior.⁴,⁵\nSanctions are part of a state’s arsenal. Both the United States and the European Union have created specific authorities for targeted financial sanctions in response to malicious cyber activity⁶—referred to throughout this paper as “cyber sanctions.”⁷ The United States has imposed\n¹ The Center for Strategic and International Studies maintains a list of significant cyberattacks that have occurred since 2006, and the Council on Foreign Relations maintains an interactive tracker of offensive cyber operations perpetrated by states.

A variety of others are used within the United States military to categorize and describe the operational environment; these include: 1) diplomatic, informational, military, and economic (DIME); 2) diplomatic, informational, military, economic, financial, intelligence, law enforcement (DIMEFIL); and 3) political, military, economic, social, informational, infrastructure (PMESII), among others.

Once policymakers answer questions of effectiveness, they can then craft their use of sanctions to best address relevant threats in cyberspace.\nThe diversity of malicious behavior in cyberspace makes it difficult to identify a coherent logic for using sanctions. States conduct offensive cyber operations in service of political goals while criminals engage in hacking for profit—sometimes, the two occur alongside one another.¹¹ The use of proxies in cyberspace complicates efforts to distinguish politically motivated and financially motivated attacks and obscures the relationship between state and non-state actors.¹²\nFurther compounding the problem are questions related to the harms that should be included in the definition of “malicious cyber activity.” Narrow definitions of “cyberattack” use the term to\nSeries, Conference Paper No. 9/2011, May 1, 2011, https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1989786 and Zachary Goldman, “Cybersecurity and a New Era of Asymmetric Economic Warfare,” Just Security, January 16, 2015, https://www.justsecurity.org/19150/cybersecurity-era-asymmetric-economic-warfare/.\n⁸ Council Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/1125 of July 30, 2020, implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/796 concerning restrictive measures against cyber-attacks threatening the Union or its Member States, 2020 O.J.

As a policy matter, the United States has used its cyber sanctions framework to punish behavior like election interference.¹⁴ Both the European Union and the United States have used human rights-related programs to respond to cyber-enabled human rights violations.¹⁵ As a result, this paper looks beyond sanctions frameworks meant explicitly to deal with malicious cyber activity and includes instances when additional horizontal frameworks have been used to respond to wrongful uses of information and communications technologies.\nThis paper seeks to provide an overview of targeted financial sanctions for countering malicious cyber activity in the United States and Europe and considerations regarding the tool’s effectiveness. Although policymakers often highlight deterrence and cost imposition as critical goals, both academic literature and policy documents point to difficulty measuring sanctions’ success at achieving these aims.\nThe continued reliance on the tool suggests that policymakers have other motivations for responding to malicious cyber activity with sanctions, regardless of whether sanctions are effective or whether their effectiveness can be measured.

Part outlines the definitional issues related to the scope of “malicious cyber activity” and what, therefore, constitutes a “cyber sanction.” It then provides an overview of the designations to date in the United States and Europe. Part two discusses how policymakers and academics evaluate sanctions’ effectiveness at achieving often-touted deterrence goals and specific considerations related to policy alternatives and long-term consequences. Policymakers cannot ignore the alternative instruments available to respond to malicious cyber activity in thinking about effectiveness and must weigh the trade-offs associated with alternative responses to cyberattacks. Finally, policymakers cannot ignore how firms and other states respond to and perceive the credibility of U.S. sanctions in the long-run—both as it relates to their imposition and removal (or lack thereof). They must consider the corresponding implications for the architecture of the global financial system and United States’ ability to weaponize its financial position. Part three then offers a categorization of the different purposes that sanctions can serve beyond deterrence. These purposes include attribution, information-sharing, audience satisfaction, cooperation with allies, norm development, punishment, and disruption of capabilities—all of which contribute cumulatively to the overarching goal of deterrence.\n## Defining “cyber sanctions”\n### What do sanctions entail?\nThe United States and EU’s cyber sanctions are targeted sanctions that differ from sanctions imposed during and before the 1990s. Comprehensive trade sanctions were a popular instrument of economic coercion throughout the 20th century, in part because they are less costly, less risky, and more palatable than military action. Targeted sanctions differ from comprehensive ones in coercive logic, the intended target, and the ultimate goal. Though similarly aimed at eliciting a change in state behavior, they focus on specific individuals and entities rather than the population at large.¹⁶ They assume that singling out individuals or groups will better “raise the target regime’s costs of noncompliance.”¹⁷ Targeted sanctions can also aim to change the\n¹⁶ Arne Tostensen and Beate Bull, “Are Smart Sanctions Feasible?” World Politics 53, no. 3 (April 2002): 380, 382.\n¹⁷ Daniel Drezner, “How Smart Are Smart Sanctions?” International Studies Review 5, no. 1 (March 2003): 107; see also Tostensen and Bull, “Are Smart Sanctions Feasible?” 380, 386; Thomas G.

Targeted sanctions are understood to have additional value for constraining and signaling. By “constraining,” these scholars refer to complicating an actor’s ability to engage in internationally wrongful behavior.²⁰ By “signaling,” they refer to sending a message to the target, domestic audiences, and international audiences that expresses support for norms of appropriate behavior.²¹\nOne type of targeted sanction, restrictive financial measures (also referred to as targeted financial sanctions), is increasingly the tool of choice for policymakers seeking to impose consequences for internationally wrongful behavior. Targeted financial sanctions include asset freezes, blocking transactions with designated individuals or entities, and denying access to capital markets.²² The tool relies on the preeminence of certain currencies and jurisdictions in global financial transactions.²³ Big financial players like the United States, Europe, and, to a lesser extent, China can weaponize the financial system to prevent specific individuals or organizations from transacting in their respective currencies.

The existence of “chokepoints” in the financial system that gives western states (particularly the United States) the “capacity to limit or penalize use of hubs by third parties (e.g., other states or private actors)” is a source of “considerable coercive power.” See Henry Farrell and Abraham Newman, “Weaponized Interdependence,” International Security 44, no. 1 (Summer 2019): 55-56.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nforeign policy emanating from these jurisdictions is incomplete without attention to the potential uses of targeted financial sanctions.²⁴\n## Definitional issues\nThe first issue to address in defining “cyber sanctions” is related to what constitutes “malicious cyber activity” and which sanctions should, therefore, be considered within this paper’s scope.\nIn April 2015, then-U.S. president Barack Obama created the first targeted financial sanctions framework meant to deal specifically with cyber-related harms;²⁵ the Europeans followed suit in 2019;²⁶ and the United Kingdom finalized their cyber sanctions regulation earlier this year.²⁷ The United States, EU, and UK authorities relate principally to compromises in data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.²⁸\nThese cyber-specific frameworks, however, do not tell the whole story. As early as 2011, the European Union sanctioned individuals and entities engaged in the surveillance and abuse of Iranian journalists and activists.²⁹ Some of the same violators later came under additional U.S.\n²⁴ Rachel Loeffler, “Bank Shots,” Foreign Affairs, March 1, 2009, https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/northkorea/2009-03-01/bank-shots; Rosenberg, et al., “The New Tools of Economic Warfare,” 5; Juan Zarate, “Harnessing the Financial Furies: Smart Financial Power and National Security,” The Washington Quarterly 32, no. 4 (October 2009): 43; Elizabeth Rosenberg, “Testimony before the United States House of Representatives Committee on Financial Services, Subcommittee on National Security, International Development and Monetary Policy: ‘Assessing the Use of Sanctions in Addressing National Security and Foreign Policy Challenges,’” Center for a New American Security, May 15, 2019, https://www.cnas.org/publications/congressional-testimony/elizabeth-rosenberg-before-the-house-financial-services-committee.\n²⁵ U.S. President, Executive Order, “Blocking the Property of Certain Persons Engaging in Significant Malicious Cyber-Enabled Activities, Executive Order 13694 of April 1, 2015,” Federal Register 80, no. 63 (April 2, 2015).\n²⁶ Council Regulation 2019/796 of May 17, 2019, concerning restrictive measures against cyber-attacks threatening the Union or its Member States, 2019 O.J.

They do not fit neatly into the definition of cyberattack promulgated by the U.S. National Institute of Technology and Standards: “An attack, via cyberspace, targeting an enterprise’s use of cyberspace for the purpose of disrupting, disabling, destroying, or maliciously controlling a computing environment/infrastructure; or destroying the integrity of the data or stealing controlled information.”³² For example, monitoring dissidents or using social media to promote narratives online does not necessarily compromise data confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Still, the United States and Europe have considered them harmful enough uses of information and communications technologies to warrant punishment. For this reason, sanctions falling under the cyber-specific framework, as well as others related to cyber-enabled influence operations and human rights violations, are included within the scope of this paper.\n## “Cyber sanctions” to date\nWith these definitional concerns in mind, this section provides a brief overview of the cyber sanctions imposed to date in both the United States and Europe.\nExecutive Order 13694, which created the United States’ cyber-specific sanctions framework, “declare[d] a national emergency with respect to the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States posed by the increasing prevalence and severity of malicious cyber-enabled activities originating from or directed by, persons located, in whole or in substantial part, outside the United States.”³³\nSo far, the United States has imposed thirty-five tranches of sanctions related to malicious cyber activity under both the cyber-specific framework and other country-specific and horizontal\n³⁰ For example, the EU sanctioned Abdolsamad Khoramabadi, head of the Committee to Determine Instances of Criminal Content, in March 2013, and the United States later imposed sanctions in May 2018.

These designations involve entities linked to Iran, North Korea, Russia, China, and Nigeria. The earliest designations, dating back to 2012 (made under an Executive Order on terrorism-related sanctions), dealt with Iranian government officials and entities participating in computer hacking projects with Hezbollah.³⁴ Since then, the United States has sanctioned a range of cybercriminals and nation-state hackers. These include North Korean actors that participated in the 2014 hack of Sony Pictures, Russian actors engaged in cyber-enabled election interference, and Iranian actors targeting U.S. financial institutions.³⁵ Since 2012, the United States has sanctioned over 250 individuals and entities for engaging in or enabling malicious cyber activity. (For a complete list of incidents, see Table 1.) The majority have been of Iranian, Russian, or North Korean origin. In the first half of 2020, however, the United States took action against two Chinese nationals for aiding Lazarus Group’s efforts to launder money, as well as six Nigerian individuals engaged in business email compromise and romance fraud scams.³⁶\nIn statements on the Executive Order, policymakers highlighted the “significant increase in the frequency, scale, and sophistication of cyber incidents targeting the American people” to justify its signing.³⁷ Absent in many of these statements are clear articulations of how the administration would evaluate these sanctions’ effectiveness. In a blog post following the signing of the April 2015 Executive Order, White House counterterrorism advisor Lisa Monica explained that policymakers hoped to “deter” and “impose costs” on adversaries.³⁸ But the specific means by which the U.S. Department of the Treasury would evaluate the program’s effectiveness remain unclear.

However, it would be misleading to not include these, and they represent an interesting examples of instances in which sanctioners can target key economic elites in order to elicit a change in state behavior.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\n|  10/22/2020 | EU | 13694), Ukraine (E.O. 13661)\nCouncil Regulation (EU) 2019/796 | 2 individuals, 1 entity | Russia | No  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  10/22/2020 | U.S. | Election interference (E.O. 13848) | 5 entities | Iran | No  |\n|  10/23/2020 | U.S. | CAATSA | 1 entity | Russia | No  |\n## Do cyber sanctions deter?\nAs described above, policymakers in both the United States and European Union emphasize that cyber sanctions aim to deter malicious actors and behavior. As Zachary Goldman and Damon McCoy have pointed out, “different kinds of malicious cyber activity demand different, tailored, deterrence strategies. This is because each category of cyber threat has a different motivation, and therefore will be sensitive to a different type of cost.”51 Nation-state hackers with political goals are unlikely to suffer the same consequences of a sanctions designation that independent cybercriminals with financial motivations will suffer. Similarly, designating a government official orchestrating an attack is unlikely to have the same impact as designating an individual two or three steps removed that launders money on behalf of a hacking group.\nTwo things complicate the effort to neatly distinguish between categories like cybercrime and nation-state activity and state and non-state actors. First, the convergence of financially-motivated cybercrime and nation-state activity makes it difficult to separate cyberattacks conducted for purely economic gain and those undertaken for political purposes.52 North Korean efforts to raise funds for its weapons of mass destruction program through cyber theft and ransom operations against financial institutions and cryptocurrency exchanges have demonstrated the difficulty of separating financial motivations from political goals.53 Similarly, state-sponsored economic espionage emanating from China blurs the distinction between financial and political aims as the theft of intellectual property aims to “support its strategic development goals—science and technology advancement, military modernization, and economic policy objectives.”54\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nSecond, the use of proxies for conducting offensive cyber operations often precludes a neat division between state and non-state actors in cyberspace. Tim Maurer’s comprehensive overview of the use of proxies for accomplishing offensive cyber operations details the spectrum of relationships between states and their proxies.⁵⁵ These relationships range from overt delegation of activity to loose orchestration to passive enablement of proxy behavior. In the latter cases, those operating at a state’s behest may also have a foot in the criminal world. For example, in 2019, Treasury alleged that a Russian cybercriminal indicted and sanctioned for developing and distributing malware also operated on behalf of the Russian government, “highlighting the Russian government’s enlistment of cybercriminals for its own malicious purposes.”⁵⁶\n## Evaluating effectiveness\nIt is not within the remit of external observers to assess whether cyber sanctions effectively achieve deterrence. Much of the information needed to make such an assessment is classified or privately owned intelligence. Though Treasury publicly reports the value of transactions blocked under specific sanctions programs, others have pointed out that evaluating the success of cyber sanctions based on the financial value of prevented transactions is misleading.⁵⁷ Therefore, it is difficult for policymakers to attribute any observed decrease in malicious cyber activity or change in activity to sanctions or determine whether activity levels would be even greater absent the threat of sanctions or imposition.\nWithin the U.S. government, Treasury’s Office of Intelligence and Analysis (OIA) and the State Department’s Bureau of Intelligence and Research perform impact assessments.⁵⁸ According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), which published a review of U.S. sanctions programs and their effectiveness in 2019, “These assessments analyze the impacts of specific sanctions on a particular aspect of the sanction’s target—for example, the sanctions’ impact on the target country’s economy or trade.”⁵⁹ OIA, for example, conducts impact assessments before a sanctions designation and after its imposition and may include factors like the target’s U.S.-\n⁵⁵ Maurer, *Cyber Mercenaries*, 42-49.\n⁵⁶ “Treasury Sanctions Evil Corp, the Russia-Based Cybercriminal Group Behind Dridex Malware,” U.S. Department of the Treasury, December 5, 2019, https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm845,\n⁵⁷ Annie Fixler and Eric Lorber, “Counting Pennies Underestimates the Value of Treasury’s Cyber Sanctions,” Foundation for Defense of Democracies, November 4, 2019, https://www.fdd.org/analysis/2019/11/04/counting-pennies-underestimates-the-value-of-treasurys-cyber-sanctions/.\n⁵⁸ Kimberly Gianopoulos, “Economic Sanctions: Agencies Assess Impacts on Targets, and Studies Suggest Several Factors Contribute to Sanctions’ Effectiveness,” U.S. Government Accountability Office, October 2019, 12, https://www.gao.gov/assets/710/701891.pdf.\n⁵⁹ Ibid.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nbased assets, global holdings, and interactions with the United States and the potential cascading consequences of a sanctions designation.⁶⁰\nHowever, the report acknowledges that “these assessments do not analyze sanctions’ overall effectiveness in achieving broader U.S. policy goals or objectives, such as whether the sanctions are advancing the national security and policy priorities of the United States” (emphasis added).⁶¹ OIA distinguishes between impact and effect in its assessments:\nAccording to OIA officials, assessing impact is analyzing the potential or observed effect of the sanction on the target. According to officials, impact can be focused on a singular target or could be broader, such as the impact on the target country’s economy or trade flows. In contrast, OIA views effectiveness as the extent to which a sanctions program is achieving the overall broader policy goals of the sanctions program, such as ultimately altering or deterring specific behaviors of the target or furthering U.S. national security priorities [Emphasis added].⁶²\nThe latter considerations come into play during National Security Council-led interagency discussions: The process “allows the U.S. government to draw upon multiple agencies’ inputs and perspectives, and to consider these issues in the larger policy context, because sanctions are often only one element of broader government-wide strategies to achieve U.S. policy goals.”⁶³\nEven within government, assessing the effectiveness of sanctions at achieving broader policy goals like deterrence is difficult. GAO’s report highlights that policymakers have difficulty isolating sanctions’ effects from those of other policy tools, dealing with shifting policy objectives, and identifying useful data for conducting assessments.⁶⁴\nThe threat of sanctions raises an additional challenge for evaluating effectiveness.⁶⁵ In at least one notable instance pertaining to Chinese cyber-enabled economic espionage, U.S. threats to impose sanctions may have contributed to the signing of a diplomatic agreement between then-\n⁶⁰ Ibid., 13-14.\n⁶¹ Ibid., 12.\n⁶² Ibid.\n⁶³ Ibid., 12.\n⁶⁴ Ibid., 17-18.\n⁶⁵ See, for example, Daniel Drezner’s work on selection bias in evaluations of sanctions programs, which suggests that sanctions are more effective than most analyses contend because they miss instances in which sanctions are threatened but not imposed: “in focusing only on those instances when sanctions have been imposed, policy analysts have overlooked the significant number of instances in which the threat of coercion did not have to be carried out.” Daniel Drezner, “The Hidden Hand of Economic Coercion,” International Organization 57, no. 3 (June 2003): 654-655, https://doi.org/10.1017/S0020818303573052.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\npresident Obama and President Xi. Reporting at the end of August 2015 suggested that the Obama administration was preparing a sanctions package against Chinese targets under the framework.⁶⁶ Just weeks later, in September of that year, Obama and Xi met in Washington to announce a moratorium on the cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property for commercial advantage.⁶⁷ In remarks on the deal, Obama alluded to the leverage created by the sanctions E.O. in stating, “I did indicate to President Xi that we will apply those and whatever other tools we have in our toolkit to go after cyber criminals, either retrospectively or prospectively.”⁶⁸ And in the words of then-Assistant Attorney General John Carlin, “That changed China.”⁶⁹ According to a report from the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, the number of detected Chinese cyberattacks diminished following the bilateral agreement.⁷⁰ But the evidence of the deal’s success was not conclusive.⁷¹,⁷² One report from threat intelligence company FireEye highlighted that the number of attacks began dropping at least a year before the agreement.⁷³ This case illustrates further the difficulty of isolating sanctions’ effects and evaluating the counterfactual of how adversaries might behave if not for the threat of sanctions.\nThe academic literature on the success of targeted financial sanctions is neither entirely optimistic nor conclusive.⁷⁴ One estimate of UN targeted sanctions’ success rate suggests that targeted sanctions are effective just 22 percent of the time.⁷⁵ Breaking that figure down by\n⁶⁶ Ellen Nakashima, “U.S. developing sanctions against China over cyberthefts,” *Washington Post*, August 30, 2015, https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/administration-developing-sanctions-against-china-over-cyberespionage/2015/08/30/9b2910aa-480b-11e5-8ab4-c73967a143d3_story.html?utm_term=.2ed69dd30154.\n⁶⁷ Office of the Press Secretary, “Remarks by President Obama and President Xi of the People’s Republic of China in Joint Press Conference,” White House, September 25, 2015, https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2015/09/25/remarks-president-obama-and-president-xi-peoples-republic-china-joint.\n⁶⁸ Ibid.\n⁶⁹ John Carlin, in “American Cybersecurity Experts: ‘No Trespassing,’” Aspen Strategy Forum, August 22, 2016, at 10:41, https://www.aspeninstitute.org/blog-posts/no-trespassing-experts-american-cybersecurity/.\n⁷⁰ National Counterintelligence and Security Center, “Foreign Economic Espionage in Cyberspace,” 7.\n⁷¹ Ben Buchanan and Robert D.

After surveying sanctions experts, they report, “A remarkable 27 out of 30 survey respondents – 90 percent – agreed with the contention that sanctions against state actors like Iran were more effective than sanctions against non-state actors like al Qaeda.”^[79]^ A recent review of the academic literature highlights the impact of sanctions on non-state actors as a gap in existing scholarship^[80]^—a fact particularly challenging for policymakers evaluating sanctions’ effectiveness against non-state and proxy cyber threats. Perhaps the most damning factor concerning the inconclusiveness of the academic literature is that even amongst academics “what counts as ‘effective’ (or ‘successful’) itself has been a contentious issue.”^[81]^\n## Factors for consideration\nStill, in trying to assess the effectiveness of cyber sanctions, policymakers should look at three key factors:\n(1) A target’s vulnerability to economic pressure,\n(2) The motivations underpinning offensive activity, and\n(3) How chosen targets support malicious activity.\n## Vulnerability to economic pressure\nDespite the lack of consensus regarding sanctions’ aims, those who have surveyed the academic literature note that a target’s vulnerability to economic pressure is critical for sanctions’ effectiveness. As one group of researchers put it, “the data suggest that the types of financial sanctions that have been deployed against states in the last two decades should have a greater\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nimpact on the decisionmaking [sic] of states for which attractiveness to international trade and investment is strategically significant.”⁸² In the cyber domain, this means that policymakers should pay attention to specific nation-state cyber threats that may be vulnerable to economic pressure. A sanction against an Iranian or North Korean government entity, for example, is unlikely to disrupt capabilities in the same way that a designation of a Russian entity might. U.S. sanctions have isolated Iran and North Korea from the global financial system,⁸³ so additional targeted sanctions may be unlikely to significantly affect the ability to carry out future attacks or enjoy their proceeds. Indeed, these two actors have made the financial system the target of cyberattacks.⁸⁴ However, actors elsewhere may be more exposed to the influence of the U.S. dollar or the euro in global financial markets and, therefore, more likely to pay attention to the punitive consequences of a sanction or have their capabilities disrupted as a result. For example, Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, alleged that his net worth dropped by 80 percent—over $7 billion—as a result of U.S. sanctions related to “a range of malign activity around the globe,” including malicious cyber activity, imposed in 2018.⁸⁵\n## Actors’ motivations\nThe motives underpinning malicious cyber activity also affect an actor's vulnerability to sanctions. As mentioned above, Goldman and McCoy have argued that sanctions are an appropriate policy tool for dealing with financially motivated cyber threats—like cyber-enabled economic espionage—because they undermine the goal of the activity: profit.⁸⁶ By preventing malicious actors from accessing and moving money, sanctions make it “more difficult for them\n⁸² Rosenberg, et al., “The New Tools of Economic Warfare,” 15.\n⁸³ Ian Talley, “U.S. Moves to Further Isolate Iran From Global Financial System,” *Wall Street Journal*, October 25, 2019, https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-moves-to-further-isolate-iran-from-global-financial-system-11572025978; David Sanger and Michael Corkery, “Treasury Imposes Sanctions on North Korea, Cutting Access to Banks,” *New York Times*, June 1, 2016, https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/02/world/asia/treasury-imposes-sanctions-on-north-korea.html.\n⁸⁴ “Treasury Targets Supporters of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Networks Responsible for Cyber-Attacks Against the United States,” U.S. Department of the Treasury; “Treasury Targets North Korea for Multiple Cyber-Attacks,” U.S. Department of the Treasury; “Treasury Sanctions North Korean State-Sponsored Malicious Cyber Groups,” U.S. Department of the Treasury.\n⁸⁵ David Dawkins, “Russian Billionaire Oleg Deripaska Describes U.S. Money Laundering Accusations As ‘Mish-Mash Of Total Nonsense,’” *Forbes*, February 14, 2020, https://www.forbes.com/sites/daviddawkins/2020/02/14/report-russian-billionaire-oleg-deripaska-accused-by-us-agency-of-laundering-funds-for-vladimir-putin/#7b2a95c0c4bc; “Treasury Designates Russian Oligarchs, Officials, and Entities in Response to Worldwide Malign Activity,” U.S. Department of the Treasury, April 6, 2018, https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm0338.\n⁸⁶ Goldman and McCoy, “Deterring Financially Motivated Cybercrime,” 602.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nto use the proceeds of their crimes.”⁸⁷ Sanctions may fail to dissuade financially motivated actors from engaging in wrongful behavior if the profitability of the action outweighs the financial costs of sanctions. Still, the profit motive may make these actors more sensitive to sanctions than a politically motivated actor would be.⁸⁸ Russian actors engaged in hack and leak operations or attacks on international organizations are not as likely to be dissuaded from engaging in their activity because sanctions have made it unprofitable if profitability was not necessarily a preeminent goal.\n## Means of supporting wrongful activity\nThe specific choice of target and whose behavioral change is the goal of sanctions are also likely to bear on how policymakers should evaluate effectiveness. Once policymakers have identified malicious activity, they can choose to go after several different targets, including the state actors that directed, orchestrated, or enabled the attack; the individuals directly engaged in the attack; or those that provide material, financial, or technological support for the attack. Again, these actors are not equally vulnerable to the effects of sanctions. Government officials that enjoy the backing and protection of the state may be less likely to be deterred than those whose legitimate commercial interests are at stake by aiding targets in circumventing sanctions. As one group of researchers at the Center for a New American Security put it, “To the extent that sanctions on non-state actors are focused on coercing a change in behavior, that strategy may have the greatest impact on the ecosystem of actual and would-be supporters of those groups, rather than on the groups themselves.”⁸⁹ Simultaneously, sanctions can go after a specific target to change a third party’s behavior—returning to the Deripaska example described above, sanctioning Russian oligarchs was partly meant to signal to the Russian state that its conduct was unacceptable and leverage elite pain for behavioral change.⁹⁰\n## Effectiveness as opposed to what?\nEvaluating the impacts of sanctions cannot ignore the alternative instruments available to states\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n⁸⁷ John Carlin, “Detect, Disrupt, Deter: A Whole-of-Government Approach to National Security Cyber Threats,” *Harvard National Security Journal* 7, (2016): 420, https://harvardnsj.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2016/06/Carlin-FINAL.pdf.\n⁸⁸ The impact of sanctions on an adversary’s risk calculus could potentially backfire if financially motivated actors are deterred from engaging in the lowest levels of criminal activity, which may generate profits incommensurate with the absorbed risk, but continue to engage in highly profitable but extremely destabilizing attacks.\n⁸⁹ Rosenberg, et al., “The New Tools of Economic Warfare,” 28.\n⁹⁰ “Treasury Designates Russian Oligarchs, Officials, and Entities in Response to Worldwide Malign Activity,” U.S. Department of the Treasury.\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nseeking to respond to wrongful behavior in cyberspace.⁹¹ This paper situates sanctions within the DIME(LE) framework to highlight the point that policymakers face the choice not of sanctioning or doing nothing but of sanctioning or releasing a diplomatic statement or responding with a retaliatory cyberattack or of doing nothing or of doing several of these. In the U.S. context, in particular, policymakers have adopted a “whole-of-government” approach to countering malicious cyber activity—in essence, one that involves all of the tools of statecraft outlined in the DIME(LE).⁹²,⁹³ As a result, sanctions have frequently followed criminal charges against malicious cyber actors. Sixteen of the thirty-five instances in which the United States imposed cyber sanctions were preceded by an indictment of at least one of the sanctioned individuals—providing useful context for understanding the range of available tools for imposing costs on malicious cyber actors.\nWhere effectiveness is concerned, sanctions, in theory, may have more “teeth” than indictments because their enforcement does not rely on an actor setting foot in a country with which a state pursuing charges has an extradition treaty. As others have noted, the U.S. strategy of charging foreign-linked hackers is unlikely to result in many hackers ever appearing in U.S. courts.⁹⁴ However, there have been some important exceptions. Three members of the FIN7 cybercrime group were arrested in Spain in 2018, two of which have been extradited,⁹⁵ and in May 2020, authorities arrested another member of the organization in Seattle.⁹⁶\nJack Goldsmith and Robert Williams have questioned whether the public attribution of cyberattacks through criminal charges is counterproductive.

Indictments against foreign hackers are not themselves political tools, but the decision to unseal an indictment can be.

Sanctions are enforced not by the U.S. government or EU alone but by financial institutions that risk exposing themselves to secondary sanctions. As a result, they may better demonstrate the costs of engaging in wrongful behavior and, therefore, deter adversaries.\nSanctions, however, face limitations. Sophisticated actors can identify ways to evade sanctions, sometimes through cyberattacks.⁹⁸ Last fall, a United Nations panel of experts report detailed North Korea’s efforts to circumvent sanctions and raise money for its weapons of mass destruction program by attacking the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) and cryptocurrency exchanges, executing ransomware attacks, and mining cryptocurrency.⁹⁹,¹⁰⁰ The risk of evasion poses a threat to the efficacy of targeted financial sanctions as it “undermines the credibility of the senders, because the inability to implement and enforce the measures is often interpreted as signaling the lack of power of the sender.”¹⁰¹ And in the longer-term, actors may be compelled to seek alternate financial architectures to avoid the hassle of evading sanctions.\nThe broader point of comparing sanctions and indictments is that sanctions are just one of the tools that governments can employ against malicious cyber actors.

As early as 2013, Treasury had designated Liberty Reserve, a virtual currency provider, as a “financial institution of primary money laundering concern,” and in November 2018, the U.S. Department of the Treasury included in a designation the Bitcoin wallet addresses of two Iranian individuals. See “Treasury Identifies Virtual Currency Provider Liberty Reserve as a Financial Institution of Primary Money Laundering Concern under USA Patriot Act Section 311,” U.S. Department of the Treasury, May 28, 2013, https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl1956.aspx; “Treasury Designates Iran-Based Financial Facilitators of Malicious Cyber Activity and for the First Time Identifies Associated Digital Currency Addresses,” U.S. Department of the Treasury, November 28, 2018, https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm556.\n¹⁰¹ Francesco Giumelli, How EU sanctions work: A new narrative (Luxembourg: Publications Office of the European Union, 2013), 39, https://www.iss.europa.eu/sites/default/files/EUISSFiles/Chaillot_129.pdf. new narrative.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nof sanctions must take into account the alternatives. In the U.S. context, the NSC-led interagency process provides a forum for discussing the effectiveness of sanctions relative to other policy instruments.¹⁰² But as with academic literature on the efficacy of sanctions on non-state actors, Dursun Peksen argues that scholarly work on the utility of sanctions relative to other policy instruments is similarly lacking.¹⁰³\nNonetheless, as policymakers impose sanctions, they must consider the potential escalatory consequences and how alternative policy instruments might compare. Rosenberg and Tama highlight the need to better assess where sanctions sit on the escalation ladder to strengthen their signaling value and ensure that efforts at cross-domain deterrence do not inadvertently compromise broader foreign policy objectives.¹⁰⁴ As they put it, “if it is unclear whether an airstrike against a military facility is higher or lower on the escalation ladder than financial sanctions targeting a country’s most important economic sector, the target government may not understand the likely consequences of continuing to flout an international norm or U.S. demands.”¹⁰⁵\nCompared to actions like diplomatic statements, sanctions may be perceived as more escalatory since they aim to impose real financial costs and disrupt an operations’ financing. But in comparison to retaliatory cyberattacks or other military action, they may be less escalatory because their contours are narrowly defined, and policymakers can couple sanctions with clear statements of intention.¹⁰⁶ The EU’s sanctions, which refrain from attributing responsibility for an attack to a specific state, may be less escalatory than those imposed by the United States,¹⁰⁷ which, as described above, can and sometimes do allege state responsibility for wrongful behavior.\nIf adversaries see sanctions as escalatory, they may retaliate. Sanctions have generated such retaliation: Iran retaliated for U.S. sanctions with cyberattacks against the financial system.

As Peter Feaver and Eric Lorber have put it, targeted financial sanctions rely on calculations about business risk, and “If global business conditions change, the firms might re-calculate that engaging in financial transactions with those targeted states outweighs the costs.”¹¹⁰ This risk of such re-calculation may be heightened if sanctions create incentives for businesses to pursue transactions in other currencies or for countries to develop alternative financial architectures.¹¹¹\nThese concerns—and consideration of cyber sanctions generally—cannot be divorced from the broader context in which the United States has aggressively pursued the use of sanctions to achieve a range of foreign policy goals, sometimes to the detriment of ally relationships. Two particular issues are worth highlighting: 1) the credibility of sanctions commitments and 2) the use of secondary sanctions.¹¹²\nThe credibility of broader sanctions commitments matters for evaluating the effectiveness of cyber sanctions at deterrence. Elizabeth Rosenberg and Jordan Tama have noted that sanctions’ effectiveness depends on the credibility of both the threat to designate targets for wrongful behavior and the promise to lift sanctions if behavior changes.¹¹³ The United States’ withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) illustrates how failure to do the latter can undermine broader foreign policy goals. As Rosenberg and Tama write, “By walking away from\n¹⁰⁸ Ellen Nakashima, “Iran blamed for cyberattacks on U.S. banks and companies,” *Washington Post*, September 21, 2012, https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/iran-blamed-for-cyberattacks/2012/09/21/afbe2be4-0412-11e2-9b24-ff730c7f6312_story.html; Neil MacFarquhar, “Putin, Responding to Sanctions, Orders U.S. to Cut Diplomatic Staff by 755,” *New York Times*, July 30, 2017, https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/30/world/europe/russia-sanctions-us-diplomats-expelled.html\n¹⁰⁹ “Treasury Targets Supporters of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Networks Responsible for Cyber-Attacks Against the United States,” U.S. Department of the Treasury.\n¹¹⁰ Peter Feaver and Eric Lorber, “Coercive Diplomacy and the New Financial Levers: Evaluating the Intended and Unintended Consequences of Financial Sanctions,” *Legatum Institute*, November 2010, 44, https://lif.blob.core.windows.net/lif/docs/default-source/publications/2010-publications-coercive-diplomacy.pdf?Status=Temp&amp;sfvrsn=2.\n¹¹¹ Ibid., 46-47.\n¹¹² I thank Allison Peters and Ariel (Eli) Levite for highlighting these important points.\n¹¹³ Rosenberg and Tama, “Strengthening the Economic Arsenal,” 5.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nthose allies and partners, the United States has made them less inclined to privilege cooperation in the future.”¹¹⁴\nIn the U.S. context, the two-pronged approach to creating new sanctions frameworks further complicates the delisting process. Legal authorities in the United States for imposing sanctions can be created through executive or legislative means. U.S. sanctions remain in place until a target appeals to OFAC and demonstrates a change in behavior that warrants delisting (and the burden is on designated individuals and entities to present a basis for delisting) or until Congress votes to lift the sanctions.¹¹⁵ Congressionally mandated sanctions provide an essential check on executive action to impose sanctions unilaterally. But if Congress refuses to lift sanctions in response to behavioral change, they undermine the tool’s credibility. (By contrast to U.S. sanctions, EU sanctions are reviewed annually.¹¹⁶ In some ways, this may enhance the instrument’s credibility.)\nEfforts to understand the effectiveness of the United States’ cyber sanctions must also contend with the legislative authorities that provide for secondary sanctions. Secondary sanctions refer to “the threat of US sanctions against foreign individuals and entities for engaging in specified activities that may not have a US nexus.”¹¹⁷ In the context of cyber sanctions, these include provisions enshrined within CAATSA for imposing sanctions against individuals and entities that engage in “significant transactions” with certain Russian government entities¹¹⁸ and their personnel.¹¹⁹ Secondary sanctions are different from provisions that allow governments to target those that provide “technical, financial, or material support” to previously designated actors. As others have pointed out, both the U.S. and EU authorities accept that sanctions are more effective when targeting an adversary’s network.¹²⁰ Instead, secondary sanctions target those that continue to do business with a sanctioned entity, whether based in the United States or not.\n¹¹⁴ Ibid., 6.\n¹¹⁵ “Filing a Petition for Removal from an OFAC List,” U.S. Department of the Treasury, last updated May 2, 2017, https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/petitions.aspx.\n¹¹⁶ Council of the EU, “Adoption and review procedure for EU sanctions,” last reviewed February 14, 2019, https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/sanctions/adoption-review-procedure/.\n¹¹⁷ Samantha Sultoon and Justine Walker, “Secondary Sanctions’ Implications and the Transatlantic Relationship,” Atlantic Council, September 2019, 3, https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SecondarySanctions_Final.pdf.\n¹¹⁸ These include “the defense or intelligence sectors of the Government of the Russian Federation, including the Main Intelligence Agency of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation or the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation.” Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act of 2017, Public Law 115-44, U.S. Statutes at Large (2017), https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/hr3364_pl115-44.pdf.\n¹¹⁹ Ibid.\n¹²⁰ Sultoon and Walker, “Secondary Sanctions’ Implications and the Transatlantic Relationship,” 4.\n24\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nTo date, the United States has not imposed cyber-related secondary sanctions under CAATSA, but the legislation permitting secondary sanctions and their potential ramifications for EU projects has attracted criticism from the bloc.¹²¹ Because of U.S. withdrawal from the JCPOA, some EU members have signed on to the Instrument in Support of Trade Exchanges (INSTEX), a special purpose vehicle that “circumvents the traditional financial networks the US uses to establish its jurisdiction for enforcing sanctions,”¹²² to conduct business with Iranian entities.\nParticularly as European entities become subject to secondary U.S. sanctions and must find alternative payment systems, other countries face incentives to create alternative global financial architectures that erode the United States’ long-term power in the global economic system.¹²³ Countries like Russia, China, and even India, are interested in an alternative financial messaging system to SWIFT, but these have yet to catch on and face important limitations.¹²⁴\nSome have pointed out that “Multinational businesses seeking to avoid exposure to U.S. and EU sanctions can find refuge in the yuan and Chinese financial platforms.”¹²⁵ China’s “efforts to promote the yuan as a global currency and establish alternatives to the dollar- and euro-dominated international financial system”¹²⁶ may heighten the associated risks. Many are quick to point out that China faces several obstacles to achieving such a goal.¹²⁷ Still, as former senior Treasury adviser Elizabeth Rosenberg points out, “sanctions do give China’s economic ambitions an undeniable boost.”¹²⁸ Especially as financial technologies—like cryptocurrencies—introduce new ways for criminals to launder money,¹²⁹ the continued use of sanctions may\n¹²¹ “Russia sanctions: EU vows to retaliate over US measures,” BBC, July 26, 2017, https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40727044; Paul Ivan, “The US and the EU need a stronger dialogue on Russia,” European Policy Centre, May 2, 2018, https://www.epc.eu/en/Publications/The-US-and-the-EU-need-a-stronger-dialogue-on-Russia-sanctions~1e70f8; Karen DeYoung, “Three European allies ask U.S. not to enforce secondary sanctions over Iran trade,” Washington Post, June 6, 2018, https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/three-european-allies-ask-us-not-to-enforce-secondary-sanctions-over-iran-trade/2018/06/06/f4c94594-69c3-11e8-bea7-c8eb28bc52b1_story.html.\n¹²² Ellie Geranmayeh and Manuel Lafont Rapnouil, “Meeting the Challenge of Secondary Sanctions,” European Council on Foreign Relations, June 2019, 4, 7, https://www.ecfr.eu/publications/summary/meeting_the_challenge_of_secondary_sanctions.\n¹²³ Drezner, “Targeted Sanctions in a World of Global Finance,” 760-761.\n¹²⁴ Jignesh Davda, “China, Russia &amp; India Push Forward on SWIFT Alternative,” Yahoo!

The potential backlash to Washington’s gung-ho attitude toward financial sanctions may occur on a longer time horizon but carries arguably more significant consequence for U.S. global power.\nThe potential consequences mean that policymakers evaluating the effectiveness of cyber sanctions at deterring wrongful behavior must also consider the long-term trajectory of the tool’s use and how decisions within the broader foreign policy context affect the reception of sanctions.\n## Moving beyond deterrence\nA general emphasis on deterrence obscures the variety of different functions that sanctions can perform and the diversity of motives underpinning malicious cyber activity. Few, if any, policymakers would argue that the outright cessation of malicious cyber activity is a realistic goal that could be achieved by targeted financial sanctions. Given that some, like North Korea, pursue cybercrime as a means of sanctions evasion, one might even argue that sanctions are counterproductive if the goal is understood to stop malicious cyber activity.^[130]^ As described above, the academic and policy literature on the effectiveness of cyber sanctions at deterrence is difficult to measure. So why do policymakers continue to employ sanctions in the seeming absence of compelling evidence about their effectiveness?\nThe academic literature on targeted sanctions has attempted to account for some of the different aims of sanctions and the diverse threats they can target by introducing three potential purposes—constraint, coercion, and signaling.^[131]^ Even these, however, ignore the nuanced and specific purposes for imposing sanctions in response to malicious cyber activity. To say that a sanctions designation aims to “signal,” for example, ignores important features of the message itself, its intended audience, and its contribution to the broader goal of sending a message by sanctioning.\nOthers divide the purposes of sanctions into “symbolic” or “expressive” and “instrumental” ones.^[132]^ Symbolic or expressive purposes relate to the political interests served by doing something in response to wrongful behavior—i.e., signaling. Instrumental objectives relate to desired policy or behavior changes—i.e., coercion and constraint.\n^[130]^ Elizabeth Rosenberg and Neil Bhatiya, “Busting North Korea’s Sanctions Evasion,” Center for a New American Security, March 4, 2020, https://www.cnas.org/publications/commentary/busting-north-koreas-sanctions-evasion.\n^[131]^ Giumelli, *How EU sanctions work*, 18-19.\n^[132]^ Taehee Whang, “Playing to the Home Crowd?

The degree to which a state might be responsible for malicious activity varies from an inability to prevent malicious attacks to active participation in an attack.¹³⁵\nSanctions designations are public listings that name individuals or entities in response to malicious behavior. As Kristen Eichensehr has argued, they can attribute wrongful conduct by naming the individual or entity that directly perpetrated a cyberattack or indicating state responsibility for an attack.¹³⁶\nThis is not always the case. Because targets can be sanctioned for materially, financially, or technologically enabling a previously designated actor, they do not always publicize attribution in the sense of identifying hackers. And because ascertaining the nature of the relationship between a state and a hacker can be difficult, not all sanctions allege that a state enabled or orchestrated wrongful behavior in cyberspace.\nBut in some cases, sanctions do serve to implicate a state in malicious cyber activity.

Within the EU, attribution is a “sovereign political decision” left up to each member state’s discretion.¹³⁸ As a result, EU sanctions designations avoid making a specific link between a designated individual or entity and a state sponsor, even when, as in the case of the July 2020 Russian targets, some of the listed individuals may work on behalf of government agencies or may be government agencies themselves.¹³⁹,¹⁴⁰ Though attribution is also a sovereign political decision in the United States, the process is more straightforward—there is no need to wrangle the agreement of twenty-seven member states to attribute.\nIndependent of the political reasons for (not) attributing a cyberattack, not all jurisdictions are equally competent in their ability to attribute. States differ in their ability to identify technical and political indicators of compromise and use signals, human, and open-source intelligence to understand them.¹⁴¹ As one RAND Corporation report put it, “These capabilities may not be widespread globally, and very few countries are thought to possess sophisticated all-source capabilities.”¹⁴²\n## Information-sharing¹⁴³\nThe press releases that accompany sanctions designations sometimes contain important information about how malicious actors carry out their attacks.

In the United States, for example, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) Exchange is a Treasury-led “voluntary public-private information sharing partnership among law enforcement, financial institutions, and FinCEN aimed at effectively and efficiently combating money laundering, terrorism financing, organized crime, and other financial crimes; protecting the financial system from illicit use; and promoting national security.”¹⁴⁴ Additionally, the Bank Secrecy Act Advisory Group (BSAAG) is “the means by which Treasury receives advice on the operations of the Bank Secrecy Act,” a key piece of U.S. law regarding money laundering.¹⁴⁵ Made of up representatives from federal agencies, financial institutions, and trade groups, BSAAG is chaired by the FinCEN director.¹⁴⁶ Though these mechanisms are essential means of sharing information, the participating institutions and representatives are limited.\nHowever, public press releases can garner the attention of a broader set of stakeholders with sanctions compliance obligations and can aid in disseminating information related to cyber threats. For example, the United States’ designation of Nigerian cybercriminals contained details of how Richard Uzuh and his co-conspirators spoofed emails from business executives to trick Americans into wiring money.¹⁴⁷\n## Audience satisfaction\nSanctions may satisfy the political pressure to “do something” in response to malicious cyber activity.¹⁴⁸ As Richard Hanania has argued, sanctions have a significant political purpose insofar as they “appear to be a moderate and measured response to unacceptable behavior abroad.”¹⁴⁹ And they are a safe option for policymakers because the targets—foreign publics—cannot easily influence American politics (i.e., vote), and, therefore, “there is little reason to suspect that their\n¹⁴⁴ Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, “FinCEN Exchange Questions and Answers,” U.S. Department of the Treasury, https://www.fincen.gov/index.php/resources/fincen-exchange/fincen-exchange-frequently-asked-questions.\n¹⁴⁵ U.S. Department of the Treasury, Notice, “Financial Crimes Enforcement Network; Bank Secrecy Act Advisory Group; Solicitation of Application for Membership,” *Federal Register* 83, no. 248 (December 28, 2018): 67487, https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2018-12-28/pdf/2018-28178.pdf.\n¹⁴⁶ Ibid.\n¹⁴⁷ “Treasury Sanctions Nigerian Cyber Actors for Targeting U.S. Businesses and Individuals,” U.S. Department of the Treasury.\n¹⁴⁸ William Kaempfer and Anton Lowenberg, “The Political Economy of Economic Sanctions,” in *Handbook of Defense Economics, Volume 2*, ed.

In some cases, sanctions are met with laudatory statements from allied governments. For example, the United States released such a message when the European Union imposed cyber sanctions for the first time in July 2020.¹⁵³\n## Cooperation with allies\nGiven that both the United States and European Union have legal frameworks to impose sanctions against malicious cyber actors, there is a potential cooperative dimension to the policy. Some have suggested that sanctions work better when there are concerted efforts among states to restrict an actor’s capabilities and deny its action’s benefits because it limits the actor’s ability to mitigate losses in other markets.¹⁵⁴ Even without cooperative effort, sanctions can signal to members of the international community a shared commitment to reducing malicious activity. Where the cyber context is concerned, European action can have a particularly important signaling function given, as a former State Department official put it, the fact that actors like Russia and China are increasingly writing off signaling from the United States.¹⁵⁵\nThe U.S. and EU legal authorities are mostly similar, heightening the potential cooperative dimension. At their cores, both offer the ability to impose sanctions on individuals and entities that disrupt the confidentiality, availability, or integrity of data or the functioning of computer systems that support critical infrastructure or governmental services.

Imposing sanctions in concert with like-minded nations further strengthens the norm development function. Having multiple states commit to punishing a malicious actor reinforces the wrongfulness of the act in question and helps establish what constitutes an appropriate state response to such wrongful behavior.¹⁵⁷\nIn his statement following the EU’s first cyber sanctions, High Representative Josep Borrell explicitly referenced commitment to implementing the norms developed by the UN Group of Government Experts’ (UNGGE) 2010, 2013, and 2015 reports and to continued cooperation the ongoing UNGGE and Open-Ended Working Group.¹⁵⁸\n## Punishment of malicious actors\nBy blocking transactions and freezing malicious cyber actors’ assets, policymakers demonstrate that engaging in offensive behavior has real financial consequences. Because many cyberattacks are financially motivated, sanctions deny the benefits of an actor’s behavior by making it more difficult to access and move money.¹⁵⁹\nGoldman has argued that targeted financial sanctions play a vital role in the broader effort to deter financially motivated cybercrime—especially cyber-enabled economic espionage—by “drying up the market for stolen data.”¹⁶⁰ Since the United States’ sanctions framework allows for the designation of not just those who steal intellectual property but also those who benefit\n¹⁵⁶ “Treasury Targets Russian Operatives over Election Interference, World Anti-Doping Agency Hacking, and Other Malign Activities,” U.S. Department of the Treasury; U.S. President, “Taking Additional Steps to Address the National Emergency With Respect to Significant Malicious Cyber-Enabled Activities,” 3; “Treasury Targets North Korea for Multiple Cyber-Attacks,” U.S. Department of the Treasury; Council Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/1125 of July 30, 2020, O.J.

By freezing assets and blocking transactions, sanctions can disrupt the financing of an offensive cyber operation. In theory, they can also disrupt a state’s ability to recruit the talent necessary to carry out a sophisticated operation—the exposure of a hacker’s identity and the financial punishment may dissuade would-be hackers from serving as a proxy.\nSanctions against terrorist financiers are an important precedent in this respect. In 2001, then-president George W. Bush signed Executive Order 13224 to allow for the imposition of sanctions against those determined “To assist in, sponsor, or provide financial, material, or technological support for, or financial or other services in support of, acts of terrorism.”¹⁶² According to Juan Zarate, a former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes, the use of sanctions against terrorist organizations led to the development of additional horizontal sanctions programs to deal with behavior-based national security threats—like cyber threats.¹⁶³ The logic of going after financing networks and enablers is simple: As Zachary Goldman has put it, “Entities like drug trafficking networks, terrorist groups, and proliferation facilitators require substantial streams of funding and access to the global financial system, to remain effective. The more time and resources they spend trying to fund an organization, the less time spent planning attacks or engaging in other illicit activity.”¹⁶⁴\n## Deterrence\nThrough the previously listed means, sanctions may aspire to a deterrent function that seeks to change state actors’ long-term behavior in cyberspace. The repeated imposition of sanctions may introduce sustained friction in the relationship between the proxy and the state that changes the state’s overall calculus about how and when to engage in malicious cyber activity. Over time, this may lead to a change in the nature of the state’s relationship with its proxies and the degree of risk it is willing to accept when engaging in offensive cyber operations. By punishing\n¹⁶¹ U.S. President, “Blocking the Property of Certain Persons Engaging in Significant Malicious Cyber-Enabled Activities,” 18077.\n¹⁶² Bureau of Counterterrorism, “Executive Order 13224,” U.S. Department of State, https://www.state.gov/executive-order-13224/.\n¹⁶³ I thank former Assistant Secretary Zarate for highlighting this historical context.\n¹⁶⁴ Zachary Goldman, “Cybersecurity and a New Era of Asymmetric Economic Warfare.”\n32\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\ncountries that engage in offensive activity and demonstrating the international community’s support for this behavior, states can aim to increase the effort, raise the risk, and reduce offensive cyber actors’ rewards.¹⁶⁵\nDespite the difficulty, even for policymakers, of evaluating sanctions’ success at deterrence, they remain a tool often used for responding to malicious activity. Therefore, our understanding of the impact of sanctions must go beyond the deterrent function and consider the additional symbolic purposes outlined above and the factors that might also impact how symbolic goals are achieved. Table 2 summarizes questions policymakers might consider in evaluating the effectiveness of sanctions at achieving the variety of purposes set forward in this section and the considerations for assessing deterrence outlined in the previous section.\nTable 2. Questions for evaluating effectiveness\n|  Function | Questions  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  Attribution | • Do the statements accompanying a sanctions designation claim that the named entities perpetrated a cyberattack itself?\n• Do the statements accompanying a sanctions designation allege state responsibility for wrongful behavior in cyberspace?\n• Have other policies or legal action (i.e., indictments) made similar attribution claims?  |\n|  Information-sharing | • Do private sector entities pay attention to sanctions notices more than other vehicles for information-sharing about cyber threats?\n• Do the statements accompanying a sanctions designation contain meaningful information about the tactics, techniques, and procedures employed by malicious actors that external stakeholders could use to fortify their networks?  |\n|  Audience satisfaction | • Do actors in the private sector or civil society find sanctions a meaningful and appropriate response to malicious activity?\n• Do allies release diplomatic statements affirming the appropriateness of the action?  |\n|  Cooperation with allies | • Do (or could) other jurisdictions impose sanctions against the same targets?\n• Do other countries release diplomatic statements affirming the appropriateness of the action?  |\n|  Norm development | • Does the offense that prompted sanction violate an established norm of responsible behavior in cyberspace?  |\n¹⁶⁵ Joseph Nye, Jr., “Deterrence and Dissuasion in Cyberspace,” *International Security* 41, no. 3 (Winter 2016/17): 56, https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/ISEC_a_00266.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\n- Have other countries or jurisdictions signaled that sanctions are the appropriate response to this type of norm violation?\n## Punishment\n- How exposed is the individual or entity to the U.S. dollar or the euro’s impact in global financial markets?\n- What is the monetary value of the transactions blocked or assets frozen as a result of the sanction?\n- Do opportunities exist for a designated actor to protect their assets or recoup their losses?\n## Disruption of capabilities\n- Do sanctions disrupt an actor’s ability to procure material, financial, or technological resources necessary to carry out malicious activity?\n- How do sanctions affect the willingness of proxies to engage with state sponsors of malicious cyber activity?\n- Do opportunities exist for actors to circumvent sanctions or mitigate their impact by using alternative financial architectures?\n## Deterrence\n- Over time, does the nature of a particular actor’s behavior in cyberspace change?\n- Do sanctions change the risk-calculus of those engaged in malicious cyber activity?\n- Over time, does the nature of malicious cyber activity in general change?\n## General\n- How might adversaries respond or retaliate to sanctions? What is the likelihood of the target engaging in retaliation, and what would the consequences of retaliation be?\n- Are the costs absorbed by the sender of sanctions proportionate to the costs imposed on targets?\n- What alternative policy options are available, and how do the effects of these tools compare to those of sanctions?\n- What might the long-term consequences be for the architecture of the global financial system?\nHaving discussed the eight purposes sanctions may seek to serve, the operational question remains whether policymakers clearly articulate these objectives and how they measure sanctions’ effectiveness at achieving any of these goals. Not all of the potential purposes of cyber sanctions writ large will be served by a single designation, nor should they be. Policymakers’ goals differ with respect to the variety of cyber threats. The aim of preventing low-level cybercrime like business email compromise scams is different from seeking to encourage states to rein in their proxies when conducting offensive cyber operations.\nNo matter which goals policymakers have in mind with a sanctions designation, they should keep in mind the considerations outlined above pertaining to alternative policy instruments and long-term consequences. Take, for example, the goal of audience satisfaction and the pressure to “do something” in response to malicious cyber activity: Escalation can undermine audience\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nsatisfaction if a greater number of private sector entities become the victims of cyberattacks in response to sanctions. And the repeated imposition of sanctions may have diminishing returns as far as satisfying audiences—if policymakers describe sanctions in deterrence terms, domestic audiences may be satisfied initially, but the continuation of activity may be interpreted as a sign of failure and lend itself to disappointment.\nThis section has outlined seven purposes in addition to deterrence that policymakers may have in mind when employing sanctions against malicious cyber actors. It is difficult to say whether sanctions deter. But despite the emphasis on deterrence in policy statements, sanctions can have important symbolic purposes that should factor into evaluations of sanctions programs.\n# Conclusion\nThe definitional issues highlighted at the beginning of this paper related to what constitutes malicious cyber activity and should be included within this paper’s scope and the variety of aims of sanctions can raise a question about whether it makes sense to speak of a country or jurisdiction’s “cyber policy” or consider cyber issues a facet of a broader foreign policy. Future research in this area should address how policy should deal with the distinction between “cyber” as a threat itself and as a means for accomplishing other ends like intelligence collection, economic competition, or control over domestic political spaces. The United States’ use, in particular, of a variety of different legal instruments—not just the cyber-specific sanctions framework—highlights the fact that cybercrime and national security threats require a variety of flexible tools. More clearly delineating how and why cyber activity crosses a line of acceptability is crucial to promoting responsible behavior in cyberspace and identifying appropriate mechanisms for responding to harms.\nMore empirical research is also needed in this area. Much of the academic literature on sanctions focuses on those levied against states and deals insufficiently with the success of sanctions against nonstate and proxy actors. $^{166}$ As transnational threats multiply and policymakers reach for sanctions in response, they should have a clear evidence base supporting their decision making.\nThough policymakers often emphasize the goal of deterrence, articulation of the considerations for evaluating the effectiveness of sanctions is scant, even among government actors with access to the full array of intelligence necessary to make such evaluations. Policymakers should consider a target’s vulnerability to economic pressure, actors’ motivations, and the role that\n$^{166}$ Peksen, “When Do Imposed Economic Sanctions Work?,” 7-8.\n35\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\ntargets play in wrongful behavior in seeking to evaluate the likely outcomes of a sanctions designation and its effectiveness. Furthermore, questions of effectiveness also require attention to alternative policy options and long-term consequences.\nMoving beyond deterrence and cost imposition, the diversity of actors against which policymakers impose sanctions requires more nuanced thinking. In the absence of clear frameworks for evaluating effectiveness and relative pessimism about sanctions’ effectiveness, policymakers continue to reach for the tool. Therefore, our understanding of the purposes of sanctions should account for functions like attribution, information-sharing, audience satisfaction, cooperation with allies, norm development, and punishment.\nDespite being hailed as ineffective by academic scholars, policymakers continue to employ sanctions. Data collected by the Center for a New American Security shows that the current U.S. administration is more than willing to sanction adversaries. Even though 2019 saw the fewest designations during the current administration, the yearly total was still more than those of any single year under the previous administration.¹⁶⁷ And the EU’s recent implementation of its cyber sanctions framework for the first time indicates that neither is the policy tool falling out of favor abroad.\n¹⁶⁷ Johnpatrick Imperiale, “Sanctions by the Numbers,” Center for a New American Security, February 27, 2020, https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/sanctions-by-the-numbers.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816",

Cyberspace is also increasingly a domain of geopolitical conflict. State (and non-state) actors are acquiring offensive cyber capabilities and have demonstrated a willingness to use them—states have conducted at least 358 hostile cyber operations since 2005, more than half of which have occurred since 2017.\nThe increasing number of attacks puts pressure on governments to counter malicious cyber activity and to promote norms of responsible behavior in cyberspace. States have relied on a mix of diplomatic, informational, economic, and law enforcement options to respond to malicious cyber activity. Some refer to these tools as the DIME(LE) set of instruments available to states seeking to influence others’ behavior.,\nSanctions are part of a state’s arsenal. Both the United States and the European Union have created specific authorities for targeted financial sanctions in response to malicious cyber activity—referred to throughout this paper as “cyber sanctions.” The United States has imposed\n The Center for Strategic and International Studies maintains a list of significant cyberattacks that have occurred since 2006, and the Council on Foreign Relations maintains an interactive tracker of offensive cyber operations perpetrated by states. See: “Significant Cyber Incidents,” Center for Strategic and International Studies, last updated April 2020, https://www.csis.org/programs/technology-policy-program/significant-cyber-incidents; “Cyber Operations Tracker,” Council on Foreign Relations, https://www.cfr.org/interactive/cyber-operations.\n The Council on Foreign Relations uses the term “operations” to refer to 1) denial of service; 2) espionage; 3) data destruction; 4) defacement; 5) sabotage; 6) doxing; and 7) financial theft. See “Cyber Operations Tracker,” Council on Foreign Relations.\n Patryk Pawlak, Eneken Tikk, and Mika Kerttunen, “Cyber Conflict Uncoded,” European Union Institute for Security Studies, April 2020, https://www.iss.europa.eu/sites/default/files/EUISSFiles/Brief%207_Cyber.pdf.\n The DIME(LE) model is one method of categorizing these tools. A variety of others are used within the United States military to categorize and describe the operational environment; these include: 1) diplomatic, informational, military, and economic (DIME); 2) diplomatic, informational, military, economic, financial, intelligence, law enforcement (DIMEFIL); and 3) political, military, economic, social, informational, infrastructure (PMESII), among others.

Kem, “Understanding the Operational Environment: The Expansion of DIME,” *Military Intelligence Professional Bulletin* 33, no. 2 (April – June 2007): 49-53, https://fas.org/irp/agency/army/mipb/2007_02.pdf.\n Tim Maurer, *Cyber Mercenaries: The State, Hackers, and Power* (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2018), 139.\n U.S. Department of State, “Cyber Sanctions,” n.d., https://www.state.gov/cyber-sanctions/, accessed January 20, 2020; Council of the EU, “Cyber-attacks: Council is now able to impose sanctions,” Press release, May 17, 2019, https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2019/05/17/cyber-attacks-council-is-now-able-to-impose-sanctions/.\n This use of the term “cyber sanctions” is distinct from that of those who use it to refer to from the use of cyberattacks as a coercive method employed to “sanction” the wrongful behavior of adversaries or to achieve coercive economic ends. For a discussion on this topic, see: Marco Benatar and Kristof Gombeer, “Cyber Sanctions: Exploring a Blind Spot in the Current Legal Debate,” European Society of International Law Conference Paper\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nsanctions in response to malicious cyber activity thirty-five times over the past decade, and the European Union and the United Kingdom imposed similar sanctions for the first time in July 2020 and again in October 2020.\nScholars have long debated the effectiveness of sanctions generally and their ability to achieve policy aims. To evaluate the efficacy of cyber sanctions, one must first articulate the goals of sanctions and what they might be useful for achieving. Once policymakers answer questions of effectiveness, they can then craft their use of sanctions to best address relevant threats in cyberspace.\nThe diversity of malicious behavior in cyberspace makes it difficult to identify a coherent logic for using sanctions. States conduct offensive cyber operations in service of political goals while criminals engage in hacking for profit—sometimes, the two occur alongside one another. The use of proxies in cyberspace complicates efforts to distinguish politically motivated and financially motivated attacks and obscures the relationship between state and non-state actors.\nFurther compounding the problem are questions related to the harms that should be included in the definition of “malicious cyber activity.” Narrow definitions of “cyberattack” use the term to\nSeries, Conference Paper No. 9/2011, May 1, 2011, https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1989786 and Zachary Goldman, “Cybersecurity and a New Era of Asymmetric Economic Warfare,” Just Security, January 16, 2015, https://www.justsecurity.org/19150/cybersecurity-era-asymmetric-economic-warfare/.\n Council Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/1125 of July 30, 2020, implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/796 concerning restrictive measures against cyber-attacks threatening the Union or its Member States, 2020 O.J.

But cyber tools can be used to engage in other wrongful behavior that falls outside of this framework. As a policy matter, the United States has used its cyber sanctions framework to punish behavior like election interference.

As a result, this paper looks beyond sanctions frameworks meant explicitly to deal with malicious cyber activity and includes instances when additional horizontal frameworks have been used to respond to wrongful uses of information and communications technologies.\nThis paper seeks to provide an overview of targeted financial sanctions for countering malicious cyber activity in the United States and Europe and considerations regarding the tool’s effectiveness. Although policymakers often highlight deterrence and cost imposition as critical goals, both academic literature and policy documents point to difficulty measuring sanctions’ success at achieving these aims.\nThe continued reliance on the tool suggests that policymakers have other motivations for responding to malicious cyber activity with sanctions, regardless of whether sanctions are effective or whether their effectiveness can be measured.

Part two discusses how policymakers and academics evaluate sanctions’ effectiveness at achieving often-touted deterrence goals and specific considerations related to policy alternatives and long-term consequences. Policymakers cannot ignore the alternative instruments available to respond to malicious cyber activity in thinking about effectiveness and must weigh the trade-offs associated with alternative responses to cyberattacks. Finally, policymakers cannot ignore how firms and other states respond to and perceive the credibility of U.S. sanctions in the long-run—both as it relates to their imposition and removal (or lack thereof). They must consider the corresponding implications for the architecture of the global financial system and United States’ ability to weaponize its financial position. Part three then offers a categorization of the different purposes that sanctions can serve beyond deterrence. These purposes include attribution, information-sharing, audience satisfaction, cooperation with allies, norm development, punishment, and disruption of capabilities—all of which contribute cumulatively to the overarching goal of deterrence.\n## Defining “cyber sanctions”\n### What do sanctions entail?\nThe United States and EU’s cyber sanctions are targeted sanctions that differ from sanctions imposed during and before the 1990s. Comprehensive trade sanctions were a popular instrument of economic coercion throughout the 20th century, in part because they are less costly, less risky, and more palatable than military action. Targeted sanctions differ from comprehensive ones in coercive logic, the intended target, and the ultimate goal. Though similarly aimed at eliciting a change in state behavior, they focus on specific individuals and entities rather than the population at large. They assume that singling out individuals or groups will better “raise the target regime’s costs of noncompliance.” Targeted sanctions can also aim to change the\n Arne Tostensen and Beate Bull, “Are Smart Sanctions Feasible?” World Politics 53, no. 3 (April 2002): 380, 382.\n Daniel Drezner, “How Smart Are Smart Sanctions?” International Studies Review 5, no. 1 (March 2003): 107; see also Tostensen and Bull, “Are Smart Sanctions Feasible?” 380, 386; Thomas G.

Targeted sanctions are understood to have additional value for constraining and signaling. By “constraining,” these scholars refer to complicating an actor’s ability to engage in internationally wrongful behavior. By “signaling,” they refer to sending a message to the target, domestic audiences, and international audiences that expresses support for norms of appropriate behavior.\nOne type of targeted sanction, restrictive financial measures (also referred to as targeted financial sanctions), is increasingly the tool of choice for policymakers seeking to impose consequences for internationally wrongful behavior. Targeted financial sanctions include asset freezes, blocking transactions with designated individuals or entities, and denying access to capital markets. The tool relies on the preeminence of certain currencies and jurisdictions in global financial transactions. Big financial players like the United States, Europe, and, to a lesser extent, China can weaponize the financial system to prevent specific individuals or organizations from transacting in their respective currencies.

The United States, EU, and UK authorities relate principally to compromises in data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\nThese cyber-specific frameworks, however, do not tell the whole story. As early as 2011, the European Union sanctioned individuals and entities engaged in the surveillance and abuse of Iranian journalists and activists. Some of the same violators later came under additional U.S.\n Rachel Loeffler, “Bank Shots,” Foreign Affairs, March 1, 2009, https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/northkorea/2009-03-01/bank-shots; Rosenberg, et al., “The New Tools of Economic Warfare,” 5; Juan Zarate, “Harnessing the Financial Furies: Smart Financial Power and National Security,” The Washington Quarterly 32, no. 4 (October 2009): 43; Elizabeth Rosenberg, “Testimony before the United States House of Representatives Committee on Financial Services, Subcommittee on National Security, International Development and Monetary Policy: ‘Assessing the Use of Sanctions in Addressing National Security and Foreign Policy Challenges,’” Center for a New American Security, May 15, 2019, https://www.cnas.org/publications/congressional-testimony/elizabeth-rosenberg-before-the-house-financial-services-committee.\n U.S. President, Executive Order, “Blocking the Property of Certain Persons Engaging in Significant Malicious Cyber-Enabled Activities, Executive Order 13694 of April 1, 2015,” Federal Register 80, no. 63 (April 2, 2015).\n Council Regulation 2019/796 of May 17, 2019, concerning restrictive measures against cyber-attacks threatening the Union or its Member States, 2019 O.J.

And the United States has used its cyber-specific framework and a different election interference framework to punish Russian cyber-enabled influence operators.\nThese Iran- and Russia-linked cases are somewhat ambiguous as to whether or not they constitute cyber-enabled harms that should be included in this paper. They do not fit neatly into the definition of cyberattack promulgated by the U.S. National Institute of Technology and Standards: “An attack, via cyberspace, targeting an enterprise’s use of cyberspace for the purpose of disrupting, disabling, destroying, or maliciously controlling a computing environment/infrastructure; or destroying the integrity of the data or stealing controlled information.” For example, monitoring dissidents or using social media to promote narratives online does not necessarily compromise data confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Still, the United States and Europe have considered them harmful enough uses of information and communications technologies to warrant punishment. For this reason, sanctions falling under the cyber-specific framework, as well as others related to cyber-enabled influence operations and human rights violations, are included within the scope of this paper.\n## “Cyber sanctions” to date\nWith these definitional concerns in mind, this section provides a brief overview of the cyber sanctions imposed to date in both the United States and Europe.\nExecutive Order 13694, which created the United States’ cyber-specific sanctions framework, “declare[d] a national emergency with respect to the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States posed by the increasing prevalence and severity of malicious cyber-enabled activities originating from or directed by, persons located, in whole or in substantial part, outside the United States.”\nSo far, the United States has imposed thirty-five tranches of sanctions related to malicious cyber activity under both the cyber-specific framework and other country-specific and horizontal\n For example, the EU sanctioned Abdolsamad Khoramabadi, head of the Committee to Determine Instances of Criminal Content, in March 2013, and the United States later imposed sanctions in May 2018.

These designations involve entities linked to Iran, North Korea, Russia, China, and Nigeria. The earliest designations, dating back to 2012 (made under an Executive Order on terrorism-related sanctions), dealt with Iranian government officials and entities participating in computer hacking projects with Hezbollah. Since then, the United States has sanctioned a range of cybercriminals and nation-state hackers. These include North Korean actors that participated in the 2014 hack of Sony Pictures, Russian actors engaged in cyber-enabled election interference, and Iranian actors targeting U.S. financial institutions. Since 2012, the United States has sanctioned over 250 individuals and entities for engaging in or enabling malicious cyber activity. (For a complete list of incidents, see Table 1.) The majority have been of Iranian, Russian, or North Korean origin. In the first half of 2020, however, the United States took action against two Chinese nationals for aiding Lazarus Group’s efforts to launder money, as well as six Nigerian individuals engaged in business email compromise and romance fraud scams.\nIn statements on the Executive Order, policymakers highlighted the “significant increase in the frequency, scale, and sophistication of cyber incidents targeting the American people” to justify its signing. Absent in many of these statements are clear articulations of how the administration would evaluate these sanctions’ effectiveness. In a blog post following the signing of the April 2015 Executive Order, White House counterterrorism advisor Lisa Monica explained that policymakers hoped to “deter” and “impose costs” on adversaries. But the specific means by which the U.S. Department of the Treasury would evaluate the program’s effectiveness remain unclear.

Though there were no initial designations, the program’s finalization came days before European Parliament elections, perhaps to signal the bloc’s ability to “move quickly to punish future attacks.” EU officials commenting on the newly created authority highlighted concern “at the rise of malicious behavior in cyberspace that aims at undermining the EU’s integrity, security and economic competitiveness, with the eventual risk of conflict.” Again, the Europeans highlight deterrence as a goal of cyber sanctions: High Representative Josep Borrell described the EU’s cyber sanctions as having been imposed “In order to better prevent, discourage, deter, and respond to such malicious behavior in cyberspace.”\nIn June 2020, the United Kingdom finalized its own cyber sanctions framework, “intended to deliver similar policy effects to that existing EU sanctions framework,” for when its transition period out of the European Union comes to an end at the start of 2021. Shortly thereafter, the High Representative of the European Union confirmed that EU candidate and potential candidate countries, members of the European Economic Area, Iceland, Norway, Ukraine, and Georgia would align themselves with these sanctions as well, bringing the total number of countries currently aligned with the EU’s sanctions framework to thirty-seven.\n Steven Mnuchin, “Department of the Treasury Budget Request for FY2021,” Hearing Before the Financial Services and General Government Subcommittee, March 4, 2020, at 1:31:14, https://appropriations.house.gov/events/hearings/department-of-the-treasury-budget-request-for-fy2021.\n Samuel Stolton, “EU backs cyber sanctions regime, following Dutch and UK pressure,” EURACTIV.com, last updated June 3, 2019, https://www.euractiv.com/section/cybersecurity/news/eu-backs-cyber-sanctions-regime-following-dutch-and-uk-pressure/; Adam Botek, “European Union establishes a sanction regime for cyber-attacks,” NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, https://ccdcoe.org/library/publications/european-union-establishes-a-sanction-regime-for-cyber-attacks/.\n “Days before elections, EU approves new cyber sanctions regime,” Reuters, May 17, 2019, https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-cyber/days-before-elections-eu-approves-new-cyber-sanctions-regime-idUSKCN1SN1FQ.\n Council of the EU, “Cyber-attacks: Council is now able to impose sanctions.”\n Council of the EU, “Declaration by the High Representative Josep Borrell on behalf of the EU: European Union response to promote international stability in cyberspace,” Press release, July 30, 2020, https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2020/07/30/declaration-by-the-high-representative-josep-borrell-on-behalf-of-the-eu-european-union-response-to-promote-international-security-and-stability-in-cyberspace/.\n Explanatory Memorandum to the Cyber (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations, 2020 No. 597, Government of the United Kingdom, https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/597/pdfs/uksiem_20200597_en.pdf.\n The Cyber (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020, UK Statutory Instruments.\n Council of the EU, “Declaration by the High Representative on behalf of the EU on the alignment of certain third countries concerning restrictive measures against cyber-attacks threatening the Union or its member states,” Press release, June 19, 2020, https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2020/06/19/declaration-by-the-\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nAt the end of July 2020, the EU took the critical step of imposing cyber sanctions for the first time on six individuals and three entities from North Korea, Russia, and China for orchestrating the WannaCry ransomware attack in 2017, attacks on financial institutions and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, and cyber-enabled economic espionage.

As Zachary Goldman and Damon McCoy have pointed out, “different kinds of malicious cyber activity demand different, tailored, deterrence strategies. This is because each category of cyber threat has a different motivation, and therefore will be sensitive to a different type of cost.”51 Nation-state hackers with political goals are unlikely to suffer the same consequences of a sanctions designation that independent cybercriminals with financial motivations will suffer. Similarly, designating a government official orchestrating an attack is unlikely to have the same impact as designating an individual two or three steps removed that launders money on behalf of a hacking group.\nTwo things complicate the effort to neatly distinguish between categories like cybercrime and nation-state activity and state and non-state actors. First, the convergence of financially-motivated cybercrime and nation-state activity makes it difficult to separate cyberattacks conducted for purely economic gain and those undertaken for political purposes.52 North Korean efforts to raise funds for its weapons of mass destruction program through cyber theft and ransom operations against financial institutions and cryptocurrency exchanges have demonstrated the difficulty of separating financial motivations from political goals.53 Similarly, state-sponsored economic espionage emanating from China blurs the distinction between financial and political aims as the theft of intellectual property aims to “support its strategic development goals—science and technology advancement, military modernization, and economic policy objectives.”54\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nSecond, the use of proxies for conducting offensive cyber operations often precludes a neat division between state and non-state actors in cyberspace. Tim Maurer’s comprehensive overview of the use of proxies for accomplishing offensive cyber operations details the spectrum of relationships between states and their proxies. These relationships range from overt delegation of activity to loose orchestration to passive enablement of proxy behavior. In the latter cases, those operating at a state’s behest may also have a foot in the criminal world. For example, in 2019, Treasury alleged that a Russian cybercriminal indicted and sanctioned for developing and distributing malware also operated on behalf of the Russian government, “highlighting the Russian government’s enlistment of cybercriminals for its own malicious purposes.”\n## Evaluating effectiveness\nIt is not within the remit of external observers to assess whether cyber sanctions effectively achieve deterrence. Much of the information needed to make such an assessment is classified or privately owned intelligence. Though Treasury publicly reports the value of transactions blocked under specific sanctions programs, others have pointed out that evaluating the success of cyber sanctions based on the financial value of prevented transactions is misleading. Therefore, it is difficult for policymakers to attribute any observed decrease in malicious cyber activity or change in activity to sanctions or determine whether activity levels would be even greater absent the threat of sanctions or imposition.\nWithin the U.S. government, Treasury’s Office of Intelligence and Analysis (OIA) and the State Department’s Bureau of Intelligence and Research perform impact assessments. According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), which published a review of U.S. sanctions programs and their effectiveness in 2019, “These assessments analyze the impacts of specific sanctions on a particular aspect of the sanction’s target—for example, the sanctions’ impact on the target country’s economy or trade.” OIA, for example, conducts impact assessments before a sanctions designation and after its imposition and may include factors like the target’s U.S.-\n Maurer, *Cyber Mercenaries*, 42-49.\n “Treasury Sanctions Evil Corp, the Russia-Based Cybercriminal Group Behind Dridex Malware,” U.S. Department of the Treasury, December 5, 2019, https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm845,\n Annie Fixler and Eric Lorber, “Counting Pennies Underestimates the Value of Treasury’s Cyber Sanctions,” Foundation for Defense of Democracies, November 4, 2019, https://www.fdd.org/analysis/2019/11/04/counting-pennies-underestimates-the-value-of-treasurys-cyber-sanctions/.\n Kimberly Gianopoulos, “Economic Sanctions: Agencies Assess Impacts on Targets, and Studies Suggest Several Factors Contribute to Sanctions’ Effectiveness,” U.S. Government Accountability Office, October 2019, 12, https://www.gao.gov/assets/710/701891.pdf.\n Ibid.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nbased assets, global holdings, and interactions with the United States and the potential cascading consequences of a sanctions designation.\nHowever, the report acknowledges that “these assessments do not analyze sanctions’ overall effectiveness in achieving broader U.S. policy goals or objectives, such as whether the sanctions are advancing the national security and policy priorities of the United States” (emphasis added). OIA distinguishes between impact and effect in its assessments:\nAccording to OIA officials, assessing impact is analyzing the potential or observed effect of the sanction on the target. According to officials, impact can be focused on a singular target or could be broader, such as the impact on the target country’s economy or trade flows. In contrast, OIA views effectiveness as the extent to which a sanctions program is achieving the overall broader policy goals of the sanctions program, such as ultimately altering or deterring specific behaviors of the target or furthering U.S. national security priorities [Emphasis added].\nThe latter considerations come into play during National Security Council-led interagency discussions: The process “allows the U.S. government to draw upon multiple agencies’ inputs and perspectives, and to consider these issues in the larger policy context, because sanctions are often only one element of broader government-wide strategies to achieve U.S. policy goals.”\nEven within government, assessing the effectiveness of sanctions at achieving broader policy goals like deterrence is difficult. GAO’s report highlights that policymakers have difficulty isolating sanctions’ effects from those of other policy tools, dealing with shifting policy objectives, and identifying useful data for conducting assessments.\nThe threat of sanctions raises an additional challenge for evaluating effectiveness. In at least one notable instance pertaining to Chinese cyber-enabled economic espionage, U.S. threats to impose sanctions may have contributed to the signing of a diplomatic agreement between then-\n Ibid., 13-14.\n Ibid., 12.\n Ibid.\n Ibid., 12.\n Ibid., 17-18.\n See, for example, Daniel Drezner’s work on selection bias in evaluations of sanctions programs, which suggests that sanctions are more effective than most analyses contend because they miss instances in which sanctions are threatened but not imposed: “in focusing only on those instances when sanctions have been imposed, policy analysts have overlooked the significant number of instances in which the threat of coercion did not have to be carried out.” Daniel Drezner, “The Hidden Hand of Economic Coercion,” International Organization 57, no. 3 (June 2003): 654-655, https://doi.org/10.1017/S0020818303573052.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\npresident Obama and President Xi. Reporting at the end of August 2015 suggested that the Obama administration was preparing a sanctions package against Chinese targets under the framework. Just weeks later, in September of that year, Obama and Xi met in Washington to announce a moratorium on the cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property for commercial advantage. In remarks on the deal, Obama alluded to the leverage created by the sanctions E.O. in stating, “I did indicate to President Xi that we will apply those and whatever other tools we have in our toolkit to go after cyber criminals, either retrospectively or prospectively.” And in the words of then-Assistant Attorney General John Carlin, “That changed China.” According to a report from the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, the number of detected Chinese cyberattacks diminished following the bilateral agreement. But the evidence of the deal’s success was not conclusive., One report from threat intelligence company FireEye highlighted that the number of attacks began dropping at least a year before the agreement. This case illustrates further the difficulty of isolating sanctions’ effects and evaluating the counterfactual of how adversaries might behave if not for the threat of sanctions.\nThe academic literature on the success of targeted financial sanctions is neither entirely optimistic nor conclusive. One estimate of UN targeted sanctions’ success rate suggests that targeted sanctions are effective just 22 percent of the time.

After surveying sanctions experts, they report, “A remarkable 27 out of 30 survey respondents – 90 percent – agreed with the contention that sanctions against state actors like Iran were more effective than sanctions against non-state actors like al Qaeda.”^[79]^ A recent review of the academic literature highlights the impact of sanctions on non-state actors as a gap in existing scholarship^[80]^—a fact particularly challenging for policymakers evaluating sanctions’ effectiveness against non-state and proxy cyber threats. Perhaps the most damning factor concerning the inconclusiveness of the academic literature is that even amongst academics “what counts as ‘effective’ (or ‘successful’) itself has been a contentious issue.”^[81]^\n## Factors for consideration\nStill, in trying to assess the effectiveness of cyber sanctions, policymakers should look at three key factors:\n(1) A target’s vulnerability to economic pressure,\n(2) The motivations underpinning offensive activity, and\n(3) How chosen targets support malicious activity.\n## Vulnerability to economic pressure\nDespite the lack of consensus regarding sanctions’ aims, those who have surveyed the academic literature note that a target’s vulnerability to economic pressure is critical for sanctions’ effectiveness. As one group of researchers put it, “the data suggest that the types of financial sanctions that have been deployed against states in the last two decades should have a greater\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nimpact on the decisionmaking [sic] of states for which attractiveness to international trade and investment is strategically significant.” In the cyber domain, this means that policymakers should pay attention to specific nation-state cyber threats that may be vulnerable to economic pressure. A sanction against an Iranian or North Korean government entity, for example, is unlikely to disrupt capabilities in the same way that a designation of a Russian entity might. U.S. sanctions have isolated Iran and North Korea from the global financial system, so additional targeted sanctions may be unlikely to significantly affect the ability to carry out future attacks or enjoy their proceeds. Indeed, these two actors have made the financial system the target of cyberattacks. However, actors elsewhere may be more exposed to the influence of the U.S. dollar or the euro in global financial markets and, therefore, more likely to pay attention to the punitive consequences of a sanction or have their capabilities disrupted as a result. For example, Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, alleged that his net worth dropped by 80 percent—over $7 billion—as a result of U.S. sanctions related to “a range of malign activity around the globe,” including malicious cyber activity, imposed in 2018.\n## Actors’ motivations\nThe motives underpinning malicious cyber activity also affect an actor's vulnerability to sanctions. As mentioned above, Goldman and McCoy have argued that sanctions are an appropriate policy tool for dealing with financially motivated cyber threats—like cyber-enabled economic espionage—because they undermine the goal of the activity: profit. By preventing malicious actors from accessing and moving money, sanctions make it “more difficult for them\n Rosenberg, et al., “The New Tools of Economic Warfare,” 15.\n Ian Talley, “U.S. Moves to Further Isolate Iran From Global Financial System,” *Wall Street Journal*, October 25, 2019, https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-moves-to-further-isolate-iran-from-global-financial-system-11572025978; David Sanger and Michael Corkery, “Treasury Imposes Sanctions on North Korea, Cutting Access to Banks,” *New York Times*, June 1, 2016, https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/02/world/asia/treasury-imposes-sanctions-on-north-korea.html.\n “Treasury Targets Supporters of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Networks Responsible for Cyber-Attacks Against the United States,” U.S. Department of the Treasury; “Treasury Targets North Korea for Multiple Cyber-Attacks,” U.S. Department of the Treasury; “Treasury Sanctions North Korean State-Sponsored Malicious Cyber Groups,” U.S. Department of the Treasury.\n David Dawkins, “Russian Billionaire Oleg Deripaska Describes U.S. Money Laundering Accusations As ‘Mish-Mash Of Total Nonsense,’” *Forbes*, February 14, 2020, https://www.forbes.com/sites/daviddawkins/2020/02/14/report-russian-billionaire-oleg-deripaska-accused-by-us-agency-of-laundering-funds-for-vladimir-putin/#7b2a95c0c4bc; “Treasury Designates Russian Oligarchs, Officials, and Entities in Response to Worldwide Malign Activity,” U.S. Department of the Treasury, April 6, 2018, https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm0338.\n Goldman and McCoy, “Deterring Financially Motivated Cybercrime,” 602.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nto use the proceeds of their crimes.” Sanctions may fail to dissuade financially motivated actors from engaging in wrongful behavior if the profitability of the action outweighs the financial costs of sanctions. Still, the profit motive may make these actors more sensitive to sanctions than a politically motivated actor would be. Russian actors engaged in hack and leak operations or attacks on international organizations are not as likely to be dissuaded from engaging in their activity because sanctions have made it unprofitable if profitability was not necessarily a preeminent goal.\n## Means of supporting wrongful activity\nThe specific choice of target and whose behavioral change is the goal of sanctions are also likely to bear on how policymakers should evaluate effectiveness. Once policymakers have identified malicious activity, they can choose to go after several different targets, including the state actors that directed, orchestrated, or enabled the attack; the individuals directly engaged in the attack; or those that provide material, financial, or technological support for the attack. Again, these actors are not equally vulnerable to the effects of sanctions. Government officials that enjoy the backing and protection of the state may be less likely to be deterred than those whose legitimate commercial interests are at stake by aiding targets in circumventing sanctions. As one group of researchers at the Center for a New American Security put it, “To the extent that sanctions on non-state actors are focused on coercing a change in behavior, that strategy may have the greatest impact on the ecosystem of actual and would-be supporters of those groups, rather than on the groups themselves.” Simultaneously, sanctions can go after a specific target to change a third party’s behavior—returning to the Deripaska example described above, sanctioning Russian oligarchs was partly meant to signal to the Russian state that its conduct was unacceptable and leverage elite pain for behavioral change.\n## Effectiveness as opposed to what?\nEvaluating the impacts of sanctions cannot ignore the alternative instruments available to states\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n John Carlin, “Detect, Disrupt, Deter: A Whole-of-Government Approach to National Security Cyber Threats,” *Harvard National Security Journal* 7, (2016): 420, https://harvardnsj.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2016/06/Carlin-FINAL.pdf.\n The impact of sanctions on an adversary’s risk calculus could potentially backfire if financially motivated actors are deterred from engaging in the lowest levels of criminal activity, which may generate profits incommensurate with the absorbed risk, but continue to engage in highly profitable but extremely destabilizing attacks.\n Rosenberg, et al., “The New Tools of Economic Warfare,” 28.\n “Treasury Designates Russian Oligarchs, Officials, and Entities in Response to Worldwide Malign Activity,” U.S. Department of the Treasury.\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nseeking to respond to wrongful behavior in cyberspace. This paper situates sanctions within the DIME(LE) framework to highlight the point that policymakers face the choice not of sanctioning or doing nothing but of sanctioning or releasing a diplomatic statement or responding with a retaliatory cyberattack or of doing nothing or of doing several of these. In the U.S. context, in particular, policymakers have adopted a “whole-of-government” approach to countering malicious cyber activity—in essence, one that involves all of the tools of statecraft outlined in the DIME(LE)., As a result, sanctions have frequently followed criminal charges against malicious cyber actors. Sixteen of the thirty-five instances in which the United States imposed cyber sanctions were preceded by an indictment of at least one of the sanctioned individuals—providing useful context for understanding the range of available tools for imposing costs on malicious cyber actors.\nWhere effectiveness is concerned, sanctions, in theory, may have more “teeth” than indictments because their enforcement does not rely on an actor setting foot in a country with which a state pursuing charges has an extradition treaty. As others have noted, the U.S. strategy of charging foreign-linked hackers is unlikely to result in many hackers ever appearing in U.S. courts. However, there have been some important exceptions. Three members of the FIN7 cybercrime group were arrested in Spain in 2018, two of which have been extradited, and in May 2020, authorities arrested another member of the organization in Seattle.\nJack Goldsmith and Robert Williams have questioned whether the public attribution of cyberattacks through criminal charges is counterproductive. They argue: “When the main public response to cybertheft that has reached crisis proportions is to identify the perpetrators but not\n David Baldwin, “The Sanctions Debate and the Logic of Choice,” *International Security* 24, no. 3 (Winter 1999/2000): 84.\n Though law enforcement action is included in this typology, others have noted that the decision to bring criminal charges is a thoroughly independent decision and that prosecutorial independence is part of what makes the tool effective. Indictments against foreign hackers are not themselves political tools, but the decision to unseal an indictment can be. See Garrett Hinck and Tim Maurer, “Persistent enforcement: Criminal Charges as a Response to Nation-State Malicious Cyber Activity,” *Journal of National Security Law and Policy* 10, no. 3 (2020): 535, https://jnslp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Criminal-Charges-as-a-Response-to-Nation-State-Malicious-Cyber-Activity.pdf.\n John Carlin, “Detect, Disrupt, Deter,” 394.\n Ibid., 527.\n Office of Public Affairs, “Three Members of Notorious International Cybercrime Group ‘Fin7’ In Custody for Role in Attacking Over 100 U.S. Companies,” U.S. Department of Justice, August 1, 2018, https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/three-members-notorious-international-cybercrime-group-fin7-custody-role-attacking-over-100; Jeff Stone, “Alleged FIN7 hacking director Andrii Kolpakov set to be extradited to the U.S.,” Cyberscoop, May 9, 2019, https://www.cyberscoop.com/fin7-andrii-kolpakov-extradition-spain/.\n Shannon Vavra, “Federal officials have arrested another accused FIN7 hacker,” Cyberscoop, May 26, 2020, https://www.cyberscoop.com/fin7-hacking-arrest-financial/.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\npunish them, the main signal to adversaries (especially third parties who are watching) is that the United States is extraordinarily defenseless.” Sanctions, by contrast, create real financial consequences for malicious actors by relying on the preeminence of the U.S. dollar and the euro in global financial transactions. Sanctions are enforced not by the U.S. government or EU alone but by financial institutions that risk exposing themselves to secondary sanctions. As a result, they may better demonstrate the costs of engaging in wrongful behavior and, therefore, deter adversaries.\nSanctions, however, face limitations. Sophisticated actors can identify ways to evade sanctions, sometimes through cyberattacks. Last fall, a United Nations panel of experts report detailed North Korea’s efforts to circumvent sanctions and raise money for its weapons of mass destruction program by attacking the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) and cryptocurrency exchanges, executing ransomware attacks, and mining cryptocurrency., The risk of evasion poses a threat to the efficacy of targeted financial sanctions as it “undermines the credibility of the senders, because the inability to implement and enforce the measures is often interpreted as signaling the lack of power of the sender.” And in the longer-term, actors may be compelled to seek alternate financial architectures to avoid the hassle of evading sanctions.\nThe broader point of comparing sanctions and indictments is that sanctions are just one of the tools that governments can employ against malicious cyber actors.

As early as 2013, Treasury had designated Liberty Reserve, a virtual currency provider, as a “financial institution of primary money laundering concern,” and in November 2018, the U.S. Department of the Treasury included in a designation the Bitcoin wallet addresses of two Iranian individuals.

In the U.S. context, the NSC-led interagency process provides a forum for discussing the effectiveness of sanctions relative to other policy instruments. But as with academic literature on the efficacy of sanctions on non-state actors, Dursun Peksen argues that scholarly work on the utility of sanctions relative to other policy instruments is similarly lacking.\nNonetheless, as policymakers impose sanctions, they must consider the potential escalatory consequences and how alternative policy instruments might compare. Rosenberg and Tama highlight the need to better assess where sanctions sit on the escalation ladder to strengthen their signaling value and ensure that efforts at cross-domain deterrence do not inadvertently compromise broader foreign policy objectives. As they put it, “if it is unclear whether an airstrike against a military facility is higher or lower on the escalation ladder than financial sanctions targeting a country’s most important economic sector, the target government may not understand the likely consequences of continuing to flout an international norm or U.S. demands.”\nCompared to actions like diplomatic statements, sanctions may be perceived as more escalatory since they aim to impose real financial costs and disrupt an operations’ financing. But in comparison to retaliatory cyberattacks or other military action, they may be less escalatory because their contours are narrowly defined, and policymakers can couple sanctions with clear statements of intention. The EU’s sanctions, which refrain from attributing responsibility for an attack to a specific state, may be less escalatory than those imposed by the United States, which, as described above, can and sometimes do allege state responsibility for wrongful behavior.\nIf adversaries see sanctions as escalatory, they may retaliate. Sanctions have generated such retaliation: Iran retaliated for U.S. sanctions with cyberattacks against the financial system. Russia responded to the passage of the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions\n Gianopolous, “Economic Sanctions,” 18.\n Peksen, “When Do Imposed Economic Sanctions Work?,” 8-9.\n Elizabeth Rosenberg and Jordan Tama, “Strengthening the Economic Arsenal,” Center for a New American Security, December 2019, 8-9, https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/strengthening-the-economic-arsenal.\n Ibid., 9.\n I thank Michael Daniel for highlighting this point.\n I thank Patryk Pawlak for highlighting this point.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nAct (CAATSA) with reductions in the number of diplomatic staff. (Perhaps somewhat counterproductively, Iran’s cyberattacks invited further sanctions.)\n## Long-term effectiveness\nThe point raised above about sanctions evasion speaks to a broader concern about how the effectiveness of sanctions might change over time, potentially providing either diminishing returns or jeopardizing the United States’ ability to pursue its policy goals. As Peter Feaver and Eric Lorber have put it, targeted financial sanctions rely on calculations about business risk, and “If global business conditions change, the firms might re-calculate that engaging in financial transactions with those targeted states outweighs the costs.” This risk of such re-calculation may be heightened if sanctions create incentives for businesses to pursue transactions in other currencies or for countries to develop alternative financial architectures.\nThese concerns—and consideration of cyber sanctions generally—cannot be divorced from the broader context in which the United States has aggressively pursued the use of sanctions to achieve a range of foreign policy goals, sometimes to the detriment of ally relationships. Two particular issues are worth highlighting: 1) the credibility of sanctions commitments and 2) the use of secondary sanctions.\nThe credibility of broader sanctions commitments matters for evaluating the effectiveness of cyber sanctions at deterrence. Elizabeth Rosenberg and Jordan Tama have noted that sanctions’ effectiveness depends on the credibility of both the threat to designate targets for wrongful behavior and the promise to lift sanctions if behavior changes. The United States’ withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) illustrates how failure to do the latter can undermine broader foreign policy goals. As Rosenberg and Tama write, “By walking away from\n Ellen Nakashima, “Iran blamed for cyberattacks on U.S. banks and companies,” *Washington Post*, September 21, 2012, https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/iran-blamed-for-cyberattacks/2012/09/21/afbe2be4-0412-11e2-9b24-ff730c7f6312_story.html; Neil MacFarquhar, “Putin, Responding to Sanctions, Orders U.S. to Cut Diplomatic Staff by 755,” *New York Times*, July 30, 2017, https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/30/world/europe/russia-sanctions-us-diplomats-expelled.html\n “Treasury Targets Supporters of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Networks Responsible for Cyber-Attacks Against the United States,” U.S. Department of the Treasury.\n Peter Feaver and Eric Lorber, “Coercive Diplomacy and the New Financial Levers: Evaluating the Intended and Unintended Consequences of Financial Sanctions,” *Legatum Institute*, November 2010, 44, https://lif.blob.core.windows.net/lif/docs/default-source/publications/2010-publications-coercive-diplomacy.pdf?Status=Temp&amp;sfvrsn=2.\n Ibid., 46-47.\n I thank Allison Peters and Ariel (Eli) Levite for highlighting these important points.\n Rosenberg and Tama, “Strengthening the Economic Arsenal,” 5.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nthose allies and partners, the United States has made them less inclined to privilege cooperation in the future.”\nIn the U.S. context, the two-pronged approach to creating new sanctions frameworks further complicates the delisting process. Legal authorities in the United States for imposing sanctions can be created through executive or legislative means. U.S. sanctions remain in place until a target appeals to OFAC and demonstrates a change in behavior that warrants delisting (and the burden is on designated individuals and entities to present a basis for delisting) or until Congress votes to lift the sanctions. Congressionally mandated sanctions provide an essential check on executive action to impose sanctions unilaterally. But if Congress refuses to lift sanctions in response to behavioral change, they undermine the tool’s credibility. (By contrast to U.S. sanctions, EU sanctions are reviewed annually. In some ways, this may enhance the instrument’s credibility.)\nEfforts to understand the effectiveness of the United States’ cyber sanctions must also contend with the legislative authorities that provide for secondary sanctions. Secondary sanctions refer to “the threat of US sanctions against foreign individuals and entities for engaging in specified activities that may not have a US nexus.” In the context of cyber sanctions, these include provisions enshrined within CAATSA for imposing sanctions against individuals and entities that engage in “significant transactions” with certain Russian government entities and their personnel. Secondary sanctions are different from provisions that allow governments to target those that provide “technical, financial, or material support” to previously designated actors. As others have pointed out, both the U.S. and EU authorities accept that sanctions are more effective when targeting an adversary’s network.

Because of U.S. withdrawal from the JCPOA, some EU members have signed on to the Instrument in Support of Trade Exchanges (INSTEX), a special purpose vehicle that “circumvents the traditional financial networks the US uses to establish its jurisdiction for enforcing sanctions,” to conduct business with Iranian entities.\nParticularly as European entities become subject to secondary U.S. sanctions and must find alternative payment systems, other countries face incentives to create alternative global financial architectures that erode the United States’ long-term power in the global economic system. Countries like Russia, China, and even India, are interested in an alternative financial messaging system to SWIFT, but these have yet to catch on and face important limitations.\nSome have pointed out that “Multinational businesses seeking to avoid exposure to U.S. and EU sanctions can find refuge in the yuan and Chinese financial platforms.” China’s “efforts to promote the yuan as a global currency and establish alternatives to the dollar- and euro-dominated international financial system” may heighten the associated risks. Many are quick to point out that China faces several obstacles to achieving such a goal. Still, as former senior Treasury adviser Elizabeth Rosenberg points out, “sanctions do give China’s economic ambitions an undeniable boost.” Especially as financial technologies—like cryptocurrencies—introduce new ways for criminals to launder money, the continued use of sanctions may\n “Russia sanctions: EU vows to retaliate over US measures,” BBC, July 26, 2017, https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40727044; Paul Ivan, “The US and the EU need a stronger dialogue on Russia,” European Policy Centre, May 2, 2018, https://www.epc.eu/en/Publications/The-US-and-the-EU-need-a-stronger-dialogue-on-Russia-sanctions~1e70f8; Karen DeYoung, “Three European allies ask U.S. not to enforce secondary sanctions over Iran trade,” Washington Post, June 6, 2018, https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/three-european-allies-ask-us-not-to-enforce-secondary-sanctions-over-iran-trade/2018/06/06/f4c94594-69c3-11e8-bea7-c8eb28bc52b1_story.html.\n Ellie Geranmayeh and Manuel Lafont Rapnouil, “Meeting the Challenge of Secondary Sanctions,” European Council on Foreign Relations, June 2019, 4, 7, https://www.ecfr.eu/publications/summary/meeting_the_challenge_of_secondary_sanctions.\n Drezner, “Targeted Sanctions in a World of Global Finance,” 760-761.\n Jignesh Davda, “China, Russia &amp; India Push Forward on SWIFT Alternative,” Yahoo!

The potential backlash to Washington’s gung-ho attitude toward financial sanctions may occur on a longer time horizon but carries arguably more significant consequence for U.S. global power.\nThe potential consequences mean that policymakers evaluating the effectiveness of cyber sanctions at deterring wrongful behavior must also consider the long-term trajectory of the tool’s use and how decisions within the broader foreign policy context affect the reception of sanctions.\n## Moving beyond deterrence\nA general emphasis on deterrence obscures the variety of different functions that sanctions can perform and the diversity of motives underpinning malicious cyber activity. Few, if any, policymakers would argue that the outright cessation of malicious cyber activity is a realistic goal that could be achieved by targeted financial sanctions. Given that some, like North Korea, pursue cybercrime as a means of sanctions evasion, one might even argue that sanctions are counterproductive if the goal is understood to stop malicious cyber activity.^[130]^ As described above, the academic and policy literature on the effectiveness of cyber sanctions at deterrence is difficult to measure. So why do policymakers continue to employ sanctions in the seeming absence of compelling evidence about their effectiveness?\nThe academic literature on targeted sanctions has attempted to account for some of the different aims of sanctions and the diverse threats they can target by introducing three potential purposes—constraint, coercion, and signaling.^[131]^ Even these, however, ignore the nuanced and specific purposes for imposing sanctions in response to malicious cyber activity. To say that a sanctions designation aims to “signal,” for example, ignores important features of the message itself, its intended audience, and its contribution to the broader goal of sending a message by sanctioning.\nOthers divide the purposes of sanctions into “symbolic” or “expressive” and “instrumental” ones.^[132]^ Symbolic or expressive purposes relate to the political interests served by doing something in response to wrongful behavior—i.e., signaling. Instrumental objectives relate to desired policy or behavior changes—i.e., coercion and constraint.\n^[130]^ Elizabeth Rosenberg and Neil Bhatiya, “Busting North Korea’s Sanctions Evasion,” Center for a New American Security, March 4, 2020, https://www.cnas.org/publications/commentary/busting-north-koreas-sanctions-evasion.\n^[131]^ Giumelli, *How EU sanctions work*, 18-19.\n^[132]^ Taehee Whang, “Playing to the Home Crowd?

Ascertaining responsibility is a complicated matter. The degree to which a state might be responsible for malicious activity varies from an inability to prevent malicious attacks to active participation in an attack.\nSanctions designations are public listings that name individuals or entities in response to malicious behavior. As Kristen Eichensehr has argued, they can attribute wrongful conduct by naming the individual or entity that directly perpetrated a cyberattack or indicating state responsibility for an attack.\nThis is not always the case. Because targets can be sanctioned for materially, financially, or technologically enabling a previously designated actor, they do not always publicize attribution in the sense of identifying hackers. And because ascertaining the nature of the relationship between a state and a hacker can be difficult, not all sanctions allege that a state enabled or orchestrated wrongful behavior in cyberspace.\nBut in some cases, sanctions do serve to implicate a state in malicious cyber activity. For example, in September 2019, the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) named Lazarus\n Hinck and Maurer, “Persistent enforcement,” 531-534.\n Herb Lin, “Attribution of Malicious Cyber Incidents,” Aegis Paper Series No. 1607, Hoover Institution, n.d., 5, https://www.hoover.org/sites/default/files/research/docs/lin_webready.pdf.\n Herb Lin draws on Jason Healey’s piece, “Beyond Attribution: Seeking National Responsibility for Cyber Attacks,” in outlining the different degrees of responsibility; Ibid., 18.

Within the EU, attribution is a “sovereign political decision” left up to each member state’s discretion. As a result, EU sanctions designations avoid making a specific link between a designated individual or entity and a state sponsor, even when, as in the case of the July 2020 Russian targets, some of the listed individuals may work on behalf of government agencies or may be government agencies themselves., Though attribution is also a sovereign political decision in the United States, the process is more straightforward—there is no need to wrangle the agreement of twenty-seven member states to attribute.\nIndependent of the political reasons for (not) attributing a cyberattack, not all jurisdictions are equally competent in their ability to attribute. States differ in their ability to identify technical and political indicators of compromise and use signals, human, and open-source intelligence to understand them. As one RAND Corporation report put it, “These capabilities may not be widespread globally, and very few countries are thought to possess sophisticated all-source capabilities.”\n## Information-sharing\nThe press releases that accompany sanctions designations sometimes contain important information about how malicious actors carry out their attacks. Though formal information-sharing mechanisms exist in both the United States and the European Union, many involve a\n “Treasury Sanctions North Korean State-Sponsored Malicious Cyber Groups,” U.S. Department of the Treasury.\n Botek, “European Union establishes a sanction regime for cyber-attacks.”\n Council Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/1125 of July 30, 2020, O.J. (246) 4.\n Researchers at the European Union Institute for Security Studies describe the threshold for placing responsibility for a cyber operation on a state as defined by two criteria: “the cyber operation is attributed to that state and constitutes an internationally wrongful act. To be attributable to that state, the operation must have been carried out by one of its organs or by another actor acting on its behalf. A cyber operation attributable to a state may constitute an internationally wrongful act if it violates a norm of international law.” See Patryk Pawlak, Thomas Biersteker, and François Delerue, *Guardian of the galaxy: EU cyber sanctions and norms in cyberspace*, eds.

In the United States, for example, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) Exchange is a Treasury-led “voluntary public-private information sharing partnership among law enforcement, financial institutions, and FinCEN aimed at effectively and efficiently combating money laundering, terrorism financing, organized crime, and other financial crimes; protecting the financial system from illicit use; and promoting national security.” Additionally, the Bank Secrecy Act Advisory Group (BSAAG) is “the means by which Treasury receives advice on the operations of the Bank Secrecy Act,” a key piece of U.S. law regarding money laundering. Made of up representatives from federal agencies, financial institutions, and trade groups, BSAAG is chaired by the FinCEN director. Though these mechanisms are essential means of sharing information, the participating institutions and representatives are limited.\nHowever, public press releases can garner the attention of a broader set of stakeholders with sanctions compliance obligations and can aid in disseminating information related to cyber threats. For example, the United States’ designation of Nigerian cybercriminals contained details of how Richard Uzuh and his co-conspirators spoofed emails from business executives to trick Americans into wiring money.\n## Audience satisfaction\nSanctions may satisfy the political pressure to “do something” in response to malicious cyber activity. As Richard Hanania has argued, sanctions have a significant political purpose insofar as they “appear to be a moderate and measured response to unacceptable behavior abroad.” And they are a safe option for policymakers because the targets—foreign publics—cannot easily influence American politics (i.e., vote), and, therefore, “there is little reason to suspect that their\n Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, “FinCEN Exchange Questions and Answers,” U.S. Department of the Treasury, https://www.fincen.gov/index.php/resources/fincen-exchange/fincen-exchange-frequently-asked-questions.\n U.S. Department of the Treasury, Notice, “Financial Crimes Enforcement Network; Bank Secrecy Act Advisory Group; Solicitation of Application for Membership,” *Federal Register* 83, no. 248 (December 28, 2018): 67487, https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2018-12-28/pdf/2018-28178.pdf.\n Ibid.\n “Treasury Sanctions Nigerian Cyber Actors for Targeting U.S. Businesses and Individuals,” U.S. Department of the Treasury.\n William Kaempfer and Anton Lowenberg, “The Political Economy of Economic Sanctions,” in *Handbook of Defense Economics, Volume 2*, ed.

From the perspective of companies, it may help redirect blame from the company for failing to prevent a cyberattack.\nSanctions may also satisfy international audiences that want to see governments respond to malicious cyber activity. In some cases, sanctions are met with laudatory statements from allied governments. For example, the United States released such a message when the European Union imposed cyber sanctions for the first time in July 2020.\n## Cooperation with allies\nGiven that both the United States and European Union have legal frameworks to impose sanctions against malicious cyber actors, there is a potential cooperative dimension to the policy. Some have suggested that sanctions work better when there are concerted efforts among states to restrict an actor’s capabilities and deny its action’s benefits because it limits the actor’s ability to mitigate losses in other markets. Even without cooperative effort, sanctions can signal to members of the international community a shared commitment to reducing malicious activity. Where the cyber context is concerned, European action can have a particularly important signaling function given, as a former State Department official put it, the fact that actors like Russia and China are increasingly writing off signaling from the United States.\nThe U.S. and EU legal authorities are mostly similar, heightening the potential cooperative dimension. At their cores, both offer the ability to impose sanctions on individuals and entities that disrupt the confidentiality, availability, or integrity of data or the functioning of computer systems that support critical infrastructure or governmental services. And so far, U.S. and EU\n Ibid.\n Hinck and Maurer, “Persistent enforcement,” 531.\n Ibid.\n Michael Pompeo, “The United States Applauds the EU’s Action on Cyber Sanctions,” U.S. Department of State, Press release, July 30, 2020, https://www.state.gov/the-united-states-applauds-the-eus-action-on-cyber-sanctions/.\n Dursun Peksen, “When Do Economic Sanctions Work Best?” Center for a New American Security, June 10, 2019, https://www.cnas.org/publications/commentary/when-do-economic-sanctions-work-best.\n I thank a former U.S. Department of State official for making this observation.\n\ndesignations have largely overlapped: the United States has previously sanctioned six of the nine targets from the EU’s initial July 2020 listing.\n## Norm development\nBy clearly delineating unacceptable harms and imposing costs against those who perpetrate them, sanctions can underscore the importance of internationally recognized norms. Imposing sanctions in concert with like-minded nations further strengthens the norm development function. Having multiple states commit to punishing a malicious actor reinforces the wrongfulness of the act in question and helps establish what constitutes an appropriate state response to such wrongful behavior.\nIn his statement following the EU’s first cyber sanctions, High Representative Josep Borrell explicitly referenced commitment to implementing the norms developed by the UN Group of Government Experts’ (UNGGE) 2010, 2013, and 2015 reports and to continued cooperation the ongoing UNGGE and Open-Ended Working Group.\n## Punishment of malicious actors\nBy blocking transactions and freezing malicious cyber actors’ assets, policymakers demonstrate that engaging in offensive behavior has real financial consequences. Because many cyberattacks are financially motivated, sanctions deny the benefits of an actor’s behavior by making it more difficult to access and move money.\nGoldman has argued that targeted financial sanctions play a vital role in the broader effort to deter financially motivated cybercrime—especially cyber-enabled economic espionage—by “drying up the market for stolen data.” Since the United States’ sanctions framework allows for the designation of not just those who steal intellectual property but also those who benefit\n “Treasury Targets Russian Operatives over Election Interference, World Anti-Doping Agency Hacking, and Other Malign Activities,” U.S. Department of the Treasury; U.S. President, “Taking Additional Steps to Address the National Emergency With Respect to Significant Malicious Cyber-Enabled Activities,” 3; “Treasury Targets North Korea for Multiple Cyber-Attacks,” U.S. Department of the Treasury; Council Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/1125 of July 30, 2020, O.J.

By freezing assets and blocking transactions, sanctions can disrupt the financing of an offensive cyber operation. In theory, they can also disrupt a state’s ability to recruit the talent necessary to carry out a sophisticated operation—the exposure of a hacker’s identity and the financial punishment may dissuade would-be hackers from serving as a proxy.\nSanctions against terrorist financiers are an important precedent in this respect. In 2001, then-president George W. Bush signed Executive Order 13224 to allow for the imposition of sanctions against those determined “To assist in, sponsor, or provide financial, material, or technological support for, or financial or other services in support of, acts of terrorism.” According to Juan Zarate, a former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes, the use of sanctions against terrorist organizations led to the development of additional horizontal sanctions programs to deal with behavior-based national security threats—like cyber threats. The logic of going after financing networks and enablers is simple: As Zachary Goldman has put it, “Entities like drug trafficking networks, terrorist groups, and proliferation facilitators require substantial streams of funding and access to the global financial system, to remain effective. The more time and resources they spend trying to fund an organization, the less time spent planning attacks or engaging in other illicit activity.”\n## Deterrence\nThrough the previously listed means, sanctions may aspire to a deterrent function that seeks to change state actors’ long-term behavior in cyberspace. The repeated imposition of sanctions may introduce sustained friction in the relationship between the proxy and the state that changes the state’s overall calculus about how and when to engage in malicious cyber activity. Over time, this may lead to a change in the nature of the state’s relationship with its proxies and the degree of risk it is willing to accept when engaging in offensive cyber operations. By punishing\n U.S. President, “Blocking the Property of Certain Persons Engaging in Significant Malicious Cyber-Enabled Activities,” 18077.\n Bureau of Counterterrorism, “Executive Order 13224,” U.S. Department of State, https://www.state.gov/executive-order-13224/.\n I thank former Assistant Secretary Zarate for highlighting this historical context.\n Zachary Goldman, “Cybersecurity and a New Era of Asymmetric Economic Warfare.”\n\ncountries that engage in offensive activity and demonstrating the international community’s support for this behavior, states can aim to increase the effort, raise the risk, and reduce offensive cyber actors’ rewards.\nDespite the difficulty, even for policymakers, of evaluating sanctions’ success at deterrence, they remain a tool often used for responding to malicious activity. Therefore, our understanding of the impact of sanctions must go beyond the deterrent function and consider the additional symbolic purposes outlined above and the factors that might also impact how symbolic goals are achieved. Table 2 summarizes questions policymakers might consider in evaluating the effectiveness of sanctions at achieving the variety of purposes set forward in this section and the considerations for assessing deterrence outlined in the previous section.\nTable 2. Questions for evaluating effectiveness\n|  Function | Questions  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  Attribution | • Do the statements accompanying a sanctions designation claim that the named entities perpetrated a cyberattack itself?\n• Do the statements accompanying a sanctions designation allege state responsibility for wrongful behavior in cyberspace?\n• Have other policies or legal action (i.e., indictments) made similar attribution claims?  |\n|  Information-sharing | • Do private sector entities pay attention to sanctions notices more than other vehicles for information-sharing about cyber threats?\n• Do the statements accompanying a sanctions designation contain meaningful information about the tactics, techniques, and procedures employed by malicious actors that external stakeholders could use to fortify their networks?  |\n|  Audience satisfaction | • Do actors in the private sector or civil society find sanctions a meaningful and appropriate response to malicious activity?\n• Do allies release diplomatic statements affirming the appropriateness of the action?  |\n|  Cooperation with allies | • Do (or could) other jurisdictions impose sanctions against the same targets?\n• Do other countries release diplomatic statements affirming the appropriateness of the action?  |\n|  Norm development | • Does the offense that prompted sanction violate an established norm of responsible behavior in cyberspace?  |\n Joseph Nye, Jr., “Deterrence and Dissuasion in Cyberspace,” *International Security* 41, no. 3 (Winter 2016/17): 56, https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/ISEC_a_00266.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\n- Have other countries or jurisdictions signaled that sanctions are the appropriate response to this type of norm violation?\n## Punishment\n- How exposed is the individual or entity to the U.S. dollar or the euro’s impact in global financial markets?\n- What is the monetary value of the transactions blocked or assets frozen as a result of the sanction?\n- Do opportunities exist for a designated actor to protect their assets or recoup their losses?\n## Disruption of capabilities\n- Do sanctions disrupt an actor’s ability to procure material, financial, or technological resources necessary to carry out malicious activity?\n- How do sanctions affect the willingness of proxies to engage with state sponsors of malicious cyber activity?\n- Do opportunities exist for actors to circumvent sanctions or mitigate their impact by using alternative financial architectures?\n## Deterrence\n- Over time, does the nature of a particular actor’s behavior in cyberspace change?\n- Do sanctions change the risk-calculus of those engaged in malicious cyber activity?\n- Over time, does the nature of malicious cyber activity in general change?\n## General\n- How might adversaries respond or retaliate to sanctions?

Not all of the potential purposes of cyber sanctions writ large will be served by a single designation, nor should they be. Policymakers’ goals differ with respect to the variety of cyber threats. The aim of preventing low-level cybercrime like business email compromise scams is different from seeking to encourage states to rein in their proxies when conducting offensive cyber operations.\nNo matter which goals policymakers have in mind with a sanctions designation, they should keep in mind the considerations outlined above pertaining to alternative policy instruments and long-term consequences. Take, for example, the goal of audience satisfaction and the pressure to “do something” in response to malicious cyber activity: Escalation can undermine audience\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nsatisfaction if a greater number of private sector entities become the victims of cyberattacks in response to sanctions. And the repeated imposition of sanctions may have diminishing returns as far as satisfying audiences—if policymakers describe sanctions in deterrence terms, domestic audiences may be satisfied initially, but the continuation of activity may be interpreted as a sign of failure and lend itself to disappointment.\nThis section has outlined seven purposes in addition to deterrence that policymakers may have in mind when employing sanctions against malicious cyber actors. It is difficult to say whether sanctions deter. But despite the emphasis on deterrence in policy statements, sanctions can have important symbolic purposes that should factor into evaluations of sanctions programs.\n# Conclusion\nThe definitional issues highlighted at the beginning of this paper related to what constitutes malicious cyber activity and should be included within this paper’s scope and the variety of aims of sanctions can raise a question about whether it makes sense to speak of a country or jurisdiction’s “cyber policy” or consider cyber issues a facet of a broader foreign policy. Future research in this area should address how policy should deal with the distinction between “cyber” as a threat itself and as a means for accomplishing other ends like intelligence collection, economic competition, or control over domestic political spaces. The United States’ use, in particular, of a variety of different legal instruments—not just the cyber-specific sanctions framework—highlights the fact that cybercrime and national security threats require a variety of flexible tools. More clearly delineating how and why cyber activity crosses a line of acceptability is crucial to promoting responsible behavior in cyberspace and identifying appropriate mechanisms for responding to harms.\nMore empirical research is also needed in this area. Much of the academic literature on sanctions focuses on those levied against states and deals insufficiently with the success of sanctions against nonstate and proxy actors. $^{166}$ As transnational threats multiply and policymakers reach for sanctions in response, they should have a clear evidence base supporting their decision making.\nThough policymakers often emphasize the goal of deterrence, articulation of the considerations for evaluating the effectiveness of sanctions is scant, even among government actors with access to the full array of intelligence necessary to make such evaluations. Policymakers should consider a target’s vulnerability to economic pressure, actors’ motivations, and the role that\n$^{166}$ Peksen, “When Do Imposed Economic Sanctions Work?,” 7-8.\n\ntargets play in wrongful behavior in seeking to evaluate the likely outcomes of a sanctions designation and its effectiveness. Furthermore, questions of effectiveness also require attention to alternative policy options and long-term consequences.\nMoving beyond deterrence and cost imposition, the diversity of actors against which policymakers impose sanctions requires more nuanced thinking. In the absence of clear frameworks for evaluating effectiveness and relative pessimism about sanctions’ effectiveness, policymakers continue to reach for the tool. Therefore, our understanding of the purposes of sanctions should account for functions like attribution, information-sharing, audience satisfaction, cooperation with allies, norm development, and punishment.\nDespite being hailed as ineffective by academic scholars, policymakers continue to employ sanctions. Data collected by the Center for a New American Security shows that the current U.S. administration is more than willing to sanction adversaries. Even though 2019 saw the fewest designations during the current administration, the yearly total was still more than those of any single year under the previous administration. And the EU’s recent implementation of its cyber sanctions framework for the first time indicates that neither is the policy tool falling out of favor abroad.\n Johnpatrick Imperiale, “Sanctions by the Numbers,” Center for a New American Security, February 27, 2020, https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/sanctions-by-the-numbers.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816",

This draft paper provides an overview of the legal frameworks for sanctioning malicious cyber actors and the set of relevant sanctions imposed to date. Despite an emphasis on the goal of deterrence, both policymakers and academics have difficulty determining whether sanctions deter malicious cyber activity. Considering the continued use of cyber sanctions, this paper highlights key considerations for policymakers to evaluate whether sanctions can deter wrongful behavior in cyberspace.\nKeywords: sanctions, economic statecraft, cyber, deterrence, descriptive studies, policy evaluation\n*Research Assistant, Cyber Policy Initiative, Technology and International Affairs Program, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Washington, DC, USA\nContact: thompsonr.natalie@gmail.com\nSpecial thanks go to my colleagues—especially Tim Maurer, George Perkovich, Jon Bateman, Ariel Levite, and Arthur Nelson—for supporting this research.

    "# Introduction": "Cyberattacks targeting public and private entities have increased dramatically over the last decade.¹ Cyberspace is also increasingly a domain of geopolitical conflict. State (and non-state) actors are acquiring offensive cyber capabilities and have demonstrated a willingness to use them—states have conducted at least 358 hostile cyber operations² since 2005, more than half of which have occurred since 2017.³\nThe increasing number of attacks puts pressure on governments to counter malicious cyber activity and to promote norms of responsible behavior in cyberspace. States have relied on a mix of diplomatic, informational, economic, and law enforcement options to respond to malicious cyber activity. Some refer to these tools as the DIME(LE) set of instruments available to states seeking to influence others’ behavior.⁴,⁵\nSanctions are part of a state’s arsenal. Both the United States and the European Union have created specific authorities for targeted financial sanctions in response to malicious cyber activity⁶—referred to throughout this paper as “cyber sanctions.”⁷ The United States has imposed\n¹ The Center for Strategic and International Studies maintains a list of significant cyberattacks that have occurred since 2006, and the Council on Foreign Relations maintains an interactive tracker of offensive cyber operations perpetrated by states. See: “Significant Cyber Incidents,” Center for Strategic and International Studies, last updated April 2020, https://www.csis.org/programs/technology-policy-program/significant-cyber-incidents; “Cyber Operations Tracker,” Council on Foreign Relations, https://www.cfr.org/interactive/cyber-operations.\n² The Council on Foreign Relations uses the term “operations” to refer to 1) denial of service; 2) espionage; 3) data destruction; 4) defacement; 5) sabotage; 6) doxing; and 7) financial theft. See “Cyber Operations Tracker,” Council on Foreign Relations.\n³ Patryk Pawlak, Eneken Tikk, and Mika Kerttunen, “Cyber Conflict Uncoded,” European Union Institute for Security Studies, April 2020, https://www.iss.europa.eu/sites/default/files/EUISSFiles/Brief%207_Cyber.pdf.\n⁴ The DIME(LE) model is one method of categorizing these tools. A variety of others are used within the United States military to categorize and describe the operational environment; these include: 1) diplomatic, informational, military, and economic (DIME); 2) diplomatic, informational, military, economic, financial, intelligence, law enforcement (DIMEFIL); and 3) political, military, economic, social, informational, infrastructure (PMESII), among others. See Jack D. Kem, “Understanding the Operational Environment: The Expansion of DIME,” *Military Intelligence Professional Bulletin* 33, no. 2 (April – June 2007): 49-53, https://fas.org/irp/agency/army/mipb/2007_02.pdf.\n⁵ Tim Maurer, *Cyber Mercenaries: The State, Hackers, and Power* (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2018), 139.\n⁶ U.S. Department of State, “Cyber Sanctions,” n.d., https://www.state.gov/cyber-sanctions/, accessed January 20, 2020; Council of the EU, “Cyber-attacks: Council is now able to impose sanctions,” Press release, May 17, 2019, https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2019/05/17/cyber-attacks-council-is-now-able-to-impose-sanctions/.\n⁷ This use of the term “cyber sanctions” is distinct from that of those who use it to refer to from the use of cyberattacks as a coercive method employed to “sanction” the wrongful behavior of adversaries or to achieve coercive economic ends. For a discussion on this topic, see: Marco Benatar and Kristof Gombeer, “Cyber Sanctions: Exploring a Blind Spot in the Current Legal Debate,” European Society of International Law Conference Paper\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nsanctions in response to malicious cyber activity thirty-five times over the past decade, and the European Union and the United Kingdom imposed similar sanctions for the first time in July 2020⁸ and again in October 2020.⁹\nScholars have long debated the effectiveness of sanctions generally and their ability to achieve policy aims.¹⁰ To evaluate the efficacy of cyber sanctions, one must first articulate the goals of sanctions and what they might be useful for achieving. Once policymakers answer questions of effectiveness, they can then craft their use of sanctions to best address relevant threats in cyberspace.\nThe diversity of malicious behavior in cyberspace makes it difficult to identify a coherent logic for using sanctions. States conduct offensive cyber operations in service of political goals while criminals engage in hacking for profit—sometimes, the two occur alongside one another.¹¹ The use of proxies in cyberspace complicates efforts to distinguish politically motivated and financially motivated attacks and obscures the relationship between state and non-state actors.¹²\nFurther compounding the problem are questions related to the harms that should be included in the definition of “malicious cyber activity.” Narrow definitions of “cyberattack” use the term to\nSeries, Conference Paper No. 9/2011, May 1, 2011, https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1989786 and Zachary Goldman, “Cybersecurity and a New Era of Asymmetric Economic Warfare,” Just Security, January 16, 2015, https://www.justsecurity.org/19150/cybersecurity-era-asymmetric-economic-warfare/.\n⁸ Council Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/1125 of July 30, 2020, implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/796 concerning restrictive measures against cyber-attacks threatening the Union or its Member States, 2020 O.J.

As a policy matter, the United States has used its cyber sanctions framework to punish behavior like election interference.¹⁴ Both the European Union and the United States have used human rights-related programs to respond to cyber-enabled human rights violations.¹⁵ As a result, this paper looks beyond sanctions frameworks meant explicitly to deal with malicious cyber activity and includes instances when additional horizontal frameworks have been used to respond to wrongful uses of information and communications technologies.\nThis paper seeks to provide an overview of targeted financial sanctions for countering malicious cyber activity in the United States and Europe and considerations regarding the tool’s effectiveness. Although policymakers often highlight deterrence and cost imposition as critical goals, both academic literature and policy documents point to difficulty measuring sanctions’ success at achieving these aims.\nThe continued reliance on the tool suggests that policymakers have other motivations for responding to malicious cyber activity with sanctions, regardless of whether sanctions are effective or whether their effectiveness can be measured.

Part outlines the definitional issues related to the scope of “malicious cyber activity” and what, therefore, constitutes a “cyber sanction.” It then provides an overview of the designations to date in the United States and Europe. Part two discusses how policymakers and academics evaluate sanctions’ effectiveness at achieving often-touted deterrence goals and specific considerations related to policy alternatives and long-term consequences. Policymakers cannot ignore the alternative instruments available to respond to malicious cyber activity in thinking about effectiveness and must weigh the trade-offs associated with alternative responses to cyberattacks. Finally, policymakers cannot ignore how firms and other states respond to and perceive the credibility of U.S. sanctions in the long-run—both as it relates to their imposition and removal (or lack thereof). They must consider the corresponding implications for the architecture of the global financial system and United States’ ability to weaponize its financial position. Part three then offers a categorization of the different purposes that sanctions can serve beyond deterrence. These purposes include attribution, information-sharing, audience satisfaction, cooperation with allies, norm development, punishment, and disruption of capabilities—all of which contribute cumulatively to the overarching goal of deterrence.",
    "## Defining “cyber sanctions”": "### What do sanctions entail?\nThe United States and EU’s cyber sanctions are targeted sanctions that differ from sanctions imposed during and before the 1990s. Comprehensive trade sanctions were a popular instrument of economic coercion throughout the 20th century, in part because they are less costly, less risky, and more palatable than military action. Targeted sanctions differ from comprehensive ones in coercive logic, the intended target, and the ultimate goal. Though similarly aimed at eliciting a change in state behavior, they focus on specific individuals and entities rather than the population at large.¹⁶ They assume that singling out individuals or groups will better “raise the target regime’s costs of noncompliance.”¹⁷ Targeted sanctions can also aim to change the\n¹⁶ Arne Tostensen and Beate Bull, “Are Smart Sanctions Feasible?” World Politics 53, no. 3 (April 2002): 380, 382.\n¹⁷ Daniel Drezner, “How Smart Are Smart Sanctions?” International Studies Review 5, no. 1 (March 2003): 107; see also Tostensen and Bull, “Are Smart Sanctions Feasible?” 380, 386; Thomas G.

Targeted sanctions are understood to have additional value for constraining and signaling. By “constraining,” these scholars refer to complicating an actor’s ability to engage in internationally wrongful behavior.²⁰ By “signaling,” they refer to sending a message to the target, domestic audiences, and international audiences that expresses support for norms of appropriate behavior.²¹\nOne type of targeted sanction, restrictive financial measures (also referred to as targeted financial sanctions), is increasingly the tool of choice for policymakers seeking to impose consequences for internationally wrongful behavior. Targeted financial sanctions include asset freezes, blocking transactions with designated individuals or entities, and denying access to capital markets.²² The tool relies on the preeminence of certain currencies and jurisdictions in global financial transactions.²³ Big financial players like the United States, Europe, and, to a lesser extent, China can weaponize the financial system to prevent specific individuals or organizations from transacting in their respective currencies.

    "## Definitional issues": "The first issue to address in defining “cyber sanctions” is related to what constitutes “malicious cyber activity” and which sanctions should, therefore, be considered within this paper’s scope.\nIn April 2015, then-U.S. president Barack Obama created the first targeted financial sanctions framework meant to deal specifically with cyber-related harms;²⁵ the Europeans followed suit in 2019;²⁶ and the United Kingdom finalized their cyber sanctions regulation earlier this year.²⁷ The United States, EU, and UK authorities relate principally to compromises in data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.²⁸\nThese cyber-specific frameworks, however, do not tell the whole story. As early as 2011, the European Union sanctioned individuals and entities engaged in the surveillance and abuse of Iranian journalists and activists.²⁹ Some of the same violators later came under additional U.S.\n²⁴ Rachel Loeffler, “Bank Shots,” Foreign Affairs, March 1, 2009, https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/northkorea/2009-03-01/bank-shots; Rosenberg, et al., “The New Tools of Economic Warfare,” 5; Juan Zarate, “Harnessing the Financial Furies: Smart Financial Power and National Security,” The Washington Quarterly 32, no. 4 (October 2009): 43; Elizabeth Rosenberg, “Testimony before the United States House of Representatives Committee on Financial Services, Subcommittee on National Security, International Development and Monetary Policy: ‘Assessing the Use of Sanctions in Addressing National Security and Foreign Policy Challenges,’” Center for a New American Security, May 15, 2019, https://www.cnas.org/publications/congressional-testimony/elizabeth-rosenberg-before-the-house-financial-services-committee.\n²⁵ U.S. President, Executive Order, “Blocking the Property of Certain Persons Engaging in Significant Malicious Cyber-Enabled Activities, Executive Order 13694 of April 1, 2015,” Federal Register 80, no. 63 (April 2, 2015).\n²⁶ Council Regulation 2019/796 of May 17, 2019, concerning restrictive measures against cyber-attacks threatening the Union or its Member States, 2019 O.J.

They do not fit neatly into the definition of cyberattack promulgated by the U.S. National Institute of Technology and Standards: “An attack, via cyberspace, targeting an enterprise’s use of cyberspace for the purpose of disrupting, disabling, destroying, or maliciously controlling a computing environment/infrastructure; or destroying the integrity of the data or stealing controlled information.”³² For example, monitoring dissidents or using social media to promote narratives online does not necessarily compromise data confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Still, the United States and Europe have considered them harmful enough uses of information and communications technologies to warrant punishment. For this reason, sanctions falling under the cyber-specific framework, as well as others related to cyber-enabled influence operations and human rights violations, are included within the scope of this paper.",
    "## “Cyber sanctions” to date": "With these definitional concerns in mind, this section provides a brief overview of the cyber sanctions imposed to date in both the United States and Europe.\nExecutive Order 13694, which created the United States’ cyber-specific sanctions framework, “declare[d] a national emergency with respect to the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States posed by the increasing prevalence and severity of malicious cyber-enabled activities originating from or directed by, persons located, in whole or in substantial part, outside the United States.”³³\nSo far, the United States has imposed thirty-five tranches of sanctions related to malicious cyber activity under both the cyber-specific framework and other country-specific and horizontal\n³⁰ For example, the EU sanctioned Abdolsamad Khoramabadi, head of the Committee to Determine Instances of Criminal Content, in March 2013, and the United States later imposed sanctions in May 2018.

These designations involve entities linked to Iran, North Korea, Russia, China, and Nigeria. The earliest designations, dating back to 2012 (made under an Executive Order on terrorism-related sanctions), dealt with Iranian government officials and entities participating in computer hacking projects with Hezbollah.³⁴ Since then, the United States has sanctioned a range of cybercriminals and nation-state hackers. These include North Korean actors that participated in the 2014 hack of Sony Pictures, Russian actors engaged in cyber-enabled election interference, and Iranian actors targeting U.S. financial institutions.³⁵ Since 2012, the United States has sanctioned over 250 individuals and entities for engaging in or enabling malicious cyber activity. (For a complete list of incidents, see Table 1.) The majority have been of Iranian, Russian, or North Korean origin. In the first half of 2020, however, the United States took action against two Chinese nationals for aiding Lazarus Group’s efforts to launder money, as well as six Nigerian individuals engaged in business email compromise and romance fraud scams.³⁶\nIn statements on the Executive Order, policymakers highlighted the “significant increase in the frequency, scale, and sophistication of cyber incidents targeting the American people” to justify its signing.³⁷ Absent in many of these statements are clear articulations of how the administration would evaluate these sanctions’ effectiveness. In a blog post following the signing of the April 2015 Executive Order, White House counterterrorism advisor Lisa Monica explained that policymakers hoped to “deter” and “impose costs” on adversaries.³⁸ But the specific means by which the U.S. Department of the Treasury would evaluate the program’s effectiveness remain unclear.

However, it would be misleading to not include these, and they represent an interesting examples of instances in which sanctioners can target key economic elites in order to elicit a change in state behavior.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\n|  10/22/2020 | EU | 13694), Ukraine (E.O. 13661)\nCouncil Regulation (EU) 2019/796 | 2 individuals, 1 entity | Russia | No  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  10/22/2020 | U.S. | Election interference (E.O. 13848) | 5 entities | Iran | No  |\n|  10/23/2020 | U.S. | CAATSA | 1 entity | Russia | No  |",
    "## Do cyber sanctions deter?": "As described above, policymakers in both the United States and European Union emphasize that cyber sanctions aim to deter malicious actors and behavior. As Zachary Goldman and Damon McCoy have pointed out, “different kinds of malicious cyber activity demand different, tailored, deterrence strategies. This is because each category of cyber threat has a different motivation, and therefore will be sensitive to a different type of cost.”51 Nation-state hackers with political goals are unlikely to suffer the same consequences of a sanctions designation that independent cybercriminals with financial motivations will suffer. Similarly, designating a government official orchestrating an attack is unlikely to have the same impact as designating an individual two or three steps removed that launders money on behalf of a hacking group.\nTwo things complicate the effort to neatly distinguish between categories like cybercrime and nation-state activity and state and non-state actors. First, the convergence of financially-motivated cybercrime and nation-state activity makes it difficult to separate cyberattacks conducted for purely economic gain and those undertaken for political purposes.52 North Korean efforts to raise funds for its weapons of mass destruction program through cyber theft and ransom operations against financial institutions and cryptocurrency exchanges have demonstrated the difficulty of separating financial motivations from political goals.53 Similarly, state-sponsored economic espionage emanating from China blurs the distinction between financial and political aims as the theft of intellectual property aims to “support its strategic development goals—science and technology advancement, military modernization, and economic policy objectives.”54\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nSecond, the use of proxies for conducting offensive cyber operations often precludes a neat division between state and non-state actors in cyberspace. Tim Maurer’s comprehensive overview of the use of proxies for accomplishing offensive cyber operations details the spectrum of relationships between states and their proxies.⁵⁵ These relationships range from overt delegation of activity to loose orchestration to passive enablement of proxy behavior. In the latter cases, those operating at a state’s behest may also have a foot in the criminal world. For example, in 2019, Treasury alleged that a Russian cybercriminal indicted and sanctioned for developing and distributing malware also operated on behalf of the Russian government, “highlighting the Russian government’s enlistment of cybercriminals for its own malicious purposes.”⁵⁶",
    "## Evaluating effectiveness": "It is not within the remit of external observers to assess whether cyber sanctions effectively achieve deterrence. Much of the information needed to make such an assessment is classified or privately owned intelligence. Though Treasury publicly reports the value of transactions blocked under specific sanctions programs, others have pointed out that evaluating the success of cyber sanctions based on the financial value of prevented transactions is misleading.⁵⁷ Therefore, it is difficult for policymakers to attribute any observed decrease in malicious cyber activity or change in activity to sanctions or determine whether activity levels would be even greater absent the threat of sanctions or imposition.\nWithin the U.S. government, Treasury’s Office of Intelligence and Analysis (OIA) and the State Department’s Bureau of Intelligence and Research perform impact assessments.⁵⁸ According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), which published a review of U.S. sanctions programs and their effectiveness in 2019, “These assessments analyze the impacts of specific sanctions on a particular aspect of the sanction’s target—for example, the sanctions’ impact on the target country’s economy or trade.”⁵⁹ OIA, for example, conducts impact assessments before a sanctions designation and after its imposition and may include factors like the target’s U.S.-\n⁵⁵ Maurer, *Cyber Mercenaries*, 42-49.\n⁵⁶ “Treasury Sanctions Evil Corp, the Russia-Based Cybercriminal Group Behind Dridex Malware,” U.S. Department of the Treasury, December 5, 2019, https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm845,\n⁵⁷ Annie Fixler and Eric Lorber, “Counting Pennies Underestimates the Value of Treasury’s Cyber Sanctions,” Foundation for Defense of Democracies, November 4, 2019, https://www.fdd.org/analysis/2019/11/04/counting-pennies-underestimates-the-value-of-treasurys-cyber-sanctions/.\n⁵⁸ Kimberly Gianopoulos, “Economic Sanctions: Agencies Assess Impacts on Targets, and Studies Suggest Several Factors Contribute to Sanctions’ Effectiveness,” U.S. Government Accountability Office, October 2019, 12, https://www.gao.gov/assets/710/701891.pdf.\n⁵⁹ Ibid.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nbased assets, global holdings, and interactions with the United States and the potential cascading consequences of a sanctions designation.⁶⁰\nHowever, the report acknowledges that “these assessments do not analyze sanctions’ overall effectiveness in achieving broader U.S. policy goals or objectives, such as whether the sanctions are advancing the national security and policy priorities of the United States” (emphasis added).⁶¹ OIA distinguishes between impact and effect in its assessments:\nAccording to OIA officials, assessing impact is analyzing the potential or observed effect of the sanction on the target. According to officials, impact can be focused on a singular target or could be broader, such as the impact on the target country’s economy or trade flows. In contrast, OIA views effectiveness as the extent to which a sanctions program is achieving the overall broader policy goals of the sanctions program, such as ultimately altering or deterring specific behaviors of the target or furthering U.S. national security priorities [Emphasis added].⁶²\nThe latter considerations come into play during National Security Council-led interagency discussions: The process “allows the U.S. government to draw upon multiple agencies’ inputs and perspectives, and to consider these issues in the larger policy context, because sanctions are often only one element of broader government-wide strategies to achieve U.S. policy goals.”⁶³\nEven within government, assessing the effectiveness of sanctions at achieving broader policy goals like deterrence is difficult. GAO’s report highlights that policymakers have difficulty isolating sanctions’ effects from those of other policy tools, dealing with shifting policy objectives, and identifying useful data for conducting assessments.⁶⁴\nThe threat of sanctions raises an additional challenge for evaluating effectiveness.⁶⁵ In at least one notable instance pertaining to Chinese cyber-enabled economic espionage, U.S. threats to impose sanctions may have contributed to the signing of a diplomatic agreement between then-\n⁶⁰ Ibid., 13-14.\n⁶¹ Ibid., 12.\n⁶² Ibid.\n⁶³ Ibid., 12.\n⁶⁴ Ibid., 17-18.\n⁶⁵ See, for example, Daniel Drezner’s work on selection bias in evaluations of sanctions programs, which suggests that sanctions are more effective than most analyses contend because they miss instances in which sanctions are threatened but not imposed: “in focusing only on those instances when sanctions have been imposed, policy analysts have overlooked the significant number of instances in which the threat of coercion did not have to be carried out.” Daniel Drezner, “The Hidden Hand of Economic Coercion,” International Organization 57, no. 3 (June 2003): 654-655, https://doi.org/10.1017/S0020818303573052.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\npresident Obama and President Xi. Reporting at the end of August 2015 suggested that the Obama administration was preparing a sanctions package against Chinese targets under the framework.⁶⁶ Just weeks later, in September of that year, Obama and Xi met in Washington to announce a moratorium on the cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property for commercial advantage.⁶⁷ In remarks on the deal, Obama alluded to the leverage created by the sanctions E.O. in stating, “I did indicate to President Xi that we will apply those and whatever other tools we have in our toolkit to go after cyber criminals, either retrospectively or prospectively.”⁶⁸ And in the words of then-Assistant Attorney General John Carlin, “That changed China.”⁶⁹ According to a report from the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, the number of detected Chinese cyberattacks diminished following the bilateral agreement.⁷⁰ But the evidence of the deal’s success was not conclusive.⁷¹,⁷² One report from threat intelligence company FireEye highlighted that the number of attacks began dropping at least a year before the agreement.⁷³ This case illustrates further the difficulty of isolating sanctions’ effects and evaluating the counterfactual of how adversaries might behave if not for the threat of sanctions.\nThe academic literature on the success of targeted financial sanctions is neither entirely optimistic nor conclusive.⁷⁴ One estimate of UN targeted sanctions’ success rate suggests that targeted sanctions are effective just 22 percent of the time.⁷⁵ Breaking that figure down by\n⁶⁶ Ellen Nakashima, “U.S. developing sanctions against China over cyberthefts,” *Washington Post*, August 30, 2015, https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/administration-developing-sanctions-against-china-over-cyberespionage/2015/08/30/9b2910aa-480b-11e5-8ab4-c73967a143d3_story.html?utm_term=.2ed69dd30154.\n⁶⁷ Office of the Press Secretary, “Remarks by President Obama and President Xi of the People’s Republic of China in Joint Press Conference,” White House, September 25, 2015, https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2015/09/25/remarks-president-obama-and-president-xi-peoples-republic-china-joint.\n⁶⁸ Ibid.\n⁶⁹ John Carlin, in “American Cybersecurity Experts: ‘No Trespassing,’” Aspen Strategy Forum, August 22, 2016, at 10:41, https://www.aspeninstitute.org/blog-posts/no-trespassing-experts-american-cybersecurity/.\n⁷⁰ National Counterintelligence and Security Center, “Foreign Economic Espionage in Cyberspace,” 7.\n⁷¹ Ben Buchanan and Robert D.

After surveying sanctions experts, they report, “A remarkable 27 out of 30 survey respondents – 90 percent – agreed with the contention that sanctions against state actors like Iran were more effective than sanctions against non-state actors like al Qaeda.”^^ A recent review of the academic literature highlights the impact of sanctions on non-state actors as a gap in existing scholarship^^—a fact particularly challenging for policymakers evaluating sanctions’ effectiveness against non-state and proxy cyber threats. Perhaps the most damning factor concerning the inconclusiveness of the academic literature is that even amongst academics “what counts as ‘effective’ (or ‘successful’) itself has been a contentious issue.”^^",
    "## Factors for consideration": "Still, in trying to assess the effectiveness of cyber sanctions, policymakers should look at three key factors:\n(1) A target’s vulnerability to economic pressure,\n(2) The motivations underpinning offensive activity, and\n(3) How chosen targets support malicious activity.",
    "## Vulnerability to economic pressure": "Despite the lack of consensus regarding sanctions’ aims, those who have surveyed the academic literature note that a target’s vulnerability to economic pressure is critical for sanctions’ effectiveness. As one group of researchers put it, “the data suggest that the types of financial sanctions that have been deployed against states in the last two decades should have a greater\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nimpact on the decisionmaking [sic] of states for which attractiveness to international trade and investment is strategically significant.”⁸² In the cyber domain, this means that policymakers should pay attention to specific nation-state cyber threats that may be vulnerable to economic pressure. A sanction against an Iranian or North Korean government entity, for example, is unlikely to disrupt capabilities in the same way that a designation of a Russian entity might. U.S. sanctions have isolated Iran and North Korea from the global financial system,⁸³ so additional targeted sanctions may be unlikely to significantly affect the ability to carry out future attacks or enjoy their proceeds. Indeed, these two actors have made the financial system the target of cyberattacks.⁸⁴ However, actors elsewhere may be more exposed to the influence of the U.S. dollar or the euro in global financial markets and, therefore, more likely to pay attention to the punitive consequences of a sanction or have their capabilities disrupted as a result. For example, Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, alleged that his net worth dropped by 80 percent—over $7 billion—as a result of U.S. sanctions related to “a range of malign activity around the globe,” including malicious cyber activity, imposed in 2018.⁸⁵",
    "## Actors’ motivations": "The motives underpinning malicious cyber activity also affect an actor's vulnerability to sanctions. As mentioned above, Goldman and McCoy have argued that sanctions are an appropriate policy tool for dealing with financially motivated cyber threats—like cyber-enabled economic espionage—because they undermine the goal of the activity: profit.⁸⁶ By preventing malicious actors from accessing and moving money, sanctions make it “more difficult for them\n⁸² Rosenberg, et al., “The New Tools of Economic Warfare,” 15.\n⁸³ Ian Talley, “U.S. Moves to Further Isolate Iran From Global Financial System,” *Wall Street Journal*, October 25, 2019, https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-moves-to-further-isolate-iran-from-global-financial-system-11572025978; David Sanger and Michael Corkery, “Treasury Imposes Sanctions on North Korea, Cutting Access to Banks,” *New York Times*, June 1, 2016, https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/02/world/asia/treasury-imposes-sanctions-on-north-korea.html.\n⁸⁴ “Treasury Targets Supporters of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Networks Responsible for Cyber-Attacks Against the United States,” U.S. Department of the Treasury; “Treasury Targets North Korea for Multiple Cyber-Attacks,” U.S. Department of the Treasury; “Treasury Sanctions North Korean State-Sponsored Malicious Cyber Groups,” U.S. Department of the Treasury.\n⁸⁵ David Dawkins, “Russian Billionaire Oleg Deripaska Describes U.S. Money Laundering Accusations As ‘Mish-Mash Of Total Nonsense,’” *Forbes*, February 14, 2020, https://www.forbes.com/sites/daviddawkins/2020/02/14/report-russian-billionaire-oleg-deripaska-accused-by-us-agency-of-laundering-funds-for-vladimir-putin/#7b2a95c0c4bc; “Treasury Designates Russian Oligarchs, Officials, and Entities in Response to Worldwide Malign Activity,” U.S. Department of the Treasury, April 6, 2018, https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm0338.\n⁸⁶ Goldman and McCoy, “Deterring Financially Motivated Cybercrime,” 602.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nto use the proceeds of their crimes.”⁸⁷ Sanctions may fail to dissuade financially motivated actors from engaging in wrongful behavior if the profitability of the action outweighs the financial costs of sanctions. Still, the profit motive may make these actors more sensitive to sanctions than a politically motivated actor would be.⁸⁸ Russian actors engaged in hack and leak operations or attacks on international organizations are not as likely to be dissuaded from engaging in their activity because sanctions have made it unprofitable if profitability was not necessarily a preeminent goal.",
    "## Means of supporting wrongful activity": "The specific choice of target and whose behavioral change is the goal of sanctions are also likely to bear on how policymakers should evaluate effectiveness. Once policymakers have identified malicious activity, they can choose to go after several different targets, including the state actors that directed, orchestrated, or enabled the attack; the individuals directly engaged in the attack; or those that provide material, financial, or technological support for the attack. Again, these actors are not equally vulnerable to the effects of sanctions. Government officials that enjoy the backing and protection of the state may be less likely to be deterred than those whose legitimate commercial interests are at stake by aiding targets in circumventing sanctions. As one group of researchers at the Center for a New American Security put it, “To the extent that sanctions on non-state actors are focused on coercing a change in behavior, that strategy may have the greatest impact on the ecosystem of actual and would-be supporters of those groups, rather than on the groups themselves.”⁸⁹ Simultaneously, sanctions can go after a specific target to change a third party’s behavior—returning to the Deripaska example described above, sanctioning Russian oligarchs was partly meant to signal to the Russian state that its conduct was unacceptable and leverage elite pain for behavioral change.⁹⁰",
    "## Effectiveness as opposed to what?": "Evaluating the impacts of sanctions cannot ignore the alternative instruments available to states\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n⁸⁷ John Carlin, “Detect, Disrupt, Deter: A Whole-of-Government Approach to National Security Cyber Threats,” *Harvard National Security Journal* 7, (2016): 420, https://harvardnsj.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2016/06/Carlin-FINAL.pdf.\n⁸⁸ The impact of sanctions on an adversary’s risk calculus could potentially backfire if financially motivated actors are deterred from engaging in the lowest levels of criminal activity, which may generate profits incommensurate with the absorbed risk, but continue to engage in highly profitable but extremely destabilizing attacks.\n⁸⁹ Rosenberg, et al., “The New Tools of Economic Warfare,” 28.\n⁹⁰ “Treasury Designates Russian Oligarchs, Officials, and Entities in Response to Worldwide Malign Activity,” U.S. Department of the Treasury.\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nseeking to respond to wrongful behavior in cyberspace.⁹¹ This paper situates sanctions within the DIME(LE) framework to highlight the point that policymakers face the choice not of sanctioning or doing nothing but of sanctioning or releasing a diplomatic statement or responding with a retaliatory cyberattack or of doing nothing or of doing several of these. In the U.S. context, in particular, policymakers have adopted a “whole-of-government” approach to countering malicious cyber activity—in essence, one that involves all of the tools of statecraft outlined in the DIME(LE).⁹²,⁹³ As a result, sanctions have frequently followed criminal charges against malicious cyber actors. Sixteen of the thirty-five instances in which the United States imposed cyber sanctions were preceded by an indictment of at least one of the sanctioned individuals—providing useful context for understanding the range of available tools for imposing costs on malicious cyber actors.\nWhere effectiveness is concerned, sanctions, in theory, may have more “teeth” than indictments because their enforcement does not rely on an actor setting foot in a country with which a state pursuing charges has an extradition treaty. As others have noted, the U.S. strategy of charging foreign-linked hackers is unlikely to result in many hackers ever appearing in U.S. courts.⁹⁴ However, there have been some important exceptions. Three members of the FIN7 cybercrime group were arrested in Spain in 2018, two of which have been extradited,⁹⁵ and in May 2020, authorities arrested another member of the organization in Seattle.⁹⁶\nJack Goldsmith and Robert Williams have questioned whether the public attribution of cyberattacks through criminal charges is counterproductive.

Indictments against foreign hackers are not themselves political tools, but the decision to unseal an indictment can be.

Sanctions are enforced not by the U.S. government or EU alone but by financial institutions that risk exposing themselves to secondary sanctions. As a result, they may better demonstrate the costs of engaging in wrongful behavior and, therefore, deter adversaries.\nSanctions, however, face limitations. Sophisticated actors can identify ways to evade sanctions, sometimes through cyberattacks.⁹⁸ Last fall, a United Nations panel of experts report detailed North Korea’s efforts to circumvent sanctions and raise money for its weapons of mass destruction program by attacking the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) and cryptocurrency exchanges, executing ransomware attacks, and mining cryptocurrency.⁹⁹,¹⁰⁰ The risk of evasion poses a threat to the efficacy of targeted financial sanctions as it “undermines the credibility of the senders, because the inability to implement and enforce the measures is often interpreted as signaling the lack of power of the sender.”¹⁰¹ And in the longer-term, actors may be compelled to seek alternate financial architectures to avoid the hassle of evading sanctions.\nThe broader point of comparing sanctions and indictments is that sanctions are just one of the tools that governments can employ against malicious cyber actors.

As early as 2013, Treasury had designated Liberty Reserve, a virtual currency provider, as a “financial institution of primary money laundering concern,” and in November 2018, the U.S. Department of the Treasury included in a designation the Bitcoin wallet addresses of two Iranian individuals. See “Treasury Identifies Virtual Currency Provider Liberty Reserve as a Financial Institution of Primary Money Laundering Concern under USA Patriot Act Section 311,” U.S. Department of the Treasury, May 28, 2013, https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl1956.aspx; “Treasury Designates Iran-Based Financial Facilitators of Malicious Cyber Activity and for the First Time Identifies Associated Digital Currency Addresses,” U.S. Department of the Treasury, November 28, 2018, https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm556.\n¹⁰¹ Francesco Giumelli, How EU sanctions work: A new narrative (Luxembourg: Publications Office of the European Union, 2013), 39, https://www.iss.europa.eu/sites/default/files/EUISSFiles/Chaillot_129.pdf. new narrative.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nof sanctions must take into account the alternatives. In the U.S. context, the NSC-led interagency process provides a forum for discussing the effectiveness of sanctions relative to other policy instruments.¹⁰² But as with academic literature on the efficacy of sanctions on non-state actors, Dursun Peksen argues that scholarly work on the utility of sanctions relative to other policy instruments is similarly lacking.¹⁰³\nNonetheless, as policymakers impose sanctions, they must consider the potential escalatory consequences and how alternative policy instruments might compare. Rosenberg and Tama highlight the need to better assess where sanctions sit on the escalation ladder to strengthen their signaling value and ensure that efforts at cross-domain deterrence do not inadvertently compromise broader foreign policy objectives.¹⁰⁴ As they put it, “if it is unclear whether an airstrike against a military facility is higher or lower on the escalation ladder than financial sanctions targeting a country’s most important economic sector, the target government may not understand the likely consequences of continuing to flout an international norm or U.S. demands.”¹⁰⁵\nCompared to actions like diplomatic statements, sanctions may be perceived as more escalatory since they aim to impose real financial costs and disrupt an operations’ financing. But in comparison to retaliatory cyberattacks or other military action, they may be less escalatory because their contours are narrowly defined, and policymakers can couple sanctions with clear statements of intention.¹⁰⁶ The EU’s sanctions, which refrain from attributing responsibility for an attack to a specific state, may be less escalatory than those imposed by the United States,¹⁰⁷ which, as described above, can and sometimes do allege state responsibility for wrongful behavior.\nIf adversaries see sanctions as escalatory, they may retaliate. Sanctions have generated such retaliation: Iran retaliated for U.S. sanctions with cyberattacks against the financial system.

    "## Long-term effectiveness": "The point raised above about sanctions evasion speaks to a broader concern about how the effectiveness of sanctions might change over time, potentially providing either diminishing returns or jeopardizing the United States’ ability to pursue its policy goals. As Peter Feaver and Eric Lorber have put it, targeted financial sanctions rely on calculations about business risk, and “If global business conditions change, the firms might re-calculate that engaging in financial transactions with those targeted states outweighs the costs.”¹¹⁰ This risk of such re-calculation may be heightened if sanctions create incentives for businesses to pursue transactions in other currencies or for countries to develop alternative financial architectures.¹¹¹\nThese concerns—and consideration of cyber sanctions generally—cannot be divorced from the broader context in which the United States has aggressively pursued the use of sanctions to achieve a range of foreign policy goals, sometimes to the detriment of ally relationships. Two particular issues are worth highlighting: 1) the credibility of sanctions commitments and 2) the use of secondary sanctions.¹¹²\nThe credibility of broader sanctions commitments matters for evaluating the effectiveness of cyber sanctions at deterrence. Elizabeth Rosenberg and Jordan Tama have noted that sanctions’ effectiveness depends on the credibility of both the threat to designate targets for wrongful behavior and the promise to lift sanctions if behavior changes.¹¹³ The United States’ withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) illustrates how failure to do the latter can undermine broader foreign policy goals. As Rosenberg and Tama write, “By walking away from\n¹⁰⁸ Ellen Nakashima, “Iran blamed for cyberattacks on U.S. banks and companies,” *Washington Post*, September 21, 2012, https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/iran-blamed-for-cyberattacks/2012/09/21/afbe2be4-0412-11e2-9b24-ff730c7f6312_story.html; Neil MacFarquhar, “Putin, Responding to Sanctions, Orders U.S. to Cut Diplomatic Staff by 755,” *New York Times*, July 30, 2017, https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/30/world/europe/russia-sanctions-us-diplomats-expelled.html\n¹⁰⁹ “Treasury Targets Supporters of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Networks Responsible for Cyber-Attacks Against the United States,” U.S. Department of the Treasury.\n¹¹⁰ Peter Feaver and Eric Lorber, “Coercive Diplomacy and the New Financial Levers: Evaluating the Intended and Unintended Consequences of Financial Sanctions,” *Legatum Institute*, November 2010, 44, https://lif.blob.core.windows.net/lif/docs/default-source/publications/2010-publications-coercive-diplomacy.pdf?Status=Temp&amp;sfvrsn=2.\n¹¹¹ Ibid., 46-47.\n¹¹² I thank Allison Peters and Ariel (Eli) Levite for highlighting these important points.\n¹¹³ Rosenberg and Tama, “Strengthening the Economic Arsenal,” 5.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nthose allies and partners, the United States has made them less inclined to privilege cooperation in the future.”¹¹⁴\nIn the U.S. context, the two-pronged approach to creating new sanctions frameworks further complicates the delisting process. Legal authorities in the United States for imposing sanctions can be created through executive or legislative means. U.S. sanctions remain in place until a target appeals to OFAC and demonstrates a change in behavior that warrants delisting (and the burden is on designated individuals and entities to present a basis for delisting) or until Congress votes to lift the sanctions.¹¹⁵ Congressionally mandated sanctions provide an essential check on executive action to impose sanctions unilaterally. But if Congress refuses to lift sanctions in response to behavioral change, they undermine the tool’s credibility. (By contrast to U.S. sanctions, EU sanctions are reviewed annually.¹¹⁶ In some ways, this may enhance the instrument’s credibility.)\nEfforts to understand the effectiveness of the United States’ cyber sanctions must also contend with the legislative authorities that provide for secondary sanctions. Secondary sanctions refer to “the threat of US sanctions against foreign individuals and entities for engaging in specified activities that may not have a US nexus.”¹¹⁷ In the context of cyber sanctions, these include provisions enshrined within CAATSA for imposing sanctions against individuals and entities that engage in “significant transactions” with certain Russian government entities¹¹⁸ and their personnel.¹¹⁹ Secondary sanctions are different from provisions that allow governments to target those that provide “technical, financial, or material support” to previously designated actors. As others have pointed out, both the U.S. and EU authorities accept that sanctions are more effective when targeting an adversary’s network.¹²⁰ Instead, secondary sanctions target those that continue to do business with a sanctioned entity, whether based in the United States or not.\n¹¹⁴ Ibid., 6.\n¹¹⁵ “Filing a Petition for Removal from an OFAC List,” U.S. Department of the Treasury, last updated May 2, 2017, https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/petitions.aspx.\n¹¹⁶ Council of the EU, “Adoption and review procedure for EU sanctions,” last reviewed February 14, 2019, https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/sanctions/adoption-review-procedure/.\n¹¹⁷ Samantha Sultoon and Justine Walker, “Secondary Sanctions’ Implications and the Transatlantic Relationship,” Atlantic Council, September 2019, 3, https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SecondarySanctions_Final.pdf.\n¹¹⁸ These include “the defense or intelligence sectors of the Government of the Russian Federation, including the Main Intelligence Agency of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation or the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation.” Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act of 2017, Public Law 115-44, U.S. Statutes at Large (2017), https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/hr3364_pl115-44.pdf.\n¹¹⁹ Ibid.\n¹²⁰ Sultoon and Walker, “Secondary Sanctions’ Implications and the Transatlantic Relationship,” 4.\n24\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nTo date, the United States has not imposed cyber-related secondary sanctions under CAATSA, but the legislation permitting secondary sanctions and their potential ramifications for EU projects has attracted criticism from the bloc.¹²¹ Because of U.S. withdrawal from the JCPOA, some EU members have signed on to the Instrument in Support of Trade Exchanges (INSTEX), a special purpose vehicle that “circumvents the traditional financial networks the US uses to establish its jurisdiction for enforcing sanctions,”¹²² to conduct business with Iranian entities.\nParticularly as European entities become subject to secondary U.S. sanctions and must find alternative payment systems, other countries face incentives to create alternative global financial architectures that erode the United States’ long-term power in the global economic system.¹²³ Countries like Russia, China, and even India, are interested in an alternative financial messaging system to SWIFT, but these have yet to catch on and face important limitations.¹²⁴\nSome have pointed out that “Multinational businesses seeking to avoid exposure to U.S. and EU sanctions can find refuge in the yuan and Chinese financial platforms.”¹²⁵ China’s “efforts to promote the yuan as a global currency and establish alternatives to the dollar- and euro-dominated international financial system”¹²⁶ may heighten the associated risks. Many are quick to point out that China faces several obstacles to achieving such a goal.¹²⁷ Still, as former senior Treasury adviser Elizabeth Rosenberg points out, “sanctions do give China’s economic ambitions an undeniable boost.”¹²⁸ Especially as financial technologies—like cryptocurrencies—introduce new ways for criminals to launder money,¹²⁹ the continued use of sanctions may\n¹²¹ “Russia sanctions: EU vows to retaliate over US measures,” BBC, July 26, 2017, https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40727044; Paul Ivan, “The US and the EU need a stronger dialogue on Russia,” European Policy Centre, May 2, 2018, https://www.epc.eu/en/Publications/The-US-and-the-EU-need-a-stronger-dialogue-on-Russia-sanctions~1e70f8; Karen DeYoung, “Three European allies ask U.S. not to enforce secondary sanctions over Iran trade,” Washington Post, June 6, 2018, https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/three-european-allies-ask-us-not-to-enforce-secondary-sanctions-over-iran-trade/2018/06/06/f4c94594-69c3-11e8-bea7-c8eb28bc52b1_story.html.\n¹²² Ellie Geranmayeh and Manuel Lafont Rapnouil, “Meeting the Challenge of Secondary Sanctions,” European Council on Foreign Relations, June 2019, 4, 7, https://www.ecfr.eu/publications/summary/meeting_the_challenge_of_secondary_sanctions.\n¹²³ Drezner, “Targeted Sanctions in a World of Global Finance,” 760-761.\n¹²⁴ Jignesh Davda, “China, Russia &amp; India Push Forward on SWIFT Alternative,” Yahoo!

The potential backlash to Washington’s gung-ho attitude toward financial sanctions may occur on a longer time horizon but carries arguably more significant consequence for U.S. global power.\nThe potential consequences mean that policymakers evaluating the effectiveness of cyber sanctions at deterring wrongful behavior must also consider the long-term trajectory of the tool’s use and how decisions within the broader foreign policy context affect the reception of sanctions.",
    "## Moving beyond deterrence": "A general emphasis on deterrence obscures the variety of different functions that sanctions can perform and the diversity of motives underpinning malicious cyber activity. Few, if any, policymakers would argue that the outright cessation of malicious cyber activity is a realistic goal that could be achieved by targeted financial sanctions. Given that some, like North Korea, pursue cybercrime as a means of sanctions evasion, one might even argue that sanctions are counterproductive if the goal is understood to stop malicious cyber activity.^^ As described above, the academic and policy literature on the effectiveness of cyber sanctions at deterrence is difficult to measure. So why do policymakers continue to employ sanctions in the seeming absence of compelling evidence about their effectiveness?\nThe academic literature on targeted sanctions has attempted to account for some of the different aims of sanctions and the diverse threats they can target by introducing three potential purposes—constraint, coercion, and signaling.^^ Even these, however, ignore the nuanced and specific purposes for imposing sanctions in response to malicious cyber activity. To say that a sanctions designation aims to “signal,” for example, ignores important features of the message itself, its intended audience, and its contribution to the broader goal of sending a message by sanctioning.\nOthers divide the purposes of sanctions into “symbolic” or “expressive” and “instrumental” ones.^^ Symbolic or expressive purposes relate to the political interests served by doing something in response to wrongful behavior—i.e., signaling. Instrumental objectives relate to desired policy or behavior changes—i.e., coercion and constraint.\n^^ Elizabeth Rosenberg and Neil Bhatiya, “Busting North Korea’s Sanctions Evasion,” Center for a New American Security, March 4, 2020, https://www.cnas.org/publications/commentary/busting-north-koreas-sanctions-evasion.\n^^ Giumelli, *How EU sanctions work*, 18-19.\n^^ Taehee Whang, “Playing to the Home Crowd?

    "## Attribution": "In the context of malicious cyber activity, “attribution” has multiple dimensions—it can relate to the machine used in an attack, the individual that perpetrated the attack, or the “ultimately responsible party” for the attack.¹³⁴ Ascertaining responsibility is a complicated matter. The degree to which a state might be responsible for malicious activity varies from an inability to prevent malicious attacks to active participation in an attack.¹³⁵\nSanctions designations are public listings that name individuals or entities in response to malicious behavior. As Kristen Eichensehr has argued, they can attribute wrongful conduct by naming the individual or entity that directly perpetrated a cyberattack or indicating state responsibility for an attack.¹³⁶\nThis is not always the case. Because targets can be sanctioned for materially, financially, or technologically enabling a previously designated actor, they do not always publicize attribution in the sense of identifying hackers. And because ascertaining the nature of the relationship between a state and a hacker can be difficult, not all sanctions allege that a state enabled or orchestrated wrongful behavior in cyberspace.\nBut in some cases, sanctions do serve to implicate a state in malicious cyber activity. For example, in September 2019, the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) named Lazarus\n¹³³ Hinck and Maurer, “Persistent enforcement,” 531-534.\n¹³⁴ Herb Lin, “Attribution of Malicious Cyber Incidents,” Aegis Paper Series No. 1607, Hoover Institution, n.d., 5, https://www.hoover.org/sites/default/files/research/docs/lin_webready.pdf.\n¹³⁵ Herb Lin draws on Jason Healey’s piece, “Beyond Attribution: Seeking National Responsibility for Cyber Attacks,” in outlining the different degrees of responsibility; Ibid., 18.

Within the EU, attribution is a “sovereign political decision” left up to each member state’s discretion.¹³⁸ As a result, EU sanctions designations avoid making a specific link between a designated individual or entity and a state sponsor, even when, as in the case of the July 2020 Russian targets, some of the listed individuals may work on behalf of government agencies or may be government agencies themselves.¹³⁹,¹⁴⁰ Though attribution is also a sovereign political decision in the United States, the process is more straightforward—there is no need to wrangle the agreement of twenty-seven member states to attribute.\nIndependent of the political reasons for (not) attributing a cyberattack, not all jurisdictions are equally competent in their ability to attribute. States differ in their ability to identify technical and political indicators of compromise and use signals, human, and open-source intelligence to understand them.¹⁴¹ As one RAND Corporation report put it, “These capabilities may not be widespread globally, and very few countries are thought to possess sophisticated all-source capabilities.”¹⁴²",
    "## Information-sharing¹⁴³": "The press releases that accompany sanctions designations sometimes contain important information about how malicious actors carry out their attacks. Though formal information-sharing mechanisms exist in both the United States and the European Union, many involve a\n¹³⁷ “Treasury Sanctions North Korean State-Sponsored Malicious Cyber Groups,” U.S. Department of the Treasury.\n¹³⁸ Botek, “European Union establishes a sanction regime for cyber-attacks.”\n¹³⁹ Council Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/1125 of July 30, 2020, O.J.

In the United States, for example, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) Exchange is a Treasury-led “voluntary public-private information sharing partnership among law enforcement, financial institutions, and FinCEN aimed at effectively and efficiently combating money laundering, terrorism financing, organized crime, and other financial crimes; protecting the financial system from illicit use; and promoting national security.”¹⁴⁴ Additionally, the Bank Secrecy Act Advisory Group (BSAAG) is “the means by which Treasury receives advice on the operations of the Bank Secrecy Act,” a key piece of U.S. law regarding money laundering.¹⁴⁵ Made of up representatives from federal agencies, financial institutions, and trade groups, BSAAG is chaired by the FinCEN director.¹⁴⁶ Though these mechanisms are essential means of sharing information, the participating institutions and representatives are limited.\nHowever, public press releases can garner the attention of a broader set of stakeholders with sanctions compliance obligations and can aid in disseminating information related to cyber threats. For example, the United States’ designation of Nigerian cybercriminals contained details of how Richard Uzuh and his co-conspirators spoofed emails from business executives to trick Americans into wiring money.¹⁴⁷",
    "## Audience satisfaction": "Sanctions may satisfy the political pressure to “do something” in response to malicious cyber activity.¹⁴⁸ As Richard Hanania has argued, sanctions have a significant political purpose insofar as they “appear to be a moderate and measured response to unacceptable behavior abroad.”¹⁴⁹ And they are a safe option for policymakers because the targets—foreign publics—cannot easily influence American politics (i.e., vote), and, therefore, “there is little reason to suspect that their\n¹⁴⁴ Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, “FinCEN Exchange Questions and Answers,” U.S. Department of the Treasury, https://www.fincen.gov/index.php/resources/fincen-exchange/fincen-exchange-frequently-asked-questions.\n¹⁴⁵ U.S. Department of the Treasury, Notice, “Financial Crimes Enforcement Network; Bank Secrecy Act Advisory Group; Solicitation of Application for Membership,” *Federal Register* 83, no. 248 (December 28, 2018): 67487, https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2018-12-28/pdf/2018-28178.pdf.\n¹⁴⁶ Ibid.\n¹⁴⁷ “Treasury Sanctions Nigerian Cyber Actors for Targeting U.S. Businesses and Individuals,” U.S. Department of the Treasury.\n¹⁴⁸ William Kaempfer and Anton Lowenberg, “The Political Economy of Economic Sanctions,” in *Handbook of Defense Economics, Volume 2*, ed.

In some cases, sanctions are met with laudatory statements from allied governments. For example, the United States released such a message when the European Union imposed cyber sanctions for the first time in July 2020.¹⁵³",
    "## Cooperation with allies": "Given that both the United States and European Union have legal frameworks to impose sanctions against malicious cyber actors, there is a potential cooperative dimension to the policy. Some have suggested that sanctions work better when there are concerted efforts among states to restrict an actor’s capabilities and deny its action’s benefits because it limits the actor’s ability to mitigate losses in other markets.¹⁵⁴ Even without cooperative effort, sanctions can signal to members of the international community a shared commitment to reducing malicious activity. Where the cyber context is concerned, European action can have a particularly important signaling function given, as a former State Department official put it, the fact that actors like Russia and China are increasingly writing off signaling from the United States.¹⁵⁵\nThe U.S. and EU legal authorities are mostly similar, heightening the potential cooperative dimension. At their cores, both offer the ability to impose sanctions on individuals and entities that disrupt the confidentiality, availability, or integrity of data or the functioning of computer systems that support critical infrastructure or governmental services.

    "## Norm development": "By clearly delineating unacceptable harms and imposing costs against those who perpetrate them, sanctions can underscore the importance of internationally recognized norms. Imposing sanctions in concert with like-minded nations further strengthens the norm development function. Having multiple states commit to punishing a malicious actor reinforces the wrongfulness of the act in question and helps establish what constitutes an appropriate state response to such wrongful behavior.¹⁵⁷\nIn his statement following the EU’s first cyber sanctions, High Representative Josep Borrell explicitly referenced commitment to implementing the norms developed by the UN Group of Government Experts’ (UNGGE) 2010, 2013, and 2015 reports and to continued cooperation the ongoing UNGGE and Open-Ended Working Group.¹⁵⁸",
    "## Punishment of malicious actors": "By blocking transactions and freezing malicious cyber actors’ assets, policymakers demonstrate that engaging in offensive behavior has real financial consequences. Because many cyberattacks are financially motivated, sanctions deny the benefits of an actor’s behavior by making it more difficult to access and move money.¹⁵⁹\nGoldman has argued that targeted financial sanctions play a vital role in the broader effort to deter financially motivated cybercrime—especially cyber-enabled economic espionage—by “drying up the market for stolen data.”¹⁶⁰ Since the United States’ sanctions framework allows for the designation of not just those who steal intellectual property but also those who benefit\n¹⁵⁶ “Treasury Targets Russian Operatives over Election Interference, World Anti-Doping Agency Hacking, and Other Malign Activities,” U.S. Department of the Treasury; U.S. President, “Taking Additional Steps to Address the National Emergency With Respect to Significant Malicious Cyber-Enabled Activities,” 3; “Treasury Targets North Korea for Multiple Cyber-Attacks,” U.S. Department of the Treasury; Council Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/1125 of July 30, 2020, O.J.

    "## Disruption of capabilities": "- Do sanctions disrupt an actor’s ability to procure material, financial, or technological resources necessary to carry out malicious activity?\n- How do sanctions affect the willingness of proxies to engage with state sponsors of malicious cyber activity?\n- Do opportunities exist for actors to circumvent sanctions or mitigate their impact by using alternative financial architectures?",
    "## Deterrence": "- Over time, does the nature of a particular actor’s behavior in cyberspace change?\n- Do sanctions change the risk-calculus of those engaged in malicious cyber activity?\n- Over time, does the nature of malicious cyber activity in general change?",
    "## Punishment": "- How exposed is the individual or entity to the U.S. dollar or the euro’s impact in global financial markets?\n- What is the monetary value of the transactions blocked or assets frozen as a result of the sanction?\n- Do opportunities exist for a designated actor to protect their assets or recoup their losses?",
    "## General": "- How might adversaries respond or retaliate to sanctions? What is the likelihood of the target engaging in retaliation, and what would the consequences of retaliation be?\n- Are the costs absorbed by the sender of sanctions proportionate to the costs imposed on targets?\n- What alternative policy options are available, and how do the effects of these tools compare to those of sanctions?\n- What might the long-term consequences be for the architecture of the global financial system?\nHaving discussed the eight purposes sanctions may seek to serve, the operational question remains whether policymakers clearly articulate these objectives and how they measure sanctions’ effectiveness at achieving any of these goals. Not all of the potential purposes of cyber sanctions writ large will be served by a single designation, nor should they be. Policymakers’ goals differ with respect to the variety of cyber threats. The aim of preventing low-level cybercrime like business email compromise scams is different from seeking to encourage states to rein in their proxies when conducting offensive cyber operations.\nNo matter which goals policymakers have in mind with a sanctions designation, they should keep in mind the considerations outlined above pertaining to alternative policy instruments and long-term consequences. Take, for example, the goal of audience satisfaction and the pressure to “do something” in response to malicious cyber activity: Escalation can undermine audience\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nsatisfaction if a greater number of private sector entities become the victims of cyberattacks in response to sanctions. And the repeated imposition of sanctions may have diminishing returns as far as satisfying audiences—if policymakers describe sanctions in deterrence terms, domestic audiences may be satisfied initially, but the continuation of activity may be interpreted as a sign of failure and lend itself to disappointment.\nThis section has outlined seven purposes in addition to deterrence that policymakers may have in mind when employing sanctions against malicious cyber actors. It is difficult to say whether sanctions deter. But despite the emphasis on deterrence in policy statements, sanctions can have important symbolic purposes that should factor into evaluations of sanctions programs.",
    "# Conclusion": "The definitional issues highlighted at the beginning of this paper related to what constitutes malicious cyber activity and should be included within this paper’s scope and the variety of aims of sanctions can raise a question about whether it makes sense to speak of a country or jurisdiction’s “cyber policy” or consider cyber issues a facet of a broader foreign policy. Future research in this area should address how policy should deal with the distinction between “cyber” as a threat itself and as a means for accomplishing other ends like intelligence collection, economic competition, or control over domestic political spaces. The United States’ use, in particular, of a variety of different legal instruments—not just the cyber-specific sanctions framework—highlights the fact that cybercrime and national security threats require a variety of flexible tools. More clearly delineating how and why cyber activity crosses a line of acceptability is crucial to promoting responsible behavior in cyberspace and identifying appropriate mechanisms for responding to harms.\nMore empirical research is also needed in this area. Much of the academic literature on sanctions focuses on those levied against states and deals insufficiently with the success of sanctions against nonstate and proxy actors. $^{166}$ As transnational threats multiply and policymakers reach for sanctions in response, they should have a clear evidence base supporting their decision making.\nThough policymakers often emphasize the goal of deterrence, articulation of the considerations for evaluating the effectiveness of sanctions is scant, even among government actors with access to the full array of intelligence necessary to make such evaluations. Policymakers should consider a target’s vulnerability to economic pressure, actors’ motivations, and the role that\n$^{166}$ Peksen, “When Do Imposed Economic Sanctions Work?,” 7-8.\n35\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\ntargets play in wrongful behavior in seeking to evaluate the likely outcomes of a sanctions designation and its effectiveness. Furthermore, questions of effectiveness also require attention to alternative policy options and long-term consequences.\nMoving beyond deterrence and cost imposition, the diversity of actors against which policymakers impose sanctions requires more nuanced thinking. In the absence of clear frameworks for evaluating effectiveness and relative pessimism about sanctions’ effectiveness, policymakers continue to reach for the tool. Therefore, our understanding of the purposes of sanctions should account for functions like attribution, information-sharing, audience satisfaction, cooperation with allies, norm development, and punishment.\nDespite being hailed as ineffective by academic scholars, policymakers continue to employ sanctions. Data collected by the Center for a New American Security shows that the current U.S. administration is more than willing to sanction adversaries. Even though 2019 saw the fewest designations during the current administration, the yearly total was still more than those of any single year under the previous administration.¹⁶⁷ And the EU’s recent implementation of its cyber sanctions framework for the first time indicates that neither is the policy tool falling out of favor abroad.\n¹⁶⁷ Johnpatrick Imperiale, “Sanctions by the Numbers,” Center for a New American Security, February 27, 2020, https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/sanctions-by-the-numbers.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816"

This draft paper provides an overview of the legal frameworks for sanctioning malicious cyber actors and the set of relevant sanctions imposed to date. Despite an emphasis on the goal of deterrence, both policymakers and academics have difficulty determining whether sanctions deter malicious cyber activity. Considering the continued use of cyber sanctions, this paper highlights key considerations for policymakers to evaluate whether sanctions can deter wrongful behavior in cyberspace.\nKeywords: sanctions, economic statecraft, cyber, deterrence, descriptive studies, policy evaluation\n*Research Assistant, Cyber Policy Initiative, Technology and International Affairs Program, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Washington, DC, USA\nContact: thompsonr.natalie@gmail.com\nSpecial thanks go to my colleagues—especially Tim Maurer, George Perkovich, Jon Bateman, Ariel Levite, and Arthur Nelson—for supporting this research.

Cyberspace is also increasingly a domain of geopolitical conflict. State (and non-state) actors are acquiring offensive cyber capabilities and have demonstrated a willingness to use them—states have conducted at least 358 hostile cyber operations since 2005, more than half of which have occurred since 2017.\nThe increasing number of attacks puts pressure on governments to counter malicious cyber activity and to promote norms of responsible behavior in cyberspace. States have relied on a mix of diplomatic, informational, economic, and law enforcement options to respond to malicious cyber activity. Some refer to these tools as the DIME(LE) set of instruments available to states seeking to influence others’ behavior.,\nSanctions are part of a state’s arsenal. Both the United States and the European Union have created specific authorities for targeted financial sanctions in response to malicious cyber activity—referred to throughout this paper as “cyber sanctions.” The United States has imposed\n The Center for Strategic and International Studies maintains a list of significant cyberattacks that have occurred since 2006, and the Council on Foreign Relations maintains an interactive tracker of offensive cyber operations perpetrated by states. See: “Significant Cyber Incidents,” Center for Strategic and International Studies, last updated April 2020, https://www.csis.org/programs/technology-policy-program/significant-cyber-incidents; “Cyber Operations Tracker,” Council on Foreign Relations, https://www.cfr.org/interactive/cyber-operations.\n The Council on Foreign Relations uses the term “operations” to refer to 1) denial of service; 2) espionage; 3) data destruction; 4) defacement; 5) sabotage; 6) doxing; and 7) financial theft. See “Cyber Operations Tracker,” Council on Foreign Relations.\n Patryk Pawlak, Eneken Tikk, and Mika Kerttunen, “Cyber Conflict Uncoded,” European Union Institute for Security Studies, April 2020, https://www.iss.europa.eu/sites/default/files/EUISSFiles/Brief%207_Cyber.pdf.\n The DIME(LE) model is one method of categorizing these tools. A variety of others are used within the United States military to categorize and describe the operational environment; these include: 1) diplomatic, informational, military, and economic (DIME); 2) diplomatic, informational, military, economic, financial, intelligence, law enforcement (DIMEFIL); and 3) political, military, economic, social, informational, infrastructure (PMESII), among others. See Jack D. Kem, “Understanding the Operational Environment: The Expansion of DIME,” *Military Intelligence Professional Bulletin* 33, no. 2 (April – June 2007): 49-53, https://fas.org/irp/agency/army/mipb/2007_02.pdf.\n Tim Maurer, *Cyber Mercenaries: The State, Hackers, and Power* (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2018), 139.\n U.S. Department of State, “Cyber Sanctions,” n.d., https://www.state.gov/cyber-sanctions/, accessed January 20, 2020; Council of the EU, “Cyber-attacks: Council is now able to impose sanctions,” Press release, May 17, 2019, https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2019/05/17/cyber-attacks-council-is-now-able-to-impose-sanctions/.\n This use of the term “cyber sanctions” is distinct from that of those who use it to refer to from the use of cyberattacks as a coercive method employed to “sanction” the wrongful behavior of adversaries or to achieve coercive economic ends. For a discussion on this topic, see: Marco Benatar and Kristof Gombeer, “Cyber Sanctions: Exploring a Blind Spot in the Current Legal Debate,” European Society of International Law Conference Paper\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nsanctions in response to malicious cyber activity thirty-five times over the past decade, and the European Union and the United Kingdom imposed similar sanctions for the first time in July 2020 and again in October 2020.\nScholars have long debated the effectiveness of sanctions generally and their ability to achieve policy aims. To evaluate the efficacy of cyber sanctions, one must first articulate the goals of sanctions and what they might be useful for achieving. Once policymakers answer questions of effectiveness, they can then craft their use of sanctions to best address relevant threats in cyberspace.\nThe diversity of malicious behavior in cyberspace makes it difficult to identify a coherent logic for using sanctions. States conduct offensive cyber operations in service of political goals while criminals engage in hacking for profit—sometimes, the two occur alongside one another. The use of proxies in cyberspace complicates efforts to distinguish politically motivated and financially motivated attacks and obscures the relationship between state and non-state actors.\nFurther compounding the problem are questions related to the harms that should be included in the definition of “malicious cyber activity.” Narrow definitions of “cyberattack” use the term to\nSeries, Conference Paper No. 9/2011, May 1, 2011, https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1989786 and Zachary Goldman, “Cybersecurity and a New Era of Asymmetric Economic Warfare,” Just Security, January 16, 2015, https://www.justsecurity.org/19150/cybersecurity-era-asymmetric-economic-warfare/.\n Council Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/1125 of July 30, 2020, implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/796 concerning restrictive measures against cyber-attacks threatening the Union or its Member States, 2020 O.J.

But cyber tools can be used to engage in other wrongful behavior that falls outside of this framework. As a policy matter, the United States has used its cyber sanctions framework to punish behavior like election interference. Both the European Union and the United States have used human rights-related programs to respond to cyber-enabled human rights violations. As a result, this paper looks beyond sanctions frameworks meant explicitly to deal with malicious cyber activity and includes instances when additional horizontal frameworks have been used to respond to wrongful uses of information and communications technologies.\nThis paper seeks to provide an overview of targeted financial sanctions for countering malicious cyber activity in the United States and Europe and considerations regarding the tool’s effectiveness. Although policymakers often highlight deterrence and cost imposition as critical goals, both academic literature and policy documents point to difficulty measuring sanctions’ success at achieving these aims.\nThe continued reliance on the tool suggests that policymakers have other motivations for responding to malicious cyber activity with sanctions, regardless of whether sanctions are effective or whether their effectiveness can be measured.

Part outlines the definitional issues related to the scope of “malicious cyber activity” and what, therefore, constitutes a “cyber sanction.” It then provides an overview of the designations to date in the United States and Europe. Part two discusses how policymakers and academics evaluate sanctions’ effectiveness at achieving often-touted deterrence goals and specific considerations related to policy alternatives and long-term consequences. Policymakers cannot ignore the alternative instruments available to respond to malicious cyber activity in thinking about effectiveness and must weigh the trade-offs associated with alternative responses to cyberattacks. Finally, policymakers cannot ignore how firms and other states respond to and perceive the credibility of U.S. sanctions in the long-run—both as it relates to their imposition and removal (or lack thereof). They must consider the corresponding implications for the architecture of the global financial system and United States’ ability to weaponize its financial position. Part three then offers a categorization of the different purposes that sanctions can serve beyond deterrence. These purposes include attribution, information-sharing, audience satisfaction, cooperation with allies, norm development, punishment, and disruption of capabilities—all of which contribute cumulatively to the overarching goal of deterrence.\n## Defining “cyber sanctions”\n### What do sanctions entail?\nThe United States and EU’s cyber sanctions are targeted sanctions that differ from sanctions imposed during and before the 1990s. Comprehensive trade sanctions were a popular instrument of economic coercion throughout the 20th century, in part because they are less costly, less risky, and more palatable than military action. Targeted sanctions differ from comprehensive ones in coercive logic, the intended target, and the ultimate goal. Though similarly aimed at eliciting a change in state behavior, they focus on specific individuals and entities rather than the population at large. They assume that singling out individuals or groups will better “raise the target regime’s costs of noncompliance.” Targeted sanctions can also aim to change the\n Arne Tostensen and Beate Bull, “Are Smart Sanctions Feasible?” World Politics 53, no. 3 (April 2002): 380, 382.\n Daniel Drezner, “How Smart Are Smart Sanctions?” International Studies Review 5, no. 1 (March 2003): 107; see also Tostensen and Bull, “Are Smart Sanctions Feasible?” 380, 386; Thomas G.

Targeted sanctions are understood to have additional value for constraining and signaling. By “constraining,” these scholars refer to complicating an actor’s ability to engage in internationally wrongful behavior. By “signaling,” they refer to sending a message to the target, domestic audiences, and international audiences that expresses support for norms of appropriate behavior.\nOne type of targeted sanction, restrictive financial measures (also referred to as targeted financial sanctions), is increasingly the tool of choice for policymakers seeking to impose consequences for internationally wrongful behavior. Targeted financial sanctions include asset freezes, blocking transactions with designated individuals or entities, and denying access to capital markets. The tool relies on the preeminence of certain currencies and jurisdictions in global financial transactions. Big financial players like the United States, Europe, and, to a lesser extent, China can weaponize the financial system to prevent specific individuals or organizations from transacting in their respective currencies.

The United States, EU, and UK authorities relate principally to compromises in data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\nThese cyber-specific frameworks, however, do not tell the whole story. As early as 2011, the European Union sanctioned individuals and entities engaged in the surveillance and abuse of Iranian journalists and activists.

And the United States has used its cyber-specific framework and a different election interference framework to punish Russian cyber-enabled influence operators.\nThese Iran- and Russia-linked cases are somewhat ambiguous as to whether or not they constitute cyber-enabled harms that should be included in this paper. They do not fit neatly into the definition of cyberattack promulgated by the U.S. National Institute of Technology and Standards: “An attack, via cyberspace, targeting an enterprise’s use of cyberspace for the purpose of disrupting, disabling, destroying, or maliciously controlling a computing environment/infrastructure; or destroying the integrity of the data or stealing controlled information.” For example, monitoring dissidents or using social media to promote narratives online does not necessarily compromise data confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Still, the United States and Europe have considered them harmful enough uses of information and communications technologies to warrant punishment. For this reason, sanctions falling under the cyber-specific framework, as well as others related to cyber-enabled influence operations and human rights violations, are included within the scope of this paper.\n## “Cyber sanctions” to date\nWith these definitional concerns in mind, this section provides a brief overview of the cyber sanctions imposed to date in both the United States and Europe.\nExecutive Order 13694, which created the United States’ cyber-specific sanctions framework, “declare[d] a national emergency with respect to the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States posed by the increasing prevalence and severity of malicious cyber-enabled activities originating from or directed by, persons located, in whole or in substantial part, outside the United States.”\nSo far, the United States has imposed thirty-five tranches of sanctions related to malicious cyber activity under both the cyber-specific framework and other country-specific and horizontal\n For example, the EU sanctioned Abdolsamad Khoramabadi, head of the Committee to Determine Instances of Criminal Content, in March 2013, and the United States later imposed sanctions in May 2018.

These designations involve entities linked to Iran, North Korea, Russia, China, and Nigeria. The earliest designations, dating back to 2012 (made under an Executive Order on terrorism-related sanctions), dealt with Iranian government officials and entities participating in computer hacking projects with Hezbollah. Since then, the United States has sanctioned a range of cybercriminals and nation-state hackers. These include North Korean actors that participated in the 2014 hack of Sony Pictures, Russian actors engaged in cyber-enabled election interference, and Iranian actors targeting U.S. financial institutions. Since 2012, the United States has sanctioned over 250 individuals and entities for engaging in or enabling malicious cyber activity. (For a complete list of incidents, see Table 1.) The majority have been of Iranian, Russian, or North Korean origin. In the first half of 2020, however, the United States took action against two Chinese nationals for aiding Lazarus Group’s efforts to launder money, as well as six Nigerian individuals engaged in business email compromise and romance fraud scams.\nIn statements on the Executive Order, policymakers highlighted the “significant increase in the frequency, scale, and sophistication of cyber incidents targeting the American people” to justify its signing. Absent in many of these statements are clear articulations of how the administration would evaluate these sanctions’ effectiveness. In a blog post following the signing of the April 2015 Executive Order, White House counterterrorism advisor Lisa Monica explained that policymakers hoped to “deter” and “impose costs” on adversaries. But the specific means by which the U.S. Department of the Treasury would evaluate the program’s effectiveness remain unclear.

Though there were no initial designations, the program’s finalization came days before European Parliament elections, perhaps to signal the bloc’s ability to “move quickly to punish future attacks.” EU officials commenting on the newly created authority highlighted concern “at the rise of malicious behavior in cyberspace that aims at undermining the EU’s integrity, security and economic competitiveness, with the eventual risk of conflict.” Again, the Europeans highlight deterrence as a goal of cyber sanctions: High Representative Josep Borrell described the EU’s cyber sanctions as having been imposed “In order to better prevent, discourage, deter, and respond to such malicious behavior in cyberspace.”\nIn June 2020, the United Kingdom finalized its own cyber sanctions framework, “intended to deliver similar policy effects to that existing EU sanctions framework,” for when its transition period out of the European Union comes to an end at the start of 2021. Shortly thereafter, the High Representative of the European Union confirmed that EU candidate and potential candidate countries, members of the European Economic Area, Iceland, Norway, Ukraine, and Georgia would align themselves with these sanctions as well, bringing the total number of countries currently aligned with the EU’s sanctions framework to thirty-seven.\n Steven Mnuchin, “Department of the Treasury Budget Request for FY2021,” Hearing Before the Financial Services and General Government Subcommittee, March 4, 2020, at 1:31:14, https://appropriations.house.gov/events/hearings/department-of-the-treasury-budget-request-for-fy2021.\n Samuel Stolton, “EU backs cyber sanctions regime, following Dutch and UK pressure,” EURACTIV.com, last updated June 3, 2019, https://www.euractiv.com/section/cybersecurity/news/eu-backs-cyber-sanctions-regime-following-dutch-and-uk-pressure/; Adam Botek, “European Union establishes a sanction regime for cyber-attacks,” NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, https://ccdcoe.org/library/publications/european-union-establishes-a-sanction-regime-for-cyber-attacks/.\n “Days before elections, EU approves new cyber sanctions regime,” Reuters, May 17, 2019, https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-cyber/days-before-elections-eu-approves-new-cyber-sanctions-regime-idUSKCN1SN1FQ.\n Council of the EU, “Cyber-attacks: Council is now able to impose sanctions.”\n Council of the EU, “Declaration by the High Representative Josep Borrell on behalf of the EU: European Union response to promote international stability in cyberspace,” Press release, July 30, 2020, https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2020/07/30/declaration-by-the-high-representative-josep-borrell-on-behalf-of-the-eu-european-union-response-to-promote-international-security-and-stability-in-cyberspace/.\n Explanatory Memorandum to the Cyber (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations, 2020 No. 597, Government of the United Kingdom, https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/597/pdfs/uksiem_20200597_en.pdf.\n The Cyber (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020, UK Statutory Instruments.\n Council of the EU, “Declaration by the High Representative on behalf of the EU on the alignment of certain third countries concerning restrictive measures against cyber-attacks threatening the Union or its member states,” Press release, June 19, 2020, https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2020/06/19/declaration-by-the-\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nAt the end of July 2020, the EU took the critical step of imposing cyber sanctions for the first time on six individuals and three entities from North Korea, Russia, and China for orchestrating the WannaCry ransomware attack in 2017, attacks on financial institutions and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, and cyber-enabled economic espionage.

As Zachary Goldman and Damon McCoy have pointed out, “different kinds of malicious cyber activity demand different, tailored, deterrence strategies. This is because each category of cyber threat has a different motivation, and therefore will be sensitive to a different type of cost.”51 Nation-state hackers with political goals are unlikely to suffer the same consequences of a sanctions designation that independent cybercriminals with financial motivations will suffer. Similarly, designating a government official orchestrating an attack is unlikely to have the same impact as designating an individual two or three steps removed that launders money on behalf of a hacking group.\nTwo things complicate the effort to neatly distinguish between categories like cybercrime and nation-state activity and state and non-state actors. First, the convergence of financially-motivated cybercrime and nation-state activity makes it difficult to separate cyberattacks conducted for purely economic gain and those undertaken for political purposes.52 North Korean efforts to raise funds for its weapons of mass destruction program through cyber theft and ransom operations against financial institutions and cryptocurrency exchanges have demonstrated the difficulty of separating financial motivations from political goals.53 Similarly, state-sponsored economic espionage emanating from China blurs the distinction between financial and political aims as the theft of intellectual property aims to “support its strategic development goals—science and technology advancement, military modernization, and economic policy objectives.”54\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nSecond, the use of proxies for conducting offensive cyber operations often precludes a neat division between state and non-state actors in cyberspace. Tim Maurer’s comprehensive overview of the use of proxies for accomplishing offensive cyber operations details the spectrum of relationships between states and their proxies. These relationships range from overt delegation of activity to loose orchestration to passive enablement of proxy behavior. In the latter cases, those operating at a state’s behest may also have a foot in the criminal world. For example, in 2019, Treasury alleged that a Russian cybercriminal indicted and sanctioned for developing and distributing malware also operated on behalf of the Russian government, “highlighting the Russian government’s enlistment of cybercriminals for its own malicious purposes.”\n## Evaluating effectiveness\nIt is not within the remit of external observers to assess whether cyber sanctions effectively achieve deterrence. Much of the information needed to make such an assessment is classified or privately owned intelligence. Though Treasury publicly reports the value of transactions blocked under specific sanctions programs, others have pointed out that evaluating the success of cyber sanctions based on the financial value of prevented transactions is misleading. Therefore, it is difficult for policymakers to attribute any observed decrease in malicious cyber activity or change in activity to sanctions or determine whether activity levels would be even greater absent the threat of sanctions or imposition.\nWithin the U.S. government, Treasury’s Office of Intelligence and Analysis (OIA) and the State Department’s Bureau of Intelligence and Research perform impact assessments. According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), which published a review of U.S. sanctions programs and their effectiveness in 2019, “These assessments analyze the impacts of specific sanctions on a particular aspect of the sanction’s target—for example, the sanctions’ impact on the target country’s economy or trade.” OIA, for example, conducts impact assessments before a sanctions designation and after its imposition and may include factors like the target’s U.S.-\n Maurer, *Cyber Mercenaries*, 42-49.\n “Treasury Sanctions Evil Corp, the Russia-Based Cybercriminal Group Behind Dridex Malware,” U.S. Department of the Treasury, December 5, 2019, https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm845,\n Annie Fixler and Eric Lorber, “Counting Pennies Underestimates the Value of Treasury’s Cyber Sanctions,” Foundation for Defense of Democracies, November 4, 2019, https://www.fdd.org/analysis/2019/11/04/counting-pennies-underestimates-the-value-of-treasurys-cyber-sanctions/.\n Kimberly Gianopoulos, “Economic Sanctions: Agencies Assess Impacts on Targets, and Studies Suggest Several Factors Contribute to Sanctions’ Effectiveness,” U.S. Government Accountability Office, October 2019, 12, https://www.gao.gov/assets/710/701891.pdf.\n Ibid.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nbased assets, global holdings, and interactions with the United States and the potential cascading consequences of a sanctions designation.\nHowever, the report acknowledges that “these assessments do not analyze sanctions’ overall effectiveness in achieving broader U.S. policy goals or objectives, such as whether the sanctions are advancing the national security and policy priorities of the United States” (emphasis added). OIA distinguishes between impact and effect in its assessments:\nAccording to OIA officials, assessing impact is analyzing the potential or observed effect of the sanction on the target. According to officials, impact can be focused on a singular target or could be broader, such as the impact on the target country’s economy or trade flows. In contrast, OIA views effectiveness as the extent to which a sanctions program is achieving the overall broader policy goals of the sanctions program, such as ultimately altering or deterring specific behaviors of the target or furthering U.S. national security priorities [Emphasis added].\nThe latter considerations come into play during National Security Council-led interagency discussions: The process “allows the U.S. government to draw upon multiple agencies’ inputs and perspectives, and to consider these issues in the larger policy context, because sanctions are often only one element of broader government-wide strategies to achieve U.S. policy goals.”\nEven within government, assessing the effectiveness of sanctions at achieving broader policy goals like deterrence is difficult. GAO’s report highlights that policymakers have difficulty isolating sanctions’ effects from those of other policy tools, dealing with shifting policy objectives, and identifying useful data for conducting assessments.\nThe threat of sanctions raises an additional challenge for evaluating effectiveness.

Reporting at the end of August 2015 suggested that the Obama administration was preparing a sanctions package against Chinese targets under the framework. Just weeks later, in September of that year, Obama and Xi met in Washington to announce a moratorium on the cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property for commercial advantage. In remarks on the deal, Obama alluded to the leverage created by the sanctions E.O. in stating, “I did indicate to President Xi that we will apply those and whatever other tools we have in our toolkit to go after cyber criminals, either retrospectively or prospectively.” And in the words of then-Assistant Attorney General John Carlin, “That changed China.” According to a report from the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, the number of detected Chinese cyberattacks diminished following the bilateral agreement. But the evidence of the deal’s success was not conclusive., One report from threat intelligence company FireEye highlighted that the number of attacks began dropping at least a year before the agreement. This case illustrates further the difficulty of isolating sanctions’ effects and evaluating the counterfactual of how adversaries might behave if not for the threat of sanctions.\nThe academic literature on the success of targeted financial sanctions is neither entirely optimistic nor conclusive. One estimate of UN targeted sanctions’ success rate suggests that targeted sanctions are effective just 22 percent of the time.

After surveying sanctions experts, they report, “A remarkable 27 out of 30 survey respondents – 90 percent – agreed with the contention that sanctions against state actors like Iran were more effective than sanctions against non-state actors like al Qaeda.”^[79]^ A recent review of the academic literature highlights the impact of sanctions on non-state actors as a gap in existing scholarship^[80]^—a fact particularly challenging for policymakers evaluating sanctions’ effectiveness against non-state and proxy cyber threats. Perhaps the most damning factor concerning the inconclusiveness of the academic literature is that even amongst academics “what counts as ‘effective’ (or ‘successful’) itself has been a contentious issue.”^[81]^\n## Factors for consideration\nStill, in trying to assess the effectiveness of cyber sanctions, policymakers should look at three key factors:\n(1) A target’s vulnerability to economic pressure,\n(2) The motivations underpinning offensive activity, and\n(3) How chosen targets support malicious activity.\n## Vulnerability to economic pressure\nDespite the lack of consensus regarding sanctions’ aims, those who have surveyed the academic literature note that a target’s vulnerability to economic pressure is critical for sanctions’ effectiveness. As one group of researchers put it, “the data suggest that the types of financial sanctions that have been deployed against states in the last two decades should have a greater\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nimpact on the decisionmaking [sic] of states for which attractiveness to international trade and investment is strategically significant.” In the cyber domain, this means that policymakers should pay attention to specific nation-state cyber threats that may be vulnerable to economic pressure. A sanction against an Iranian or North Korean government entity, for example, is unlikely to disrupt capabilities in the same way that a designation of a Russian entity might. U.S. sanctions have isolated Iran and North Korea from the global financial system, so additional targeted sanctions may be unlikely to significantly affect the ability to carry out future attacks or enjoy their proceeds. Indeed, these two actors have made the financial system the target of cyberattacks. However, actors elsewhere may be more exposed to the influence of the U.S. dollar or the euro in global financial markets and, therefore, more likely to pay attention to the punitive consequences of a sanction or have their capabilities disrupted as a result. For example, Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, alleged that his net worth dropped by 80 percent—over $7 billion—as a result of U.S. sanctions related to “a range of malign activity around the globe,” including malicious cyber activity, imposed in 2018.\n## Actors’ motivations\nThe motives underpinning malicious cyber activity also affect an actor's vulnerability to sanctions. As mentioned above, Goldman and McCoy have argued that sanctions are an appropriate policy tool for dealing with financially motivated cyber threats—like cyber-enabled economic espionage—because they undermine the goal of the activity: profit. By preventing malicious actors from accessing and moving money, sanctions make it “more difficult for them\n Rosenberg, et al., “The New Tools of Economic Warfare,” 15.\n Ian Talley, “U.S. Moves to Further Isolate Iran From Global Financial System,” *Wall Street Journal*, October 25, 2019, https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-moves-to-further-isolate-iran-from-global-financial-system-11572025978; David Sanger and Michael Corkery, “Treasury Imposes Sanctions on North Korea, Cutting Access to Banks,” *New York Times*, June 1, 2016, https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/02/world/asia/treasury-imposes-sanctions-on-north-korea.html.\n “Treasury Targets Supporters of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Networks Responsible for Cyber-Attacks Against the United States,” U.S. Department of the Treasury; “Treasury Targets North Korea for Multiple Cyber-Attacks,” U.S. Department of the Treasury; “Treasury Sanctions North Korean State-Sponsored Malicious Cyber Groups,” U.S. Department of the Treasury.\n David Dawkins, “Russian Billionaire Oleg Deripaska Describes U.S. Money Laundering Accusations As ‘Mish-Mash Of Total Nonsense,’” *Forbes*, February 14, 2020, https://www.forbes.com/sites/daviddawkins/2020/02/14/report-russian-billionaire-oleg-deripaska-accused-by-us-agency-of-laundering-funds-for-vladimir-putin/#7b2a95c0c4bc; “Treasury Designates Russian Oligarchs, Officials, and Entities in Response to Worldwide Malign Activity,” U.S. Department of the Treasury, April 6, 2018, https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm0338.\n Goldman and McCoy, “Deterring Financially Motivated Cybercrime,” 602.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nto use the proceeds of their crimes.” Sanctions may fail to dissuade financially motivated actors from engaging in wrongful behavior if the profitability of the action outweighs the financial costs of sanctions. Still, the profit motive may make these actors more sensitive to sanctions than a politically motivated actor would be. Russian actors engaged in hack and leak operations or attacks on international organizations are not as likely to be dissuaded from engaging in their activity because sanctions have made it unprofitable if profitability was not necessarily a preeminent goal.\n## Means of supporting wrongful activity\nThe specific choice of target and whose behavioral change is the goal of sanctions are also likely to bear on how policymakers should evaluate effectiveness. Once policymakers have identified malicious activity, they can choose to go after several different targets, including the state actors that directed, orchestrated, or enabled the attack; the individuals directly engaged in the attack; or those that provide material, financial, or technological support for the attack. Again, these actors are not equally vulnerable to the effects of sanctions. Government officials that enjoy the backing and protection of the state may be less likely to be deterred than those whose legitimate commercial interests are at stake by aiding targets in circumventing sanctions. As one group of researchers at the Center for a New American Security put it, “To the extent that sanctions on non-state actors are focused on coercing a change in behavior, that strategy may have the greatest impact on the ecosystem of actual and would-be supporters of those groups, rather than on the groups themselves.” Simultaneously, sanctions can go after a specific target to change a third party’s behavior—returning to the Deripaska example described above, sanctioning Russian oligarchs was partly meant to signal to the Russian state that its conduct was unacceptable and leverage elite pain for behavioral change.\n## Effectiveness as opposed to what?\nEvaluating the impacts of sanctions cannot ignore the alternative instruments available to states\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n John Carlin, “Detect, Disrupt, Deter: A Whole-of-Government Approach to National Security Cyber Threats,” *Harvard National Security Journal* 7, (2016): 420, https://harvardnsj.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2016/06/Carlin-FINAL.pdf.\n The impact of sanctions on an adversary’s risk calculus could potentially backfire if financially motivated actors are deterred from engaging in the lowest levels of criminal activity, which may generate profits incommensurate with the absorbed risk, but continue to engage in highly profitable but extremely destabilizing attacks.\n Rosenberg, et al., “The New Tools of Economic Warfare,” 28.\n “Treasury Designates Russian Oligarchs, Officials, and Entities in Response to Worldwide Malign Activity,” U.S. Department of the Treasury.\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nseeking to respond to wrongful behavior in cyberspace. This paper situates sanctions within the DIME(LE) framework to highlight the point that policymakers face the choice not of sanctioning or doing nothing but of sanctioning or releasing a diplomatic statement or responding with a retaliatory cyberattack or of doing nothing or of doing several of these. In the U.S. context, in particular, policymakers have adopted a “whole-of-government” approach to countering malicious cyber activity—in essence, one that involves all of the tools of statecraft outlined in the DIME(LE)., As a result, sanctions have frequently followed criminal charges against malicious cyber actors. Sixteen of the thirty-five instances in which the United States imposed cyber sanctions were preceded by an indictment of at least one of the sanctioned individuals—providing useful context for understanding the range of available tools for imposing costs on malicious cyber actors.\nWhere effectiveness is concerned, sanctions, in theory, may have more “teeth” than indictments because their enforcement does not rely on an actor setting foot in a country with which a state pursuing charges has an extradition treaty. As others have noted, the U.S. strategy of charging foreign-linked hackers is unlikely to result in many hackers ever appearing in U.S. courts. However, there have been some important exceptions. Three members of the FIN7 cybercrime group were arrested in Spain in 2018, two of which have been extradited, and in May 2020, authorities arrested another member of the organization in Seattle.\nJack Goldsmith and Robert Williams have questioned whether the public attribution of cyberattacks through criminal charges is counterproductive. They argue: “When the main public response to cybertheft that has reached crisis proportions is to identify the perpetrators but not\n David Baldwin, “The Sanctions Debate and the Logic of Choice,” *International Security* 24, no. 3 (Winter 1999/2000): 84.\n Though law enforcement action is included in this typology, others have noted that the decision to bring criminal charges is a thoroughly independent decision and that prosecutorial independence is part of what makes the tool effective. Indictments against foreign hackers are not themselves political tools, but the decision to unseal an indictment can be. See Garrett Hinck and Tim Maurer, “Persistent enforcement: Criminal Charges as a Response to Nation-State Malicious Cyber Activity,” *Journal of National Security Law and Policy* 10, no. 3 (2020): 535, https://jnslp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Criminal-Charges-as-a-Response-to-Nation-State-Malicious-Cyber-Activity.pdf.\n John Carlin, “Detect, Disrupt, Deter,” 394.\n Ibid., 527.\n Office of Public Affairs, “Three Members of Notorious International Cybercrime Group ‘Fin7’ In Custody for Role in Attacking Over 100 U.S. Companies,” U.S. Department of Justice, August 1, 2018, https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/three-members-notorious-international-cybercrime-group-fin7-custody-role-attacking-over-100; Jeff Stone, “Alleged FIN7 hacking director Andrii Kolpakov set to be extradited to the U.S.,” Cyberscoop, May 9, 2019, https://www.cyberscoop.com/fin7-andrii-kolpakov-extradition-spain/.\n Shannon Vavra, “Federal officials have arrested another accused FIN7 hacker,” Cyberscoop, May 26, 2020, https://www.cyberscoop.com/fin7-hacking-arrest-financial/.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\npunish them, the main signal to adversaries (especially third parties who are watching) is that the United States is extraordinarily defenseless.” Sanctions, by contrast, create real financial consequences for malicious actors by relying on the preeminence of the U.S. dollar and the euro in global financial transactions. Sanctions are enforced not by the U.S. government or EU alone but by financial institutions that risk exposing themselves to secondary sanctions. As a result, they may better demonstrate the costs of engaging in wrongful behavior and, therefore, deter adversaries.\nSanctions, however, face limitations. Sophisticated actors can identify ways to evade sanctions, sometimes through cyberattacks. Last fall, a United Nations panel of experts report detailed North Korea’s efforts to circumvent sanctions and raise money for its weapons of mass destruction program by attacking the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) and cryptocurrency exchanges, executing ransomware attacks, and mining cryptocurrency., The risk of evasion poses a threat to the efficacy of targeted financial sanctions as it “undermines the credibility of the senders, because the inability to implement and enforce the measures is often interpreted as signaling the lack of power of the sender.” And in the longer-term, actors may be compelled to seek alternate financial architectures to avoid the hassle of evading sanctions.\nThe broader point of comparing sanctions and indictments is that sanctions are just one of the tools that governments can employ against malicious cyber actors.

In the U.S. context, the NSC-led interagency process provides a forum for discussing the effectiveness of sanctions relative to other policy instruments. But as with academic literature on the efficacy of sanctions on non-state actors, Dursun Peksen argues that scholarly work on the utility of sanctions relative to other policy instruments is similarly lacking.\nNonetheless, as policymakers impose sanctions, they must consider the potential escalatory consequences and how alternative policy instruments might compare. Rosenberg and Tama highlight the need to better assess where sanctions sit on the escalation ladder to strengthen their signaling value and ensure that efforts at cross-domain deterrence do not inadvertently compromise broader foreign policy objectives. As they put it, “if it is unclear whether an airstrike against a military facility is higher or lower on the escalation ladder than financial sanctions targeting a country’s most important economic sector, the target government may not understand the likely consequences of continuing to flout an international norm or U.S. demands.”\nCompared to actions like diplomatic statements, sanctions may be perceived as more escalatory since they aim to impose real financial costs and disrupt an operations’ financing. But in comparison to retaliatory cyberattacks or other military action, they may be less escalatory because their contours are narrowly defined, and policymakers can couple sanctions with clear statements of intention. The EU’s sanctions, which refrain from attributing responsibility for an attack to a specific state, may be less escalatory than those imposed by the United States, which, as described above, can and sometimes do allege state responsibility for wrongful behavior.\nIf adversaries see sanctions as escalatory, they may retaliate. Sanctions have generated such retaliation: Iran retaliated for U.S. sanctions with cyberattacks against the financial system. Russia responded to the passage of the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions\n Gianopolous, “Economic Sanctions,” 18.\n Peksen, “When Do Imposed Economic Sanctions Work?,” 8-9.\n Elizabeth Rosenberg and Jordan Tama, “Strengthening the Economic Arsenal,” Center for a New American Security, December 2019, 8-9, https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/strengthening-the-economic-arsenal.\n Ibid., 9.\n I thank Michael Daniel for highlighting this point.\n I thank Patryk Pawlak for highlighting this point.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nAct (CAATSA) with reductions in the number of diplomatic staff. (Perhaps somewhat counterproductively, Iran’s cyberattacks invited further sanctions.)\n## Long-term effectiveness\nThe point raised above about sanctions evasion speaks to a broader concern about how the effectiveness of sanctions might change over time, potentially providing either diminishing returns or jeopardizing the United States’ ability to pursue its policy goals. As Peter Feaver and Eric Lorber have put it, targeted financial sanctions rely on calculations about business risk, and “If global business conditions change, the firms might re-calculate that engaging in financial transactions with those targeted states outweighs the costs.” This risk of such re-calculation may be heightened if sanctions create incentives for businesses to pursue transactions in other currencies or for countries to develop alternative financial architectures.\nThese concerns—and consideration of cyber sanctions generally—cannot be divorced from the broader context in which the United States has aggressively pursued the use of sanctions to achieve a range of foreign policy goals, sometimes to the detriment of ally relationships. Two particular issues are worth highlighting: 1) the credibility of sanctions commitments and 2) the use of secondary sanctions.\nThe credibility of broader sanctions commitments matters for evaluating the effectiveness of cyber sanctions at deterrence. Elizabeth Rosenberg and Jordan Tama have noted that sanctions’ effectiveness depends on the credibility of both the threat to designate targets for wrongful behavior and the promise to lift sanctions if behavior changes. The United States’ withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) illustrates how failure to do the latter can undermine broader foreign policy goals. As Rosenberg and Tama write, “By walking away from\n Ellen Nakashima, “Iran blamed for cyberattacks on U.S. banks and companies,” *Washington Post*, September 21, 2012, https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/iran-blamed-for-cyberattacks/2012/09/21/afbe2be4-0412-11e2-9b24-ff730c7f6312_story.html; Neil MacFarquhar, “Putin, Responding to Sanctions, Orders U.S. to Cut Diplomatic Staff by 755,” *New York Times*, July 30, 2017, https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/30/world/europe/russia-sanctions-us-diplomats-expelled.html\n “Treasury Targets Supporters of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Networks Responsible for Cyber-Attacks Against the United States,” U.S. Department of the Treasury.\n Peter Feaver and Eric Lorber, “Coercive Diplomacy and the New Financial Levers: Evaluating the Intended and Unintended Consequences of Financial Sanctions,” *Legatum Institute*, November 2010, 44, https://lif.blob.core.windows.net/lif/docs/default-source/publications/2010-publications-coercive-diplomacy.pdf?Status=Temp&amp;sfvrsn=2.\n Ibid., 46-47.\n I thank Allison Peters and Ariel (Eli) Levite for highlighting these important points.\n Rosenberg and Tama, “Strengthening the Economic Arsenal,” 5.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nthose allies and partners, the United States has made them less inclined to privilege cooperation in the future.”\nIn the U.S. context, the two-pronged approach to creating new sanctions frameworks further complicates the delisting process. Legal authorities in the United States for imposing sanctions can be created through executive or legislative means. U.S. sanctions remain in place until a target appeals to OFAC and demonstrates a change in behavior that warrants delisting (and the burden is on designated individuals and entities to present a basis for delisting) or until Congress votes to lift the sanctions. Congressionally mandated sanctions provide an essential check on executive action to impose sanctions unilaterally. But if Congress refuses to lift sanctions in response to behavioral change, they undermine the tool’s credibility. (By contrast to U.S. sanctions, EU sanctions are reviewed annually. In some ways, this may enhance the instrument’s credibility.)\nEfforts to understand the effectiveness of the United States’ cyber sanctions must also contend with the legislative authorities that provide for secondary sanctions. Secondary sanctions refer to “the threat of US sanctions against foreign individuals and entities for engaging in specified activities that may not have a US nexus.” In the context of cyber sanctions, these include provisions enshrined within CAATSA for imposing sanctions against individuals and entities that engage in “significant transactions” with certain Russian government entities and their personnel. Secondary sanctions are different from provisions that allow governments to target those that provide “technical, financial, or material support” to previously designated actors. As others have pointed out, both the U.S. and EU authorities accept that sanctions are more effective when targeting an adversary’s network. Instead, secondary sanctions target those that continue to do business with a sanctioned entity, whether based in the United States or not.\n Ibid., 6.\n “Filing a Petition for Removal from an OFAC List,” U.S. Department of the Treasury, last updated May 2, 2017, https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/petitions.aspx.\n Council of the EU, “Adoption and review procedure for EU sanctions,” last reviewed February 14, 2019, https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/sanctions/adoption-review-procedure/.\n Samantha Sultoon and Justine Walker, “Secondary Sanctions’ Implications and the Transatlantic Relationship,” Atlantic Council, September 2019, 3, https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SecondarySanctions_Final.pdf.\n These include “the defense or intelligence sectors of the Government of the Russian Federation, including the Main Intelligence Agency of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation or the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation.” Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act of 2017, Public Law 115-44, U.S. Statutes at Large (2017), https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/hr3364_pl115-44.pdf.\n Ibid.\n Sultoon and Walker, “Secondary Sanctions’ Implications and the Transatlantic Relationship,” 4.\n\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nTo date, the United States has not imposed cyber-related secondary sanctions under CAATSA, but the legislation permitting secondary sanctions and their potential ramifications for EU projects has attracted criticism from the bloc. Because of U.S. withdrawal from the JCPOA, some EU members have signed on to the Instrument in Support of Trade Exchanges (INSTEX), a special purpose vehicle that “circumvents the traditional financial networks the US uses to establish its jurisdiction for enforcing sanctions,” to conduct business with Iranian entities.\nParticularly as European entities become subject to secondary U.S. sanctions and must find alternative payment systems, other countries face incentives to create alternative global financial architectures that erode the United States’ long-term power in the global economic system. Countries like Russia, China, and even India, are interested in an alternative financial messaging system to SWIFT, but these have yet to catch on and face important limitations.\nSome have pointed out that “Multinational businesses seeking to avoid exposure to U.S. and EU sanctions can find refuge in the yuan and Chinese financial platforms.” China’s “efforts to promote the yuan as a global currency and establish alternatives to the dollar- and euro-dominated international financial system” may heighten the associated risks. Many are quick to point out that China faces several obstacles to achieving such a goal. Still, as former senior Treasury adviser Elizabeth Rosenberg points out, “sanctions do give China’s economic ambitions an undeniable boost.” Especially as financial technologies—like cryptocurrencies—introduce new ways for criminals to launder money, the continued use of sanctions may\n “Russia sanctions: EU vows to retaliate over US measures,” BBC, July 26, 2017, https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40727044; Paul Ivan, “The US and the EU need a stronger dialogue on Russia,” European Policy Centre, May 2, 2018, https://www.epc.eu/en/Publications/The-US-and-the-EU-need-a-stronger-dialogue-on-Russia-sanctions~1e70f8; Karen DeYoung, “Three European allies ask U.S. not to enforce secondary sanctions over Iran trade,” Washington Post, June 6, 2018, https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/three-european-allies-ask-us-not-to-enforce-secondary-sanctions-over-iran-trade/2018/06/06/f4c94594-69c3-11e8-bea7-c8eb28bc52b1_story.html.\n Ellie Geranmayeh and Manuel Lafont Rapnouil, “Meeting the Challenge of Secondary Sanctions,” European Council on Foreign Relations, June 2019, 4, 7, https://www.ecfr.eu/publications/summary/meeting_the_challenge_of_secondary_sanctions.\n Drezner, “Targeted Sanctions in a World of Global Finance,” 760-761.\n Jignesh Davda, “China, Russia &amp; India Push Forward on SWIFT Alternative,” Yahoo!

The potential backlash to Washington’s gung-ho attitude toward financial sanctions may occur on a longer time horizon but carries arguably more significant consequence for U.S. global power.\nThe potential consequences mean that policymakers evaluating the effectiveness of cyber sanctions at deterring wrongful behavior must also consider the long-term trajectory of the tool’s use and how decisions within the broader foreign policy context affect the reception of sanctions.\n## Moving beyond deterrence\nA general emphasis on deterrence obscures the variety of different functions that sanctions can perform and the diversity of motives underpinning malicious cyber activity. Few, if any, policymakers would argue that the outright cessation of malicious cyber activity is a realistic goal that could be achieved by targeted financial sanctions. Given that some, like North Korea, pursue cybercrime as a means of sanctions evasion, one might even argue that sanctions are counterproductive if the goal is understood to stop malicious cyber activity.^[130]^ As described above, the academic and policy literature on the effectiveness of cyber sanctions at deterrence is difficult to measure. So why do policymakers continue to employ sanctions in the seeming absence of compelling evidence about their effectiveness?\nThe academic literature on targeted sanctions has attempted to account for some of the different aims of sanctions and the diverse threats they can target by introducing three potential purposes—constraint, coercion, and signaling.^[131]^ Even these, however, ignore the nuanced and specific purposes for imposing sanctions in response to malicious cyber activity. To say that a sanctions designation aims to “signal,” for example, ignores important features of the message itself, its intended audience, and its contribution to the broader goal of sending a message by sanctioning.\nOthers divide the purposes of sanctions into “symbolic” or “expressive” and “instrumental” ones.^[132]^ Symbolic or expressive purposes relate to the political interests served by doing something in response to wrongful behavior—i.e., signaling. Instrumental objectives relate to desired policy or behavior changes—i.e., coercion and constraint.\n^[130]^ Elizabeth Rosenberg and Neil Bhatiya, “Busting North Korea’s Sanctions Evasion,” Center for a New American Security, March 4, 2020, https://www.cnas.org/publications/commentary/busting-north-koreas-sanctions-evasion.\n^[131]^ Giumelli, *How EU sanctions work*, 18-19.\n^[132]^ Taehee Whang, “Playing to the Home Crowd?

Ascertaining responsibility is a complicated matter. The degree to which a state might be responsible for malicious activity varies from an inability to prevent malicious attacks to active participation in an attack.\nSanctions designations are public listings that name individuals or entities in response to malicious behavior. As Kristen Eichensehr has argued, they can attribute wrongful conduct by naming the individual or entity that directly perpetrated a cyberattack or indicating state responsibility for an attack.\nThis is not always the case. Because targets can be sanctioned for materially, financially, or technologically enabling a previously designated actor, they do not always publicize attribution in the sense of identifying hackers. And because ascertaining the nature of the relationship between a state and a hacker can be difficult, not all sanctions allege that a state enabled or orchestrated wrongful behavior in cyberspace.\nBut in some cases, sanctions do serve to implicate a state in malicious cyber activity. For example, in September 2019, the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) named Lazarus\n Hinck and Maurer, “Persistent enforcement,” 531-534.\n Herb Lin, “Attribution of Malicious Cyber Incidents,” Aegis Paper Series No. 1607, Hoover Institution, n.d., 5, https://www.hoover.org/sites/default/files/research/docs/lin_webready.pdf.\n Herb Lin draws on Jason Healey’s piece, “Beyond Attribution: Seeking National Responsibility for Cyber Attacks,” in outlining the different degrees of responsibility; Ibid., 18.

Within the EU, attribution is a “sovereign political decision” left up to each member state’s discretion. As a result, EU sanctions designations avoid making a specific link between a designated individual or entity and a state sponsor, even when, as in the case of the July 2020 Russian targets, some of the listed individuals may work on behalf of government agencies or may be government agencies themselves., Though attribution is also a sovereign political decision in the United States, the process is more straightforward—there is no need to wrangle the agreement of twenty-seven member states to attribute.\nIndependent of the political reasons for (not) attributing a cyberattack, not all jurisdictions are equally competent in their ability to attribute. States differ in their ability to identify technical and political indicators of compromise and use signals, human, and open-source intelligence to understand them. As one RAND Corporation report put it, “These capabilities may not be widespread globally, and very few countries are thought to possess sophisticated all-source capabilities.”\n## Information-sharing\nThe press releases that accompany sanctions designations sometimes contain important information about how malicious actors carry out their attacks. Though formal information-sharing mechanisms exist in both the United States and the European Union, many involve a\n “Treasury Sanctions North Korean State-Sponsored Malicious Cyber Groups,” U.S. Department of the Treasury.\n Botek, “European Union establishes a sanction regime for cyber-attacks.”\n Council Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/1125 of July 30, 2020, O.J. (246) 4.\n Researchers at the European Union Institute for Security Studies describe the threshold for placing responsibility for a cyber operation on a state as defined by two criteria: “the cyber operation is attributed to that state and constitutes an internationally wrongful act. To be attributable to that state, the operation must have been carried out by one of its organs or by another actor acting on its behalf. A cyber operation attributable to a state may constitute an internationally wrongful act if it violates a norm of international law.” See Patryk Pawlak, Thomas Biersteker, and François Delerue, *Guardian of the galaxy: EU cyber sanctions and norms in cyberspace*, eds.

In the United States, for example, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) Exchange is a Treasury-led “voluntary public-private information sharing partnership among law enforcement, financial institutions, and FinCEN aimed at effectively and efficiently combating money laundering, terrorism financing, organized crime, and other financial crimes; protecting the financial system from illicit use; and promoting national security.” Additionally, the Bank Secrecy Act Advisory Group (BSAAG) is “the means by which Treasury receives advice on the operations of the Bank Secrecy Act,” a key piece of U.S. law regarding money laundering. Made of up representatives from federal agencies, financial institutions, and trade groups, BSAAG is chaired by the FinCEN director. Though these mechanisms are essential means of sharing information, the participating institutions and representatives are limited.\nHowever, public press releases can garner the attention of a broader set of stakeholders with sanctions compliance obligations and can aid in disseminating information related to cyber threats. For example, the United States’ designation of Nigerian cybercriminals contained details of how Richard Uzuh and his co-conspirators spoofed emails from business executives to trick Americans into wiring money.\n## Audience satisfaction\nSanctions may satisfy the political pressure to “do something” in response to malicious cyber activity. As Richard Hanania has argued, sanctions have a significant political purpose insofar as they “appear to be a moderate and measured response to unacceptable behavior abroad.” And they are a safe option for policymakers because the targets—foreign publics—cannot easily influence American politics (i.e., vote), and, therefore, “there is little reason to suspect that their\n Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, “FinCEN Exchange Questions and Answers,” U.S. Department of the Treasury, https://www.fincen.gov/index.php/resources/fincen-exchange/fincen-exchange-frequently-asked-questions.\n U.S. Department of the Treasury, Notice, “Financial Crimes Enforcement Network; Bank Secrecy Act Advisory Group; Solicitation of Application for Membership,” *Federal Register* 83, no. 248 (December 28, 2018): 67487, https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2018-12-28/pdf/2018-28178.pdf.\n Ibid.\n “Treasury Sanctions Nigerian Cyber Actors for Targeting U.S. Businesses and Individuals,” U.S. Department of the Treasury.\n William Kaempfer and Anton Lowenberg, “The Political Economy of Economic Sanctions,” in *Handbook of Defense Economics, Volume 2*, ed.

From the perspective of companies, it may help redirect blame from the company for failing to prevent a cyberattack.\nSanctions may also satisfy international audiences that want to see governments respond to malicious cyber activity. In some cases, sanctions are met with laudatory statements from allied governments. For example, the United States released such a message when the European Union imposed cyber sanctions for the first time in July 2020.\n## Cooperation with allies\nGiven that both the United States and European Union have legal frameworks to impose sanctions against malicious cyber actors, there is a potential cooperative dimension to the policy. Some have suggested that sanctions work better when there are concerted efforts among states to restrict an actor’s capabilities and deny its action’s benefits because it limits the actor’s ability to mitigate losses in other markets. Even without cooperative effort, sanctions can signal to members of the international community a shared commitment to reducing malicious activity. Where the cyber context is concerned, European action can have a particularly important signaling function given, as a former State Department official put it, the fact that actors like Russia and China are increasingly writing off signaling from the United States.\nThe U.S. and EU legal authorities are mostly similar, heightening the potential cooperative dimension. At their cores, both offer the ability to impose sanctions on individuals and entities that disrupt the confidentiality, availability, or integrity of data or the functioning of computer systems that support critical infrastructure or governmental services. And so far, U.S. and EU\n Ibid.\n Hinck and Maurer, “Persistent enforcement,” 531.\n Ibid.\n Michael Pompeo, “The United States Applauds the EU’s Action on Cyber Sanctions,” U.S. Department of State, Press release, July 30, 2020, https://www.state.gov/the-united-states-applauds-the-eus-action-on-cyber-sanctions/.\n Dursun Peksen, “When Do Economic Sanctions Work Best?” Center for a New American Security, June 10, 2019, https://www.cnas.org/publications/commentary/when-do-economic-sanctions-work-best.\n I thank a former U.S. Department of State official for making this observation.\n\ndesignations have largely overlapped: the United States has previously sanctioned six of the nine targets from the EU’s initial July 2020 listing.\n## Norm development\nBy clearly delineating unacceptable harms and imposing costs against those who perpetrate them, sanctions can underscore the importance of internationally recognized norms. Imposing sanctions in concert with like-minded nations further strengthens the norm development function. Having multiple states commit to punishing a malicious actor reinforces the wrongfulness of the act in question and helps establish what constitutes an appropriate state response to such wrongful behavior.\nIn his statement following the EU’s first cyber sanctions, High Representative Josep Borrell explicitly referenced commitment to implementing the norms developed by the UN Group of Government Experts’ (UNGGE) 2010, 2013, and 2015 reports and to continued cooperation the ongoing UNGGE and Open-Ended Working Group.\n## Punishment of malicious actors\nBy blocking transactions and freezing malicious cyber actors’ assets, policymakers demonstrate that engaging in offensive behavior has real financial consequences. Because many cyberattacks are financially motivated, sanctions deny the benefits of an actor’s behavior by making it more difficult to access and move money.\nGoldman has argued that targeted financial sanctions play a vital role in the broader effort to deter financially motivated cybercrime—especially cyber-enabled economic espionage—by “drying up the market for stolen data.” Since the United States’ sanctions framework allows for the designation of not just those who steal intellectual property but also those who benefit\n “Treasury Targets Russian Operatives over Election Interference, World Anti-Doping Agency Hacking, and Other Malign Activities,” U.S. Department of the Treasury; U.S. President, “Taking Additional Steps to Address the National Emergency With Respect to Significant Malicious Cyber-Enabled Activities,” 3; “Treasury Targets North Korea for Multiple Cyber-Attacks,” U.S. Department of the Treasury; Council Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/1125 of July 30, 2020, O.J.

By freezing assets and blocking transactions, sanctions can disrupt the financing of an offensive cyber operation. In theory, they can also disrupt a state’s ability to recruit the talent necessary to carry out a sophisticated operation—the exposure of a hacker’s identity and the financial punishment may dissuade would-be hackers from serving as a proxy.\nSanctions against terrorist financiers are an important precedent in this respect. In 2001, then-president George W. Bush signed Executive Order 13224 to allow for the imposition of sanctions against those determined “To assist in, sponsor, or provide financial, material, or technological support for, or financial or other services in support of, acts of terrorism.” According to Juan Zarate, a former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes, the use of sanctions against terrorist organizations led to the development of additional horizontal sanctions programs to deal with behavior-based national security threats—like cyber threats. The logic of going after financing networks and enablers is simple: As Zachary Goldman has put it, “Entities like drug trafficking networks, terrorist groups, and proliferation facilitators require substantial streams of funding and access to the global financial system, to remain effective. The more time and resources they spend trying to fund an organization, the less time spent planning attacks or engaging in other illicit activity.”\n## Deterrence\nThrough the previously listed means, sanctions may aspire to a deterrent function that seeks to change state actors’ long-term behavior in cyberspace. The repeated imposition of sanctions may introduce sustained friction in the relationship between the proxy and the state that changes the state’s overall calculus about how and when to engage in malicious cyber activity. Over time, this may lead to a change in the nature of the state’s relationship with its proxies and the degree of risk it is willing to accept when engaging in offensive cyber operations.

Therefore, our understanding of the impact of sanctions must go beyond the deterrent function and consider the additional symbolic purposes outlined above and the factors that might also impact how symbolic goals are achieved. Table 2 summarizes questions policymakers might consider in evaluating the effectiveness of sanctions at achieving the variety of purposes set forward in this section and the considerations for assessing deterrence outlined in the previous section.\nTable 2. Questions for evaluating effectiveness\n|  Function | Questions  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  Attribution | • Do the statements accompanying a sanctions designation claim that the named entities perpetrated a cyberattack itself?\n• Do the statements accompanying a sanctions designation allege state responsibility for wrongful behavior in cyberspace?\n• Have other policies or legal action (i.e., indictments) made similar attribution claims?  |\n|  Information-sharing | • Do private sector entities pay attention to sanctions notices more than other vehicles for information-sharing about cyber threats?\n• Do the statements accompanying a sanctions designation contain meaningful information about the tactics, techniques, and procedures employed by malicious actors that external stakeholders could use to fortify their networks?  |\n|  Audience satisfaction | • Do actors in the private sector or civil society find sanctions a meaningful and appropriate response to malicious activity?\n• Do allies release diplomatic statements affirming the appropriateness of the action?  |\n|  Cooperation with allies | • Do (or could) other jurisdictions impose sanctions against the same targets?\n• Do other countries release diplomatic statements affirming the appropriateness of the action?  |\n|  Norm development | • Does the offense that prompted sanction violate an established norm of responsible behavior in cyberspace?  |\n Joseph Nye, Jr., “Deterrence and Dissuasion in Cyberspace,” *International Security* 41, no. 3 (Winter 2016/17): 56, https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/ISEC_a_00266.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\n- Have other countries or jurisdictions signaled that sanctions are the appropriate response to this type of norm violation?\n## Punishment\n- How exposed is the individual or entity to the U.S. dollar or the euro’s impact in global financial markets?\n- What is the monetary value of the transactions blocked or assets frozen as a result of the sanction?\n- Do opportunities exist for a designated actor to protect their assets or recoup their losses?\n## Disruption of capabilities\n- Do sanctions disrupt an actor’s ability to procure material, financial, or technological resources necessary to carry out malicious activity?\n- How do sanctions affect the willingness of proxies to engage with state sponsors of malicious cyber activity?\n- Do opportunities exist for actors to circumvent sanctions or mitigate their impact by using alternative financial architectures?\n## Deterrence\n- Over time, does the nature of a particular actor’s behavior in cyberspace change?\n- Do sanctions change the risk-calculus of those engaged in malicious cyber activity?\n- Over time, does the nature of malicious cyber activity in general change?\n## General\n- How might adversaries respond or retaliate to sanctions?

Not all of the potential purposes of cyber sanctions writ large will be served by a single designation, nor should they be. Policymakers’ goals differ with respect to the variety of cyber threats. The aim of preventing low-level cybercrime like business email compromise scams is different from seeking to encourage states to rein in their proxies when conducting offensive cyber operations.\nNo matter which goals policymakers have in mind with a sanctions designation, they should keep in mind the considerations outlined above pertaining to alternative policy instruments and long-term consequences. Take, for example, the goal of audience satisfaction and the pressure to “do something” in response to malicious cyber activity: Escalation can undermine audience\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nsatisfaction if a greater number of private sector entities become the victims of cyberattacks in response to sanctions. And the repeated imposition of sanctions may have diminishing returns as far as satisfying audiences—if policymakers describe sanctions in deterrence terms, domestic audiences may be satisfied initially, but the continuation of activity may be interpreted as a sign of failure and lend itself to disappointment.\nThis section has outlined seven purposes in addition to deterrence that policymakers may have in mind when employing sanctions against malicious cyber actors. It is difficult to say whether sanctions deter. But despite the emphasis on deterrence in policy statements, sanctions can have important symbolic purposes that should factor into evaluations of sanctions programs.\n# Conclusion\nThe definitional issues highlighted at the beginning of this paper related to what constitutes malicious cyber activity and should be included within this paper’s scope and the variety of aims of sanctions can raise a question about whether it makes sense to speak of a country or jurisdiction’s “cyber policy” or consider cyber issues a facet of a broader foreign policy. Future research in this area should address how policy should deal with the distinction between “cyber” as a threat itself and as a means for accomplishing other ends like intelligence collection, economic competition, or control over domestic political spaces. The United States’ use, in particular, of a variety of different legal instruments—not just the cyber-specific sanctions framework—highlights the fact that cybercrime and national security threats require a variety of flexible tools. More clearly delineating how and why cyber activity crosses a line of acceptability is crucial to promoting responsible behavior in cyberspace and identifying appropriate mechanisms for responding to harms.\nMore empirical research is also needed in this area. Much of the academic literature on sanctions focuses on those levied against states and deals insufficiently with the success of sanctions against nonstate and proxy actors. $^{166}$ As transnational threats multiply and policymakers reach for sanctions in response, they should have a clear evidence base supporting their decision making.\nThough policymakers often emphasize the goal of deterrence, articulation of the considerations for evaluating the effectiveness of sanctions is scant, even among government actors with access to the full array of intelligence necessary to make such evaluations. Policymakers should consider a target’s vulnerability to economic pressure, actors’ motivations, and the role that\n$^{166}$ Peksen, “When Do Imposed Economic Sanctions Work?,” 7-8.\n\ntargets play in wrongful behavior in seeking to evaluate the likely outcomes of a sanctions designation and its effectiveness. Furthermore, questions of effectiveness also require attention to alternative policy options and long-term consequences.\nMoving beyond deterrence and cost imposition, the diversity of actors against which policymakers impose sanctions requires more nuanced thinking. In the absence of clear frameworks for evaluating effectiveness and relative pessimism about sanctions’ effectiveness, policymakers continue to reach for the tool. Therefore, our understanding of the purposes of sanctions should account for functions like attribution, information-sharing, audience satisfaction, cooperation with allies, norm development, and punishment.\nDespite being hailed as ineffective by academic scholars, policymakers continue to employ sanctions. Data collected by the Center for a New American Security shows that the current U.S. administration is more than willing to sanction adversaries. Even though 2019 saw the fewest designations during the current administration, the yearly total was still more than those of any single year under the previous administration. And the EU’s recent implementation of its cyber sanctions framework for the first time indicates that neither is the policy tool falling out of favor abroad.\n Johnpatrick Imperiale, “Sanctions by the Numbers,” Center for a New American Security, February 27, 2020, https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/sanctions-by-the-numbers.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816",

          "footnote": "Researchers at the European Union Institute for Security Studies describe the threshold for placing responsibility for a cyber operation on a state as defined by two criteria: “the cyber operation is attributed to that state and constitutes an internationally wrongful act. To be attributable to that state, the operation must have been carried out by one of its organs or by another actor acting on its behalf. A cyber operation attributable to a state may constitute an internationally wrongful act if it violates a norm of international law.” See Patryk Pawlak, Thomas Biersteker, and François Delerue, *Guardian of the galaxy: EU cyber sanctions and norms in cyberspace*, eds.

This draft paper provides an overview of the legal frameworks for sanctioning malicious cyber actors and the set of relevant sanctions imposed to date. Despite an emphasis on the goal of deterrence, both policymakers and academics have difficulty determining whether sanctions deter malicious cyber activity. Considering the continued use of cyber sanctions, this paper highlights key considerations for policymakers to evaluate whether sanctions can deter wrongful behavior in cyberspace.\nKeywords: sanctions, economic statecraft, cyber, deterrence, descriptive studies, policy evaluation\n*Research Assistant, Cyber Policy Initiative, Technology and International Affairs Program, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Washington, DC, USA\nContact: thompsonr.natalie@gmail.com\nSpecial thanks go to my colleagues—especially Tim Maurer, George Perkovich, Jon Bateman, Ariel Levite, and Arthur Nelson—for supporting this research.

Cyberspace is also increasingly a domain of geopolitical conflict. State (and non-state) actors are acquiring offensive cyber capabilities and have demonstrated a willingness to use them—states have conducted at least 358 hostile cyber operations since 2005, more than half of which have occurred since 2017.\nThe increasing number of attacks puts pressure on governments to counter malicious cyber activity and to promote norms of responsible behavior in cyberspace. States have relied on a mix of diplomatic, informational, economic, and law enforcement options to respond to malicious cyber activity. Some refer to these tools as the DIME(LE) set of instruments available to states seeking to influence others’ behavior.,\nSanctions are part of a state’s arsenal. Both the United States and the European Union have created specific authorities for targeted financial sanctions in response to malicious cyber activity—referred to throughout this paper as “cyber sanctions.” The United States has imposed\n The Center for Strategic and International Studies maintains a list of significant cyberattacks that have occurred since 2006, and the Council on Foreign Relations maintains an interactive tracker of offensive cyber operations perpetrated by states. See: “Significant Cyber Incidents,” Center for Strategic and International Studies, last updated April 2020, https://www.csis.org/programs/technology-policy-program/significant-cyber-incidents; “Cyber Operations Tracker,” Council on Foreign Relations, https://www.cfr.org/interactive/cyber-operations.\n The Council on Foreign Relations uses the term “operations” to refer to 1) denial of service; 2) espionage; 3) data destruction; 4) defacement; 5) sabotage; 6) doxing; and 7) financial theft. See “Cyber Operations Tracker,” Council on Foreign Relations.\n Patryk Pawlak, Eneken Tikk, and Mika Kerttunen, “Cyber Conflict Uncoded,” European Union Institute for Security Studies, April 2020, https://www.iss.europa.eu/sites/default/files/EUISSFiles/Brief%207_Cyber.pdf.\n The DIME(LE) model is one method of categorizing these tools. A variety of others are used within the United States military to categorize and describe the operational environment; these include: 1) diplomatic, informational, military, and economic (DIME); 2) diplomatic, informational, military, economic, financial, intelligence, law enforcement (DIMEFIL); and 3) political, military, economic, social, informational, infrastructure (PMESII), among others.

For a discussion on this topic, see: Marco Benatar and Kristof Gombeer, “Cyber Sanctions: Exploring a Blind Spot in the Current Legal Debate,” European Society of International Law Conference Paper\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nsanctions in response to malicious cyber activity thirty-five times over the past decade, and the European Union and the United Kingdom imposed similar sanctions for the first time in July 2020 and again in October 2020.\nScholars have long debated the effectiveness of sanctions generally and their ability to achieve policy aims. To evaluate the efficacy of cyber sanctions, one must first articulate the goals of sanctions and what they might be useful for achieving. Once policymakers answer questions of effectiveness, they can then craft their use of sanctions to best address relevant threats in cyberspace.\nThe diversity of malicious behavior in cyberspace makes it difficult to identify a coherent logic for using sanctions. States conduct offensive cyber operations in service of political goals while criminals engage in hacking for profit—sometimes, the two occur alongside one another. The use of proxies in cyberspace complicates efforts to distinguish politically motivated and financially motivated attacks and obscures the relationship between state and non-state actors.\nFurther compounding the problem are questions related to the harms that should be included in the definition of “malicious cyber activity.” Narrow definitions of “cyberattack” use the term to\nSeries, Conference Paper No. 9/2011, May 1, 2011, https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1989786 and Zachary Goldman, “Cybersecurity and a New Era of Asymmetric Economic Warfare,” Just Security, January 16, 2015, https://www.justsecurity.org/19150/cybersecurity-era-asymmetric-economic-warfare/.\n Council Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/1125 of July 30, 2020, implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/796 concerning restrictive measures against cyber-attacks threatening the Union or its Member States, 2020 O.J.

But cyber tools can be used to engage in other wrongful behavior that falls outside of this framework. As a policy matter, the United States has used its cyber sanctions framework to punish behavior like election interference. Both the European Union and the United States have used human rights-related programs to respond to cyber-enabled human rights violations. As a result, this paper looks beyond sanctions frameworks meant explicitly to deal with malicious cyber activity and includes instances when additional horizontal frameworks have been used to respond to wrongful uses of information and communications technologies.\nThis paper seeks to provide an overview of targeted financial sanctions for countering malicious cyber activity in the United States and Europe and considerations regarding the tool’s effectiveness. Although policymakers often highlight deterrence and cost imposition as critical goals, both academic literature and policy documents point to difficulty measuring sanctions’ success at achieving these aims.\nThe continued reliance on the tool suggests that policymakers have other motivations for responding to malicious cyber activity with sanctions, regardless of whether sanctions are effective or whether their effectiveness can be measured.

Part outlines the definitional issues related to the scope of “malicious cyber activity” and what, therefore, constitutes a “cyber sanction.” It then provides an overview of the designations to date in the United States and Europe. Part two discusses how policymakers and academics evaluate sanctions’ effectiveness at achieving often-touted deterrence goals and specific considerations related to policy alternatives and long-term consequences. Policymakers cannot ignore the alternative instruments available to respond to malicious cyber activity in thinking about effectiveness and must weigh the trade-offs associated with alternative responses to cyberattacks. Finally, policymakers cannot ignore how firms and other states respond to and perceive the credibility of U.S. sanctions in the long-run—both as it relates to their imposition and removal (or lack thereof). They must consider the corresponding implications for the architecture of the global financial system and United States’ ability to weaponize its financial position. Part three then offers a categorization of the different purposes that sanctions can serve beyond deterrence. These purposes include attribution, information-sharing, audience satisfaction, cooperation with allies, norm development, punishment, and disruption of capabilities—all of which contribute cumulatively to the overarching goal of deterrence.\n## Defining “cyber sanctions”\n### What do sanctions entail?\nThe United States and EU’s cyber sanctions are targeted sanctions that differ from sanctions imposed during and before the 1990s. Comprehensive trade sanctions were a popular instrument of economic coercion throughout the 20th century, in part because they are less costly, less risky, and more palatable than military action. Targeted sanctions differ from comprehensive ones in coercive logic, the intended target, and the ultimate goal. Though similarly aimed at eliciting a change in state behavior, they focus on specific individuals and entities rather than the population at large. They assume that singling out individuals or groups will better “raise the target regime’s costs of noncompliance.” Targeted sanctions can also aim to change the\n Arne Tostensen and Beate Bull, “Are Smart Sanctions Feasible?” World Politics 53, no. 3 (April 2002): 380, 382.\n Daniel Drezner, “How Smart Are Smart Sanctions?” International Studies Review 5, no. 1 (March 2003): 107; see also Tostensen and Bull, “Are Smart Sanctions Feasible?” 380, 386; Thomas G.

Targeted sanctions are understood to have additional value for constraining and signaling. By “constraining,” these scholars refer to complicating an actor’s ability to engage in internationally wrongful behavior. By “signaling,” they refer to sending a message to the target, domestic audiences, and international audiences that expresses support for norms of appropriate behavior.\nOne type of targeted sanction, restrictive financial measures (also referred to as targeted financial sanctions), is increasingly the tool of choice for policymakers seeking to impose consequences for internationally wrongful behavior. Targeted financial sanctions include asset freezes, blocking transactions with designated individuals or entities, and denying access to capital markets. The tool relies on the preeminence of certain currencies and jurisdictions in global financial transactions. Big financial players like the United States, Europe, and, to a lesser extent, China can weaponize the financial system to prevent specific individuals or organizations from transacting in their respective currencies.

The United States, EU, and UK authorities relate principally to compromises in data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\nThese cyber-specific frameworks, however, do not tell the whole story. As early as 2011, the European Union sanctioned individuals and entities engaged in the surveillance and abuse of Iranian journalists and activists.

And the United States has used its cyber-specific framework and a different election interference framework to punish Russian cyber-enabled influence operators.\nThese Iran- and Russia-linked cases are somewhat ambiguous as to whether or not they constitute cyber-enabled harms that should be included in this paper. They do not fit neatly into the definition of cyberattack promulgated by the U.S. National Institute of Technology and Standards: “An attack, via cyberspace, targeting an enterprise’s use of cyberspace for the purpose of disrupting, disabling, destroying, or maliciously controlling a computing environment/infrastructure; or destroying the integrity of the data or stealing controlled information.” For example, monitoring dissidents or using social media to promote narratives online does not necessarily compromise data confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Still, the United States and Europe have considered them harmful enough uses of information and communications technologies to warrant punishment. For this reason, sanctions falling under the cyber-specific framework, as well as others related to cyber-enabled influence operations and human rights violations, are included within the scope of this paper.\n## “Cyber sanctions” to date\nWith these definitional concerns in mind, this section provides a brief overview of the cyber sanctions imposed to date in both the United States and Europe.\nExecutive Order 13694, which created the United States’ cyber-specific sanctions framework, “declare[d] a national emergency with respect to the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States posed by the increasing prevalence and severity of malicious cyber-enabled activities originating from or directed by, persons located, in whole or in substantial part, outside the United States.”\nSo far, the United States has imposed thirty-five tranches of sanctions related to malicious cyber activity under both the cyber-specific framework and other country-specific and horizontal\n For example, the EU sanctioned Abdolsamad Khoramabadi, head of the Committee to Determine Instances of Criminal Content, in March 2013, and the United States later imposed sanctions in May 2018.

These designations involve entities linked to Iran, North Korea, Russia, China, and Nigeria. The earliest designations, dating back to 2012 (made under an Executive Order on terrorism-related sanctions), dealt with Iranian government officials and entities participating in computer hacking projects with Hezbollah. Since then, the United States has sanctioned a range of cybercriminals and nation-state hackers. These include North Korean actors that participated in the 2014 hack of Sony Pictures, Russian actors engaged in cyber-enabled election interference, and Iranian actors targeting U.S. financial institutions. Since 2012, the United States has sanctioned over 250 individuals and entities for engaging in or enabling malicious cyber activity. (For a complete list of incidents, see Table 1.) The majority have been of Iranian, Russian, or North Korean origin. In the first half of 2020, however, the United States took action against two Chinese nationals for aiding Lazarus Group’s efforts to launder money, as well as six Nigerian individuals engaged in business email compromise and romance fraud scams.\nIn statements on the Executive Order, policymakers highlighted the “significant increase in the frequency, scale, and sophistication of cyber incidents targeting the American people” to justify its signing. Absent in many of these statements are clear articulations of how the administration would evaluate these sanctions’ effectiveness. In a blog post following the signing of the April 2015 Executive Order, White House counterterrorism advisor Lisa Monica explained that policymakers hoped to “deter” and “impose costs” on adversaries. But the specific means by which the U.S. Department of the Treasury would evaluate the program’s effectiveness remain unclear.

Though there were no initial designations, the program’s finalization came days before European Parliament elections, perhaps to signal the bloc’s ability to “move quickly to punish future attacks.” EU officials commenting on the newly created authority highlighted concern “at the rise of malicious behavior in cyberspace that aims at undermining the EU’s integrity, security and economic competitiveness, with the eventual risk of conflict.” Again, the Europeans highlight deterrence as a goal of cyber sanctions: High Representative Josep Borrell described the EU’s cyber sanctions as having been imposed “In order to better prevent, discourage, deter, and respond to such malicious behavior in cyberspace.”\nIn June 2020, the United Kingdom finalized its own cyber sanctions framework, “intended to deliver similar policy effects to that existing EU sanctions framework,” for when its transition period out of the European Union comes to an end at the start of 2021. Shortly thereafter, the High Representative of the European Union confirmed that EU candidate and potential candidate countries, members of the European Economic Area, Iceland, Norway, Ukraine, and Georgia would align themselves with these sanctions as well, bringing the total number of countries currently aligned with the EU’s sanctions framework to thirty-seven.\n Steven Mnuchin, “Department of the Treasury Budget Request for FY2021,” Hearing Before the Financial Services and General Government Subcommittee, March 4, 2020, at 1:31:14, https://appropriations.house.gov/events/hearings/department-of-the-treasury-budget-request-for-fy2021.\n Samuel Stolton, “EU backs cyber sanctions regime, following Dutch and UK pressure,” EURACTIV.com, last updated June 3, 2019, https://www.euractiv.com/section/cybersecurity/news/eu-backs-cyber-sanctions-regime-following-dutch-and-uk-pressure/; Adam Botek, “European Union establishes a sanction regime for cyber-attacks,” NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, https://ccdcoe.org/library/publications/european-union-establishes-a-sanction-regime-for-cyber-attacks/.\n “Days before elections, EU approves new cyber sanctions regime,” Reuters, May 17, 2019, https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-cyber/days-before-elections-eu-approves-new-cyber-sanctions-regime-idUSKCN1SN1FQ.\n Council of the EU, “Cyber-attacks: Council is now able to impose sanctions.”\n Council of the EU, “Declaration by the High Representative Josep Borrell on behalf of the EU: European Union response to promote international stability in cyberspace,” Press release, July 30, 2020, https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2020/07/30/declaration-by-the-high-representative-josep-borrell-on-behalf-of-the-eu-european-union-response-to-promote-international-security-and-stability-in-cyberspace/.\n Explanatory Memorandum to the Cyber (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations, 2020 No. 597, Government of the United Kingdom, https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/597/pdfs/uksiem_20200597_en.pdf.\n The Cyber (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020, UK Statutory Instruments.\n Council of the EU, “Declaration by the High Representative on behalf of the EU on the alignment of certain third countries concerning restrictive measures against cyber-attacks threatening the Union or its member states,” Press release, June 19, 2020, https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2020/06/19/declaration-by-the-\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nAt the end of July 2020, the EU took the critical step of imposing cyber sanctions for the first time on six individuals and three entities from North Korea, Russia, and China for orchestrating the WannaCry ransomware attack in 2017, attacks on financial institutions and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, and cyber-enabled economic espionage.

As Zachary Goldman and Damon McCoy have pointed out, “different kinds of malicious cyber activity demand different, tailored, deterrence strategies. This is because each category of cyber threat has a different motivation, and therefore will be sensitive to a different type of cost.”51 Nation-state hackers with political goals are unlikely to suffer the same consequences of a sanctions designation that independent cybercriminals with financial motivations will suffer. Similarly, designating a government official orchestrating an attack is unlikely to have the same impact as designating an individual two or three steps removed that launders money on behalf of a hacking group.\nTwo things complicate the effort to neatly distinguish between categories like cybercrime and nation-state activity and state and non-state actors. First, the convergence of financially-motivated cybercrime and nation-state activity makes it difficult to separate cyberattacks conducted for purely economic gain and those undertaken for political purposes.52 North Korean efforts to raise funds for its weapons of mass destruction program through cyber theft and ransom operations against financial institutions and cryptocurrency exchanges have demonstrated the difficulty of separating financial motivations from political goals.53 Similarly, state-sponsored economic espionage emanating from China blurs the distinction between financial and political aims as the theft of intellectual property aims to “support its strategic development goals—science and technology advancement, military modernization, and economic policy objectives.”54\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nSecond, the use of proxies for conducting offensive cyber operations often precludes a neat division between state and non-state actors in cyberspace. Tim Maurer’s comprehensive overview of the use of proxies for accomplishing offensive cyber operations details the spectrum of relationships between states and their proxies. These relationships range from overt delegation of activity to loose orchestration to passive enablement of proxy behavior. In the latter cases, those operating at a state’s behest may also have a foot in the criminal world. For example, in 2019, Treasury alleged that a Russian cybercriminal indicted and sanctioned for developing and distributing malware also operated on behalf of the Russian government, “highlighting the Russian government’s enlistment of cybercriminals for its own malicious purposes.”\n## Evaluating effectiveness\nIt is not within the remit of external observers to assess whether cyber sanctions effectively achieve deterrence. Much of the information needed to make such an assessment is classified or privately owned intelligence. Though Treasury publicly reports the value of transactions blocked under specific sanctions programs, others have pointed out that evaluating the success of cyber sanctions based on the financial value of prevented transactions is misleading. Therefore, it is difficult for policymakers to attribute any observed decrease in malicious cyber activity or change in activity to sanctions or determine whether activity levels would be even greater absent the threat of sanctions or imposition.\nWithin the U.S. government, Treasury’s Office of Intelligence and Analysis (OIA) and the State Department’s Bureau of Intelligence and Research perform impact assessments. According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), which published a review of U.S. sanctions programs and their effectiveness in 2019, “These assessments analyze the impacts of specific sanctions on a particular aspect of the sanction’s target—for example, the sanctions’ impact on the target country’s economy or trade.” OIA, for example, conducts impact assessments before a sanctions designation and after its imposition and may include factors like the target’s U.S.-\n Maurer, *Cyber Mercenaries*, 42-49.\n “Treasury Sanctions Evil Corp, the Russia-Based Cybercriminal Group Behind Dridex Malware,” U.S. Department of the Treasury, December 5, 2019, https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm845,\n Annie Fixler and Eric Lorber, “Counting Pennies Underestimates the Value of Treasury’s Cyber Sanctions,” Foundation for Defense of Democracies, November 4, 2019, https://www.fdd.org/analysis/2019/11/04/counting-pennies-underestimates-the-value-of-treasurys-cyber-sanctions/.\n Kimberly Gianopoulos, “Economic Sanctions: Agencies Assess Impacts on Targets, and Studies Suggest Several Factors Contribute to Sanctions’ Effectiveness,” U.S. Government Accountability Office, October 2019, 12, https://www.gao.gov/assets/710/701891.pdf.\n Ibid.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nbased assets, global holdings, and interactions with the United States and the potential cascading consequences of a sanctions designation.\nHowever, the report acknowledges that “these assessments do not analyze sanctions’ overall effectiveness in achieving broader U.S. policy goals or objectives, such as whether the sanctions are advancing the national security and policy priorities of the United States” (emphasis added). OIA distinguishes between impact and effect in its assessments:\nAccording to OIA officials, assessing impact is analyzing the potential or observed effect of the sanction on the target. According to officials, impact can be focused on a singular target or could be broader, such as the impact on the target country’s economy or trade flows. In contrast, OIA views effectiveness as the extent to which a sanctions program is achieving the overall broader policy goals of the sanctions program, such as ultimately altering or deterring specific behaviors of the target or furthering U.S. national security priorities [Emphasis added].\nThe latter considerations come into play during National Security Council-led interagency discussions: The process “allows the U.S. government to draw upon multiple agencies’ inputs and perspectives, and to consider these issues in the larger policy context, because sanctions are often only one element of broader government-wide strategies to achieve U.S. policy goals.”\nEven within government, assessing the effectiveness of sanctions at achieving broader policy goals like deterrence is difficult. GAO’s report highlights that policymakers have difficulty isolating sanctions’ effects from those of other policy tools, dealing with shifting policy objectives, and identifying useful data for conducting assessments.\nThe threat of sanctions raises an additional challenge for evaluating effectiveness. In at least one notable instance pertaining to Chinese cyber-enabled economic espionage, U.S. threats to impose sanctions may have contributed to the signing of a diplomatic agreement between then-\n Ibid., 13-14.\n Ibid., 12.\n Ibid.\n Ibid., 12.\n Ibid., 17-18.\n See, for example, Daniel Drezner’s work on selection bias in evaluations of sanctions programs, which suggests that sanctions are more effective than most analyses contend because they miss instances in which sanctions are threatened but not imposed: “in focusing only on those instances when sanctions have been imposed, policy analysts have overlooked the significant number of instances in which the threat of coercion did not have to be carried out.” Daniel Drezner, “The Hidden Hand of Economic Coercion,” International Organization 57, no. 3 (June 2003): 654-655, https://doi.org/10.1017/S0020818303573052.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\npresident Obama and President Xi. Reporting at the end of August 2015 suggested that the Obama administration was preparing a sanctions package against Chinese targets under the framework. Just weeks later, in September of that year, Obama and Xi met in Washington to announce a moratorium on the cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property for commercial advantage. In remarks on the deal, Obama alluded to the leverage created by the sanctions E.O. in stating, “I did indicate to President Xi that we will apply those and whatever other tools we have in our toolkit to go after cyber criminals, either retrospectively or prospectively.” And in the words of then-Assistant Attorney General John Carlin, “That changed China.” According to a report from the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, the number of detected Chinese cyberattacks diminished following the bilateral agreement. But the evidence of the deal’s success was not conclusive., One report from threat intelligence company FireEye highlighted that the number of attacks began dropping at least a year before the agreement. This case illustrates further the difficulty of isolating sanctions’ effects and evaluating the counterfactual of how adversaries might behave if not for the threat of sanctions.\nThe academic literature on the success of targeted financial sanctions is neither entirely optimistic nor conclusive. One estimate of UN targeted sanctions’ success rate suggests that targeted sanctions are effective just 22 percent of the time.

After surveying sanctions experts, they report, “A remarkable 27 out of 30 survey respondents – 90 percent – agreed with the contention that sanctions against state actors like Iran were more effective than sanctions against non-state actors like al Qaeda.”^[79]^ A recent review of the academic literature highlights the impact of sanctions on non-state actors as a gap in existing scholarship^[80]^—a fact particularly challenging for policymakers evaluating sanctions’ effectiveness against non-state and proxy cyber threats. Perhaps the most damning factor concerning the inconclusiveness of the academic literature is that even amongst academics “what counts as ‘effective’ (or ‘successful’) itself has been a contentious issue.”^[81]^\n## Factors for consideration\nStill, in trying to assess the effectiveness of cyber sanctions, policymakers should look at three key factors:\n(1) A target’s vulnerability to economic pressure,\n(2) The motivations underpinning offensive activity, and\n(3) How chosen targets support malicious activity.\n## Vulnerability to economic pressure\nDespite the lack of consensus regarding sanctions’ aims, those who have surveyed the academic literature note that a target’s vulnerability to economic pressure is critical for sanctions’ effectiveness. As one group of researchers put it, “the data suggest that the types of financial sanctions that have been deployed against states in the last two decades should have a greater\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nimpact on the decisionmaking [sic] of states for which attractiveness to international trade and investment is strategically significant.” In the cyber domain, this means that policymakers should pay attention to specific nation-state cyber threats that may be vulnerable to economic pressure. A sanction against an Iranian or North Korean government entity, for example, is unlikely to disrupt capabilities in the same way that a designation of a Russian entity might. U.S. sanctions have isolated Iran and North Korea from the global financial system, so additional targeted sanctions may be unlikely to significantly affect the ability to carry out future attacks or enjoy their proceeds. Indeed, these two actors have made the financial system the target of cyberattacks. However, actors elsewhere may be more exposed to the influence of the U.S. dollar or the euro in global financial markets and, therefore, more likely to pay attention to the punitive consequences of a sanction or have their capabilities disrupted as a result. For example, Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, alleged that his net worth dropped by 80 percent—over $7 billion—as a result of U.S. sanctions related to “a range of malign activity around the globe,” including malicious cyber activity, imposed in 2018.\n## Actors’ motivations\nThe motives underpinning malicious cyber activity also affect an actor's vulnerability to sanctions. As mentioned above, Goldman and McCoy have argued that sanctions are an appropriate policy tool for dealing with financially motivated cyber threats—like cyber-enabled economic espionage—because they undermine the goal of the activity: profit.

Still, the profit motive may make these actors more sensitive to sanctions than a politically motivated actor would be. Russian actors engaged in hack and leak operations or attacks on international organizations are not as likely to be dissuaded from engaging in their activity because sanctions have made it unprofitable if profitability was not necessarily a preeminent goal.\n## Means of supporting wrongful activity\nThe specific choice of target and whose behavioral change is the goal of sanctions are also likely to bear on how policymakers should evaluate effectiveness. Once policymakers have identified malicious activity, they can choose to go after several different targets, including the state actors that directed, orchestrated, or enabled the attack; the individuals directly engaged in the attack; or those that provide material, financial, or technological support for the attack. Again, these actors are not equally vulnerable to the effects of sanctions. Government officials that enjoy the backing and protection of the state may be less likely to be deterred than those whose legitimate commercial interests are at stake by aiding targets in circumventing sanctions. As one group of researchers at the Center for a New American Security put it, “To the extent that sanctions on non-state actors are focused on coercing a change in behavior, that strategy may have the greatest impact on the ecosystem of actual and would-be supporters of those groups, rather than on the groups themselves.” Simultaneously, sanctions can go after a specific target to change a third party’s behavior—returning to the Deripaska example described above, sanctioning Russian oligarchs was partly meant to signal to the Russian state that its conduct was unacceptable and leverage elite pain for behavioral change.\n## Effectiveness as opposed to what?\nEvaluating the impacts of sanctions cannot ignore the alternative instruments available to states\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n John Carlin, “Detect, Disrupt, Deter: A Whole-of-Government Approach to National Security Cyber Threats,” *Harvard National Security Journal* 7, (2016): 420, https://harvardnsj.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2016/06/Carlin-FINAL.pdf.\n The impact of sanctions on an adversary’s risk calculus could potentially backfire if financially motivated actors are deterred from engaging in the lowest levels of criminal activity, which may generate profits incommensurate with the absorbed risk, but continue to engage in highly profitable but extremely destabilizing attacks.\n Rosenberg, et al., “The New Tools of Economic Warfare,” 28.\n “Treasury Designates Russian Oligarchs, Officials, and Entities in Response to Worldwide Malign Activity,” U.S. Department of the Treasury.\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nseeking to respond to wrongful behavior in cyberspace. This paper situates sanctions within the DIME(LE) framework to highlight the point that policymakers face the choice not of sanctioning or doing nothing but of sanctioning or releasing a diplomatic statement or responding with a retaliatory cyberattack or of doing nothing or of doing several of these. In the U.S. context, in particular, policymakers have adopted a “whole-of-government” approach to countering malicious cyber activity—in essence, one that involves all of the tools of statecraft outlined in the DIME(LE)., As a result, sanctions have frequently followed criminal charges against malicious cyber actors. Sixteen of the thirty-five instances in which the United States imposed cyber sanctions were preceded by an indictment of at least one of the sanctioned individuals—providing useful context for understanding the range of available tools for imposing costs on malicious cyber actors.\nWhere effectiveness is concerned, sanctions, in theory, may have more “teeth” than indictments because their enforcement does not rely on an actor setting foot in a country with which a state pursuing charges has an extradition treaty. As others have noted, the U.S. strategy of charging foreign-linked hackers is unlikely to result in many hackers ever appearing in U.S. courts. However, there have been some important exceptions. Three members of the FIN7 cybercrime group were arrested in Spain in 2018, two of which have been extradited, and in May 2020, authorities arrested another member of the organization in Seattle.\nJack Goldsmith and Robert Williams have questioned whether the public attribution of cyberattacks through criminal charges is counterproductive.

Indictments against foreign hackers are not themselves political tools, but the decision to unseal an indictment can be. See Garrett Hinck and Tim Maurer, “Persistent enforcement: Criminal Charges as a Response to Nation-State Malicious Cyber Activity,” *Journal of National Security Law and Policy* 10, no. 3 (2020): 535, https://jnslp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Criminal-Charges-as-a-Response-to-Nation-State-Malicious-Cyber-Activity.pdf.\n John Carlin, “Detect, Disrupt, Deter,” 394.\n Ibid., 527.\n Office of Public Affairs, “Three Members of Notorious International Cybercrime Group ‘Fin7’ In Custody for Role in Attacking Over 100 U.S. Companies,” U.S. Department of Justice, August 1, 2018, https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/three-members-notorious-international-cybercrime-group-fin7-custody-role-attacking-over-100; Jeff Stone, “Alleged FIN7 hacking director Andrii Kolpakov set to be extradited to the U.S.,” Cyberscoop, May 9, 2019, https://www.cyberscoop.com/fin7-andrii-kolpakov-extradition-spain/.\n Shannon Vavra, “Federal officials have arrested another accused FIN7 hacker,” Cyberscoop, May 26, 2020, https://www.cyberscoop.com/fin7-hacking-arrest-financial/.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\npunish them, the main signal to adversaries (especially third parties who are watching) is that the United States is extraordinarily defenseless.” Sanctions, by contrast, create real financial consequences for malicious actors by relying on the preeminence of the U.S. dollar and the euro in global financial transactions. Sanctions are enforced not by the U.S. government or EU alone but by financial institutions that risk exposing themselves to secondary sanctions. As a result, they may better demonstrate the costs of engaging in wrongful behavior and, therefore, deter adversaries.\nSanctions, however, face limitations. Sophisticated actors can identify ways to evade sanctions, sometimes through cyberattacks. Last fall, a United Nations panel of experts report detailed North Korea’s efforts to circumvent sanctions and raise money for its weapons of mass destruction program by attacking the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) and cryptocurrency exchanges, executing ransomware attacks, and mining cryptocurrency., The risk of evasion poses a threat to the efficacy of targeted financial sanctions as it “undermines the credibility of the senders, because the inability to implement and enforce the measures is often interpreted as signaling the lack of power of the sender.” And in the longer-term, actors may be compelled to seek alternate financial architectures to avoid the hassle of evading sanctions.\nThe broader point of comparing sanctions and indictments is that sanctions are just one of the tools that governments can employ against malicious cyber actors.

In the U.S. context, the NSC-led interagency process provides a forum for discussing the effectiveness of sanctions relative to other policy instruments. But as with academic literature on the efficacy of sanctions on non-state actors, Dursun Peksen argues that scholarly work on the utility of sanctions relative to other policy instruments is similarly lacking.\nNonetheless, as policymakers impose sanctions, they must consider the potential escalatory consequences and how alternative policy instruments might compare. Rosenberg and Tama highlight the need to better assess where sanctions sit on the escalation ladder to strengthen their signaling value and ensure that efforts at cross-domain deterrence do not inadvertently compromise broader foreign policy objectives. As they put it, “if it is unclear whether an airstrike against a military facility is higher or lower on the escalation ladder than financial sanctions targeting a country’s most important economic sector, the target government may not understand the likely consequences of continuing to flout an international norm or U.S. demands.”\nCompared to actions like diplomatic statements, sanctions may be perceived as more escalatory since they aim to impose real financial costs and disrupt an operations’ financing. But in comparison to retaliatory cyberattacks or other military action, they may be less escalatory because their contours are narrowly defined, and policymakers can couple sanctions with clear statements of intention. The EU’s sanctions, which refrain from attributing responsibility for an attack to a specific state, may be less escalatory than those imposed by the United States, which, as described above, can and sometimes do allege state responsibility for wrongful behavior.\nIf adversaries see sanctions as escalatory, they may retaliate. Sanctions have generated such retaliation: Iran retaliated for U.S. sanctions with cyberattacks against the financial system.

(Perhaps somewhat counterproductively, Iran’s cyberattacks invited further sanctions.)\n## Long-term effectiveness\nThe point raised above about sanctions evasion speaks to a broader concern about how the effectiveness of sanctions might change over time, potentially providing either diminishing returns or jeopardizing the United States’ ability to pursue its policy goals. As Peter Feaver and Eric Lorber have put it, targeted financial sanctions rely on calculations about business risk, and “If global business conditions change, the firms might re-calculate that engaging in financial transactions with those targeted states outweighs the costs.” This risk of such re-calculation may be heightened if sanctions create incentives for businesses to pursue transactions in other currencies or for countries to develop alternative financial architectures.\nThese concerns—and consideration of cyber sanctions generally—cannot be divorced from the broader context in which the United States has aggressively pursued the use of sanctions to achieve a range of foreign policy goals, sometimes to the detriment of ally relationships. Two particular issues are worth highlighting: 1) the credibility of sanctions commitments and 2) the use of secondary sanctions.\nThe credibility of broader sanctions commitments matters for evaluating the effectiveness of cyber sanctions at deterrence. Elizabeth Rosenberg and Jordan Tama have noted that sanctions’ effectiveness depends on the credibility of both the threat to designate targets for wrongful behavior and the promise to lift sanctions if behavior changes. The United States’ withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) illustrates how failure to do the latter can undermine broader foreign policy goals. As Rosenberg and Tama write, “By walking away from\n Ellen Nakashima, “Iran blamed for cyberattacks on U.S. banks and companies,” *Washington Post*, September 21, 2012, https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/iran-blamed-for-cyberattacks/2012/09/21/afbe2be4-0412-11e2-9b24-ff730c7f6312_story.html; Neil MacFarquhar, “Putin, Responding to Sanctions, Orders U.S. to Cut Diplomatic Staff by 755,” *New York Times*, July 30, 2017, https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/30/world/europe/russia-sanctions-us-diplomats-expelled.html\n “Treasury Targets Supporters of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Networks Responsible for Cyber-Attacks Against the United States,” U.S. Department of the Treasury.\n Peter Feaver and Eric Lorber, “Coercive Diplomacy and the New Financial Levers: Evaluating the Intended and Unintended Consequences of Financial Sanctions,” *Legatum Institute*, November 2010, 44, https://lif.blob.core.windows.net/lif/docs/default-source/publications/2010-publications-coercive-diplomacy.pdf?Status=Temp&amp;sfvrsn=2.\n Ibid., 46-47.\n I thank Allison Peters and Ariel (Eli) Levite for highlighting these important points.\n Rosenberg and Tama, “Strengthening the Economic Arsenal,” 5.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nthose allies and partners, the United States has made them less inclined to privilege cooperation in the future.”\nIn the U.S. context, the two-pronged approach to creating new sanctions frameworks further complicates the delisting process. Legal authorities in the United States for imposing sanctions can be created through executive or legislative means. U.S. sanctions remain in place until a target appeals to OFAC and demonstrates a change in behavior that warrants delisting (and the burden is on designated individuals and entities to present a basis for delisting) or until Congress votes to lift the sanctions. Congressionally mandated sanctions provide an essential check on executive action to impose sanctions unilaterally. But if Congress refuses to lift sanctions in response to behavioral change, they undermine the tool’s credibility. (By contrast to U.S. sanctions, EU sanctions are reviewed annually. In some ways, this may enhance the instrument’s credibility.)\nEfforts to understand the effectiveness of the United States’ cyber sanctions must also contend with the legislative authorities that provide for secondary sanctions. Secondary sanctions refer to “the threat of US sanctions against foreign individuals and entities for engaging in specified activities that may not have a US nexus.” In the context of cyber sanctions, these include provisions enshrined within CAATSA for imposing sanctions against individuals and entities that engage in “significant transactions” with certain Russian government entities and their personnel. Secondary sanctions are different from provisions that allow governments to target those that provide “technical, financial, or material support” to previously designated actors. As others have pointed out, both the U.S. and EU authorities accept that sanctions are more effective when targeting an adversary’s network. Instead, secondary sanctions target those that continue to do business with a sanctioned entity, whether based in the United States or not.\n Ibid., 6.\n “Filing a Petition for Removal from an OFAC List,” U.S. Department of the Treasury, last updated May 2, 2017, https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/petitions.aspx.\n Council of the EU, “Adoption and review procedure for EU sanctions,” last reviewed February 14, 2019, https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/sanctions/adoption-review-procedure/.\n Samantha Sultoon and Justine Walker, “Secondary Sanctions’ Implications and the Transatlantic Relationship,” Atlantic Council, September 2019, 3, https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SecondarySanctions_Final.pdf.\n These include “the defense or intelligence sectors of the Government of the Russian Federation, including the Main Intelligence Agency of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation or the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation.” Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act of 2017, Public Law 115-44, U.S. Statutes at Large (2017), https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/hr3364_pl115-44.pdf.\n Ibid.\n Sultoon and Walker, “Secondary Sanctions’ Implications and the Transatlantic Relationship,” 4.\n\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nTo date, the United States has not imposed cyber-related secondary sanctions under CAATSA, but the legislation permitting secondary sanctions and their potential ramifications for EU projects has attracted criticism from the bloc. Because of U.S. withdrawal from the JCPOA, some EU members have signed on to the Instrument in Support of Trade Exchanges (INSTEX), a special purpose vehicle that “circumvents the traditional financial networks the US uses to establish its jurisdiction for enforcing sanctions,” to conduct business with Iranian entities.\nParticularly as European entities become subject to secondary U.S. sanctions and must find alternative payment systems, other countries face incentives to create alternative global financial architectures that erode the United States’ long-term power in the global economic system. Countries like Russia, China, and even India, are interested in an alternative financial messaging system to SWIFT, but these have yet to catch on and face important limitations.\nSome have pointed out that “Multinational businesses seeking to avoid exposure to U.S. and EU sanctions can find refuge in the yuan and Chinese financial platforms.” China’s “efforts to promote the yuan as a global currency and establish alternatives to the dollar- and euro-dominated international financial system” may heighten the associated risks. Many are quick to point out that China faces several obstacles to achieving such a goal. Still, as former senior Treasury adviser Elizabeth Rosenberg points out, “sanctions do give China’s economic ambitions an undeniable boost.” Especially as financial technologies—like cryptocurrencies—introduce new ways for criminals to launder money, the continued use of sanctions may\n “Russia sanctions: EU vows to retaliate over US measures,” BBC, July 26, 2017, https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40727044; Paul Ivan, “The US and the EU need a stronger dialogue on Russia,” European Policy Centre, May 2, 2018, https://www.epc.eu/en/Publications/The-US-and-the-EU-need-a-stronger-dialogue-on-Russia-sanctions~1e70f8; Karen DeYoung, “Three European allies ask U.S. not to enforce secondary sanctions over Iran trade,” Washington Post, June 6, 2018, https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/three-european-allies-ask-us-not-to-enforce-secondary-sanctions-over-iran-trade/2018/06/06/f4c94594-69c3-11e8-bea7-c8eb28bc52b1_story.html.\n Ellie Geranmayeh and Manuel Lafont Rapnouil, “Meeting the Challenge of Secondary Sanctions,” European Council on Foreign Relations, June 2019, 4, 7, https://www.ecfr.eu/publications/summary/meeting_the_challenge_of_secondary_sanctions.\n Drezner, “Targeted Sanctions in a World of Global Finance,” 760-761.\n Jignesh Davda, “China, Russia &amp; India Push Forward on SWIFT Alternative,” Yahoo!

The potential backlash to Washington’s gung-ho attitude toward financial sanctions may occur on a longer time horizon but carries arguably more significant consequence for U.S. global power.\nThe potential consequences mean that policymakers evaluating the effectiveness of cyber sanctions at deterring wrongful behavior must also consider the long-term trajectory of the tool’s use and how decisions within the broader foreign policy context affect the reception of sanctions.\n## Moving beyond deterrence\nA general emphasis on deterrence obscures the variety of different functions that sanctions can perform and the diversity of motives underpinning malicious cyber activity. Few, if any, policymakers would argue that the outright cessation of malicious cyber activity is a realistic goal that could be achieved by targeted financial sanctions. Given that some, like North Korea, pursue cybercrime as a means of sanctions evasion, one might even argue that sanctions are counterproductive if the goal is understood to stop malicious cyber activity.^[130]^ As described above, the academic and policy literature on the effectiveness of cyber sanctions at deterrence is difficult to measure. So why do policymakers continue to employ sanctions in the seeming absence of compelling evidence about their effectiveness?\nThe academic literature on targeted sanctions has attempted to account for some of the different aims of sanctions and the diverse threats they can target by introducing three potential purposes—constraint, coercion, and signaling.^[131]^ Even these, however, ignore the nuanced and specific purposes for imposing sanctions in response to malicious cyber activity. To say that a sanctions designation aims to “signal,” for example, ignores important features of the message itself, its intended audience, and its contribution to the broader goal of sending a message by sanctioning.\nOthers divide the purposes of sanctions into “symbolic” or “expressive” and “instrumental” ones.^[132]^ Symbolic or expressive purposes relate to the political interests served by doing something in response to wrongful behavior—i.e., signaling. Instrumental objectives relate to desired policy or behavior changes—i.e., coercion and constraint.\n^[130]^ Elizabeth Rosenberg and Neil Bhatiya, “Busting North Korea’s Sanctions Evasion,” Center for a New American Security, March 4, 2020, https://www.cnas.org/publications/commentary/busting-north-koreas-sanctions-evasion.\n^[131]^ Giumelli, *How EU sanctions work*, 18-19.\n^[132]^ Taehee Whang, “Playing to the Home Crowd?

Ascertaining responsibility is a complicated matter. The degree to which a state might be responsible for malicious activity varies from an inability to prevent malicious attacks to active participation in an attack.\nSanctions designations are public listings that name individuals or entities in response to malicious behavior. As Kristen Eichensehr has argued, they can attribute wrongful conduct by naming the individual or entity that directly perpetrated a cyberattack or indicating state responsibility for an attack.\nThis is not always the case. Because targets can be sanctioned for materially, financially, or technologically enabling a previously designated actor, they do not always publicize attribution in the sense of identifying hackers. And because ascertaining the nature of the relationship between a state and a hacker can be difficult, not all sanctions allege that a state enabled or orchestrated wrongful behavior in cyberspace.\nBut in some cases, sanctions do serve to implicate a state in malicious cyber activity. For example, in September 2019, the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) named Lazarus\n Hinck and Maurer, “Persistent enforcement,” 531-534.\n Herb Lin, “Attribution of Malicious Cyber Incidents,” Aegis Paper Series No. 1607, Hoover Institution, n.d., 5, https://www.hoover.org/sites/default/files/research/docs/lin_webready.pdf.\n Herb Lin draws on Jason Healey’s piece, “Beyond Attribution: Seeking National Responsibility for Cyber Attacks,” in outlining the different degrees of responsibility; Ibid., 18.

Within the EU, attribution is a “sovereign political decision” left up to each member state’s discretion. As a result, EU sanctions designations avoid making a specific link between a designated individual or entity and a state sponsor, even when, as in the case of the July 2020 Russian targets, some of the listed individuals may work on behalf of government agencies or may be government agencies themselves., Though attribution is also a sovereign political decision in the United States, the process is more straightforward—there is no need to wrangle the agreement of twenty-seven member states to attribute.\nIndependent of the political reasons for (not) attributing a cyberattack, not all jurisdictions are equally competent in their ability to attribute. States differ in their ability to identify technical and political indicators of compromise and use signals, human, and open-source intelligence to understand them. As one RAND Corporation report put it, “These capabilities may not be widespread globally, and very few countries are thought to possess sophisticated all-source capabilities.”\n## Information-sharing\nThe press releases that accompany sanctions designations sometimes contain important information about how malicious actors carry out their attacks. Though formal information-sharing mechanisms exist in both the United States and the European Union, many involve a\n “Treasury Sanctions North Korean State-Sponsored Malicious Cyber Groups,” U.S. Department of the Treasury.\n Botek, “European Union establishes a sanction regime for cyber-attacks.”\n Council Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/1125 of July 30, 2020, O.J.

To be attributable to that state, the operation must have been carried out by one of its organs or by another actor acting on its behalf. A cyber operation attributable to a state may constitute an internationally wrongful act if it violates a norm of international law.” See Patryk Pawlak, Thomas Biersteker, and François Delerue, *Guardian of the galaxy: EU cyber sanctions and norms in cyberspace*, eds.

In the United States, for example, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) Exchange is a Treasury-led “voluntary public-private information sharing partnership among law enforcement, financial institutions, and FinCEN aimed at effectively and efficiently combating money laundering, terrorism financing, organized crime, and other financial crimes; protecting the financial system from illicit use; and promoting national security.” Additionally, the Bank Secrecy Act Advisory Group (BSAAG) is “the means by which Treasury receives advice on the operations of the Bank Secrecy Act,” a key piece of U.S. law regarding money laundering. Made of up representatives from federal agencies, financial institutions, and trade groups, BSAAG is chaired by the FinCEN director. Though these mechanisms are essential means of sharing information, the participating institutions and representatives are limited.\nHowever, public press releases can garner the attention of a broader set of stakeholders with sanctions compliance obligations and can aid in disseminating information related to cyber threats. For example, the United States’ designation of Nigerian cybercriminals contained details of how Richard Uzuh and his co-conspirators spoofed emails from business executives to trick Americans into wiring money.\n## Audience satisfaction\nSanctions may satisfy the political pressure to “do something” in response to malicious cyber activity. As Richard Hanania has argued, sanctions have a significant political purpose insofar as they “appear to be a moderate and measured response to unacceptable behavior abroad.” And they are a safe option for policymakers because the targets—foreign publics—cannot easily influence American politics (i.e., vote), and, therefore, “there is little reason to suspect that their\n Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, “FinCEN Exchange Questions and Answers,” U.S. Department of the Treasury, https://www.fincen.gov/index.php/resources/fincen-exchange/fincen-exchange-frequently-asked-questions.\n U.S. Department of the Treasury, Notice, “Financial Crimes Enforcement Network; Bank Secrecy Act Advisory Group; Solicitation of Application for Membership,” *Federal Register* 83, no. 248 (December 28, 2018): 67487, https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2018-12-28/pdf/2018-28178.pdf.\n Ibid.\n “Treasury Sanctions Nigerian Cyber Actors for Targeting U.S. Businesses and Individuals,” U.S. Department of the Treasury.\n William Kaempfer and Anton Lowenberg, “The Political Economy of Economic Sanctions,” in *Handbook of Defense Economics, Volume 2*, ed.

From the perspective of companies, it may help redirect blame from the company for failing to prevent a cyberattack.\nSanctions may also satisfy international audiences that want to see governments respond to malicious cyber activity. In some cases, sanctions are met with laudatory statements from allied governments. For example, the United States released such a message when the European Union imposed cyber sanctions for the first time in July 2020.\n## Cooperation with allies\nGiven that both the United States and European Union have legal frameworks to impose sanctions against malicious cyber actors, there is a potential cooperative dimension to the policy. Some have suggested that sanctions work better when there are concerted efforts among states to restrict an actor’s capabilities and deny its action’s benefits because it limits the actor’s ability to mitigate losses in other markets. Even without cooperative effort, sanctions can signal to members of the international community a shared commitment to reducing malicious activity. Where the cyber context is concerned, European action can have a particularly important signaling function given, as a former State Department official put it, the fact that actors like Russia and China are increasingly writing off signaling from the United States.\nThe U.S. and EU legal authorities are mostly similar, heightening the potential cooperative dimension. At their cores, both offer the ability to impose sanctions on individuals and entities that disrupt the confidentiality, availability, or integrity of data or the functioning of computer systems that support critical infrastructure or governmental services. And so far, U.S. and EU\n Ibid.\n Hinck and Maurer, “Persistent enforcement,” 531.\n Ibid.\n Michael Pompeo, “The United States Applauds the EU’s Action on Cyber Sanctions,” U.S. Department of State, Press release, July 30, 2020, https://www.state.gov/the-united-states-applauds-the-eus-action-on-cyber-sanctions/.\n Dursun Peksen, “When Do Economic Sanctions Work Best?” Center for a New American Security, June 10, 2019, https://www.cnas.org/publications/commentary/when-do-economic-sanctions-work-best.\n I thank a former U.S. Department of State official for making this observation.\n\ndesignations have largely overlapped: the United States has previously sanctioned six of the nine targets from the EU’s initial July 2020 listing.\n## Norm development\nBy clearly delineating unacceptable harms and imposing costs against those who perpetrate them, sanctions can underscore the importance of internationally recognized norms. Imposing sanctions in concert with like-minded nations further strengthens the norm development function. Having multiple states commit to punishing a malicious actor reinforces the wrongfulness of the act in question and helps establish what constitutes an appropriate state response to such wrongful behavior.\nIn his statement following the EU’s first cyber sanctions, High Representative Josep Borrell explicitly referenced commitment to implementing the norms developed by the UN Group of Government Experts’ (UNGGE) 2010, 2013, and 2015 reports and to continued cooperation the ongoing UNGGE and Open-Ended Working Group.\n## Punishment of malicious actors\nBy blocking transactions and freezing malicious cyber actors’ assets, policymakers demonstrate that engaging in offensive behavior has real financial consequences. Because many cyberattacks are financially motivated, sanctions deny the benefits of an actor’s behavior by making it more difficult to access and move money.\nGoldman has argued that targeted financial sanctions play a vital role in the broader effort to deter financially motivated cybercrime—especially cyber-enabled economic espionage—by “drying up the market for stolen data.” Since the United States’ sanctions framework allows for the designation of not just those who steal intellectual property but also those who benefit\n “Treasury Targets Russian Operatives over Election Interference, World Anti-Doping Agency Hacking, and Other Malign Activities,” U.S. Department of the Treasury; U.S. President, “Taking Additional Steps to Address the National Emergency With Respect to Significant Malicious Cyber-Enabled Activities,” 3; “Treasury Targets North Korea for Multiple Cyber-Attacks,” U.S. Department of the Treasury; Council Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/1125 of July 30, 2020, O.J.

By freezing assets and blocking transactions, sanctions can disrupt the financing of an offensive cyber operation. In theory, they can also disrupt a state’s ability to recruit the talent necessary to carry out a sophisticated operation—the exposure of a hacker’s identity and the financial punishment may dissuade would-be hackers from serving as a proxy.\nSanctions against terrorist financiers are an important precedent in this respect. In 2001, then-president George W. Bush signed Executive Order 13224 to allow for the imposition of sanctions against those determined “To assist in, sponsor, or provide financial, material, or technological support for, or financial or other services in support of, acts of terrorism.” According to Juan Zarate, a former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes, the use of sanctions against terrorist organizations led to the development of additional horizontal sanctions programs to deal with behavior-based national security threats—like cyber threats. The logic of going after financing networks and enablers is simple: As Zachary Goldman has put it, “Entities like drug trafficking networks, terrorist groups, and proliferation facilitators require substantial streams of funding and access to the global financial system, to remain effective. The more time and resources they spend trying to fund an organization, the less time spent planning attacks or engaging in other illicit activity.”\n## Deterrence\nThrough the previously listed means, sanctions may aspire to a deterrent function that seeks to change state actors’ long-term behavior in cyberspace. The repeated imposition of sanctions may introduce sustained friction in the relationship between the proxy and the state that changes the state’s overall calculus about how and when to engage in malicious cyber activity. Over time, this may lead to a change in the nature of the state’s relationship with its proxies and the degree of risk it is willing to accept when engaging in offensive cyber operations. By punishing\n U.S. President, “Blocking the Property of Certain Persons Engaging in Significant Malicious Cyber-Enabled Activities,” 18077.\n Bureau of Counterterrorism, “Executive Order 13224,” U.S. Department of State, https://www.state.gov/executive-order-13224/.\n I thank former Assistant Secretary Zarate for highlighting this historical context.\n Zachary Goldman, “Cybersecurity and a New Era of Asymmetric Economic Warfare.”\n\ncountries that engage in offensive activity and demonstrating the international community’s support for this behavior, states can aim to increase the effort, raise the risk, and reduce offensive cyber actors’ rewards.\nDespite the difficulty, even for policymakers, of evaluating sanctions’ success at deterrence, they remain a tool often used for responding to malicious activity. Therefore, our understanding of the impact of sanctions must go beyond the deterrent function and consider the additional symbolic purposes outlined above and the factors that might also impact how symbolic goals are achieved. Table 2 summarizes questions policymakers might consider in evaluating the effectiveness of sanctions at achieving the variety of purposes set forward in this section and the considerations for assessing deterrence outlined in the previous section.\nTable 2. Questions for evaluating effectiveness\n|  Function | Questions  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  Attribution | • Do the statements accompanying a sanctions designation claim that the named entities perpetrated a cyberattack itself?\n• Do the statements accompanying a sanctions designation allege state responsibility for wrongful behavior in cyberspace?\n• Have other policies or legal action (i.e., indictments) made similar attribution claims?  |\n|  Information-sharing | • Do private sector entities pay attention to sanctions notices more than other vehicles for information-sharing about cyber threats?\n• Do the statements accompanying a sanctions designation contain meaningful information about the tactics, techniques, and procedures employed by malicious actors that external stakeholders could use to fortify their networks?  |\n|  Audience satisfaction | • Do actors in the private sector or civil society find sanctions a meaningful and appropriate response to malicious activity?\n• Do allies release diplomatic statements affirming the appropriateness of the action?  |\n|  Cooperation with allies | • Do (or could) other jurisdictions impose sanctions against the same targets?\n• Do other countries release diplomatic statements affirming the appropriateness of the action?  |\n|  Norm development | • Does the offense that prompted sanction violate an established norm of responsible behavior in cyberspace?  |\n Joseph Nye, Jr., “Deterrence and Dissuasion in Cyberspace,” *International Security* 41, no. 3 (Winter 2016/17): 56, https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/ISEC_a_00266.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\n- Have other countries or jurisdictions signaled that sanctions are the appropriate response to this type of norm violation?\n## Punishment\n- How exposed is the individual or entity to the U.S. dollar or the euro’s impact in global financial markets?\n- What is the monetary value of the transactions blocked or assets frozen as a result of the sanction?\n- Do opportunities exist for a designated actor to protect their assets or recoup their losses?\n## Disruption of capabilities\n- Do sanctions disrupt an actor’s ability to procure material, financial, or technological resources necessary to carry out malicious activity?\n- How do sanctions affect the willingness of proxies to engage with state sponsors of malicious cyber activity?\n- Do opportunities exist for actors to circumvent sanctions or mitigate their impact by using alternative financial architectures?\n## Deterrence\n- Over time, does the nature of a particular actor’s behavior in cyberspace change?\n- Do sanctions change the risk-calculus of those engaged in malicious cyber activity?\n- Over time, does the nature of malicious cyber activity in general change?\n## General\n- How might adversaries respond or retaliate to sanctions? What is the likelihood of the target engaging in retaliation, and what would the consequences of retaliation be?\n- Are the costs absorbed by the sender of sanctions proportionate to the costs imposed on targets?\n- What alternative policy options are available, and how do the effects of these tools compare to those of sanctions?\n- What might the long-term consequences be for the architecture of the global financial system?\nHaving discussed the eight purposes sanctions may seek to serve, the operational question remains whether policymakers clearly articulate these objectives and how they measure sanctions’ effectiveness at achieving any of these goals. Not all of the potential purposes of cyber sanctions writ large will be served by a single designation, nor should they be. Policymakers’ goals differ with respect to the variety of cyber threats. The aim of preventing low-level cybercrime like business email compromise scams is different from seeking to encourage states to rein in their proxies when conducting offensive cyber operations.\nNo matter which goals policymakers have in mind with a sanctions designation, they should keep in mind the considerations outlined above pertaining to alternative policy instruments and long-term consequences. Take, for example, the goal of audience satisfaction and the pressure to “do something” in response to malicious cyber activity: Escalation can undermine audience\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nsatisfaction if a greater number of private sector entities become the victims of cyberattacks in response to sanctions. And the repeated imposition of sanctions may have diminishing returns as far as satisfying audiences—if policymakers describe sanctions in deterrence terms, domestic audiences may be satisfied initially, but the continuation of activity may be interpreted as a sign of failure and lend itself to disappointment.\nThis section has outlined seven purposes in addition to deterrence that policymakers may have in mind when employing sanctions against malicious cyber actors. It is difficult to say whether sanctions deter. But despite the emphasis on deterrence in policy statements, sanctions can have important symbolic purposes that should factor into evaluations of sanctions programs.\n# Conclusion\nThe definitional issues highlighted at the beginning of this paper related to what constitutes malicious cyber activity and should be included within this paper’s scope and the variety of aims of sanctions can raise a question about whether it makes sense to speak of a country or jurisdiction’s “cyber policy” or consider cyber issues a facet of a broader foreign policy. Future research in this area should address how policy should deal with the distinction between “cyber” as a threat itself and as a means for accomplishing other ends like intelligence collection, economic competition, or control over domestic political spaces. The United States’ use, in particular, of a variety of different legal instruments—not just the cyber-specific sanctions framework—highlights the fact that cybercrime and national security threats require a variety of flexible tools. More clearly delineating how and why cyber activity crosses a line of acceptability is crucial to promoting responsible behavior in cyberspace and identifying appropriate mechanisms for responding to harms.\nMore empirical research is also needed in this area. Much of the academic literature on sanctions focuses on those levied against states and deals insufficiently with the success of sanctions against nonstate and proxy actors. $^{166}$ As transnational threats multiply and policymakers reach for sanctions in response, they should have a clear evidence base supporting their decision making.\nThough policymakers often emphasize the goal of deterrence, articulation of the considerations for evaluating the effectiveness of sanctions is scant, even among government actors with access to the full array of intelligence necessary to make such evaluations. Policymakers should consider a target’s vulnerability to economic pressure, actors’ motivations, and the role that\n$^{166}$ Peksen, “When Do Imposed Economic Sanctions Work?,” 7-8.\n\ntargets play in wrongful behavior in seeking to evaluate the likely outcomes of a sanctions designation and its effectiveness. Furthermore, questions of effectiveness also require attention to alternative policy options and long-term consequences.\nMoving beyond deterrence and cost imposition, the diversity of actors against which policymakers impose sanctions requires more nuanced thinking. In the absence of clear frameworks for evaluating effectiveness and relative pessimism about sanctions’ effectiveness, policymakers continue to reach for the tool. Therefore, our understanding of the purposes of sanctions should account for functions like attribution, information-sharing, audience satisfaction, cooperation with allies, norm development, and punishment.\nDespite being hailed as ineffective by academic scholars, policymakers continue to employ sanctions. Data collected by the Center for a New American Security shows that the current U.S. administration is more than willing to sanction adversaries. Even though 2019 saw the fewest designations during the current administration, the yearly total was still more than those of any single year under the previous administration. And the EU’s recent implementation of its cyber sanctions framework for the first time indicates that neither is the policy tool falling out of favor abroad.\n Johnpatrick Imperiale, “Sanctions by the Numbers,” Center for a New American Security, February 27, 2020, https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/sanctions-by-the-numbers.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816"

This draft paper provides an overview of the legal frameworks for sanctioning malicious cyber actors and the set of relevant sanctions imposed to date. Despite an emphasis on the goal of deterrence, both policymakers and academics have difficulty determining whether sanctions deter malicious cyber activity. Considering the continued use of cyber sanctions, this paper highlights key considerations for policymakers to evaluate whether sanctions can deter wrongful behavior in cyberspace.\nKeywords: sanctions, economic statecraft, cyber, deterrence, descriptive studies, policy evaluation\n*Research Assistant, Cyber Policy Initiative, Technology and International Affairs Program, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Washington, DC, USA\nContact: thompsonr.natalie@gmail.com\nSpecial thanks go to my colleagues—especially Tim Maurer, George Perkovich, Jon Bateman, Ariel Levite, and Arthur Nelson—for supporting this research.

State (and non-state) actors are acquiring offensive cyber capabilities and have demonstrated a willingness to use them—states have conducted at least 358 hostile cyber operations² since 2005, more than half of which have occurred since 2017.³\nThe increasing number of attacks puts pressure on governments to counter malicious cyber activity and to promote norms of responsible behavior in cyberspace. States have relied on a mix of diplomatic, informational, economic, and law enforcement options to respond to malicious cyber activity. Some refer to these tools as the DIME(LE) set of instruments available to states seeking to influence others’ behavior.⁴,⁵\nSanctions are part of a state’s arsenal. Both the United States and the European Union have created specific authorities for targeted financial sanctions in response to malicious cyber activity⁶—referred to throughout this paper as “cyber sanctions.”⁷ The United States has imposed\n¹ The Center for Strategic and International Studies maintains a list of significant cyberattacks that have occurred since 2006, and the Council on Foreign Relations maintains an interactive tracker of offensive cyber operations perpetrated by states.

A variety of others are used within the United States military to categorize and describe the operational environment; these include: 1) diplomatic, informational, military, and economic (DIME); 2) diplomatic, informational, military, economic, financial, intelligence, law enforcement (DIMEFIL); and 3) political, military, economic, social, informational, infrastructure (PMESII), among others.

Once policymakers answer questions of effectiveness, they can then craft their use of sanctions to best address relevant threats in cyberspace.\nThe diversity of malicious behavior in cyberspace makes it difficult to identify a coherent logic for using sanctions. States conduct offensive cyber operations in service of political goals while criminals engage in hacking for profit—sometimes, the two occur alongside one another.¹¹ The use of proxies in cyberspace complicates efforts to distinguish politically motivated and financially motivated attacks and obscures the relationship between state and non-state actors.¹²\nFurther compounding the problem are questions related to the harms that should be included in the definition of “malicious cyber activity.” Narrow definitions of “cyberattack” use the term to\nSeries, Conference Paper No. 9/2011, May 1, 2011, https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1989786 and Zachary Goldman, “Cybersecurity and a New Era of Asymmetric Economic Warfare,” Just Security, January 16, 2015, https://www.justsecurity.org/19150/cybersecurity-era-asymmetric-economic-warfare/.\n⁸ Council Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/1125 of July 30, 2020, implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/796 concerning restrictive measures against cyber-attacks threatening the Union or its Member States, 2020 O.J.

As a policy matter, the United States has used its cyber sanctions framework to punish behavior like election interference.¹⁴ Both the European Union and the United States have used human rights-related programs to respond to cyber-enabled human rights violations.¹⁵ As a result, this paper looks beyond sanctions frameworks meant explicitly to deal with malicious cyber activity and includes instances when additional horizontal frameworks have been used to respond to wrongful uses of information and communications technologies.\nThis paper seeks to provide an overview of targeted financial sanctions for countering malicious cyber activity in the United States and Europe and considerations regarding the tool’s effectiveness. Although policymakers often highlight deterrence and cost imposition as critical goals, both academic literature and policy documents point to difficulty measuring sanctions’ success at achieving these aims.\nThe continued reliance on the tool suggests that policymakers have other motivations for responding to malicious cyber activity with sanctions, regardless of whether sanctions are effective or whether their effectiveness can be measured.

Part outlines the definitional issues related to the scope of “malicious cyber activity” and what, therefore, constitutes a “cyber sanction.” It then provides an overview of the designations to date in the United States and Europe. Part two discusses how policymakers and academics evaluate sanctions’ effectiveness at achieving often-touted deterrence goals and specific considerations related to policy alternatives and long-term consequences. Policymakers cannot ignore the alternative instruments available to respond to malicious cyber activity in thinking about effectiveness and must weigh the trade-offs associated with alternative responses to cyberattacks. Finally, policymakers cannot ignore how firms and other states respond to and perceive the credibility of U.S. sanctions in the long-run—both as it relates to their imposition and removal (or lack thereof). They must consider the corresponding implications for the architecture of the global financial system and United States’ ability to weaponize its financial position. Part three then offers a categorization of the different purposes that sanctions can serve beyond deterrence. These purposes include attribution, information-sharing, audience satisfaction, cooperation with allies, norm development, punishment, and disruption of capabilities—all of which contribute cumulatively to the overarching goal of deterrence.\n## Defining “cyber sanctions”\n### What do sanctions entail?\nThe United States and EU’s cyber sanctions are targeted sanctions that differ from sanctions imposed during and before the 1990s. Comprehensive trade sanctions were a popular instrument of economic coercion throughout the 20th century, in part because they are less costly, less risky, and more palatable than military action. Targeted sanctions differ from comprehensive ones in coercive logic, the intended target, and the ultimate goal. Though similarly aimed at eliciting a change in state behavior, they focus on specific individuals and entities rather than the population at large.¹⁶ They assume that singling out individuals or groups will better “raise the target regime’s costs of noncompliance.”¹⁷ Targeted sanctions can also aim to change the\n¹⁶ Arne Tostensen and Beate Bull, “Are Smart Sanctions Feasible?” World Politics 53, no. 3 (April 2002): 380, 382.\n¹⁷ Daniel Drezner, “How Smart Are Smart Sanctions?” International Studies Review 5, no. 1 (March 2003): 107; see also Tostensen and Bull, “Are Smart Sanctions Feasible?” 380, 386; Thomas G.

Targeted sanctions are understood to have additional value for constraining and signaling. By “constraining,” these scholars refer to complicating an actor’s ability to engage in internationally wrongful behavior.²⁰ By “signaling,” they refer to sending a message to the target, domestic audiences, and international audiences that expresses support for norms of appropriate behavior.²¹\nOne type of targeted sanction, restrictive financial measures (also referred to as targeted financial sanctions), is increasingly the tool of choice for policymakers seeking to impose consequences for internationally wrongful behavior. Targeted financial sanctions include asset freezes, blocking transactions with designated individuals or entities, and denying access to capital markets.²² The tool relies on the preeminence of certain currencies and jurisdictions in global financial transactions.²³ Big financial players like the United States, Europe, and, to a lesser extent, China can weaponize the financial system to prevent specific individuals or organizations from transacting in their respective currencies.

The existence of “chokepoints” in the financial system that gives western states (particularly the United States) the “capacity to limit or penalize use of hubs by third parties (e.g., other states or private actors)” is a source of “considerable coercive power.” See Henry Farrell and Abraham Newman, “Weaponized Interdependence,” International Security 44, no. 1 (Summer 2019): 55-56.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nforeign policy emanating from these jurisdictions is incomplete without attention to the potential uses of targeted financial sanctions.²⁴\n## Definitional issues\nThe first issue to address in defining “cyber sanctions” is related to what constitutes “malicious cyber activity” and which sanctions should, therefore, be considered within this paper’s scope.\nIn April 2015, then-U.S. president Barack Obama created the first targeted financial sanctions framework meant to deal specifically with cyber-related harms;²⁵ the Europeans followed suit in 2019;²⁶ and the United Kingdom finalized their cyber sanctions regulation earlier this year.²⁷ The United States, EU, and UK authorities relate principally to compromises in data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.²⁸\nThese cyber-specific frameworks, however, do not tell the whole story. As early as 2011, the European Union sanctioned individuals and entities engaged in the surveillance and abuse of Iranian journalists and activists.²⁹ Some of the same violators later came under additional U.S.\n²⁴ Rachel Loeffler, “Bank Shots,” Foreign Affairs, March 1, 2009, https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/northkorea/2009-03-01/bank-shots; Rosenberg, et al., “The New Tools of Economic Warfare,” 5; Juan Zarate, “Harnessing the Financial Furies: Smart Financial Power and National Security,” The Washington Quarterly 32, no. 4 (October 2009): 43; Elizabeth Rosenberg, “Testimony before the United States House of Representatives Committee on Financial Services, Subcommittee on National Security, International Development and Monetary Policy: ‘Assessing the Use of Sanctions in Addressing National Security and Foreign Policy Challenges,’” Center for a New American Security, May 15, 2019, https://www.cnas.org/publications/congressional-testimony/elizabeth-rosenberg-before-the-house-financial-services-committee.\n²⁵ U.S. President, Executive Order, “Blocking the Property of Certain Persons Engaging in Significant Malicious Cyber-Enabled Activities, Executive Order 13694 of April 1, 2015,” Federal Register 80, no. 63 (April 2, 2015).\n²⁶ Council Regulation 2019/796 of May 17, 2019, concerning restrictive measures against cyber-attacks threatening the Union or its Member States, 2019 O.J.

They do not fit neatly into the definition of cyberattack promulgated by the U.S. National Institute of Technology and Standards: “An attack, via cyberspace, targeting an enterprise’s use of cyberspace for the purpose of disrupting, disabling, destroying, or maliciously controlling a computing environment/infrastructure; or destroying the integrity of the data or stealing controlled information.”³² For example, monitoring dissidents or using social media to promote narratives online does not necessarily compromise data confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Still, the United States and Europe have considered them harmful enough uses of information and communications technologies to warrant punishment. For this reason, sanctions falling under the cyber-specific framework, as well as others related to cyber-enabled influence operations and human rights violations, are included within the scope of this paper.\n## “Cyber sanctions” to date\nWith these definitional concerns in mind, this section provides a brief overview of the cyber sanctions imposed to date in both the United States and Europe.\nExecutive Order 13694, which created the United States’ cyber-specific sanctions framework, “declare[d] a national emergency with respect to the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States posed by the increasing prevalence and severity of malicious cyber-enabled activities originating from or directed by, persons located, in whole or in substantial part, outside the United States.”³³\nSo far, the United States has imposed thirty-five tranches of sanctions related to malicious cyber activity under both the cyber-specific framework and other country-specific and horizontal\n³⁰ For example, the EU sanctioned Abdolsamad Khoramabadi, head of the Committee to Determine Instances of Criminal Content, in March 2013, and the United States later imposed sanctions in May 2018.

These designations involve entities linked to Iran, North Korea, Russia, China, and Nigeria. The earliest designations, dating back to 2012 (made under an Executive Order on terrorism-related sanctions), dealt with Iranian government officials and entities participating in computer hacking projects with Hezbollah.³⁴ Since then, the United States has sanctioned a range of cybercriminals and nation-state hackers. These include North Korean actors that participated in the 2014 hack of Sony Pictures, Russian actors engaged in cyber-enabled election interference, and Iranian actors targeting U.S. financial institutions.³⁵ Since 2012, the United States has sanctioned over 250 individuals and entities for engaging in or enabling malicious cyber activity. (For a complete list of incidents, see Table 1.) The majority have been of Iranian, Russian, or North Korean origin. In the first half of 2020, however, the United States took action against two Chinese nationals for aiding Lazarus Group’s efforts to launder money, as well as six Nigerian individuals engaged in business email compromise and romance fraud scams.³⁶\nIn statements on the Executive Order, policymakers highlighted the “significant increase in the frequency, scale, and sophistication of cyber incidents targeting the American people” to justify its signing.³⁷ Absent in many of these statements are clear articulations of how the administration would evaluate these sanctions’ effectiveness. In a blog post following the signing of the April 2015 Executive Order, White House counterterrorism advisor Lisa Monica explained that policymakers hoped to “deter” and “impose costs” on adversaries.³⁸ But the specific means by which the U.S. Department of the Treasury would evaluate the program’s effectiveness remain unclear.

However, it would be misleading to not include these, and they represent an interesting examples of instances in which sanctioners can target key economic elites in order to elicit a change in state behavior.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\n|  10/22/2020 | EU | 13694), Ukraine (E.O. 13661)\nCouncil Regulation (EU) 2019/796 | 2 individuals, 1 entity | Russia | No  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  10/22/2020 | U.S. | Election interference (E.O. 13848) | 5 entities | Iran | No  |\n|  10/23/2020 | U.S. | CAATSA | 1 entity | Russia | No  |\n## Do cyber sanctions deter?\nAs described above, policymakers in both the United States and European Union emphasize that cyber sanctions aim to deter malicious actors and behavior. As Zachary Goldman and Damon McCoy have pointed out, “different kinds of malicious cyber activity demand different, tailored, deterrence strategies. This is because each category of cyber threat has a different motivation, and therefore will be sensitive to a different type of cost.”51 Nation-state hackers with political goals are unlikely to suffer the same consequences of a sanctions designation that independent cybercriminals with financial motivations will suffer. Similarly, designating a government official orchestrating an attack is unlikely to have the same impact as designating an individual two or three steps removed that launders money on behalf of a hacking group.\nTwo things complicate the effort to neatly distinguish between categories like cybercrime and nation-state activity and state and non-state actors. First, the convergence of financially-motivated cybercrime and nation-state activity makes it difficult to separate cyberattacks conducted for purely economic gain and those undertaken for political purposes.52 North Korean efforts to raise funds for its weapons of mass destruction program through cyber theft and ransom operations against financial institutions and cryptocurrency exchanges have demonstrated the difficulty of separating financial motivations from political goals.53 Similarly, state-sponsored economic espionage emanating from China blurs the distinction between financial and political aims as the theft of intellectual property aims to “support its strategic development goals—science and technology advancement, military modernization, and economic policy objectives.”54\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nSecond, the use of proxies for conducting offensive cyber operations often precludes a neat division between state and non-state actors in cyberspace. Tim Maurer’s comprehensive overview of the use of proxies for accomplishing offensive cyber operations details the spectrum of relationships between states and their proxies.⁵⁵ These relationships range from overt delegation of activity to loose orchestration to passive enablement of proxy behavior. In the latter cases, those operating at a state’s behest may also have a foot in the criminal world. For example, in 2019, Treasury alleged that a Russian cybercriminal indicted and sanctioned for developing and distributing malware also operated on behalf of the Russian government, “highlighting the Russian government’s enlistment of cybercriminals for its own malicious purposes.”⁵⁶\n## Evaluating effectiveness\nIt is not within the remit of external observers to assess whether cyber sanctions effectively achieve deterrence. Much of the information needed to make such an assessment is classified or privately owned intelligence. Though Treasury publicly reports the value of transactions blocked under specific sanctions programs, others have pointed out that evaluating the success of cyber sanctions based on the financial value of prevented transactions is misleading.⁵⁷ Therefore, it is difficult for policymakers to attribute any observed decrease in malicious cyber activity or change in activity to sanctions or determine whether activity levels would be even greater absent the threat of sanctions or imposition.\nWithin the U.S. government, Treasury’s Office of Intelligence and Analysis (OIA) and the State Department’s Bureau of Intelligence and Research perform impact assessments.⁵⁸ According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), which published a review of U.S. sanctions programs and their effectiveness in 2019, “These assessments analyze the impacts of specific sanctions on a particular aspect of the sanction’s target—for example, the sanctions’ impact on the target country’s economy or trade.”⁵⁹ OIA, for example, conducts impact assessments before a sanctions designation and after its imposition and may include factors like the target’s U.S.-\n⁵⁵ Maurer, *Cyber Mercenaries*, 42-49.\n⁵⁶ “Treasury Sanctions Evil Corp, the Russia-Based Cybercriminal Group Behind Dridex Malware,” U.S. Department of the Treasury, December 5, 2019, https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm845,\n⁵⁷ Annie Fixler and Eric Lorber, “Counting Pennies Underestimates the Value of Treasury’s Cyber Sanctions,” Foundation for Defense of Democracies, November 4, 2019, https://www.fdd.org/analysis/2019/11/04/counting-pennies-underestimates-the-value-of-treasurys-cyber-sanctions/.\n⁵⁸ Kimberly Gianopoulos, “Economic Sanctions: Agencies Assess Impacts on Targets, and Studies Suggest Several Factors Contribute to Sanctions’ Effectiveness,” U.S. Government Accountability Office, October 2019, 12, https://www.gao.gov/assets/710/701891.pdf.\n⁵⁹ Ibid.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nbased assets, global holdings, and interactions with the United States and the potential cascading consequences of a sanctions designation.⁶⁰\nHowever, the report acknowledges that “these assessments do not analyze sanctions’ overall effectiveness in achieving broader U.S. policy goals or objectives, such as whether the sanctions are advancing the national security and policy priorities of the United States” (emphasis added).⁶¹ OIA distinguishes between impact and effect in its assessments:\nAccording to OIA officials, assessing impact is analyzing the potential or observed effect of the sanction on the target. According to officials, impact can be focused on a singular target or could be broader, such as the impact on the target country’s economy or trade flows. In contrast, OIA views effectiveness as the extent to which a sanctions program is achieving the overall broader policy goals of the sanctions program, such as ultimately altering or deterring specific behaviors of the target or furthering U.S. national security priorities [Emphasis added].⁶²\nThe latter considerations come into play during National Security Council-led interagency discussions: The process “allows the U.S. government to draw upon multiple agencies’ inputs and perspectives, and to consider these issues in the larger policy context, because sanctions are often only one element of broader government-wide strategies to achieve U.S. policy goals.”⁶³\nEven within government, assessing the effectiveness of sanctions at achieving broader policy goals like deterrence is difficult. GAO’s report highlights that policymakers have difficulty isolating sanctions’ effects from those of other policy tools, dealing with shifting policy objectives, and identifying useful data for conducting assessments.⁶⁴\nThe threat of sanctions raises an additional challenge for evaluating effectiveness.⁶⁵ In at least one notable instance pertaining to Chinese cyber-enabled economic espionage, U.S. threats to impose sanctions may have contributed to the signing of a diplomatic agreement between then-\n⁶⁰ Ibid., 13-14.\n⁶¹ Ibid., 12.\n⁶² Ibid.\n⁶³ Ibid., 12.\n⁶⁴ Ibid., 17-18.\n⁶⁵ See, for example, Daniel Drezner’s work on selection bias in evaluations of sanctions programs, which suggests that sanctions are more effective than most analyses contend because they miss instances in which sanctions are threatened but not imposed: “in focusing only on those instances when sanctions have been imposed, policy analysts have overlooked the significant number of instances in which the threat of coercion did not have to be carried out.” Daniel Drezner, “The Hidden Hand of Economic Coercion,” International Organization 57, no. 3 (June 2003): 654-655, https://doi.org/10.1017/S0020818303573052.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\npresident Obama and President Xi. Reporting at the end of August 2015 suggested that the Obama administration was preparing a sanctions package against Chinese targets under the framework.⁶⁶ Just weeks later, in September of that year, Obama and Xi met in Washington to announce a moratorium on the cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property for commercial advantage.⁶⁷ In remarks on the deal, Obama alluded to the leverage created by the sanctions E.O. in stating, “I did indicate to President Xi that we will apply those and whatever other tools we have in our toolkit to go after cyber criminals, either retrospectively or prospectively.”⁶⁸ And in the words of then-Assistant Attorney General John Carlin, “That changed China.”⁶⁹ According to a report from the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, the number of detected Chinese cyberattacks diminished following the bilateral agreement.⁷⁰ But the evidence of the deal’s success was not conclusive.⁷¹,⁷² One report from threat intelligence company FireEye highlighted that the number of attacks began dropping at least a year before the agreement.⁷³ This case illustrates further the difficulty of isolating sanctions’ effects and evaluating the counterfactual of how adversaries might behave if not for the threat of sanctions.\nThe academic literature on the success of targeted financial sanctions is neither entirely optimistic nor conclusive.⁷⁴ One estimate of UN targeted sanctions’ success rate suggests that targeted sanctions are effective just 22 percent of the time.⁷⁵ Breaking that figure down by\n⁶⁶ Ellen Nakashima, “U.S. developing sanctions against China over cyberthefts,” *Washington Post*, August 30, 2015, https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/administration-developing-sanctions-against-china-over-cyberespionage/2015/08/30/9b2910aa-480b-11e5-8ab4-c73967a143d3_story.html?utm_term=.2ed69dd30154.\n⁶⁷ Office of the Press Secretary, “Remarks by President Obama and President Xi of the People’s Republic of China in Joint Press Conference,” White House, September 25, 2015, https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2015/09/25/remarks-president-obama-and-president-xi-peoples-republic-china-joint.\n⁶⁸ Ibid.\n⁶⁹ John Carlin, in “American Cybersecurity Experts: ‘No Trespassing,’” Aspen Strategy Forum, August 22, 2016, at 10:41, https://www.aspeninstitute.org/blog-posts/no-trespassing-experts-american-cybersecurity/.\n⁷⁰ National Counterintelligence and Security Center, “Foreign Economic Espionage in Cyberspace,” 7.\n⁷¹ Ben Buchanan and Robert D.

After surveying sanctions experts, they report, “A remarkable 27 out of 30 survey respondents – 90 percent – agreed with the contention that sanctions against state actors like Iran were more effective than sanctions against non-state actors like al Qaeda.”^^ A recent review of the academic literature highlights the impact of sanctions on non-state actors as a gap in existing scholarship^^—a fact particularly challenging for policymakers evaluating sanctions’ effectiveness against non-state and proxy cyber threats. Perhaps the most damning factor concerning the inconclusiveness of the academic literature is that even amongst academics “what counts as ‘effective’ (or ‘successful’) itself has been a contentious issue.”^^\n## Factors for consideration\nStill, in trying to assess the effectiveness of cyber sanctions, policymakers should look at three key factors:\n(1) A target’s vulnerability to economic pressure,\n(2) The motivations underpinning offensive activity, and\n(3) How chosen targets support malicious activity.\n## Vulnerability to economic pressure\nDespite the lack of consensus regarding sanctions’ aims, those who have surveyed the academic literature note that a target’s vulnerability to economic pressure is critical for sanctions’ effectiveness. As one group of researchers put it, “the data suggest that the types of financial sanctions that have been deployed against states in the last two decades should have a greater\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nimpact on the decisionmaking [sic] of states for which attractiveness to international trade and investment is strategically significant.”⁸² In the cyber domain, this means that policymakers should pay attention to specific nation-state cyber threats that may be vulnerable to economic pressure. A sanction against an Iranian or North Korean government entity, for example, is unlikely to disrupt capabilities in the same way that a designation of a Russian entity might. U.S. sanctions have isolated Iran and North Korea from the global financial system,⁸³ so additional targeted sanctions may be unlikely to significantly affect the ability to carry out future attacks or enjoy their proceeds. Indeed, these two actors have made the financial system the target of cyberattacks.⁸⁴ However, actors elsewhere may be more exposed to the influence of the U.S. dollar or the euro in global financial markets and, therefore, more likely to pay attention to the punitive consequences of a sanction or have their capabilities disrupted as a result. For example, Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, alleged that his net worth dropped by 80 percent—over $7 billion—as a result of U.S. sanctions related to “a range of malign activity around the globe,” including malicious cyber activity, imposed in 2018.⁸⁵\n## Actors’ motivations\nThe motives underpinning malicious cyber activity also affect an actor's vulnerability to sanctions. As mentioned above, Goldman and McCoy have argued that sanctions are an appropriate policy tool for dealing with financially motivated cyber threats—like cyber-enabled economic espionage—because they undermine the goal of the activity: profit.⁸⁶ By preventing malicious actors from accessing and moving money, sanctions make it “more difficult for them\n⁸² Rosenberg, et al., “The New Tools of Economic Warfare,” 15.\n⁸³ Ian Talley, “U.S. Moves to Further Isolate Iran From Global Financial System,” *Wall Street Journal*, October 25, 2019, https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-moves-to-further-isolate-iran-from-global-financial-system-11572025978; David Sanger and Michael Corkery, “Treasury Imposes Sanctions on North Korea, Cutting Access to Banks,” *New York Times*, June 1, 2016, https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/02/world/asia/treasury-imposes-sanctions-on-north-korea.html.\n⁸⁴ “Treasury Targets Supporters of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Networks Responsible for Cyber-Attacks Against the United States,” U.S. Department of the Treasury; “Treasury Targets North Korea for Multiple Cyber-Attacks,” U.S. Department of the Treasury; “Treasury Sanctions North Korean State-Sponsored Malicious Cyber Groups,” U.S. Department of the Treasury.\n⁸⁵ David Dawkins, “Russian Billionaire Oleg Deripaska Describes U.S. Money Laundering Accusations As ‘Mish-Mash Of Total Nonsense,’” *Forbes*, February 14, 2020, https://www.forbes.com/sites/daviddawkins/2020/02/14/report-russian-billionaire-oleg-deripaska-accused-by-us-agency-of-laundering-funds-for-vladimir-putin/#7b2a95c0c4bc; “Treasury Designates Russian Oligarchs, Officials, and Entities in Response to Worldwide Malign Activity,” U.S. Department of the Treasury, April 6, 2018, https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm0338.\n⁸⁶ Goldman and McCoy, “Deterring Financially Motivated Cybercrime,” 602.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nto use the proceeds of their crimes.”⁸⁷ Sanctions may fail to dissuade financially motivated actors from engaging in wrongful behavior if the profitability of the action outweighs the financial costs of sanctions. Still, the profit motive may make these actors more sensitive to sanctions than a politically motivated actor would be.⁸⁸ Russian actors engaged in hack and leak operations or attacks on international organizations are not as likely to be dissuaded from engaging in their activity because sanctions have made it unprofitable if profitability was not necessarily a preeminent goal.\n## Means of supporting wrongful activity\nThe specific choice of target and whose behavioral change is the goal of sanctions are also likely to bear on how policymakers should evaluate effectiveness. Once policymakers have identified malicious activity, they can choose to go after several different targets, including the state actors that directed, orchestrated, or enabled the attack; the individuals directly engaged in the attack; or those that provide material, financial, or technological support for the attack. Again, these actors are not equally vulnerable to the effects of sanctions. Government officials that enjoy the backing and protection of the state may be less likely to be deterred than those whose legitimate commercial interests are at stake by aiding targets in circumventing sanctions. As one group of researchers at the Center for a New American Security put it, “To the extent that sanctions on non-state actors are focused on coercing a change in behavior, that strategy may have the greatest impact on the ecosystem of actual and would-be supporters of those groups, rather than on the groups themselves.”⁸⁹ Simultaneously, sanctions can go after a specific target to change a third party’s behavior—returning to the Deripaska example described above, sanctioning Russian oligarchs was partly meant to signal to the Russian state that its conduct was unacceptable and leverage elite pain for behavioral change.⁹⁰\n## Effectiveness as opposed to what?\nEvaluating the impacts of sanctions cannot ignore the alternative instruments available to states\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n⁸⁷ John Carlin, “Detect, Disrupt, Deter: A Whole-of-Government Approach to National Security Cyber Threats,” *Harvard National Security Journal* 7, (2016): 420, https://harvardnsj.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2016/06/Carlin-FINAL.pdf.\n⁸⁸ The impact of sanctions on an adversary’s risk calculus could potentially backfire if financially motivated actors are deterred from engaging in the lowest levels of criminal activity, which may generate profits incommensurate with the absorbed risk, but continue to engage in highly profitable but extremely destabilizing attacks.\n⁸⁹ Rosenberg, et al., “The New Tools of Economic Warfare,” 28.\n⁹⁰ “Treasury Designates Russian Oligarchs, Officials, and Entities in Response to Worldwide Malign Activity,” U.S. Department of the Treasury.\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nseeking to respond to wrongful behavior in cyberspace.⁹¹ This paper situates sanctions within the DIME(LE) framework to highlight the point that policymakers face the choice not of sanctioning or doing nothing but of sanctioning or releasing a diplomatic statement or responding with a retaliatory cyberattack or of doing nothing or of doing several of these. In the U.S. context, in particular, policymakers have adopted a “whole-of-government” approach to countering malicious cyber activity—in essence, one that involves all of the tools of statecraft outlined in the DIME(LE).⁹²,⁹³ As a result, sanctions have frequently followed criminal charges against malicious cyber actors. Sixteen of the thirty-five instances in which the United States imposed cyber sanctions were preceded by an indictment of at least one of the sanctioned individuals—providing useful context for understanding the range of available tools for imposing costs on malicious cyber actors.\nWhere effectiveness is concerned, sanctions, in theory, may have more “teeth” than indictments because their enforcement does not rely on an actor setting foot in a country with which a state pursuing charges has an extradition treaty. As others have noted, the U.S. strategy of charging foreign-linked hackers is unlikely to result in many hackers ever appearing in U.S. courts.⁹⁴ However, there have been some important exceptions. Three members of the FIN7 cybercrime group were arrested in Spain in 2018, two of which have been extradited,⁹⁵ and in May 2020, authorities arrested another member of the organization in Seattle.⁹⁶\nJack Goldsmith and Robert Williams have questioned whether the public attribution of cyberattacks through criminal charges is counterproductive.

Sanctions are enforced not by the U.S. government or EU alone but by financial institutions that risk exposing themselves to secondary sanctions. As a result, they may better demonstrate the costs of engaging in wrongful behavior and, therefore, deter adversaries.\nSanctions, however, face limitations. Sophisticated actors can identify ways to evade sanctions, sometimes through cyberattacks.⁹⁸ Last fall, a United Nations panel of experts report detailed North Korea’s efforts to circumvent sanctions and raise money for its weapons of mass destruction program by attacking the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) and cryptocurrency exchanges, executing ransomware attacks, and mining cryptocurrency.⁹⁹,¹⁰⁰ The risk of evasion poses a threat to the efficacy of targeted financial sanctions as it “undermines the credibility of the senders, because the inability to implement and enforce the measures is often interpreted as signaling the lack of power of the sender.”¹⁰¹ And in the longer-term, actors may be compelled to seek alternate financial architectures to avoid the hassle of evading sanctions.\nThe broader point of comparing sanctions and indictments is that sanctions are just one of the tools that governments can employ against malicious cyber actors.

As early as 2013, Treasury had designated Liberty Reserve, a virtual currency provider, as a “financial institution of primary money laundering concern,” and in November 2018, the U.S. Department of the Treasury included in a designation the Bitcoin wallet addresses of two Iranian individuals.

In the U.S. context, the NSC-led interagency process provides a forum for discussing the effectiveness of sanctions relative to other policy instruments.¹⁰² But as with academic literature on the efficacy of sanctions on non-state actors, Dursun Peksen argues that scholarly work on the utility of sanctions relative to other policy instruments is similarly lacking.¹⁰³\nNonetheless, as policymakers impose sanctions, they must consider the potential escalatory consequences and how alternative policy instruments might compare. Rosenberg and Tama highlight the need to better assess where sanctions sit on the escalation ladder to strengthen their signaling value and ensure that efforts at cross-domain deterrence do not inadvertently compromise broader foreign policy objectives.¹⁰⁴ As they put it, “if it is unclear whether an airstrike against a military facility is higher or lower on the escalation ladder than financial sanctions targeting a country’s most important economic sector, the target government may not understand the likely consequences of continuing to flout an international norm or U.S. demands.”¹⁰⁵\nCompared to actions like diplomatic statements, sanctions may be perceived as more escalatory since they aim to impose real financial costs and disrupt an operations’ financing. But in comparison to retaliatory cyberattacks or other military action, they may be less escalatory because their contours are narrowly defined, and policymakers can couple sanctions with clear statements of intention.¹⁰⁶ The EU’s sanctions, which refrain from attributing responsibility for an attack to a specific state, may be less escalatory than those imposed by the United States,¹⁰⁷ which, as described above, can and sometimes do allege state responsibility for wrongful behavior.\nIf adversaries see sanctions as escalatory, they may retaliate. Sanctions have generated such retaliation: Iran retaliated for U.S. sanctions with cyberattacks against the financial system.

As Peter Feaver and Eric Lorber have put it, targeted financial sanctions rely on calculations about business risk, and “If global business conditions change, the firms might re-calculate that engaging in financial transactions with those targeted states outweighs the costs.”¹¹⁰ This risk of such re-calculation may be heightened if sanctions create incentives for businesses to pursue transactions in other currencies or for countries to develop alternative financial architectures.¹¹¹\nThese concerns—and consideration of cyber sanctions generally—cannot be divorced from the broader context in which the United States has aggressively pursued the use of sanctions to achieve a range of foreign policy goals, sometimes to the detriment of ally relationships. Two particular issues are worth highlighting: 1) the credibility of sanctions commitments and 2) the use of secondary sanctions.¹¹²\nThe credibility of broader sanctions commitments matters for evaluating the effectiveness of cyber sanctions at deterrence. Elizabeth Rosenberg and Jordan Tama have noted that sanctions’ effectiveness depends on the credibility of both the threat to designate targets for wrongful behavior and the promise to lift sanctions if behavior changes.¹¹³ The United States’ withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) illustrates how failure to do the latter can undermine broader foreign policy goals. As Rosenberg and Tama write, “By walking away from\n¹⁰⁸ Ellen Nakashima, “Iran blamed for cyberattacks on U.S. banks and companies,” *Washington Post*, September 21, 2012, https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/iran-blamed-for-cyberattacks/2012/09/21/afbe2be4-0412-11e2-9b24-ff730c7f6312_story.html; Neil MacFarquhar, “Putin, Responding to Sanctions, Orders U.S. to Cut Diplomatic Staff by 755,” *New York Times*, July 30, 2017, https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/30/world/europe/russia-sanctions-us-diplomats-expelled.html\n¹⁰⁹ “Treasury Targets Supporters of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Networks Responsible for Cyber-Attacks Against the United States,” U.S. Department of the Treasury.\n¹¹⁰ Peter Feaver and Eric Lorber, “Coercive Diplomacy and the New Financial Levers: Evaluating the Intended and Unintended Consequences of Financial Sanctions,” *Legatum Institute*, November 2010, 44, https://lif.blob.core.windows.net/lif/docs/default-source/publications/2010-publications-coercive-diplomacy.pdf?Status=Temp&amp;sfvrsn=2.\n¹¹¹ Ibid., 46-47.\n¹¹² I thank Allison Peters and Ariel (Eli) Levite for highlighting these important points.\n¹¹³ Rosenberg and Tama, “Strengthening the Economic Arsenal,” 5.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nthose allies and partners, the United States has made them less inclined to privilege cooperation in the future.”¹¹⁴\nIn the U.S. context, the two-pronged approach to creating new sanctions frameworks further complicates the delisting process. Legal authorities in the United States for imposing sanctions can be created through executive or legislative means. U.S. sanctions remain in place until a target appeals to OFAC and demonstrates a change in behavior that warrants delisting (and the burden is on designated individuals and entities to present a basis for delisting) or until Congress votes to lift the sanctions.¹¹⁵ Congressionally mandated sanctions provide an essential check on executive action to impose sanctions unilaterally. But if Congress refuses to lift sanctions in response to behavioral change, they undermine the tool’s credibility. (By contrast to U.S. sanctions, EU sanctions are reviewed annually.¹¹⁶ In some ways, this may enhance the instrument’s credibility.)\nEfforts to understand the effectiveness of the United States’ cyber sanctions must also contend with the legislative authorities that provide for secondary sanctions. Secondary sanctions refer to “the threat of US sanctions against foreign individuals and entities for engaging in specified activities that may not have a US nexus.”¹¹⁷ In the context of cyber sanctions, these include provisions enshrined within CAATSA for imposing sanctions against individuals and entities that engage in “significant transactions” with certain Russian government entities¹¹⁸ and their personnel.¹¹⁹ Secondary sanctions are different from provisions that allow governments to target those that provide “technical, financial, or material support” to previously designated actors. As others have pointed out, both the U.S. and EU authorities accept that sanctions are more effective when targeting an adversary’s network.¹²⁰ Instead, secondary sanctions target those that continue to do business with a sanctioned entity, whether based in the United States or not.\n¹¹⁴ Ibid., 6.\n¹¹⁵ “Filing a Petition for Removal from an OFAC List,” U.S. Department of the Treasury, last updated May 2, 2017, https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/petitions.aspx.\n¹¹⁶ Council of the EU, “Adoption and review procedure for EU sanctions,” last reviewed February 14, 2019, https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/sanctions/adoption-review-procedure/.\n¹¹⁷ Samantha Sultoon and Justine Walker, “Secondary Sanctions’ Implications and the Transatlantic Relationship,” Atlantic Council, September 2019, 3, https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SecondarySanctions_Final.pdf.\n¹¹⁸ These include “the defense or intelligence sectors of the Government of the Russian Federation, including the Main Intelligence Agency of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation or the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation.” Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act of 2017, Public Law 115-44, U.S. Statutes at Large (2017), https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/hr3364_pl115-44.pdf.\n¹¹⁹ Ibid.\n¹²⁰ Sultoon and Walker, “Secondary Sanctions’ Implications and the Transatlantic Relationship,” 4.\n24\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nTo date, the United States has not imposed cyber-related secondary sanctions under CAATSA, but the legislation permitting secondary sanctions and their potential ramifications for EU projects has attracted criticism from the bloc.¹²¹ Because of U.S. withdrawal from the JCPOA, some EU members have signed on to the Instrument in Support of Trade Exchanges (INSTEX), a special purpose vehicle that “circumvents the traditional financial networks the US uses to establish its jurisdiction for enforcing sanctions,”¹²² to conduct business with Iranian entities.\nParticularly as European entities become subject to secondary U.S. sanctions and must find alternative payment systems, other countries face incentives to create alternative global financial architectures that erode the United States’ long-term power in the global economic system.¹²³ Countries like Russia, China, and even India, are interested in an alternative financial messaging system to SWIFT, but these have yet to catch on and face important limitations.¹²⁴\nSome have pointed out that “Multinational businesses seeking to avoid exposure to U.S. and EU sanctions can find refuge in the yuan and Chinese financial platforms.”¹²⁵ China’s “efforts to promote the yuan as a global currency and establish alternatives to the dollar- and euro-dominated international financial system”¹²⁶ may heighten the associated risks. Many are quick to point out that China faces several obstacles to achieving such a goal.¹²⁷ Still, as former senior Treasury adviser Elizabeth Rosenberg points out, “sanctions do give China’s economic ambitions an undeniable boost.”¹²⁸ Especially as financial technologies—like cryptocurrencies—introduce new ways for criminals to launder money,¹²⁹ the continued use of sanctions may\n¹²¹ “Russia sanctions: EU vows to retaliate over US measures,” BBC, July 26, 2017, https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40727044; Paul Ivan, “The US and the EU need a stronger dialogue on Russia,” European Policy Centre, May 2, 2018, https://www.epc.eu/en/Publications/The-US-and-the-EU-need-a-stronger-dialogue-on-Russia-sanctions~1e70f8; Karen DeYoung, “Three European allies ask U.S. not to enforce secondary sanctions over Iran trade,” Washington Post, June 6, 2018, https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/three-european-allies-ask-us-not-to-enforce-secondary-sanctions-over-iran-trade/2018/06/06/f4c94594-69c3-11e8-bea7-c8eb28bc52b1_story.html.\n¹²² Ellie Geranmayeh and Manuel Lafont Rapnouil, “Meeting the Challenge of Secondary Sanctions,” European Council on Foreign Relations, June 2019, 4, 7, https://www.ecfr.eu/publications/summary/meeting_the_challenge_of_secondary_sanctions.\n¹²³ Drezner, “Targeted Sanctions in a World of Global Finance,” 760-761.\n¹²⁴ Jignesh Davda, “China, Russia &amp; India Push Forward on SWIFT Alternative,” Yahoo!

The potential backlash to Washington’s gung-ho attitude toward financial sanctions may occur on a longer time horizon but carries arguably more significant consequence for U.S. global power.\nThe potential consequences mean that policymakers evaluating the effectiveness of cyber sanctions at deterring wrongful behavior must also consider the long-term trajectory of the tool’s use and how decisions within the broader foreign policy context affect the reception of sanctions.\n## Moving beyond deterrence\nA general emphasis on deterrence obscures the variety of different functions that sanctions can perform and the diversity of motives underpinning malicious cyber activity. Few, if any, policymakers would argue that the outright cessation of malicious cyber activity is a realistic goal that could be achieved by targeted financial sanctions. Given that some, like North Korea, pursue cybercrime as a means of sanctions evasion, one might even argue that sanctions are counterproductive if the goal is understood to stop malicious cyber activity.^^ As described above, the academic and policy literature on the effectiveness of cyber sanctions at deterrence is difficult to measure. So why do policymakers continue to employ sanctions in the seeming absence of compelling evidence about their effectiveness?\nThe academic literature on targeted sanctions has attempted to account for some of the different aims of sanctions and the diverse threats they can target by introducing three potential purposes—constraint, coercion, and signaling.^^ Even these, however, ignore the nuanced and specific purposes for imposing sanctions in response to malicious cyber activity. To say that a sanctions designation aims to “signal,” for example, ignores important features of the message itself, its intended audience, and its contribution to the broader goal of sending a message by sanctioning.\nOthers divide the purposes of sanctions into “symbolic” or “expressive” and “instrumental” ones.^^ Symbolic or expressive purposes relate to the political interests served by doing something in response to wrongful behavior—i.e., signaling. Instrumental objectives relate to desired policy or behavior changes—i.e., coercion and constraint.\n^^ Elizabeth Rosenberg and Neil Bhatiya, “Busting North Korea’s Sanctions Evasion,” Center for a New American Security, March 4, 2020, https://www.cnas.org/publications/commentary/busting-north-koreas-sanctions-evasion.\n^^ Giumelli, *How EU sanctions work*, 18-19.\n^^ Taehee Whang, “Playing to the Home Crowd?

The degree to which a state might be responsible for malicious activity varies from an inability to prevent malicious attacks to active participation in an attack.¹³⁵\nSanctions designations are public listings that name individuals or entities in response to malicious behavior. As Kristen Eichensehr has argued, they can attribute wrongful conduct by naming the individual or entity that directly perpetrated a cyberattack or indicating state responsibility for an attack.¹³⁶\nThis is not always the case. Because targets can be sanctioned for materially, financially, or technologically enabling a previously designated actor, they do not always publicize attribution in the sense of identifying hackers. And because ascertaining the nature of the relationship between a state and a hacker can be difficult, not all sanctions allege that a state enabled or orchestrated wrongful behavior in cyberspace.\nBut in some cases, sanctions do serve to implicate a state in malicious cyber activity. For example, in September 2019, the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) named Lazarus\n¹³³ Hinck and Maurer, “Persistent enforcement,” 531-534.\n¹³⁴ Herb Lin, “Attribution of Malicious Cyber Incidents,” Aegis Paper Series No. 1607, Hoover Institution, n.d., 5, https://www.hoover.org/sites/default/files/research/docs/lin_webready.pdf.\n¹³⁵ Herb Lin draws on Jason Healey’s piece, “Beyond Attribution: Seeking National Responsibility for Cyber Attacks,” in outlining the different degrees of responsibility; Ibid., 18.

Within the EU, attribution is a “sovereign political decision” left up to each member state’s discretion.¹³⁸ As a result, EU sanctions designations avoid making a specific link between a designated individual or entity and a state sponsor, even when, as in the case of the July 2020 Russian targets, some of the listed individuals may work on behalf of government agencies or may be government agencies themselves.¹³⁹,¹⁴⁰ Though attribution is also a sovereign political decision in the United States, the process is more straightforward—there is no need to wrangle the agreement of twenty-seven member states to attribute.\nIndependent of the political reasons for (not) attributing a cyberattack, not all jurisdictions are equally competent in their ability to attribute. States differ in their ability to identify technical and political indicators of compromise and use signals, human, and open-source intelligence to understand them.¹⁴¹ As one RAND Corporation report put it, “These capabilities may not be widespread globally, and very few countries are thought to possess sophisticated all-source capabilities.”¹⁴²\n## Information-sharing¹⁴³\nThe press releases that accompany sanctions designations sometimes contain important information about how malicious actors carry out their attacks. Though formal information-sharing mechanisms exist in both the United States and the European Union, many involve a\n¹³⁷ “Treasury Sanctions North Korean State-Sponsored Malicious Cyber Groups,” U.S. Department of the Treasury.\n¹³⁸ Botek, “European Union establishes a sanction regime for cyber-attacks.”\n¹³⁹ Council Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/1125 of July 30, 2020, O.J.

To be attributable to that state, the operation must have been carried out by one of its organs or by another actor acting on its behalf. A cyber operation attributable to a state may constitute an internationally wrongful act if it violates a norm of international law.” See Patryk Pawlak, Thomas Biersteker, and François Delerue, *Guardian of the galaxy: EU cyber sanctions and norms in cyberspace*, eds.

In the United States, for example, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) Exchange is a Treasury-led “voluntary public-private information sharing partnership among law enforcement, financial institutions, and FinCEN aimed at effectively and efficiently combating money laundering, terrorism financing, organized crime, and other financial crimes; protecting the financial system from illicit use; and promoting national security.”¹⁴⁴ Additionally, the Bank Secrecy Act Advisory Group (BSAAG) is “the means by which Treasury receives advice on the operations of the Bank Secrecy Act,” a key piece of U.S. law regarding money laundering.¹⁴⁵ Made of up representatives from federal agencies, financial institutions, and trade groups, BSAAG is chaired by the FinCEN director.¹⁴⁶ Though these mechanisms are essential means of sharing information, the participating institutions and representatives are limited.\nHowever, public press releases can garner the attention of a broader set of stakeholders with sanctions compliance obligations and can aid in disseminating information related to cyber threats.

In some cases, sanctions are met with laudatory statements from allied governments. For example, the United States released such a message when the European Union imposed cyber sanctions for the first time in July 2020.¹⁵³\n## Cooperation with allies\nGiven that both the United States and European Union have legal frameworks to impose sanctions against malicious cyber actors, there is a potential cooperative dimension to the policy. Some have suggested that sanctions work better when there are concerted efforts among states to restrict an actor’s capabilities and deny its action’s benefits because it limits the actor’s ability to mitigate losses in other markets.¹⁵⁴ Even without cooperative effort, sanctions can signal to members of the international community a shared commitment to reducing malicious activity. Where the cyber context is concerned, European action can have a particularly important signaling function given, as a former State Department official put it, the fact that actors like Russia and China are increasingly writing off signaling from the United States.¹⁵⁵\nThe U.S. and EU legal authorities are mostly similar, heightening the potential cooperative dimension. At their cores, both offer the ability to impose sanctions on individuals and entities that disrupt the confidentiality, availability, or integrity of data or the functioning of computer systems that support critical infrastructure or governmental services.

Imposing sanctions in concert with like-minded nations further strengthens the norm development function. Having multiple states commit to punishing a malicious actor reinforces the wrongfulness of the act in question and helps establish what constitutes an appropriate state response to such wrongful behavior.¹⁵⁷\nIn his statement following the EU’s first cyber sanctions, High Representative Josep Borrell explicitly referenced commitment to implementing the norms developed by the UN Group of Government Experts’ (UNGGE) 2010, 2013, and 2015 reports and to continued cooperation the ongoing UNGGE and Open-Ended Working Group.¹⁵⁸\n## Punishment of malicious actors\nBy blocking transactions and freezing malicious cyber actors’ assets, policymakers demonstrate that engaging in offensive behavior has real financial consequences. Because many cyberattacks are financially motivated, sanctions deny the benefits of an actor’s behavior by making it more difficult to access and move money.¹⁵⁹\nGoldman has argued that targeted financial sanctions play a vital role in the broader effort to deter financially motivated cybercrime—especially cyber-enabled economic espionage—by “drying up the market for stolen data.”¹⁶⁰ Since the United States’ sanctions framework allows for the designation of not just those who steal intellectual property but also those who benefit\n¹⁵⁶ “Treasury Targets Russian Operatives over Election Interference, World Anti-Doping Agency Hacking, and Other Malign Activities,” U.S. Department of the Treasury; U.S. President, “Taking Additional Steps to Address the National Emergency With Respect to Significant Malicious Cyber-Enabled Activities,” 3; “Treasury Targets North Korea for Multiple Cyber-Attacks,” U.S. Department of the Treasury; Council Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/1125 of July 30, 2020, O.J.

By freezing assets and blocking transactions, sanctions can disrupt the financing of an offensive cyber operation. In theory, they can also disrupt a state’s ability to recruit the talent necessary to carry out a sophisticated operation—the exposure of a hacker’s identity and the financial punishment may dissuade would-be hackers from serving as a proxy.\nSanctions against terrorist financiers are an important precedent in this respect. In 2001, then-president George W. Bush signed Executive Order 13224 to allow for the imposition of sanctions against those determined “To assist in, sponsor, or provide financial, material, or technological support for, or financial or other services in support of, acts of terrorism.”¹⁶² According to Juan Zarate, a former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes, the use of sanctions against terrorist organizations led to the development of additional horizontal sanctions programs to deal with behavior-based national security threats—like cyber threats.¹⁶³ The logic of going after financing networks and enablers is simple: As Zachary Goldman has put it, “Entities like drug trafficking networks, terrorist groups, and proliferation facilitators require substantial streams of funding and access to the global financial system, to remain effective. The more time and resources they spend trying to fund an organization, the less time spent planning attacks or engaging in other illicit activity.”¹⁶⁴\n## Deterrence\nThrough the previously listed means, sanctions may aspire to a deterrent function that seeks to change state actors’ long-term behavior in cyberspace. The repeated imposition of sanctions may introduce sustained friction in the relationship between the proxy and the state that changes the state’s overall calculus about how and when to engage in malicious cyber activity. Over time, this may lead to a change in the nature of the state’s relationship with its proxies and the degree of risk it is willing to accept when engaging in offensive cyber operations. By punishing\n¹⁶¹ U.S. President, “Blocking the Property of Certain Persons Engaging in Significant Malicious Cyber-Enabled Activities,” 18077.\n¹⁶² Bureau of Counterterrorism, “Executive Order 13224,” U.S. Department of State, https://www.state.gov/executive-order-13224/.\n¹⁶³ I thank former Assistant Secretary Zarate for highlighting this historical context.\n¹⁶⁴ Zachary Goldman, “Cybersecurity and a New Era of Asymmetric Economic Warfare.”\n32\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\ncountries that engage in offensive activity and demonstrating the international community’s support for this behavior, states can aim to increase the effort, raise the risk, and reduce offensive cyber actors’ rewards.¹⁶⁵\nDespite the difficulty, even for policymakers, of evaluating sanctions’ success at deterrence, they remain a tool often used for responding to malicious activity. Therefore, our understanding of the impact of sanctions must go beyond the deterrent function and consider the additional symbolic purposes outlined above and the factors that might also impact how symbolic goals are achieved. Table 2 summarizes questions policymakers might consider in evaluating the effectiveness of sanctions at achieving the variety of purposes set forward in this section and the considerations for assessing deterrence outlined in the previous section.\nTable 2. Questions for evaluating effectiveness\n|  Function | Questions  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  Attribution | • Do the statements accompanying a sanctions designation claim that the named entities perpetrated a cyberattack itself?\n• Do the statements accompanying a sanctions designation allege state responsibility for wrongful behavior in cyberspace?\n• Have other policies or legal action (i.e., indictments) made similar attribution claims?  |\n|  Information-sharing | • Do private sector entities pay attention to sanctions notices more than other vehicles for information-sharing about cyber threats?\n• Do the statements accompanying a sanctions designation contain meaningful information about the tactics, techniques, and procedures employed by malicious actors that external stakeholders could use to fortify their networks?  |\n|  Audience satisfaction | • Do actors in the private sector or civil society find sanctions a meaningful and appropriate response to malicious activity?\n• Do allies release diplomatic statements affirming the appropriateness of the action?  |\n|  Cooperation with allies | • Do (or could) other jurisdictions impose sanctions against the same targets?\n• Do other countries release diplomatic statements affirming the appropriateness of the action?  |\n|  Norm development | • Does the offense that prompted sanction violate an established norm of responsible behavior in cyberspace?  |\n¹⁶⁵ Joseph Nye, Jr., “Deterrence and Dissuasion in Cyberspace,” *International Security* 41, no. 3 (Winter 2016/17): 56, https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/ISEC_a_00266.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\n- Have other countries or jurisdictions signaled that sanctions are the appropriate response to this type of norm violation?\n## Punishment\n- How exposed is the individual or entity to the U.S. dollar or the euro’s impact in global financial markets?\n- What is the monetary value of the transactions blocked or assets frozen as a result of the sanction?\n- Do opportunities exist for a designated actor to protect their assets or recoup their losses?\n## Disruption of capabilities\n- Do sanctions disrupt an actor’s ability to procure material, financial, or technological resources necessary to carry out malicious activity?\n- How do sanctions affect the willingness of proxies to engage with state sponsors of malicious cyber activity?\n- Do opportunities exist for actors to circumvent sanctions or mitigate their impact by using alternative financial architectures?\n## Deterrence\n- Over time, does the nature of a particular actor’s behavior in cyberspace change?\n- Do sanctions change the risk-calculus of those engaged in malicious cyber activity?\n- Over time, does the nature of malicious cyber activity in general change?\n## General\n- How might adversaries respond or retaliate to sanctions? What is the likelihood of the target engaging in retaliation, and what would the consequences of retaliation be?\n- Are the costs absorbed by the sender of sanctions proportionate to the costs imposed on targets?\n- What alternative policy options are available, and how do the effects of these tools compare to those of sanctions?\n- What might the long-term consequences be for the architecture of the global financial system?\nHaving discussed the eight purposes sanctions may seek to serve, the operational question remains whether policymakers clearly articulate these objectives and how they measure sanctions’ effectiveness at achieving any of these goals. Not all of the potential purposes of cyber sanctions writ large will be served by a single designation, nor should they be. Policymakers’ goals differ with respect to the variety of cyber threats. The aim of preventing low-level cybercrime like business email compromise scams is different from seeking to encourage states to rein in their proxies when conducting offensive cyber operations.\nNo matter which goals policymakers have in mind with a sanctions designation, they should keep in mind the considerations outlined above pertaining to alternative policy instruments and long-term consequences. Take, for example, the goal of audience satisfaction and the pressure to “do something” in response to malicious cyber activity: Escalation can undermine audience\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nsatisfaction if a greater number of private sector entities become the victims of cyberattacks in response to sanctions. And the repeated imposition of sanctions may have diminishing returns as far as satisfying audiences—if policymakers describe sanctions in deterrence terms, domestic audiences may be satisfied initially, but the continuation of activity may be interpreted as a sign of failure and lend itself to disappointment.\nThis section has outlined seven purposes in addition to deterrence that policymakers may have in mind when employing sanctions against malicious cyber actors. It is difficult to say whether sanctions deter. But despite the emphasis on deterrence in policy statements, sanctions can have important symbolic purposes that should factor into evaluations of sanctions programs.\n# Conclusion\nThe definitional issues highlighted at the beginning of this paper related to what constitutes malicious cyber activity and should be included within this paper’s scope and the variety of aims of sanctions can raise a question about whether it makes sense to speak of a country or jurisdiction’s “cyber policy” or consider cyber issues a facet of a broader foreign policy. Future research in this area should address how policy should deal with the distinction between “cyber” as a threat itself and as a means for accomplishing other ends like intelligence collection, economic competition, or control over domestic political spaces. The United States’ use, in particular, of a variety of different legal instruments—not just the cyber-specific sanctions framework—highlights the fact that cybercrime and national security threats require a variety of flexible tools. More clearly delineating how and why cyber activity crosses a line of acceptability is crucial to promoting responsible behavior in cyberspace and identifying appropriate mechanisms for responding to harms.\nMore empirical research is also needed in this area. Much of the academic literature on sanctions focuses on those levied against states and deals insufficiently with the success of sanctions against nonstate and proxy actors. $^{166}$ As transnational threats multiply and policymakers reach for sanctions in response, they should have a clear evidence base supporting their decision making.\nThough policymakers often emphasize the goal of deterrence, articulation of the considerations for evaluating the effectiveness of sanctions is scant, even among government actors with access to the full array of intelligence necessary to make such evaluations. Policymakers should consider a target’s vulnerability to economic pressure, actors’ motivations, and the role that\n$^{166}$ Peksen, “When Do Imposed Economic Sanctions Work?,” 7-8.\n35\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\ntargets play in wrongful behavior in seeking to evaluate the likely outcomes of a sanctions designation and its effectiveness. Furthermore, questions of effectiveness also require attention to alternative policy options and long-term consequences.\nMoving beyond deterrence and cost imposition, the diversity of actors against which policymakers impose sanctions requires more nuanced thinking. In the absence of clear frameworks for evaluating effectiveness and relative pessimism about sanctions’ effectiveness, policymakers continue to reach for the tool. Therefore, our understanding of the purposes of sanctions should account for functions like attribution, information-sharing, audience satisfaction, cooperation with allies, norm development, and punishment.\nDespite being hailed as ineffective by academic scholars, policymakers continue to employ sanctions. Data collected by the Center for a New American Security shows that the current U.S. administration is more than willing to sanction adversaries. Even though 2019 saw the fewest designations during the current administration, the yearly total was still more than those of any single year under the previous administration.¹⁶⁷ And the EU’s recent implementation of its cyber sanctions framework for the first time indicates that neither is the policy tool falling out of favor abroad.\n¹⁶⁷ Johnpatrick Imperiale, “Sanctions by the Numbers,” Center for a New American Security, February 27, 2020, https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/sanctions-by-the-numbers.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816"

This draft paper provides an overview of the legal frameworks for sanctioning malicious cyber actors and the set of relevant sanctions imposed to date. Despite an emphasis on the goal of deterrence, both policymakers and academics have difficulty determining whether sanctions deter malicious cyber activity. Considering the continued use of cyber sanctions, this paper highlights key considerations for policymakers to evaluate whether sanctions can deter wrongful behavior in cyberspace.\nKeywords: sanctions, economic statecraft, cyber, deterrence, descriptive studies, policy evaluation\n*Research Assistant, Cyber Policy Initiative, Technology and International Affairs Program, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Washington, DC, USA\nContact: thompsonr.natalie@gmail.com\nSpecial thanks go to my colleagues—especially Tim Maurer, George Perkovich, Jon Bateman, Ariel Levite, and Arthur Nelson—for supporting this research.

State (and non-state) actors are acquiring offensive cyber capabilities and have demonstrated a willingness to use them—states have conducted at least 358 hostile cyber operations² since 2005, more than half of which have occurred since 2017.³\nThe increasing number of attacks puts pressure on governments to counter malicious cyber activity and to promote norms of responsible behavior in cyberspace. States have relied on a mix of diplomatic, informational, economic, and law enforcement options to respond to malicious cyber activity. Some refer to these tools as the DIME(LE) set of instruments available to states seeking to influence others’ behavior.⁴,⁵\nSanctions are part of a state’s arsenal. Both the United States and the European Union have created specific authorities for targeted financial sanctions in response to malicious cyber activity⁶—referred to throughout this paper as “cyber sanctions.”⁷ The United States has imposed\n¹ The Center for Strategic and International Studies maintains a list of significant cyberattacks that have occurred since 2006, and the Council on Foreign Relations maintains an interactive tracker of offensive cyber operations perpetrated by states.

A variety of others are used within the United States military to categorize and describe the operational environment; these include: 1) diplomatic, informational, military, and economic (DIME); 2) diplomatic, informational, military, economic, financial, intelligence, law enforcement (DIMEFIL); and 3) political, military, economic, social, informational, infrastructure (PMESII), among others.

For a discussion on this topic, see: Marco Benatar and Kristof Gombeer, “Cyber Sanctions: Exploring a Blind Spot in the Current Legal Debate,” European Society of International Law Conference Paper\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nsanctions in response to malicious cyber activity thirty-five times over the past decade, and the European Union and the United Kingdom imposed similar sanctions for the first time in July 2020⁸ and again in October 2020.⁹\nScholars have long debated the effectiveness of sanctions generally and their ability to achieve policy aims.¹⁰ To evaluate the efficacy of cyber sanctions, one must first articulate the goals of sanctions and what they might be useful for achieving. Once policymakers answer questions of effectiveness, they can then craft their use of sanctions to best address relevant threats in cyberspace.\nThe diversity of malicious behavior in cyberspace makes it difficult to identify a coherent logic for using sanctions. States conduct offensive cyber operations in service of political goals while criminals engage in hacking for profit—sometimes, the two occur alongside one another.¹¹ The use of proxies in cyberspace complicates efforts to distinguish politically motivated and financially motivated attacks and obscures the relationship between state and non-state actors.¹²\nFurther compounding the problem are questions related to the harms that should be included in the definition of “malicious cyber activity.” Narrow definitions of “cyberattack” use the term to\nSeries, Conference Paper No. 9/2011, May 1, 2011, https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1989786 and Zachary Goldman, “Cybersecurity and a New Era of Asymmetric Economic Warfare,” Just Security, January 16, 2015, https://www.justsecurity.org/19150/cybersecurity-era-asymmetric-economic-warfare/.\n⁸ Council Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/1125 of July 30, 2020, implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/796 concerning restrictive measures against cyber-attacks threatening the Union or its Member States, 2020 O.J.

As a policy matter, the United States has used its cyber sanctions framework to punish behavior like election interference.¹⁴ Both the European Union and the United States have used human rights-related programs to respond to cyber-enabled human rights violations.¹⁵ As a result, this paper looks beyond sanctions frameworks meant explicitly to deal with malicious cyber activity and includes instances when additional horizontal frameworks have been used to respond to wrongful uses of information and communications technologies.\nThis paper seeks to provide an overview of targeted financial sanctions for countering malicious cyber activity in the United States and Europe and considerations regarding the tool’s effectiveness. Although policymakers often highlight deterrence and cost imposition as critical goals, both academic literature and policy documents point to difficulty measuring sanctions’ success at achieving these aims.\nThe continued reliance on the tool suggests that policymakers have other motivations for responding to malicious cyber activity with sanctions, regardless of whether sanctions are effective or whether their effectiveness can be measured.

Part outlines the definitional issues related to the scope of “malicious cyber activity” and what, therefore, constitutes a “cyber sanction.” It then provides an overview of the designations to date in the United States and Europe. Part two discusses how policymakers and academics evaluate sanctions’ effectiveness at achieving often-touted deterrence goals and specific considerations related to policy alternatives and long-term consequences. Policymakers cannot ignore the alternative instruments available to respond to malicious cyber activity in thinking about effectiveness and must weigh the trade-offs associated with alternative responses to cyberattacks. Finally, policymakers cannot ignore how firms and other states respond to and perceive the credibility of U.S. sanctions in the long-run—both as it relates to their imposition and removal (or lack thereof). They must consider the corresponding implications for the architecture of the global financial system and United States’ ability to weaponize its financial position. Part three then offers a categorization of the different purposes that sanctions can serve beyond deterrence. These purposes include attribution, information-sharing, audience satisfaction, cooperation with allies, norm development, punishment, and disruption of capabilities—all of which contribute cumulatively to the overarching goal of deterrence.\n## Defining “cyber sanctions”\n### What do sanctions entail?\nThe United States and EU’s cyber sanctions are targeted sanctions that differ from sanctions imposed during and before the 1990s. Comprehensive trade sanctions were a popular instrument of economic coercion throughout the 20th century, in part because they are less costly, less risky, and more palatable than military action. Targeted sanctions differ from comprehensive ones in coercive logic, the intended target, and the ultimate goal. Though similarly aimed at eliciting a change in state behavior, they focus on specific individuals and entities rather than the population at large.¹⁶ They assume that singling out individuals or groups will better “raise the target regime’s costs of noncompliance.”¹⁷ Targeted sanctions can also aim to change the\n¹⁶ Arne Tostensen and Beate Bull, “Are Smart Sanctions Feasible?” World Politics 53, no. 3 : 380, 382.\n¹⁷ Daniel Drezner, “How Smart Are Smart Sanctions?” International Studies Review 5, no. 1 : 107; see also Tostensen and Bull, “Are Smart Sanctions Feasible?” 380, 386; Thomas G.

Targeted sanctions are understood to have additional value for constraining and signaling. By “constraining,” these scholars refer to complicating an actor’s ability to engage in internationally wrongful behavior.²⁰ By “signaling,” they refer to sending a message to the target, domestic audiences, and international audiences that expresses support for norms of appropriate behavior.²¹\nOne type of targeted sanction, restrictive financial measures (also referred to as targeted financial sanctions), is increasingly the tool of choice for policymakers seeking to impose consequences for internationally wrongful behavior. Targeted financial sanctions include asset freezes, blocking transactions with designated individuals or entities, and denying access to capital markets.²² The tool relies on the preeminence of certain currencies and jurisdictions in global financial transactions.²³ Big financial players like the United States, Europe, and, to a lesser extent, China can weaponize the financial system to prevent specific individuals or organizations from transacting in their respective currencies.

As early as 2011, the European Union sanctioned individuals and entities engaged in the surveillance and abuse of Iranian journalists and activists.²⁹ Some of the same violators later came under additional U.S.\n²⁴ Rachel Loeffler, “Bank Shots,” Foreign Affairs, March 1, 2009, https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/northkorea/2009-03-01/bank-shots; Rosenberg, et al., “The New Tools of Economic Warfare,” 5; Juan Zarate, “Harnessing the Financial Furies: Smart Financial Power and National Security,” The Washington Quarterly 32, no. 4 : 43; Elizabeth Rosenberg, “Testimony before the United States House of Representatives Committee on Financial Services, Subcommittee on National Security, International Development and Monetary Policy: ‘Assessing the Use of Sanctions in Addressing National Security and Foreign Policy Challenges,’” Center for a New American Security, May 15, 2019, https://www.cnas.org/publications/congressional-testimony/elizabeth-rosenberg-before-the-house-financial-services-committee.\n²⁵ U.S. President, Executive Order, “Blocking the Property of Certain Persons Engaging in Significant Malicious Cyber-Enabled Activities, Executive Order 13694 of April 1, 2015,” Federal Register 80, no. 63 (April 2, 2015).\n²⁶ Council Regulation 2019/796 of May 17, 2019, concerning restrictive measures against cyber-attacks threatening the Union or its Member States, 2019 O.J.

They do not fit neatly into the definition of cyberattack promulgated by the U.S. National Institute of Technology and Standards: “An attack, via cyberspace, targeting an enterprise’s use of cyberspace for the purpose of disrupting, disabling, destroying, or maliciously controlling a computing environment/infrastructure; or destroying the integrity of the data or stealing controlled information.”³² For example, monitoring dissidents or using social media to promote narratives online does not necessarily compromise data confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Still, the United States and Europe have considered them harmful enough uses of information and communications technologies to warrant punishment. For this reason, sanctions falling under the cyber-specific framework, as well as others related to cyber-enabled influence operations and human rights violations, are included within the scope of this paper.\n## “Cyber sanctions” to date\nWith these definitional concerns in mind, this section provides a brief overview of the cyber sanctions imposed to date in both the United States and Europe.\nExecutive Order 13694, which created the United States’ cyber-specific sanctions framework, “declare[d] a national emergency with respect to the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States posed by the increasing prevalence and severity of malicious cyber-enabled activities originating from or directed by, persons located, in whole or in substantial part, outside the United States.”³³\nSo far, the United States has imposed thirty-five tranches of sanctions related to malicious cyber activity under both the cyber-specific framework and other country-specific and horizontal\n³⁰ For example, the EU sanctioned Abdolsamad Khoramabadi, head of the Committee to Determine Instances of Criminal Content, in March 2013, and the United States later imposed sanctions in May 2018.

These designations involve entities linked to Iran, North Korea, Russia, China, and Nigeria. The earliest designations, dating back to 2012 (made under an Executive Order on terrorism-related sanctions), dealt with Iranian government officials and entities participating in computer hacking projects with Hezbollah.³⁴ Since then, the United States has sanctioned a range of cybercriminals and nation-state hackers. These include North Korean actors that participated in the 2014 hack of Sony Pictures, Russian actors engaged in cyber-enabled election interference, and Iranian actors targeting U.S. financial institutions.³⁵ Since 2012, the United States has sanctioned over 250 individuals and entities for engaging in or enabling malicious cyber activity. (For a complete list of incidents, see Table 1.) The majority have been of Iranian, Russian, or North Korean origin. In the first half of 2020, however, the United States took action against two Chinese nationals for aiding Lazarus Group’s efforts to launder money, as well as six Nigerian individuals engaged in business email compromise and romance fraud scams.³⁶\nIn statements on the Executive Order, policymakers highlighted the “significant increase in the frequency, scale, and sophistication of cyber incidents targeting the American people” to justify its signing.³⁷ Absent in many of these statements are clear articulations of how the administration would evaluate these sanctions’ effectiveness. In a blog post following the signing of the April 2015 Executive Order, White House counterterrorism advisor Lisa Monica explained that policymakers hoped to “deter” and “impose costs” on adversaries.³⁸ But the specific means by which the U.S. Department of the Treasury would evaluate the program’s effectiveness remain unclear.

As Zachary Goldman and Damon McCoy have pointed out, “different kinds of malicious cyber activity demand different, tailored, deterrence strategies. This is because each category of cyber threat has a different motivation, and therefore will be sensitive to a different type of cost.”51 Nation-state hackers with political goals are unlikely to suffer the same consequences of a sanctions designation that independent cybercriminals with financial motivations will suffer. Similarly, designating a government official orchestrating an attack is unlikely to have the same impact as designating an individual two or three steps removed that launders money on behalf of a hacking group.\nTwo things complicate the effort to neatly distinguish between categories like cybercrime and nation-state activity and state and non-state actors. First, the convergence of financially-motivated cybercrime and nation-state activity makes it difficult to separate cyberattacks conducted for purely economic gain and those undertaken for political purposes.52 North Korean efforts to raise funds for its weapons of mass destruction program through cyber theft and ransom operations against financial institutions and cryptocurrency exchanges have demonstrated the difficulty of separating financial motivations from political goals.53 Similarly, state-sponsored economic espionage emanating from China blurs the distinction between financial and political aims as the theft of intellectual property aims to “support its strategic development goals—science and technology advancement, military modernization, and economic policy objectives.”54\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nSecond, the use of proxies for conducting offensive cyber operations often precludes a neat division between state and non-state actors in cyberspace. Tim Maurer’s comprehensive overview of the use of proxies for accomplishing offensive cyber operations details the spectrum of relationships between states and their proxies.⁵⁵ These relationships range from overt delegation of activity to loose orchestration to passive enablement of proxy behavior. In the latter cases, those operating at a state’s behest may also have a foot in the criminal world. For example, in 2019, Treasury alleged that a Russian cybercriminal indicted and sanctioned for developing and distributing malware also operated on behalf of the Russian government, “highlighting the Russian government’s enlistment of cybercriminals for its own malicious purposes.”⁵⁶\n## Evaluating effectiveness\nIt is not within the remit of external observers to assess whether cyber sanctions effectively achieve deterrence. Much of the information needed to make such an assessment is classified or privately owned intelligence. Though Treasury publicly reports the value of transactions blocked under specific sanctions programs, others have pointed out that evaluating the success of cyber sanctions based on the financial value of prevented transactions is misleading.⁵⁷ Therefore, it is difficult for policymakers to attribute any observed decrease in malicious cyber activity or change in activity to sanctions or determine whether activity levels would be even greater absent the threat of sanctions or imposition.\nWithin the U.S. government, Treasury’s Office of Intelligence and Analysis (OIA) and the State Department’s Bureau of Intelligence and Research perform impact assessments.⁵⁸ According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), which published a review of U.S. sanctions programs and their effectiveness in 2019, “These assessments analyze the impacts of specific sanctions on a particular aspect of the sanction’s target—for example, the sanctions’ impact on the target country’s economy or trade.”⁵⁹ OIA, for example, conducts impact assessments before a sanctions designation and after its imposition and may include factors like the target’s U.S.-\n⁵⁵ Maurer, *Cyber Mercenaries*, 42-49.\n⁵⁶ “Treasury Sanctions Evil Corp, the Russia-Based Cybercriminal Group Behind Dridex Malware,” U.S. Department of the Treasury, December 5, 2019, https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm845,\n⁵⁷ Annie Fixler and Eric Lorber, “Counting Pennies Underestimates the Value of Treasury’s Cyber Sanctions,” Foundation for Defense of Democracies, November 4, 2019, https://www.fdd.org/analysis/2019/11/04/counting-pennies-underestimates-the-value-of-treasurys-cyber-sanctions/.\n⁵⁸ Kimberly Gianopoulos, “Economic Sanctions: Agencies Assess Impacts on Targets, and Studies Suggest Several Factors Contribute to Sanctions’ Effectiveness,” U.S. Government Accountability Office, October 2019, 12, https://www.gao.gov/assets/710/701891.pdf.\n⁵⁹ Ibid.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nbased assets, global holdings, and interactions with the United States and the potential cascading consequences of a sanctions designation.⁶⁰\nHowever, the report acknowledges that “these assessments do not analyze sanctions’ overall effectiveness in achieving broader U.S. policy goals or objectives, such as whether the sanctions are advancing the national security and policy priorities of the United States” (emphasis added).⁶¹ OIA distinguishes between impact and effect in its assessments:\nAccording to OIA officials, assessing impact is analyzing the potential or observed effect of the sanction on the target. According to officials, impact can be focused on a singular target or could be broader, such as the impact on the target country’s economy or trade flows. In contrast, OIA views effectiveness as the extent to which a sanctions program is achieving the overall broader policy goals of the sanctions program, such as ultimately altering or deterring specific behaviors of the target or furthering U.S. national security priorities [Emphasis added].⁶²\nThe latter considerations come into play during National Security Council-led interagency discussions: The process “allows the U.S. government to draw upon multiple agencies’ inputs and perspectives, and to consider these issues in the larger policy context, because sanctions are often only one element of broader government-wide strategies to achieve U.S. policy goals.”⁶³\nEven within government, assessing the effectiveness of sanctions at achieving broader policy goals like deterrence is difficult. GAO’s report highlights that policymakers have difficulty isolating sanctions’ effects from those of other policy tools, dealing with shifting policy objectives, and identifying useful data for conducting assessments.⁶⁴\nThe threat of sanctions raises an additional challenge for evaluating effectiveness.⁶⁵ In at least one notable instance pertaining to Chinese cyber-enabled economic espionage, U.S. threats to impose sanctions may have contributed to the signing of a diplomatic agreement between then-\n⁶⁰ Ibid., 13-14.\n⁶¹ Ibid., 12.\n⁶² Ibid.\n⁶³ Ibid., 12.\n⁶⁴ Ibid., 17-18.\n⁶⁵ See, for example, Daniel Drezner’s work on selection bias in evaluations of sanctions programs, which suggests that sanctions are more effective than most analyses contend because they miss instances in which sanctions are threatened but not imposed: “in focusing only on those instances when sanctions have been imposed, policy analysts have overlooked the significant number of instances in which the threat of coercion did not have to be carried out.” Daniel Drezner, “The Hidden Hand of Economic Coercion,” International Organization 57, no. 3 : 654-655, https://doi.org/10.1017/S0020818303573052.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\npresident Obama and President Xi. Reporting at the end of August 2015 suggested that the Obama administration was preparing a sanctions package against Chinese targets under the framework.⁶⁶ Just weeks later, in September of that year, Obama and Xi met in Washington to announce a moratorium on the cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property for commercial advantage.⁶⁷ In remarks on the deal, Obama alluded to the leverage created by the sanctions E.O. in stating, “I did indicate to President Xi that we will apply those and whatever other tools we have in our toolkit to go after cyber criminals, either retrospectively or prospectively.”⁶⁸ And in the words of then-Assistant Attorney General John Carlin, “That changed China.”⁶⁹ According to a report from the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, the number of detected Chinese cyberattacks diminished following the bilateral agreement.⁷⁰ But the evidence of the deal’s success was not conclusive.⁷¹,⁷² One report from threat intelligence company FireEye highlighted that the number of attacks began dropping at least a year before the agreement.⁷³ This case illustrates further the difficulty of isolating sanctions’ effects and evaluating the counterfactual of how adversaries might behave if not for the threat of sanctions.\nThe academic literature on the success of targeted financial sanctions is neither entirely optimistic nor conclusive.⁷⁴ One estimate of UN targeted sanctions’ success rate suggests that targeted sanctions are effective just 22 percent of the time.⁷⁵ Breaking that figure down by\n⁶⁶ Ellen Nakashima, “U.S. developing sanctions against China over cyberthefts,” *Washington Post*, August 30, 2015, https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/administration-developing-sanctions-against-china-over-cyberespionage/2015/08/30/9b2910aa-480b-11e5-8ab4-c73967a143d3_story.html?utm_term=.2ed69dd30154.\n⁶⁷ Office of the Press Secretary, “Remarks by President Obama and President Xi of the People’s Republic of China in Joint Press Conference,” White House, September 25, 2015, https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2015/09/25/remarks-president-obama-and-president-xi-peoples-republic-china-joint.\n⁶⁸ Ibid.\n⁶⁹ John Carlin, in “American Cybersecurity Experts: ‘No Trespassing,’” Aspen Strategy Forum, August 22, 2016, at 10:41, https://www.aspeninstitute.org/blog-posts/no-trespassing-experts-american-cybersecurity/.\n⁷⁰ National Counterintelligence and Security Center, “Foreign Economic Espionage in Cyberspace,” 7.\n⁷¹ Ben Buchanan and Robert D.

After surveying sanctions experts, they report, “A remarkable 27 out of 30 survey respondents – 90 percent – agreed with the contention that sanctions against state actors like Iran were more effective than sanctions against non-state actors like al Qaeda.”^[79]^ A recent review of the academic literature highlights the impact of sanctions on non-state actors as a gap in existing scholarship^[80]^—a fact particularly challenging for policymakers evaluating sanctions’ effectiveness against non-state and proxy cyber threats. Perhaps the most damning factor concerning the inconclusiveness of the academic literature is that even amongst academics “what counts as ‘effective’ (or ‘successful’) itself has been a contentious issue.”^[81]^\n## Factors for consideration\nStill, in trying to assess the effectiveness of cyber sanctions, policymakers should look at three key factors:\n(1) A target’s vulnerability to economic pressure,\n(2) The motivations underpinning offensive activity, and\n(3) How chosen targets support malicious activity.\n## Vulnerability to economic pressure\nDespite the lack of consensus regarding sanctions’ aims, those who have surveyed the academic literature note that a target’s vulnerability to economic pressure is critical for sanctions’ effectiveness. As one group of researchers put it, “the data suggest that the types of financial sanctions that have been deployed against states in the last two decades should have a greater\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nimpact on the decisionmaking [sic] of states for which attractiveness to international trade and investment is strategically significant.”⁸² In the cyber domain, this means that policymakers should pay attention to specific nation-state cyber threats that may be vulnerable to economic pressure. A sanction against an Iranian or North Korean government entity, for example, is unlikely to disrupt capabilities in the same way that a designation of a Russian entity might. U.S. sanctions have isolated Iran and North Korea from the global financial system,⁸³ so additional targeted sanctions may be unlikely to significantly affect the ability to carry out future attacks or enjoy their proceeds. Indeed, these two actors have made the financial system the target of cyberattacks.⁸⁴ However, actors elsewhere may be more exposed to the influence of the U.S. dollar or the euro in global financial markets and, therefore, more likely to pay attention to the punitive consequences of a sanction or have their capabilities disrupted as a result. For example, Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, alleged that his net worth dropped by 80 percent—over $7 billion—as a result of U.S. sanctions related to “a range of malign activity around the globe,” including malicious cyber activity, imposed in 2018.⁸⁵\n## Actors’ motivations\nThe motives underpinning malicious cyber activity also affect an actor's vulnerability to sanctions. As mentioned above, Goldman and McCoy have argued that sanctions are an appropriate policy tool for dealing with financially motivated cyber threats—like cyber-enabled economic espionage—because they undermine the goal of the activity: profit.⁸⁶ By preventing malicious actors from accessing and moving money, sanctions make it “more difficult for them\n⁸² Rosenberg, et al., “The New Tools of Economic Warfare,” 15.\n⁸³ Ian Talley, “U.S. Moves to Further Isolate Iran From Global Financial System,” *Wall Street Journal*, October 25, 2019, https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-moves-to-further-isolate-iran-from-global-financial-system-11572025978; David Sanger and Michael Corkery, “Treasury Imposes Sanctions on North Korea, Cutting Access to Banks,” *New York Times*, June 1, 2016, https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/02/world/asia/treasury-imposes-sanctions-on-north-korea.html.\n⁸⁴ “Treasury Targets Supporters of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Networks Responsible for Cyber-Attacks Against the United States,” U.S. Department of the Treasury; “Treasury Targets North Korea for Multiple Cyber-Attacks,” U.S. Department of the Treasury; “Treasury Sanctions North Korean State-Sponsored Malicious Cyber Groups,” U.S. Department of the Treasury.\n⁸⁵ David Dawkins, “Russian Billionaire Oleg Deripaska Describes U.S. Money Laundering Accusations As ‘Mish-Mash Of Total Nonsense,’” *Forbes*, February 14, 2020, https://www.forbes.com/sites/daviddawkins/2020/02/14/report-russian-billionaire-oleg-deripaska-accused-by-us-agency-of-laundering-funds-for-vladimir-putin/#7b2a95c0c4bc; “Treasury Designates Russian Oligarchs, Officials, and Entities in Response to Worldwide Malign Activity,” U.S. Department of the Treasury, April 6, 2018, https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm0338.\n⁸⁶ Goldman and McCoy, “Deterring Financially Motivated Cybercrime,” 602.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nto use the proceeds of their crimes.”⁸⁷ Sanctions may fail to dissuade financially motivated actors from engaging in wrongful behavior if the profitability of the action outweighs the financial costs of sanctions. Still, the profit motive may make these actors more sensitive to sanctions than a politically motivated actor would be.⁸⁸ Russian actors engaged in hack and leak operations or attacks on international organizations are not as likely to be dissuaded from engaging in their activity because sanctions have made it unprofitable if profitability was not necessarily a preeminent goal.\n## Means of supporting wrongful activity\nThe specific choice of target and whose behavioral change is the goal of sanctions are also likely to bear on how policymakers should evaluate effectiveness. Once policymakers have identified malicious activity, they can choose to go after several different targets, including the state actors that directed, orchestrated, or enabled the attack; the individuals directly engaged in the attack; or those that provide material, financial, or technological support for the attack. Again, these actors are not equally vulnerable to the effects of sanctions. Government officials that enjoy the backing and protection of the state may be less likely to be deterred than those whose legitimate commercial interests are at stake by aiding targets in circumventing sanctions. As one group of researchers at the Center for a New American Security put it, “To the extent that sanctions on non-state actors are focused on coercing a change in behavior, that strategy may have the greatest impact on the ecosystem of actual and would-be supporters of those groups, rather than on the groups themselves.”⁸⁹ Simultaneously, sanctions can go after a specific target to change a third party’s behavior—returning to the Deripaska example described above, sanctioning Russian oligarchs was partly meant to signal to the Russian state that its conduct was unacceptable and leverage elite pain for behavioral change.⁹⁰\n## Effectiveness as opposed to what?\nEvaluating the impacts of sanctions cannot ignore the alternative instruments available to states\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n⁸⁷ John Carlin, “Detect, Disrupt, Deter: A Whole-of-Government Approach to National Security Cyber Threats,” *Harvard National Security Journal* 7, (2016): 420, https://harvardnsj.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2016/06/Carlin-FINAL.pdf.\n⁸⁸ The impact of sanctions on an adversary’s risk calculus could potentially backfire if financially motivated actors are deterred from engaging in the lowest levels of criminal activity, which may generate profits incommensurate with the absorbed risk, but continue to engage in highly profitable but extremely destabilizing attacks.\n⁸⁹ Rosenberg, et al., “The New Tools of Economic Warfare,” 28.\n⁹⁰ “Treasury Designates Russian Oligarchs, Officials, and Entities in Response to Worldwide Malign Activity,” U.S. Department of the Treasury.\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nseeking to respond to wrongful behavior in cyberspace.⁹¹ This paper situates sanctions within the DIME(LE) framework to highlight the point that policymakers face the choice not of sanctioning or doing nothing but of sanctioning or releasing a diplomatic statement or responding with a retaliatory cyberattack or of doing nothing or of doing several of these. In the U.S. context, in particular, policymakers have adopted a “whole-of-government” approach to countering malicious cyber activity—in essence, one that involves all of the tools of statecraft outlined in the DIME(LE).⁹²,⁹³ As a result, sanctions have frequently followed criminal charges against malicious cyber actors. Sixteen of the thirty-five instances in which the United States imposed cyber sanctions were preceded by an indictment of at least one of the sanctioned individuals—providing useful context for understanding the range of available tools for imposing costs on malicious cyber actors.\nWhere effectiveness is concerned, sanctions, in theory, may have more “teeth” than indictments because their enforcement does not rely on an actor setting foot in a country with which a state pursuing charges has an extradition treaty. As others have noted, the U.S. strategy of charging foreign-linked hackers is unlikely to result in many hackers ever appearing in U.S. courts.⁹⁴ However, there have been some important exceptions. Three members of the FIN7 cybercrime group were arrested in Spain in 2018, two of which have been extradited,⁹⁵ and in May 2020, authorities arrested another member of the organization in Seattle.⁹⁶\nJack Goldsmith and Robert Williams have questioned whether the public attribution of cyberattacks through criminal charges is counterproductive. They argue: “When the main public response to cybertheft that has reached crisis proportions is to identify the perpetrators but not\n⁹¹ David Baldwin, “The Sanctions Debate and the Logic of Choice,” *International Security* 24, no. 3 : 84.\n⁹² Though law enforcement action is included in this typology, others have noted that the decision to bring criminal charges is a thoroughly independent decision and that prosecutorial independence is part of what makes the tool effective. Indictments against foreign hackers are not themselves political tools, but the decision to unseal an indictment can be. See Garrett Hinck and Tim Maurer, “Persistent enforcement: Criminal Charges as a Response to Nation-State Malicious Cyber Activity,” *Journal of National Security Law and Policy* 10, no. 3 (2020): 535, https://jnslp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Criminal-Charges-as-a-Response-to-Nation-State-Malicious-Cyber-Activity.pdf.\n⁹³ John Carlin, “Detect, Disrupt, Deter,” 394.\n⁹⁴ Ibid., 527.\n⁹⁵ Office of Public Affairs, “Three Members of Notorious International Cybercrime Group ‘Fin7’ In Custody for Role in Attacking Over 100 U.S. Companies,” U.S. Department of Justice, August 1, 2018, https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/three-members-notorious-international-cybercrime-group-fin7-custody-role-attacking-over-100; Jeff Stone, “Alleged FIN7 hacking director Andrii Kolpakov set to be extradited to the U.S.,” Cyberscoop, May 9, 2019, https://www.cyberscoop.com/fin7-andrii-kolpakov-extradition-spain/.\n⁹⁶ Shannon Vavra, “Federal officials have arrested another accused FIN7 hacker,” Cyberscoop, May 26, 2020, https://www.cyberscoop.com/fin7-hacking-arrest-financial/.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\npunish them, the main signal to adversaries (especially third parties who are watching) is that the United States is extraordinarily defenseless.”⁹⁷ Sanctions, by contrast, create real financial consequences for malicious actors by relying on the preeminence of the U.S. dollar and the euro in global financial transactions. Sanctions are enforced not by the U.S. government or EU alone but by financial institutions that risk exposing themselves to secondary sanctions. As a result, they may better demonstrate the costs of engaging in wrongful behavior and, therefore, deter adversaries.\nSanctions, however, face limitations. Sophisticated actors can identify ways to evade sanctions, sometimes through cyberattacks.⁹⁸ Last fall, a United Nations panel of experts report detailed North Korea’s efforts to circumvent sanctions and raise money for its weapons of mass destruction program by attacking the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) and cryptocurrency exchanges, executing ransomware attacks, and mining cryptocurrency.⁹⁹,¹⁰⁰ The risk of evasion poses a threat to the efficacy of targeted financial sanctions as it “undermines the credibility of the senders, because the inability to implement and enforce the measures is often interpreted as signaling the lack of power of the sender.”¹⁰¹ And in the longer-term, actors may be compelled to seek alternate financial architectures to avoid the hassle of evading sanctions.\nThe broader point of comparing sanctions and indictments is that sanctions are just one of the tools that governments can employ against malicious cyber actors.

As early as 2013, Treasury had designated Liberty Reserve, a virtual currency provider, as a “financial institution of primary money laundering concern,” and in November 2018, the U.S. Department of the Treasury included in a designation the Bitcoin wallet addresses of two Iranian individuals. See “Treasury Identifies Virtual Currency Provider Liberty Reserve as a Financial Institution of Primary Money Laundering Concern under USA Patriot Act Section 311,” U.S. Department of the Treasury, May 28, 2013, https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl1956.aspx; “Treasury Designates Iran-Based Financial Facilitators of Malicious Cyber Activity and for the First Time Identifies Associated Digital Currency Addresses,” U.S. Department of the Treasury, November 28, 2018, https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm556.\n¹⁰¹ Francesco Giumelli, How EU sanctions work: A new narrative (Luxembourg: Publications Office of the European Union, 2013), 39, https://www.iss.europa.eu/sites/default/files/EUISSFiles/Chaillot_129.pdf. new narrative.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nof sanctions must take into account the alternatives. In the U.S. context, the NSC-led interagency process provides a forum for discussing the effectiveness of sanctions relative to other policy instruments.¹⁰² But as with academic literature on the efficacy of sanctions on non-state actors, Dursun Peksen argues that scholarly work on the utility of sanctions relative to other policy instruments is similarly lacking.¹⁰³\nNonetheless, as policymakers impose sanctions, they must consider the potential escalatory consequences and how alternative policy instruments might compare. Rosenberg and Tama highlight the need to better assess where sanctions sit on the escalation ladder to strengthen their signaling value and ensure that efforts at cross-domain deterrence do not inadvertently compromise broader foreign policy objectives.¹⁰⁴ As they put it, “if it is unclear whether an airstrike against a military facility is higher or lower on the escalation ladder than financial sanctions targeting a country’s most important economic sector, the target government may not understand the likely consequences of continuing to flout an international norm or U.S. demands.”¹⁰⁵\nCompared to actions like diplomatic statements, sanctions may be perceived as more escalatory since they aim to impose real financial costs and disrupt an operations’ financing. But in comparison to retaliatory cyberattacks or other military action, they may be less escalatory because their contours are narrowly defined, and policymakers can couple sanctions with clear statements of intention.¹⁰⁶ The EU’s sanctions, which refrain from attributing responsibility for an attack to a specific state, may be less escalatory than those imposed by the United States,¹⁰⁷ which, as described above, can and sometimes do allege state responsibility for wrongful behavior.\nIf adversaries see sanctions as escalatory, they may retaliate. Sanctions have generated such retaliation: Iran retaliated for U.S. sanctions with cyberattacks against the financial system. Russia responded to the passage of the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions\n¹⁰² Gianopolous, “Economic Sanctions,” 18.\n¹⁰³ Peksen, “When Do Imposed Economic Sanctions Work?,” 8-9.\n¹⁰⁴ Elizabeth Rosenberg and Jordan Tama, “Strengthening the Economic Arsenal,” Center for a New American Security, December 2019, 8-9, https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/strengthening-the-economic-arsenal.\n¹⁰⁵ Ibid., 9.\n¹⁰⁶ I thank Michael Daniel for highlighting this point.\n¹⁰⁷ I thank Patryk Pawlak for highlighting this point.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nAct (CAATSA) with reductions in the number of diplomatic staff.¹⁰⁸ (Perhaps somewhat counterproductively, Iran’s cyberattacks invited further sanctions.¹⁰⁹)\n## Long-term effectiveness\nThe point raised above about sanctions evasion speaks to a broader concern about how the effectiveness of sanctions might change over time, potentially providing either diminishing returns or jeopardizing the United States’ ability to pursue its policy goals. As Peter Feaver and Eric Lorber have put it, targeted financial sanctions rely on calculations about business risk, and “If global business conditions change, the firms might re-calculate that engaging in financial transactions with those targeted states outweighs the costs.”¹¹⁰ This risk of such re-calculation may be heightened if sanctions create incentives for businesses to pursue transactions in other currencies or for countries to develop alternative financial architectures.¹¹¹\nThese concerns—and consideration of cyber sanctions generally—cannot be divorced from the broader context in which the United States has aggressively pursued the use of sanctions to achieve a range of foreign policy goals, sometimes to the detriment of ally relationships. Two particular issues are worth highlighting: 1) the credibility of sanctions commitments and 2) the use of secondary sanctions.¹¹²\nThe credibility of broader sanctions commitments matters for evaluating the effectiveness of cyber sanctions at deterrence. Elizabeth Rosenberg and Jordan Tama have noted that sanctions’ effectiveness depends on the credibility of both the threat to designate targets for wrongful behavior and the promise to lift sanctions if behavior changes.¹¹³ The United States’ withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) illustrates how failure to do the latter can undermine broader foreign policy goals. As Rosenberg and Tama write, “By walking away from\n¹⁰⁸ Ellen Nakashima, “Iran blamed for cyberattacks on U.S. banks and companies,” *Washington Post*, September 21, 2012, https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/iran-blamed-for-cyberattacks/2012/09/21/afbe2be4-0412-11e2-9b24-ff730c7f6312_story.html; Neil MacFarquhar, “Putin, Responding to Sanctions, Orders U.S. to Cut Diplomatic Staff by 755,” *New York Times*, July 30, 2017, https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/30/world/europe/russia-sanctions-us-diplomats-expelled.html\n¹⁰⁹ “Treasury Targets Supporters of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Networks Responsible for Cyber-Attacks Against the United States,” U.S. Department of the Treasury.\n¹¹⁰ Peter Feaver and Eric Lorber, “Coercive Diplomacy and the New Financial Levers: Evaluating the Intended and Unintended Consequences of Financial Sanctions,” *Legatum Institute*, November 2010, 44, https://lif.blob.core.windows.net/lif/docs/default-source/publications/2010-publications-coercive-diplomacy.pdf?Status=Temp&amp;sfvrsn=2.\n¹¹¹ Ibid., 46-47.\n¹¹² I thank Allison Peters and Ariel (Eli) Levite for highlighting these important points.\n¹¹³ Rosenberg and Tama, “Strengthening the Economic Arsenal,” 5.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nthose allies and partners, the United States has made them less inclined to privilege cooperation in the future.”¹¹⁴\nIn the U.S. context, the two-pronged approach to creating new sanctions frameworks further complicates the delisting process. Legal authorities in the United States for imposing sanctions can be created through executive or legislative means. U.S. sanctions remain in place until a target appeals to OFAC and demonstrates a change in behavior that warrants delisting (and the burden is on designated individuals and entities to present a basis for delisting) or until Congress votes to lift the sanctions.¹¹⁵ Congressionally mandated sanctions provide an essential check on executive action to impose sanctions unilaterally. But if Congress refuses to lift sanctions in response to behavioral change, they undermine the tool’s credibility. (By contrast to U.S. sanctions, EU sanctions are reviewed annually.¹¹⁶ In some ways, this may enhance the instrument’s credibility.)\nEfforts to understand the effectiveness of the United States’ cyber sanctions must also contend with the legislative authorities that provide for secondary sanctions. Secondary sanctions refer to “the threat of US sanctions against foreign individuals and entities for engaging in specified activities that may not have a US nexus.”¹¹⁷ In the context of cyber sanctions, these include provisions enshrined within CAATSA for imposing sanctions against individuals and entities that engage in “significant transactions” with certain Russian government entities¹¹⁸ and their personnel.¹¹⁹ Secondary sanctions are different from provisions that allow governments to target those that provide “technical, financial, or material support” to previously designated actors.

Many are quick to point out that China faces several obstacles to achieving such a goal.¹²⁷ Still, as former senior Treasury adviser Elizabeth Rosenberg points out, “sanctions do give China’s economic ambitions an undeniable boost.”¹²⁸ Especially as financial technologies—like cryptocurrencies—introduce new ways for criminals to launder money,¹²⁹ the continued use of sanctions may ¹²¹ “Russia sanctions: EU vows to retaliate over US measures,” BBC, July 26, 2017, https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40727044; Paul Ivan, “The US and the EU need a stronger dialogue on Russia,” European Policy Centre, May 2, 2018, https://www.epc.eu/en/Publications/The-US-and-the-EU-need-a-stronger-dialogue-on-Russia-sanctions~1e70f8; Karen DeYoung, “Three European allies ask U.S. not to enforce secondary sanctions over Iran trade,” Washington Post, June 6, 2018, https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/three-european-allies-ask-us-not-to-enforce-secondary-sanctions-over-iran-trade/2018/06/06/f4c94594-69c3-11e8-bea7-c8eb28bc52b1_story.html.\n¹²² Ellie Geranmayeh and Manuel Lafont Rapnouil, “Meeting the Challenge of Secondary Sanctions,” European Council on Foreign Relations, June 2019, 4, 7, https://www.ecfr.eu/publications/summary/meeting_the_challenge_of_secondary_sanctions.\n¹²³ Drezner, “Targeted Sanctions in a World of Global Finance,” 760-761.\n¹²⁴ Jignesh Davda, “China, Russia &amp; India Push Forward on SWIFT Alternative,” Yahoo!

The potential backlash to Washington’s gung-ho attitude toward financial sanctions may occur on a longer time horizon but carries arguably more significant consequence for U.S. global power.\nThe potential consequences mean that policymakers evaluating the effectiveness of cyber sanctions at deterring wrongful behavior must also consider the long-term trajectory of the tool’s use and how decisions within the broader foreign policy context affect the reception of sanctions.\n## Moving beyond deterrence A general emphasis on deterrence obscures the variety of different functions that sanctions can perform and the diversity of motives underpinning malicious cyber activity. Few, if any, policymakers would argue that the outright cessation of malicious cyber activity is a realistic goal that could be achieved by targeted financial sanctions. Given that some, like North Korea, pursue cybercrime as a means of sanctions evasion, one might even argue that sanctions are counterproductive if the goal is understood to stop malicious cyber activity.^[130]^ As described above, the academic and policy literature on the effectiveness of cyber sanctions at deterrence is difficult to measure. So why do policymakers continue to employ sanctions in the seeming absence of compelling evidence about their effectiveness?\nThe academic literature on targeted sanctions has attempted to account for some of the different aims of sanctions and the diverse threats they can target by introducing three potential purposes—constraint, coercion, and signaling.^[131]^ Even these, however, ignore the nuanced and specific purposes for imposing sanctions in response to malicious cyber activity. To say that a sanctions designation aims to “signal,” for example, ignores important features of the message itself, its intended audience, and its contribution to the broader goal of sending a message by sanctioning.\nOthers divide the purposes of sanctions into “symbolic” or “expressive” and “instrumental” ones.^[132]^ Symbolic or expressive purposes relate to the political interests served by doing something in response to wrongful behavior—i.e., signaling. Instrumental objectives relate to desired policy or behavior changes—i.e., coercion and constraint.\n^[130]^ Elizabeth Rosenberg and Neil Bhatiya, “Busting North Korea’s Sanctions Evasion,” Center for a New American Security, March 4, 2020, https://www.cnas.org/publications/commentary/busting-north-koreas-sanctions-evasion.\n^[131]^ Giumelli, *How EU sanctions work*, 18-19.\n^[132]^ Taehee Whang, “Playing to the Home Crowd?

The degree to which a state might be responsible for malicious activity varies from an inability to prevent malicious attacks to active participation in an attack.¹³⁵ Sanctions designations are public listings that name individuals or entities in response to malicious behavior. As Kristen Eichensehr has argued, they can attribute wrongful conduct by naming the individual or entity that directly perpetrated a cyberattack or indicating state responsibility for an attack.¹³⁶ This is not always the case. Because targets can be sanctioned for materially, financially, or technologically enabling a previously designated actor, they do not always publicize attribution in the sense of identifying hackers. And because ascertaining the nature of the relationship between a state and a hacker can be difficult, not all sanctions allege that a state enabled or orchestrated wrongful behavior in cyberspace.\nBut in some cases, sanctions do serve to implicate a state in malicious cyber activity. For example, in September 2019, the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) named Lazarus ¹³³ Hinck and Maurer, “Persistent enforcement,” 531-534.\n¹³⁴ Herb Lin, “Attribution of Malicious Cyber Incidents,” Aegis Paper Series No. 1607, Hoover Institution, n.d., 5, https://www.hoover.org/sites/default/files/research/docs/lin_webready.pdf.\n¹³⁵ Herb Lin draws on Jason Healey’s piece, “Beyond Attribution: Seeking National Responsibility for Cyber Attacks,” in outlining the different degrees of responsibility; Ibid., 18.

Within the EU, attribution is a “sovereign political decision” left up to each member state’s discretion.¹³⁸ As a result, EU sanctions designations avoid making a specific link between a designated individual or entity and a state sponsor, even when, as in the case of the July 2020 Russian targets, some of the listed individuals may work on behalf of government agencies or may be government agencies themselves.¹³⁹,¹⁴⁰ Though attribution is also a sovereign political decision in the United States, the process is more straightforward—there is no need to wrangle the agreement of twenty-seven member states to attribute.\nIndependent of the political reasons for (not) attributing a cyberattack, not all jurisdictions are equally competent in their ability to attribute. States differ in their ability to identify technical and political indicators of compromise and use signals, human, and open-source intelligence to understand them.¹⁴¹ As one RAND Corporation report put it, “These capabilities may not be widespread globally, and very few countries are thought to possess sophisticated all-source capabilities.”¹⁴² ## Information-sharing¹⁴³ The press releases that accompany sanctions designations sometimes contain important information about how malicious actors carry out their attacks. Though formal information-sharing mechanisms exist in both the United States and the European Union, many involve a ¹³⁷ “Treasury Sanctions North Korean State-Sponsored Malicious Cyber Groups,” U.S. Department of the Treasury.\n¹³⁸ Botek, “European Union establishes a sanction regime for cyber-attacks.”\n¹³⁹ Council Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/1125 of July 30, 2020, O.J. (246) 4.\n¹⁴⁰ Researchers at the European Union Institute for Security Studies describe the threshold for placing responsibility for a cyber operation on a state as defined by two criteria: “the cyber operation is attributed to that state and constitutes an internationally wrongful act. To be attributable to that state, the operation must have been carried out by one of its organs or by another actor acting on its behalf. A cyber operation attributable to a state may constitute an internationally wrongful act if it violates a norm of international law.” See Patryk Pawlak, Thomas Biersteker, and François Delerue, *Guardian of the galaxy: EU cyber sanctions and norms in cyberspace*, eds.

In the United States, for example, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) Exchange is a Treasury-led “voluntary public-private information sharing partnership among law enforcement, financial institutions, and FinCEN aimed at effectively and efficiently combating money laundering, terrorism financing, organized crime, and other financial crimes; protecting the financial system from illicit use; and promoting national security.”¹⁴⁴ Additionally, the Bank Secrecy Act Advisory Group (BSAAG) is “the means by which Treasury receives advice on the operations of the Bank Secrecy Act,” a key piece of U.S. law regarding money laundering.¹⁴⁵ Made of up representatives from federal agencies, financial institutions, and trade groups, BSAAG is chaired by the FinCEN director.¹⁴⁶ Though these mechanisms are essential means of sharing information, the participating institutions and representatives are limited.\nHowever, public press releases can garner the attention of a broader set of stakeholders with sanctions compliance obligations and can aid in disseminating information related to cyber threats. For example, the United States’ designation of Nigerian cybercriminals contained details of how Richard Uzuh and his co-conspirators spoofed emails from business executives to trick Americans into wiring money.¹⁴⁷ ## Audience satisfaction Sanctions may satisfy the political pressure to “do something” in response to malicious cyber activity.¹⁴⁸ As Richard Hanania has argued, sanctions have a significant political purpose insofar as they “appear to be a moderate and measured response to unacceptable behavior abroad.”¹⁴⁹ And they are a safe option for policymakers because the targets—foreign publics—cannot easily influence American politics (i.e., vote), and, therefore, “there is little reason to suspect that their ¹⁴⁴ Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, “FinCEN Exchange Questions and Answers,” U.S. Department of the Treasury, https://www.fincen.gov/index.php/resources/fincen-exchange/fincen-exchange-frequently-asked-questions.\n¹⁴⁵ U.S. Department of the Treasury, Notice, “Financial Crimes Enforcement Network; Bank Secrecy Act Advisory Group; Solicitation of Application for Membership,” *Federal Register* 83, no. 248 (December 28, 2018): 67487, https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2018-12-28/pdf/2018-28178.pdf.\n¹⁴⁶ Ibid.\n¹⁴⁷ “Treasury Sanctions Nigerian Cyber Actors for Targeting U.S. Businesses and Individuals,” U.S. Department of the Treasury.\n¹⁴⁸ William Kaempfer and Anton Lowenberg, “The Political Economy of Economic Sanctions,” in *Handbook of Defense Economics, Volume 2*, ed.

In some cases, sanctions are met with laudatory statements from allied governments. For example, the United States released such a message when the European Union imposed cyber sanctions for the first time in July 2020.¹⁵³ ## Cooperation with allies Given that both the United States and European Union have legal frameworks to impose sanctions against malicious cyber actors, there is a potential cooperative dimension to the policy. Some have suggested that sanctions work better when there are concerted efforts among states to restrict an actor’s capabilities and deny its action’s benefits because it limits the actor’s ability to mitigate losses in other markets.¹⁵⁴ Even without cooperative effort, sanctions can signal to members of the international community a shared commitment to reducing malicious activity. Where the cyber context is concerned, European action can have a particularly important signaling function given, as a former State Department official put it, the fact that actors like Russia and China are increasingly writing off signaling from the United States.¹⁵⁵ The U.S. and EU legal authorities are mostly similar, heightening the potential cooperative dimension. At their cores, both offer the ability to impose sanctions on individuals and entities that disrupt the confidentiality, availability, or integrity of data or the functioning of computer systems that support critical infrastructure or governmental services.

Imposing sanctions in concert with like-minded nations further strengthens the norm development function. Having multiple states commit to punishing a malicious actor reinforces the wrongfulness of the act in question and helps establish what constitutes an appropriate state response to such wrongful behavior.¹⁵⁷ In his statement following the EU’s first cyber sanctions, High Representative Josep Borrell explicitly referenced commitment to implementing the norms developed by the UN Group of Government Experts’ (UNGGE) 2010, 2013, and 2015 reports and to continued cooperation the ongoing UNGGE and Open-Ended Working Group.¹⁵⁸ ## Punishment of malicious actors By blocking transactions and freezing malicious cyber actors’ assets, policymakers demonstrate that engaging in offensive behavior has real financial consequences. Because many cyberattacks are financially motivated, sanctions deny the benefits of an actor’s behavior by making it more difficult to access and move money.¹⁵⁹ Goldman has argued that targeted financial sanctions play a vital role in the broader effort to deter financially motivated cybercrime—especially cyber-enabled economic espionage—by “drying up the market for stolen data.”¹⁶⁰ Since the United States’ sanctions framework allows for the designation of not just those who steal intellectual property but also those who benefit ¹⁵⁶ “Treasury Targets Russian Operatives over Election Interference, World Anti-Doping Agency Hacking, and Other Malign Activities,” U.S. Department of the Treasury; U.S. President, “Taking Additional Steps to Address the National Emergency With Respect to Significant Malicious Cyber-Enabled Activities,” 3; “Treasury Targets North Korea for Multiple Cyber-Attacks,” U.S. Department of the Treasury; Council Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/1125 of July 30, 2020, O.J.

By freezing assets and blocking transactions, sanctions can disrupt the financing of an offensive cyber operation. In theory, they can also disrupt a state’s ability to recruit the talent necessary to carry out a sophisticated operation—the exposure of a hacker’s identity and the financial punishment may dissuade would-be hackers from serving as a proxy.\nSanctions against terrorist financiers are an important precedent in this respect. In 2001, then-president George W. Bush signed Executive Order 13224 to allow for the imposition of sanctions against those determined “To assist in, sponsor, or provide financial, material, or technological support for, or financial or other services in support of, acts of terrorism.”¹⁶² According to Juan Zarate, a former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes, the use of sanctions against terrorist organizations led to the development of additional horizontal sanctions programs to deal with behavior-based national security threats—like cyber threats.¹⁶³ The logic of going after financing networks and enablers is simple: As Zachary Goldman has put it, “Entities like drug trafficking networks, terrorist groups, and proliferation facilitators require substantial streams of funding and access to the global financial system, to remain effective. The more time and resources they spend trying to fund an organization, the less time spent planning attacks or engaging in other illicit activity.”¹⁶⁴ ## Deterrence Through the previously listed means, sanctions may aspire to a deterrent function that seeks to change state actors’ long-term behavior in cyberspace. The repeated imposition of sanctions may introduce sustained friction in the relationship between the proxy and the state that changes the state’s overall calculus about how and when to engage in malicious cyber activity. Over time, this may lead to a change in the nature of the state’s relationship with its proxies and the degree of risk it is willing to accept when engaging in offensive cyber operations. By punishing ¹⁶¹ U.S. President, “Blocking the Property of Certain Persons Engaging in Significant Malicious Cyber-Enabled Activities,” 18077.\n¹⁶² Bureau of Counterterrorism, “Executive Order 13224,” U.S. Department of State, https://www.state.gov/executive-order-13224/.\n¹⁶³ I thank former Assistant Secretary Zarate for highlighting this historical context.\n¹⁶⁴ Zachary Goldman, “Cybersecurity and a New Era of Asymmetric Economic Warfare.”\n\ncountries that engage in offensive activity and demonstrating the international community’s support for this behavior, states can aim to increase the effort, raise the risk, and reduce offensive cyber actors’ rewards.¹⁶⁵\nDespite the difficulty, even for policymakers, of evaluating sanctions’ success at deterrence, they remain a tool often used for responding to malicious activity. Therefore, our understanding of the impact of sanctions must go beyond the deterrent function and consider the additional symbolic purposes outlined above and the factors that might also impact how symbolic goals are achieved. Table 2 summarizes questions policymakers might consider in evaluating the effectiveness of sanctions at achieving the variety of purposes set forward in this section and the considerations for assessing deterrence outlined in the previous section.\nTable 2. Questions for evaluating effectiveness\n|  Function | Questions  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  Attribution | • Do the statements accompanying a sanctions designation claim that the named entities perpetrated a cyberattack itself?\n• Do the statements accompanying a sanctions designation allege state responsibility for wrongful behavior in cyberspace?\n• Have other policies or legal action (i.e., indictments) made similar attribution claims?  |\n|  Information-sharing | • Do private sector entities pay attention to sanctions notices more than other vehicles for information-sharing about cyber threats?\n• Do the statements accompanying a sanctions designation contain meaningful information about the tactics, techniques, and procedures employed by malicious actors that external stakeholders could use to fortify their networks?  |\n|  Audience satisfaction | • Do actors in the private sector or civil society find sanctions a meaningful and appropriate response to malicious activity?\n• Do allies release diplomatic statements affirming the appropriateness of the action?  |\n|  Cooperation with allies | • Do (or could) other jurisdictions impose sanctions against the same targets?\n• Do other countries release diplomatic statements affirming the appropriateness of the action?  |\n|  Norm development | • Does the offense that prompted sanction violate an established norm of responsible behavior in cyberspace?  |\n¹⁶⁵ Joseph Nye, Jr., “Deterrence and Dissuasion in Cyberspace,” *International Security* 41, no. 3 : 56, https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/ISEC_a_00266.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\n- Have other countries or jurisdictions signaled that sanctions are the appropriate response to this type of norm violation?\n## Punishment\n- How exposed is the individual or entity to the U.S. dollar or the euro’s impact in global financial markets?\n- What is the monetary value of the transactions blocked or assets frozen as a result of the sanction?\n- Do opportunities exist for a designated actor to protect their assets or recoup their losses?\n## Disruption of capabilities\n- Do sanctions disrupt an actor’s ability to procure material, financial, or technological resources necessary to carry out malicious activity?\n- How do sanctions affect the willingness of proxies to engage with state sponsors of malicious cyber activity?\n- Do opportunities exist for actors to circumvent sanctions or mitigate their impact by using alternative financial architectures?\n## Deterrence\n- Over time, does the nature of a particular actor’s behavior in cyberspace change?\n- Do sanctions change the risk-calculus of those engaged in malicious cyber activity?\n- Over time, does the nature of malicious cyber activity in general change?\n## General\n- How might adversaries respond or retaliate to sanctions? What is the likelihood of the target engaging in retaliation, and what would the consequences of retaliation be?\n- Are the costs absorbed by the sender of sanctions proportionate to the costs imposed on targets?\n- What alternative policy options are available, and how do the effects of these tools compare to those of sanctions?\n- What might the long-term consequences be for the architecture of the global financial system?\nHaving discussed the eight purposes sanctions may seek to serve, the operational question remains whether policymakers clearly articulate these objectives and how they measure sanctions’ effectiveness at achieving any of these goals. Not all of the potential purposes of cyber sanctions writ large will be served by a single designation, nor should they be. Policymakers’ goals differ with respect to the variety of cyber threats. The aim of preventing low-level cybercrime like business email compromise scams is different from seeking to encourage states to rein in their proxies when conducting offensive cyber operations.\nNo matter which goals policymakers have in mind with a sanctions designation, they should keep in mind the considerations outlined above pertaining to alternative policy instruments and long-term consequences. Take, for example, the goal of audience satisfaction and the pressure to “do something” in response to malicious cyber activity: Escalation can undermine audience\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\nsatisfaction if a greater number of private sector entities become the victims of cyberattacks in response to sanctions. And the repeated imposition of sanctions may have diminishing returns as far as satisfying audiences—if policymakers describe sanctions in deterrence terms, domestic audiences may be satisfied initially, but the continuation of activity may be interpreted as a sign of failure and lend itself to disappointment.\nThis section has outlined seven purposes in addition to deterrence that policymakers may have in mind when employing sanctions against malicious cyber actors. It is difficult to say whether sanctions deter. But despite the emphasis on deterrence in policy statements, sanctions can have important symbolic purposes that should factor into evaluations of sanctions programs.\n# Conclusion\nThe definitional issues highlighted at the beginning of this paper related to what constitutes malicious cyber activity and should be included within this paper’s scope and the variety of aims of sanctions can raise a question about whether it makes sense to speak of a country or jurisdiction’s “cyber policy” or consider cyber issues a facet of a broader foreign policy. Future research in this area should address how policy should deal with the distinction between “cyber” as a threat itself and as a means for accomplishing other ends like intelligence collection, economic competition, or control over domestic political spaces. The United States’ use, in particular, of a variety of different legal instruments—not just the cyber-specific sanctions framework—highlights the fact that cybercrime and national security threats require a variety of flexible tools. More clearly delineating how and why cyber activity crosses a line of acceptability is crucial to promoting responsible behavior in cyberspace and identifying appropriate mechanisms for responding to harms.\nMore empirical research is also needed in this area. Much of the academic literature on sanctions focuses on those levied against states and deals insufficiently with the success of sanctions against nonstate and proxy actors. $^{166}$ As transnational threats multiply and policymakers reach for sanctions in response, they should have a clear evidence base supporting their decision making.\nThough policymakers often emphasize the goal of deterrence, articulation of the considerations for evaluating the effectiveness of sanctions is scant, even among government actors with access to the full array of intelligence necessary to make such evaluations. Policymakers should consider a target’s vulnerability to economic pressure, actors’ motivations, and the role that\n$^{166}$ Peksen, “When Do Imposed Economic Sanctions Work?,” 7-8.\n\ntargets play in wrongful behavior in seeking to evaluate the likely outcomes of a sanctions designation and its effectiveness. Furthermore, questions of effectiveness also require attention to alternative policy options and long-term consequences.\nMoving beyond deterrence and cost imposition, the diversity of actors against which policymakers impose sanctions requires more nuanced thinking. In the absence of clear frameworks for evaluating effectiveness and relative pessimism about sanctions’ effectiveness, policymakers continue to reach for the tool. Therefore, our understanding of the purposes of sanctions should account for functions like attribution, information-sharing, audience satisfaction, cooperation with allies, norm development, and punishment.\nDespite being hailed as ineffective by academic scholars, policymakers continue to employ sanctions. Data collected by the Center for a New American Security shows that the current U.S. administration is more than willing to sanction adversaries. Even though 2019 saw the fewest designations during the current administration, the yearly total was still more than those of any single year under the previous administration.¹⁶⁷ And the EU’s recent implementation of its cyber sanctions framework for the first time indicates that neither is the policy tool falling out of favor abroad.\n¹⁶⁷ Johnpatrick Imperiale, “Sanctions by the Numbers,” Center for a New American Security, February 27, 2020, https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/sanctions-by-the-numbers.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816"

State (and non-state) actors are acquiring offensive cyber capabilities and have demonstrated a willingness to use them—states have conducted at least 358 hostile cyber operations² since 2005, more than half of which have occurred since 2017.³\nThe increasing number of attacks puts pressure on governments to counter malicious cyber activity and to promote norms of responsible behavior in cyberspace. States have relied on a mix of diplomatic, informational, economic, and law enforcement options to respond to malicious cyber activity.

These purposes include attribution, information-sharing, audience satisfaction, cooperation with allies, norm development, punishment, and disruption of capabilities—all of which contribute cumulatively to the overarching goal of deterrence.\n\n---\n\n## # Conclusion\n\nThe definitional issues highlighted at the beginning of this paper related to what constitutes malicious cyber activity and should be included within this paper’s scope and the variety of aims of sanctions can raise a question about whether it makes sense to speak of a country or jurisdiction’s “cyber policy” or consider cyber issues a facet of a broader foreign policy. Future research in this area should address how policy should deal with the distinction between “cyber” as a threat itself and as a means for accomplishing other ends like intelligence collection, economic competition, or control over domestic political spaces. The United States’ use, in particular, of a variety of different legal instruments—not just the cyber-specific sanctions framework—highlights the fact that cybercrime and national security threats require a variety of flexible tools. More clearly delineating how and why cyber activity crosses a line of acceptability is crucial to promoting responsible behavior in cyberspace and identifying appropriate mechanisms for responding to harms.\nMore empirical research is also needed in this area. Much of the academic literature on sanctions focuses on those levied against states and deals insufficiently with the success of sanctions against nonstate and proxy actors. $^{166}$ As transnational threats multiply and policymakers reach for sanctions in response, they should have a clear evidence base supporting their decision making.\nThough policymakers often emphasize the goal of deterrence, articulation of the considerations for evaluating the effectiveness of sanctions is scant, even among government actors with access to the full array of intelligence necessary to make such evaluations. Policymakers should consider a target’s vulnerability to economic pressure, actors’ motivations, and the role that\n$^{166}$ Peksen, “When Do Imposed Economic Sanctions Work?,” 7-8.\n35\n[DRAFT – October 2020]\ntargets play in wrongful behavior in seeking to evaluate the likely outcomes of a sanctions designation and its effectiveness. Furthermore, questions of effectiveness also require attention to alternative policy options and long-term consequences.\nMoving beyond deterrence and cost imposition, the diversity of actors against which policymakers impose sanctions requires more nuanced thinking. In the absence of clear frameworks for evaluating effectiveness and relative pessimism about sanctions’ effectiveness, policymakers continue to reach for the tool. Therefore, our understanding of the purposes of sanctions should account for functions like attribution, information-sharing, audience satisfaction, cooperation with allies, norm development, and punishment.\nDespite being hailed as ineffective by academic scholars, policymakers continue to employ sanctions. Data collected by the Center for a New American Security shows that the current U.S. administration is more than willing to sanction adversaries. Even though 2019 saw the fewest designations during the current administration, the yearly total was still more than those of any single year under the previous administration.¹⁶⁷ And the EU’s recent implementation of its cyber sanctions framework for the first time indicates that neither is the policy tool falling out of favor abroad.\n¹⁶⁷ Johnpatrick Imperiale, “Sanctions by the Numbers,” Center for a New American Security, February 27, 2020, https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/sanctions-by-the-numbers.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816",

This draft paper provides an overview of the legal frameworks for sanctioning malicious cyber actors and the set of relevant sanctions imposed to date. Despite an emphasis on the goal of deterrence, both policymakers and academics have difficulty determining whether sanctions deter malicious cyber activity. Considering the continued use of cyber sanctions, this paper highlights key considerations for policymakers to evaluate whether sanctions can deter wrongful behavior in cyberspace.\n\nKeywords: sanctions, economic statecraft, cyber, deterrence, descriptive studies, policy evaluation\n\n*Research Assistant, Cyber Policy Initiative, Technology and International Affairs Program, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Washington, DC, USA\n\nContact: thompsonr.natalie@gmail.com\n\nSpecial thanks go to my colleagues—especially Tim Maurer, George Perkovich, Jon Bateman, Ariel Levite, and Arthur Nelson—for supporting this research.

State (and non-state) actors are acquiring offensive cyber capabilities and have demonstrated a willingness to use them—states have conducted at least 358 hostile cyber operations² since 2005, more than half of which have occurred since 2017.³\n\nThe increasing number of attacks puts pressure on governments to counter malicious cyber activity and to promote norms of responsible behavior in cyberspace. States have relied on a mix of diplomatic, informational, economic, and law enforcement options to respond to malicious cyber activity. Some refer to these tools as the DIME(LE) set of instruments available to states seeking to influence others’ behavior.⁴,⁵\n\nSanctions are part of a state’s arsenal.

Comprehensive trade sanctions were a popular instrument of economic coercion throughout the 20th century, in part because they are less costly, less risky, and more palatable than military action. Targeted sanctions differ from comprehensive ones in coercive logic, the intended target, and the ultimate goal.

Targeted sanctions are understood to have additional value for constraining and signaling. By “constraining,” these scholars refer to complicating an actor’s ability to engage in internationally wrongful behavior.²⁰ By “signaling,” they refer to sending a message to the target, domestic audiences, and international audiences that expresses support for norms of appropriate behavior.²¹\n\nOne type of targeted sanction, restrictive financial measures (also referred to as targeted financial sanctions), is increasingly the tool of choice for policymakers seeking to impose consequences for internationally wrongful behavior. Targeted financial sanctions include asset freezes, blocking transactions with designated individuals or entities, and denying access to capital markets.²² The tool relies on the preeminence of certain currencies and jurisdictions in global financial transactions.²³ Big financial players like the United States, Europe, and, to a lesser extent, China can weaponize the financial system to prevent specific individuals or organizations from transacting in their respective currencies.

They do not fit neatly into the definition of cyberattack promulgated by the U.S. National Institute of Technology and Standards: “An attack, via cyberspace, targeting an enterprise’s use of cyberspace for the purpose of disrupting, disabling, destroying, or maliciously controlling a computing environment/infrastructure; or destroying the integrity of the data or stealing controlled information.”³² For example, monitoring dissidents or using social media to promote narratives online does not necessarily compromise data confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Still, the United States and Europe have considered them harmful enough uses of information and communications technologies to warrant punishment. For this reason, sanctions falling under the cyber-specific framework, as well as others related to cyber-enabled influence operations and human rights violations, are included within the scope of this paper.\n\n## “Cyber sanctions” to date\n\nWith these definitional concerns in mind, this section provides a brief overview of the cyber sanctions imposed to date in both the United States and Europe.\n\nExecutive Order 13694, which created the United States’ cyber-specific sanctions framework, “declare[d] a national emergency with respect to the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States posed by the increasing prevalence and severity of malicious cyber-enabled activities originating from or directed by, persons located, in whole or in substantial part, outside the United States.”³³\n\nSo far, the United States has imposed thirty-five tranches of sanctions related to malicious cyber activity under both the cyber-specific framework and other country-specific and horizontal\n\n³⁰ For example, the EU sanctioned Abdolsamad Khoramabadi, head of the Committee to Determine Instances of Criminal Content, in March 2013, and the United States later imposed sanctions in May 2018.

The earliest designations, dating back to 2012 (made under an Executive Order on terrorism-related sanctions), dealt with Iranian government officials and entities participating in computer hacking projects with Hezbollah.³⁴ Since then, the United States has sanctioned a range of cybercriminals and nation-state hackers. These include North Korean actors that participated in the 2014 hack of Sony Pictures, Russian actors engaged in cyber-enabled election interference, and Iranian actors targeting U.S. financial institutions.³⁵ Since 2012, the United States has sanctioned over 250 individuals and entities for engaging in or enabling malicious cyber activity. (For a complete list of incidents, see Table 1.) The majority have been of Iranian, Russian, or North Korean origin. In the first half of 2020, however, the United States took action against two Chinese nationals for aiding Lazarus Group’s efforts to launder money, as well as six Nigerian individuals engaged in business email compromise and romance fraud scams.³⁶\n\nIn statements on the Executive Order, policymakers highlighted the “significant increase in the frequency, scale, and sophistication of cyber incidents targeting the American people” to justify its signing.³⁷ Absent in many of these statements are clear articulations of how the administration would evaluate these sanctions’ effectiveness.

As Zachary Goldman and Damon McCoy have pointed out, “different kinds of malicious cyber activity demand different, tailored, deterrence strategies. This is because each category of cyber threat has a different motivation, and therefore will be sensitive to a different type of cost.”51 Nation-state hackers with political goals are unlikely to suffer the same consequences of a sanctions designation that independent cybercriminals with financial motivations will suffer. Similarly, designating a government official orchestrating an attack is unlikely to have the same impact as designating an individual two or three steps removed that launders money on behalf of a hacking group.\n\nTwo things complicate the effort to neatly distinguish between categories like cybercrime and nation-state activity and state and non-state actors. First, the convergence of financially-motivated cybercrime and nation-state activity makes it difficult to separate cyberattacks conducted for purely economic gain and those undertaken for political purposes.52 North Korean efforts to raise funds for its weapons of mass destruction program through cyber theft and ransom operations against financial institutions and cryptocurrency exchanges have demonstrated the difficulty of separating financial motivations from political goals.53 Similarly, state-sponsored economic espionage emanating from China blurs the distinction between financial and political aims as the theft of intellectual property aims to “support its strategic development goals—science and technology advancement, military modernization, and economic policy objectives.”54\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816",
    "[DRAFT – October 2020]\n\nSecond, the use of proxies for conducting offensive cyber operations often precludes a neat division between state and non-state actors in cyberspace. Tim Maurer’s comprehensive overview of the use of proxies for accomplishing offensive cyber operations details the spectrum of relationships between states and their proxies.⁵⁵ These relationships range from overt delegation of activity to loose orchestration to passive enablement of proxy behavior. In the latter cases, those operating at a state’s behest may also have a foot in the criminal world. For example, in 2019, Treasury alleged that a Russian cybercriminal indicted and sanctioned for developing and distributing malware also operated on behalf of the Russian government, “highlighting the Russian government’s enlistment of cybercriminals for its own malicious purposes.”⁵⁶\n\n## Evaluating effectiveness\n\nIt is not within the remit of external observers to assess whether cyber sanctions effectively achieve deterrence. Much of the information needed to make such an assessment is classified or privately owned intelligence. Though Treasury publicly reports the value of transactions blocked under specific sanctions programs, others have pointed out that evaluating the success of cyber sanctions based on the financial value of prevented transactions is misleading.⁵⁷ Therefore, it is difficult for policymakers to attribute any observed decrease in malicious cyber activity or change in activity to sanctions or determine whether activity levels would be even greater absent the threat of sanctions or imposition.\n\nWithin the U.S. government, Treasury’s Office of Intelligence and Analysis (OIA) and the State Department’s Bureau of Intelligence and Research perform impact assessments.⁵⁸ According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), which published a review of U.S. sanctions programs and their effectiveness in 2019, “These assessments analyze the impacts of specific sanctions on a particular aspect of the sanction’s target—for example, the sanctions’ impact on the target country’s economy or trade.”⁵⁹ OIA, for example, conducts impact assessments before a sanctions designation and after its imposition and may include factors like the target’s U.S.-\n\n⁵⁵ Maurer, *Cyber Mercenaries*, 42-49.\n\n⁵⁶ “Treasury Sanctions Evil Corp, the Russia-Based Cybercriminal Group Behind Dridex Malware,” U.S. Department of the Treasury, December 5, 2019, https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm845,\n\n⁵⁷ Annie Fixler and Eric Lorber, “Counting Pennies Underestimates the Value of Treasury’s Cyber Sanctions,” Foundation for Defense of Democracies, November 4, 2019, https://www.fdd.org/analysis/2019/11/04/counting-pennies-underestimates-the-value-of-treasurys-cyber-sanctions/.\n\n⁵⁸ Kimberly Gianopoulos, “Economic Sanctions: Agencies Assess Impacts on Targets, and Studies Suggest Several Factors Contribute to Sanctions’ Effectiveness,” U.S. Government Accountability Office, October 2019, 12, https://www.gao.gov/assets/710/701891.pdf.\n\n⁵⁹ Ibid.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816",

According to officials, impact can be focused on a singular target or could be broader, such as the impact on the target country’s economy or trade flows. In contrast, OIA views effectiveness as the extent to which a sanctions program is achieving the overall broader policy goals of the sanctions program, such as ultimately altering or deterring specific behaviors of the target or furthering U.S. national security priorities [Emphasis added].⁶²\n\nThe latter considerations come into play during National Security Council-led interagency discussions: The process “allows the U.S. government to draw upon multiple agencies’ inputs and perspectives, and to consider these issues in the larger policy context, because sanctions are often only one element of broader government-wide strategies to achieve U.S. policy goals.”⁶³\n\nEven within government, assessing the effectiveness of sanctions at achieving broader policy goals like deterrence is difficult. GAO’s report highlights that policymakers have difficulty isolating sanctions’ effects from those of other policy tools, dealing with shifting policy objectives, and identifying useful data for conducting assessments.⁶⁴\n\nThe threat of sanctions raises an additional challenge for evaluating effectiveness.⁶⁵ In at least one notable instance pertaining to Chinese cyber-enabled economic espionage, U.S. threats to impose sanctions may have contributed to the signing of a diplomatic agreement between then-\n\n⁶⁰ Ibid., 13-14.\n⁶¹ Ibid., 12.\n⁶² Ibid.\n⁶³ Ibid., 12.\n⁶⁴ Ibid., 17-18.\n⁶⁵ See, for example, Daniel Drezner’s work on selection bias in evaluations of sanctions programs, which suggests that sanctions are more effective than most analyses contend because they miss instances in which sanctions are threatened but not imposed: “in focusing only on those instances when sanctions have been imposed, policy analysts have overlooked the significant number of instances in which the threat of coercion did not have to be carried out.” Daniel Drezner, “The Hidden Hand of Economic Coercion,” International Organization 57, no. 3 (June 2003): 654-655, https://doi.org/10.1017/S0020818303573052.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816",

After surveying sanctions experts, they report, “A remarkable 27 out of 30 survey respondents – 90 percent – agreed with the contention that sanctions against state actors like Iran were more effective than sanctions against non-state actors like al Qaeda.”^[79]^ A recent review of the academic literature highlights the impact of sanctions on non-state actors as a gap in existing scholarship^[80]^—a fact particularly challenging for policymakers evaluating sanctions’ effectiveness against non-state and proxy cyber threats. Perhaps the most damning factor concerning the inconclusiveness of the academic literature is that even amongst academics “what counts as ‘effective’ (or ‘successful’) itself has been a contentious issue.”^[81]^\n\n## Factors for consideration\n\nStill, in trying to assess the effectiveness of cyber sanctions, policymakers should look at three key factors:\n\n(1) A target’s vulnerability to economic pressure,\n(2) The motivations underpinning offensive activity, and\n(3) How chosen targets support malicious activity.\n\n## Vulnerability to economic pressure\n\nDespite the lack of consensus regarding sanctions’ aims, those who have surveyed the academic literature note that a target’s vulnerability to economic pressure is critical for sanctions’ effectiveness. As one group of researchers put it, “the data suggest that the types of financial sanctions that have been deployed against states in the last two decades should have a greater\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816",
    "[DRAFT – October 2020]\n\nimpact on the decisionmaking [sic] of states for which attractiveness to international trade and investment is strategically significant.”⁸² In the cyber domain, this means that policymakers should pay attention to specific nation-state cyber threats that may be vulnerable to economic pressure. A sanction against an Iranian or North Korean government entity, for example, is unlikely to disrupt capabilities in the same way that a designation of a Russian entity might. U.S. sanctions have isolated Iran and North Korea from the global financial system,⁸³ so additional targeted sanctions may be unlikely to significantly affect the ability to carry out future attacks or enjoy their proceeds. Indeed, these two actors have made the financial system the target of cyberattacks.⁸⁴ However, actors elsewhere may be more exposed to the influence of the U.S. dollar or the euro in global financial markets and, therefore, more likely to pay attention to the punitive consequences of a sanction or have their capabilities disrupted as a result. For example, Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, alleged that his net worth dropped by 80 percent—over $7 billion—as a result of U.S. sanctions related to “a range of malign activity around the globe,” including malicious cyber activity, imposed in 2018.⁸⁵\n\n## Actors’ motivations\n\nThe motives underpinning malicious cyber activity also affect an actor's vulnerability to sanctions. As mentioned above, Goldman and McCoy have argued that sanctions are an appropriate policy tool for dealing with financially motivated cyber threats—like cyber-enabled economic espionage—because they undermine the goal of the activity: profit.⁸⁶ By preventing malicious actors from accessing and moving money, sanctions make it “more difficult for them\n\n⁸² Rosenberg, et al., “The New Tools of Economic Warfare,” 15.\n⁸³ Ian Talley, “U.S. Moves to Further Isolate Iran From Global Financial System,” *Wall Street Journal*, October 25, 2019, https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-moves-to-further-isolate-iran-from-global-financial-system-11572025978; David Sanger and Michael Corkery, “Treasury Imposes Sanctions on North Korea, Cutting Access to Banks,” *New York Times*, June 1, 2016, https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/02/world/asia/treasury-imposes-sanctions-on-north-korea.html.\n⁸⁴ “Treasury Targets Supporters of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Networks Responsible for Cyber-Attacks Against the United States,” U.S. Department of the Treasury; “Treasury Targets North Korea for Multiple Cyber-Attacks,” U.S. Department of the Treasury; “Treasury Sanctions North Korean State-Sponsored Malicious Cyber Groups,” U.S. Department of the Treasury.\n⁸⁵ David Dawkins, “Russian Billionaire Oleg Deripaska Describes U.S. Money Laundering Accusations As ‘Mish-Mash Of Total Nonsense,’” *Forbes*, February 14, 2020, https://www.forbes.com/sites/daviddawkins/2020/02/14/report-russian-billionaire-oleg-deripaska-accused-by-us-agency-of-laundering-funds-for-vladimir-putin/#7b2a95c0c4bc; “Treasury Designates Russian Oligarchs, Officials, and Entities in Response to Worldwide Malign Activity,” U.S. Department of the Treasury, April 6, 2018, https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm0338.\n⁸⁶ Goldman and McCoy, “Deterring Financially Motivated Cybercrime,” 602.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816",
    "[DRAFT – October 2020]\n\nto use the proceeds of their crimes.”⁸⁷ Sanctions may fail to dissuade financially motivated actors from engaging in wrongful behavior if the profitability of the action outweighs the financial costs of sanctions. Still, the profit motive may make these actors more sensitive to sanctions than a politically motivated actor would be.⁸⁸ Russian actors engaged in hack and leak operations or attacks on international organizations are not as likely to be dissuaded from engaging in their activity because sanctions have made it unprofitable if profitability was not necessarily a preeminent goal.\n\n## Means of supporting wrongful activity\n\nThe specific choice of target and whose behavioral change is the goal of sanctions are also likely to bear on how policymakers should evaluate effectiveness. Once policymakers have identified malicious activity, they can choose to go after several different targets, including the state actors that directed, orchestrated, or enabled the attack; the individuals directly engaged in the attack; or those that provide material, financial, or technological support for the attack. Again, these actors are not equally vulnerable to the effects of sanctions. Government officials that enjoy the backing and protection of the state may be less likely to be deterred than those whose legitimate commercial interests are at stake by aiding targets in circumventing sanctions. As one group of researchers at the Center for a New American Security put it, “To the extent that sanctions on non-state actors are focused on coercing a change in behavior, that strategy may have the greatest impact on the ecosystem of actual and would-be supporters of those groups, rather than on the groups themselves.”⁸⁹ Simultaneously, sanctions can go after a specific target to change a third party’s behavior—returning to the Deripaska example described above, sanctioning Russian oligarchs was partly meant to signal to the Russian state that its conduct was unacceptable and leverage elite pain for behavioral change.⁹⁰\n\n## Effectiveness as opposed to what?\n\nEvaluating the impacts of sanctions cannot ignore the alternative instruments available to states\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816\n\n⁸⁷ John Carlin, “Detect, Disrupt, Deter: A Whole-of-Government Approach to National Security Cyber Threats,” *Harvard National Security Journal* 7, (2016): 420, https://harvardnsj.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2016/06/Carlin-FINAL.pdf.\n\n⁸⁸ The impact of sanctions on an adversary’s risk calculus could potentially backfire if financially motivated actors are deterred from engaging in the lowest levels of criminal activity, which may generate profits incommensurate with the absorbed risk, but continue to engage in highly profitable but extremely destabilizing attacks.\n\n⁸⁹ Rosenberg, et al., “The New Tools of Economic Warfare,” 28.\n\n⁹⁰ “Treasury Designates Russian Oligarchs, Officials, and Entities in Response to Worldwide Malign Activity,” U.S. Department of the Treasury.",

In the U.S. context, in particular, policymakers have adopted a “whole-of-government” approach to countering malicious cyber activity—in essence, one that involves all of the tools of statecraft outlined in the DIME(LE).⁹²,⁹³ As a result, sanctions have frequently followed criminal charges against malicious cyber actors. Sixteen of the thirty-five instances in which the United States imposed cyber sanctions were preceded by an indictment of at least one of the sanctioned individuals—providing useful context for understanding the range of available tools for imposing costs on malicious cyber actors.\n\nWhere effectiveness is concerned, sanctions, in theory, may have more “teeth” than indictments because their enforcement does not rely on an actor setting foot in a country with which a state pursuing charges has an extradition treaty. As others have noted, the U.S. strategy of charging foreign-linked hackers is unlikely to result in many hackers ever appearing in U.S. courts.⁹⁴ However, there have been some important exceptions. Three members of the FIN7 cybercrime group were arrested in Spain in 2018, two of which have been extradited,⁹⁵ and in May 2020, authorities arrested another member of the organization in Seattle.⁹⁶\n\nJack Goldsmith and Robert Williams have questioned whether the public attribution of cyberattacks through criminal charges is counterproductive.

Sanctions are enforced not by the U.S. government or EU alone but by financial institutions that risk exposing themselves to secondary sanctions. As a result, they may better demonstrate the costs of engaging in wrongful behavior and, therefore, deter adversaries.\n\nSanctions, however, face limitations. Sophisticated actors can identify ways to evade sanctions, sometimes through cyberattacks.⁹⁸ Last fall, a United Nations panel of experts report detailed North Korea’s efforts to circumvent sanctions and raise money for its weapons of mass destruction program by attacking the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) and cryptocurrency exchanges, executing ransomware attacks, and mining cryptocurrency.⁹⁹,¹⁰⁰ The risk of evasion poses a threat to the efficacy of targeted financial sanctions as it “undermines the credibility of the senders, because the inability to implement and enforce the measures is often interpreted as signaling the lack of power of the sender.”¹⁰¹ And in the longer-term, actors may be compelled to seek alternate financial architectures to avoid the hassle of evading sanctions.\n\nThe broader point of comparing sanctions and indictments is that sanctions are just one of the tools that governments can employ against malicious cyber actors.

In the U.S. context, the NSC-led interagency process provides a forum for discussing the effectiveness of sanctions relative to other policy instruments.¹⁰² But as with academic literature on the efficacy of sanctions on non-state actors, Dursun Peksen argues that scholarly work on the utility of sanctions relative to other policy instruments is similarly lacking.¹⁰³\n\nNonetheless, as policymakers impose sanctions, they must consider the potential escalatory consequences and how alternative policy instruments might compare. Rosenberg and Tama highlight the need to better assess where sanctions sit on the escalation ladder to strengthen their signaling value and ensure that efforts at cross-domain deterrence do not inadvertently compromise broader foreign policy objectives.¹⁰⁴ As they put it, “if it is unclear whether an airstrike against a military facility is higher or lower on the escalation ladder than financial sanctions targeting a country’s most important economic sector, the target government may not understand the likely consequences of continuing to flout an international norm or U.S. demands.”¹⁰⁵\n\nCompared to actions like diplomatic statements, sanctions may be perceived as more escalatory since they aim to impose real financial costs and disrupt an operations’ financing. But in comparison to retaliatory cyberattacks or other military action, they may be less escalatory because their contours are narrowly defined, and policymakers can couple sanctions with clear statements of intention.¹⁰⁶ The EU’s sanctions, which refrain from attributing responsibility for an attack to a specific state, may be less escalatory than those imposed by the United States,¹⁰⁷ which, as described above, can and sometimes do allege state responsibility for wrongful behavior.\n\nIf adversaries see sanctions as escalatory, they may retaliate. Sanctions have generated such retaliation: Iran retaliated for U.S. sanctions with cyberattacks against the financial system.

As Peter Feaver and Eric Lorber have put it, targeted financial sanctions rely on calculations about business risk, and “If global business conditions change, the firms might re-calculate that engaging in financial transactions with those targeted states outweighs the costs.”¹¹⁰ This risk of such re-calculation may be heightened if sanctions create incentives for businesses to pursue transactions in other currencies or for countries to develop alternative financial architectures.¹¹¹\n\nThese concerns—and consideration of cyber sanctions generally—cannot be divorced from the broader context in which the United States has aggressively pursued the use of sanctions to achieve a range of foreign policy goals, sometimes to the detriment of ally relationships. Two particular issues are worth highlighting: 1) the credibility of sanctions commitments and 2) the use of secondary sanctions.¹¹²\n\nThe credibility of broader sanctions commitments matters for evaluating the effectiveness of cyber sanctions at deterrence. Elizabeth Rosenberg and Jordan Tama have noted that sanctions’ effectiveness depends on the credibility of both the threat to designate targets for wrongful behavior and the promise to lift sanctions if behavior changes.¹¹³ The United States’ withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) illustrates how failure to do the latter can undermine broader foreign policy goals.

Legal authorities in the United States for imposing sanctions can be created through executive or legislative means. U.S. sanctions remain in place until a target appeals to OFAC and demonstrates a change in behavior that warrants delisting (and the burden is on designated individuals and entities to present a basis for delisting) or until Congress votes to lift the sanctions.¹¹⁵ Congressionally mandated sanctions provide an essential check on executive action to impose sanctions unilaterally. But if Congress refuses to lift sanctions in response to behavioral change, they undermine the tool’s credibility. (By contrast to U.S. sanctions, EU sanctions are reviewed annually.¹¹⁶ In some ways, this may enhance the instrument’s credibility.)\n\nEfforts to understand the effectiveness of the United States’ cyber sanctions must also contend with the legislative authorities that provide for secondary sanctions. Secondary sanctions refer to “the threat of US sanctions against foreign individuals and entities for engaging in specified activities that may not have a US nexus.”¹¹⁷ In the context of cyber sanctions, these include provisions enshrined within CAATSA for imposing sanctions against individuals and entities that engage in “significant transactions” with certain Russian government entities¹¹⁸ and their personnel.¹¹⁹ Secondary sanctions are different from provisions that allow governments to target those that provide “technical, financial, or material support” to previously designated actors. As others have pointed out, both the U.S. and EU authorities accept that sanctions are more effective when targeting an adversary’s network.¹²⁰ Instead, secondary sanctions target those that continue to do business with a sanctioned entity, whether based in the United States or not.\n\n¹¹⁴ Ibid., 6.\n¹¹⁵ “Filing a Petition for Removal from an OFAC List,” U.S. Department of the Treasury, last updated May 2, 2017, https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/petitions.aspx.\n¹¹⁶ Council of the EU, “Adoption and review procedure for EU sanctions,” last reviewed February 14, 2019, https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/sanctions/adoption-review-procedure/.\n¹¹⁷ Samantha Sultoon and Justine Walker, “Secondary Sanctions’ Implications and the Transatlantic Relationship,” Atlantic Council, September 2019, 3, https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SecondarySanctions_Final.pdf.\n¹¹⁸ These include “the defense or intelligence sectors of the Government of the Russian Federation, including the Main Intelligence Agency of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation or the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation.” Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act of 2017, Public Law 115-44, U.S. Statutes at Large (2017), https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/hr3364_pl115-44.pdf.\n¹¹⁹ Ibid.\n¹²⁰ Sultoon and Walker, “Secondary Sanctions’ Implications and the Transatlantic Relationship,” 4.\n\n24\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816",
    "[DRAFT – October 2020]\n\nTo date, the United States has not imposed cyber-related secondary sanctions under CAATSA, but the legislation permitting secondary sanctions and their potential ramifications for EU projects has attracted criticism from the bloc.¹²¹ Because of U.S. withdrawal from the JCPOA, some EU members have signed on to the Instrument in Support of Trade Exchanges (INSTEX), a special purpose vehicle that “circumvents the traditional financial networks the US uses to establish its jurisdiction for enforcing sanctions,”¹²² to conduct business with Iranian entities.\n\nParticularly as European entities become subject to secondary U.S. sanctions and must find alternative payment systems, other countries face incentives to create alternative global financial architectures that erode the United States’ long-term power in the global economic system.¹²³ Countries like Russia, China, and even India, are interested in an alternative financial messaging system to SWIFT, but these have yet to catch on and face important limitations.¹²⁴\n\nSome have pointed out that “Multinational businesses seeking to avoid exposure to U.S. and EU sanctions can find refuge in the yuan and Chinese financial platforms.”¹²⁵ China’s “efforts to promote the yuan as a global currency and establish alternatives to the dollar- and euro-dominated international financial system”¹²⁶ may heighten the associated risks. Many are quick to point out that China faces several obstacles to achieving such a goal.¹²⁷ Still, as former senior Treasury adviser Elizabeth Rosenberg points out, “sanctions do give China’s economic ambitions an undeniable boost.”¹²⁸ Especially as financial technologies—like cryptocurrencies—introduce new ways for criminals to launder money,¹²⁹ the continued use of sanctions may\n\n¹²¹ “Russia sanctions: EU vows to retaliate over US measures,” BBC, July 26, 2017, https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40727044; Paul Ivan, “The US and the EU need a stronger dialogue on Russia,” European Policy Centre, May 2, 2018, https://www.epc.eu/en/Publications/The-US-and-the-EU-need-a-stronger-dialogue-on-Russia-sanctions~1e70f8; Karen DeYoung, “Three European allies ask U.S. not to enforce secondary sanctions over Iran trade,” Washington Post, June 6, 2018, https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/three-european-allies-ask-us-not-to-enforce-secondary-sanctions-over-iran-trade/2018/06/06/f4c94594-69c3-11e8-bea7-c8eb28bc52b1_story.html.\n\n¹²² Ellie Geranmayeh and Manuel Lafont Rapnouil, “Meeting the Challenge of Secondary Sanctions,” European Council on Foreign Relations, June 2019, 4, 7, https://www.ecfr.eu/publications/summary/meeting_the_challenge_of_secondary_sanctions.\n\n¹²³ Drezner, “Targeted Sanctions in a World of Global Finance,” 760-761.\n\n¹²⁴ Jignesh Davda, “China, Russia &amp; India Push Forward on SWIFT Alternative,” Yahoo!

The potential backlash to Washington’s gung-ho attitude toward financial sanctions may occur on a longer time horizon but carries arguably more significant consequence for U.S. global power.\n\nThe potential consequences mean that policymakers evaluating the effectiveness of cyber sanctions at deterring wrongful behavior must also consider the long-term trajectory of the tool’s use and how decisions within the broader foreign policy context affect the reception of sanctions.\n\n## Moving beyond deterrence\n\nA general emphasis on deterrence obscures the variety of different functions that sanctions can perform and the diversity of motives underpinning malicious cyber activity. Few, if any, policymakers would argue that the outright cessation of malicious cyber activity is a realistic goal that could be achieved by targeted financial sanctions. Given that some, like North Korea, pursue cybercrime as a means of sanctions evasion, one might even argue that sanctions are counterproductive if the goal is understood to stop malicious cyber activity.^[130]^ As described above, the academic and policy literature on the effectiveness of cyber sanctions at deterrence is difficult to measure. So why do policymakers continue to employ sanctions in the seeming absence of compelling evidence about their effectiveness?\n\nThe academic literature on targeted sanctions has attempted to account for some of the different aims of sanctions and the diverse threats they can target by introducing three potential purposes—constraint, coercion, and signaling.^[131]^ Even these, however, ignore the nuanced and specific purposes for imposing sanctions in response to malicious cyber activity. To say that a sanctions designation aims to “signal,” for example, ignores important features of the message itself, its intended audience, and its contribution to the broader goal of sending a message by sanctioning.\n\nOthers divide the purposes of sanctions into “symbolic” or “expressive” and “instrumental” ones.^[132]^ Symbolic or expressive purposes relate to the political interests served by doing something in response to wrongful behavior—i.e., signaling. Instrumental objectives relate to desired policy or behavior changes—i.e., coercion and constraint.\n\n^[130]^ Elizabeth Rosenberg and Neil Bhatiya, “Busting North Korea’s Sanctions Evasion,” Center for a New American Security, March 4, 2020, https://www.cnas.org/publications/commentary/busting-north-koreas-sanctions-evasion.\n^[131]^ Giumelli, *How EU sanctions work*, 18-19.\n^[132]^ Taehee Whang, “Playing to the Home Crowd?

    "[DRAFT – October 2020]\n\nBuilding on the scholarship of Garrett Hinck and Tim Maurer, which examined the role that criminal charges play in countering malicious cyber activity,¹³³ cyber sanctions can be categorized to serve the following symbolic purposes: 1) attribution, 2) information-sharing, 3) audience satisfaction, 4) cooperation with allies, and 5) norm development and instrumental ones: 6) punishment of malicious actors and 7) disruption of capabilities, which cumulatively aspire to 8) deterrence.\n\n## Attribution\n\nIn the context of malicious cyber activity, “attribution” has multiple dimensions—it can relate to the machine used in an attack, the individual that perpetrated the attack, or the “ultimately responsible party” for the attack.¹³⁴ Ascertaining responsibility is a complicated matter. The degree to which a state might be responsible for malicious activity varies from an inability to prevent malicious attacks to active participation in an attack.¹³⁵\n\nSanctions designations are public listings that name individuals or entities in response to malicious behavior. As Kristen Eichensehr has argued, they can attribute wrongful conduct by naming the individual or entity that directly perpetrated a cyberattack or indicating state responsibility for an attack.¹³⁶\n\nThis is not always the case. Because targets can be sanctioned for materially, financially, or technologically enabling a previously designated actor, they do not always publicize attribution in the sense of identifying hackers. And because ascertaining the nature of the relationship between a state and a hacker can be difficult, not all sanctions allege that a state enabled or orchestrated wrongful behavior in cyberspace.\n\nBut in some cases, sanctions do serve to implicate a state in malicious cyber activity.

Within the EU, attribution is a “sovereign political decision” left up to each member state’s discretion.¹³⁸ As a result, EU sanctions designations avoid making a specific link between a designated individual or entity and a state sponsor, even when, as in the case of the July 2020 Russian targets, some of the listed individuals may work on behalf of government agencies or may be government agencies themselves.¹³⁹,¹⁴⁰ Though attribution is also a sovereign political decision in the United States, the process is more straightforward—there is no need to wrangle the agreement of twenty-seven member states to attribute.\n\nIndependent of the political reasons for (not) attributing a cyberattack, not all jurisdictions are equally competent in their ability to attribute. States differ in their ability to identify technical and political indicators of compromise and use signals, human, and open-source intelligence to understand them.¹⁴¹ As one RAND Corporation report put it, “These capabilities may not be widespread globally, and very few countries are thought to possess sophisticated all-source capabilities.”¹⁴²\n\n## Information-sharing¹⁴³\n\nThe press releases that accompany sanctions designations sometimes contain important information about how malicious actors carry out their attacks.

In the United States, for example, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) Exchange is a Treasury-led “voluntary public-private information sharing partnership among law enforcement, financial institutions, and FinCEN aimed at effectively and efficiently combating money laundering, terrorism financing, organized crime, and other financial crimes; protecting the financial system from illicit use; and promoting national security.”¹⁴⁴ Additionally, the Bank Secrecy Act Advisory Group (BSAAG) is “the means by which Treasury receives advice on the operations of the Bank Secrecy Act,” a key piece of U.S. law regarding money laundering.¹⁴⁵ Made of up representatives from federal agencies, financial institutions, and trade groups, BSAAG is chaired by the FinCEN director.¹⁴⁶ Though these mechanisms are essential means of sharing information, the participating institutions and representatives are limited.\n\nHowever, public press releases can garner the attention of a broader set of stakeholders with sanctions compliance obligations and can aid in disseminating information related to cyber threats.

In some cases, sanctions are met with laudatory statements from allied governments. For example, the United States released such a message when the European Union imposed cyber sanctions for the first time in July 2020.¹⁵³\n\n## Cooperation with allies\n\nGiven that both the United States and European Union have legal frameworks to impose sanctions against malicious cyber actors, there is a potential cooperative dimension to the policy. Some have suggested that sanctions work better when there are concerted efforts among states to restrict an actor’s capabilities and deny its action’s benefits because it limits the actor’s ability to mitigate losses in other markets.¹⁵⁴ Even without cooperative effort, sanctions can signal to members of the international community a shared commitment to reducing malicious activity. Where the cyber context is concerned, European action can have a particularly important signaling function given, as a former State Department official put it, the fact that actors like Russia and China are increasingly writing off signaling from the United States.¹⁵⁵\n\nThe U.S. and EU legal authorities are mostly similar, heightening the potential cooperative dimension. At their cores, both offer the ability to impose sanctions on individuals and entities that disrupt the confidentiality, availability, or integrity of data or the functioning of computer systems that support critical infrastructure or governmental services.

Imposing sanctions in concert with like-minded nations further strengthens the norm development function. Having multiple states commit to punishing a malicious actor reinforces the wrongfulness of the act in question and helps establish what constitutes an appropriate state response to such wrongful behavior.¹⁵⁷\n\nIn his statement following the EU’s first cyber sanctions, High Representative Josep Borrell explicitly referenced commitment to implementing the norms developed by the UN Group of Government Experts’ (UNGGE) 2010, 2013, and 2015 reports and to continued cooperation the ongoing UNGGE and Open-Ended Working Group.¹⁵⁸\n\n## Punishment of malicious actors\n\nBy blocking transactions and freezing malicious cyber actors’ assets, policymakers demonstrate that engaging in offensive behavior has real financial consequences. Because many cyberattacks are financially motivated, sanctions deny the benefits of an actor’s behavior by making it more difficult to access and move money.¹⁵⁹\n\nGoldman has argued that targeted financial sanctions play a vital role in the broader effort to deter financially motivated cybercrime—especially cyber-enabled economic espionage—by “drying up the market for stolen data.”¹⁶⁰ Since the United States’ sanctions framework allows for the designation of not just those who steal intellectual property but also those who benefit\n\n¹⁵⁶ “Treasury Targets Russian Operatives over Election Interference, World Anti-Doping Agency Hacking, and Other Malign Activities,” U.S. Department of the Treasury; U.S. President, “Taking Additional Steps to Address the National Emergency With Respect to Significant Malicious Cyber-Enabled Activities,” 3; “Treasury Targets North Korea for Multiple Cyber-Attacks,” U.S. Department of the Treasury; Council Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/1125 of July 30, 2020, O.J.

By freezing assets and blocking transactions, sanctions can disrupt the financing of an offensive cyber operation. In theory, they can also disrupt a state’s ability to recruit the talent necessary to carry out a sophisticated operation—the exposure of a hacker’s identity and the financial punishment may dissuade would-be hackers from serving as a proxy.\n\nSanctions against terrorist financiers are an important precedent in this respect. In 2001, then-president George W. Bush signed Executive Order 13224 to allow for the imposition of sanctions against those determined “To assist in, sponsor, or provide financial, material, or technological support for, or financial or other services in support of, acts of terrorism.”¹⁶² According to Juan Zarate, a former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes, the use of sanctions against terrorist organizations led to the development of additional horizontal sanctions programs to deal with behavior-based national security threats—like cyber threats.¹⁶³ The logic of going after financing networks and enablers is simple: As Zachary Goldman has put it, “Entities like drug trafficking networks, terrorist groups, and proliferation facilitators require substantial streams of funding and access to the global financial system, to remain effective. The more time and resources they spend trying to fund an organization, the less time spent planning attacks or engaging in other illicit activity.”¹⁶⁴\n\n## Deterrence\n\nThrough the previously listed means, sanctions may aspire to a deterrent function that seeks to change state actors’ long-term behavior in cyberspace. The repeated imposition of sanctions may introduce sustained friction in the relationship between the proxy and the state that changes the state’s overall calculus about how and when to engage in malicious cyber activity. Over time, this may lead to a change in the nature of the state’s relationship with its proxies and the degree of risk it is willing to accept when engaging in offensive cyber operations.

Not all of the potential purposes of cyber sanctions writ large will be served by a single designation, nor should they be. Policymakers’ goals differ with respect to the variety of cyber threats. The aim of preventing low-level cybercrime like business email compromise scams is different from seeking to encourage states to rein in their proxies when conducting offensive cyber operations.\n\nNo matter which goals policymakers have in mind with a sanctions designation, they should keep in mind the considerations outlined above pertaining to alternative policy instruments and long-term consequences. Take, for example, the goal of audience satisfaction and the pressure to “do something” in response to malicious cyber activity: Escalation can undermine audience\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816",
    "[DRAFT – October 2020]\n\nsatisfaction if a greater number of private sector entities become the victims of cyberattacks in response to sanctions. And the repeated imposition of sanctions may have diminishing returns as far as satisfying audiences—if policymakers describe sanctions in deterrence terms, domestic audiences may be satisfied initially, but the continuation of activity may be interpreted as a sign of failure and lend itself to disappointment.\n\nThis section has outlined seven purposes in addition to deterrence that policymakers may have in mind when employing sanctions against malicious cyber actors. It is difficult to say whether sanctions deter. But despite the emphasis on deterrence in policy statements, sanctions can have important symbolic purposes that should factor into evaluations of sanctions programs.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe definitional issues highlighted at the beginning of this paper related to what constitutes malicious cyber activity and should be included within this paper’s scope and the variety of aims of sanctions can raise a question about whether it makes sense to speak of a country or jurisdiction’s “cyber policy” or consider cyber issues a facet of a broader foreign policy. Future research in this area should address how policy should deal with the distinction between “cyber” as a threat itself and as a means for accomplishing other ends like intelligence collection, economic competition, or control over domestic political spaces. The United States’ use, in particular, of a variety of different legal instruments—not just the cyber-specific sanctions framework—highlights the fact that cybercrime and national security threats require a variety of flexible tools. More clearly delineating how and why cyber activity crosses a line of acceptability is crucial to promoting responsible behavior in cyberspace and identifying appropriate mechanisms for responding to harms.\n\nMore empirical research is also needed in this area. Much of the academic literature on sanctions focuses on those levied against states and deals insufficiently with the success of sanctions against nonstate and proxy actors. $^{166}$ As transnational threats multiply and policymakers reach for sanctions in response, they should have a clear evidence base supporting their decision making.\n\nThough policymakers often emphasize the goal of deterrence, articulation of the considerations for evaluating the effectiveness of sanctions is scant, even among government actors with access to the full array of intelligence necessary to make such evaluations. Policymakers should consider a target’s vulnerability to economic pressure, actors’ motivations, and the role that\n\n$^{166}$ Peksen, “When Do Imposed Economic Sanctions Work?,” 7-8.\n\n35",
    "[DRAFT – October 2020]\n\ntargets play in wrongful behavior in seeking to evaluate the likely outcomes of a sanctions designation and its effectiveness. Furthermore, questions of effectiveness also require attention to alternative policy options and long-term consequences.\n\nMoving beyond deterrence and cost imposition, the diversity of actors against which policymakers impose sanctions requires more nuanced thinking. In the absence of clear frameworks for evaluating effectiveness and relative pessimism about sanctions’ effectiveness, policymakers continue to reach for the tool. Therefore, our understanding of the purposes of sanctions should account for functions like attribution, information-sharing, audience satisfaction, cooperation with allies, norm development, and punishment.\n\nDespite being hailed as ineffective by academic scholars, policymakers continue to employ sanctions. Data collected by the Center for a New American Security shows that the current U.S. administration is more than willing to sanction adversaries. Even though 2019 saw the fewest designations during the current administration, the yearly total was still more than those of any single year under the previous administration.¹⁶⁷ And the EU’s recent implementation of its cyber sanctions framework for the first time indicates that neither is the policy tool falling out of favor abroad.\n\n¹⁶⁷ Johnpatrick Imperiale, “Sanctions by the Numbers,” Center for a New American Security, February 27, 2020, https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/sanctions-by-the-numbers.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3770816"
