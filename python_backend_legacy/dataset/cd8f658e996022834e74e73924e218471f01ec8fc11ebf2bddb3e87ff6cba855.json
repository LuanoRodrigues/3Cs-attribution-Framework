Introduction\n\nCyberspace constitute an unstable environment, featuring rapid changes in the nature of the actors using it, the technologies applied and the inter-personal, governmental and commercial interactions facilitated thereby. The nature of the threats posed by those who abuse cyberspace is also highly dynamic in nature.¹ At the same time, the growing reliance of individuals, markets and society at large on digital devices (including on the Internet of things), and on networks which connect them to one another, generates high susceptibility in the face of malicious cyber-operations (also referred to as cyber-attacks).² The global COVID-19 pandemic exponentially accelerated the trend of digitalization in various fields of life, increasing even more the dependency on cyber-infrastructure and with it the potential for harmful cyber-attacks.³\n\nTraditionally, states have been cautious in invoking international law in the context of cyber-attacks, and they tended to refrain from denouncing attacks against them as violations of international law, or attributing it to other states.⁴ Such reluctance appears to derive primarily from political and operational considerations: enhancing the regulatory role of international law in cyberspace might impede espionage activities resorted to by all states, and limit the retaliation options of victim states.⁵ Another reason for the reluctance might be the lack of a credible international attribution mechanism for hostile cyber operations.⁶ Instead, states targeted by cyber-attacks resort at times to private companies providing technical attribution aimed at identifying the computer system from which the attack had originated, followed by\n\n¹ Kenneth Geers, *The Cyber Threat to National Critical Infrastructures: Beyond Theory*, 18 INFORMATION SECURITY JOURNAL: A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE 1, 3 (2009).\n\n² Oona Hathaway et al., *The Law of Cyber-Attack*, 100 CAL.

While there are of disagreements as to the way that international law applies in the cyberspace, a common understanding had emerged about some key international law norms that apply in this field.⁸ States like Australia,⁹ France,¹⁰ Germany,¹¹ Israel,¹² the United Kingdom,¹³ and the Netherlands¹⁴ have recently articulated their legal positions on how international law applies in cyberspace. In the same vein, states who fell victim to cyber-attacks are increasingly attributing them, as an international law matter, to other states, or non-state actors.¹⁵ Arguably, the increased role played by international law in cyberspace constitutes a reaction to the fact that cyber-attacks become more and more frequent, and dangerous, capable of shutting down critical infrastructure,¹⁶ including nuclear centrifuges¹⁷ and water pumping facilities.¹⁸\n\n⁷ Israel asserts that attribution remains a mostly technical matter that should not be overregulated, and that the choice of disclosing information supporting attribution claims remains at the exclusive discretion of the state.

Part IV concludes and suggests a way forward.\n\n1. A Short History of Cyber-attacks\n\nIt is hard to exaggerate the crucial role cyberspace plays in almost all aspects of everyday life. AI systems relying on online databases and computer networks facilitate the management of huge amounts of governmental services, economic transactions, health data and more.¹⁹ The recent COVID-19 pandemic accelerated digitalization of fields like workplace meetings, distant teaching and online shopping.²⁰\n\nAgainst this background, it is no surprise that cyber-attacks can and do cause significant and widespread damage.²¹ Notable attacks from recent years were directed against nuclear infrastructure²² and other basic utilities,²³ hospitals,²⁴ commercial entities,²⁵ Internet services²⁶ and more.

As will be elaborated in the part below dealing with attribution, tracing attacks back to their source is not an easy task even for states with advanced cyber capabilities.⁴¹ In fact, the low entry barrier for developing cyber-attack capabilities allows militarily weaker parties to international conflicts, including non-state actors,⁴² to ‘bridge the gap’ and take on powerful states (who may, paradoxically, be more vulnerable to cyber-attacks because of their greater reliance on online services and platforms).⁴³ Moreover, at times, states use non-state actors to perform cyber operations at their behest, with a view to hiding their own involvement.⁴⁴\n\nCyber-attacks can take a variety of forms, entailing different types of harms and inviting different preventive measures and regulatory responses. A highly common form of a cyberattack is a Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) operation, during which botnets devastate computer servers through large scale repeat visits to designated websites.⁴⁵ DDOS attacks come in many forms, including network flooding, data modification, electromagnetic interference and more.⁴⁶ Famous DDOS attacks are the attacks conducted during April 2007 on the densely wired Estonia, as well as attacks in Georgia during 2008, ahead of the Russian invasion to South Ossetia.⁴⁷ Nashi – a youth-movement supporting Russian President Putin – accepted responsibility for the attacks,⁴⁸ which appear to have been motivated by political reasons related to tensions in Estonian-Russian relations. Many believe that the attacks can be traced back to Russia, despite Russia’s denial of any involvement.⁴⁹ Similarly, Georgia claimed that Russia initiated DDoS attacks against a number of its governmental, commercial and media\n\n⁴⁰ Ido Kilovaty, *Cyber Warfare and the Jus Ad Bellum Challenges: Evaluation in the Light of the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare*, 1(5) AMERICAN UNIVERSITY NATIONAL SECURITY LAW BRIEF VOLUME 91, 95 (2014); Geers, supra note 1, at 3.\n\n⁴¹ For discussion, see: FRED KAPLAN, DARK TERRITORY: THE SECRET HISTORY OF CYBER WAR (2016).\n\n⁴² JOSEPH NYE, THE FUTURE OF POWER 124 (2011); Christian Payne &amp; Lorraine Finlay, *Addressing Obstacles to Cyber-Attribution: A Model Based on State Response to Cyber-Attack*, 49 GEO.

This international law obligation of due-diligence (DD) requires a state to take reasonable measures to safeguard its territory from being to misused to commit violations of international law.¹⁰¹ If such violations nonetheless occur, then the state should investigate them properly, and provide a remedy to the victims.¹⁰² Based on the DD principle, states should prevent non-state actors, or other states, from conducting cyber-attacks from within their territory.¹⁰³ A failure to meet DD obligations might give rise to a violation of international law, even if the harm was done in practice by private persons or entities.¹⁰⁴ DD is an obligation of conduct, not one of result, in the sense that it demands from the state to employ all means reasonably available to it.¹⁰⁵ It sets a standard of conduct that depends on state capacity and its actual ability to operate.¹⁰⁶ This standard was recognized by states such as Finland,¹⁰⁷ France,¹⁰⁸ and Germany, as applicable to cyber-attacks.¹⁰⁹\n\n## 2.2.

On the one hand, the SC has recognized the right of self-defense in the context of terror attacks conducted by non-state actors.¹²⁵ By contrast, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has presented a state-centered perspective, according to which an attack by a non-state entity would only qualify as an armed attack, if it is possible to attribute the act to a sovereign state.¹²⁶ As a result, some claim that there is no right to use force against non-state entities found in the territory of another state unless attribution to a state exists,¹²⁷ while others believe that victim states to an attack by non-state entities may respond with the use of military force directed against them.¹²⁸\n\nCyber-attacks can also originate from the territory of a state that is unwilling or unable to suppress such activities.¹²⁹ It is relevant to note in this regard the discussion in international law surrounding the doctrine of “unwilling or unable”, which justifies the use of force against a non-state entity, when the entity operates from the territory of a state that is “unwilling or unable” to take DD measures to deal with it.¹³⁰ While most international law scholars reject the doctrine,¹³¹ the doctrine cannot be discarded altogether since it was used by the US in its “war\n\n¹²² Michael P.

The Tallinn Manual also suggests looking into the military character of the attack.¹⁵⁰ Put simply, the effect-based approach requires physical damage to people or property.¹⁵¹\n\nA similar normative debate also exists with respect to the definition of a prohibited use of force, which nonetheless does not reach the level of gravity associated with an “armed attack” and which does not give rise to the right to self-defense. A low threshold for considering what amounts to a use of force provides states with greater discretion in responding to malicious online activity.¹⁵² Conversely, the concern with lowering the bar is that of military escalation.¹⁵³ Significantly, some states have taken a broad view on what constitutes a use of force which justifies the imposition of counter-measures (i.e., sanctions) falling short of use of force in self-defense.

Key among them is the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, which is open to countries from other regions as well, and is the most prominent international instrument dealing with cybercrime.¹⁹⁶ Cyber-attacks undertaken by non-state actors would be covered by the prohibitions and law-enforcement provisions of the Budapest Convention, which bans all forms of illegal access to computer data and systems, or data\n\n¹⁹¹ See, for example: G.A.

Part of the attribution problem derives from the structural design of the Internet, and the processes through which data is transmitted between networks, which offers excellent conditions for maintaining anonymity.²²⁰ Attackers can, for example, delay being discovered by using ‘logic bombs’, and perform attacks via intermediaries in other jurisdictions.²²¹ They can also harness zombie computers,²²² use proxy servers or resort to ‘spoofing’ tools (incorporating a misleading return address by the sender).²²³ When a cyber-attacker employs techniques, such as ‘proxy’ or ‘Stepping Stones’, the available forensic evidence might not be enough to allow technical attribution.²²⁴ The difficulty in obtaining forensic evidence from computer systems under the control of other states is another factor.²²⁵ Hence, only states with access to sophisticated forensic investigative capacities and strong intelligence services are well-positioned to succeed in undertaking technical attribution.²²⁶ Still, the context of the attack might sometimes be strongly suggestive of the identity of the perpetrator.

While cyber-security, cyber-diplomacy, technical training and education are of importance, experience in other fields related to international conflicts shows that effective regulation aimed at shaping the conduct of state and non-state actors is also of great importance.\n\nInternational law currently provides a relatively weak regulatory framework and there is a need for clearer rules that prohibit and respond to cyber-attacks, including rules that delineate what cyber-attacks constitutes an unlawful armed attack, and legal procedures that facilitate the proving and attributing of cyber-attacks. Greater reliance on international law offers states the possibility of dealing with cyber threats through public diplomacy and multilateral sanctions – policy options that go over and beyond self-reliance on passive and active cyber defense. The ability to rely on an effective international law framework might encourage states to accept reciprocal restraints in cross-border cyber operations and to exercise more intensive control over non-state actors active in this field.\n\nAlas, it will not be an easy task to promote an international agreement specifying the application of international law rules to cyber operations. For example, Russia proposed in the past an international treaty that will ban secretly embedding malicious codes for future use in case of a need, but the US opposed it.²⁴⁰ Other significant challenges relate to disagreement about the structure of the Internet (i.e., and the extent of ‘digital sovereignty’ over parts thereof) and attribution. An international instrument regulating cyber-attacks could promote greater harmonization of practices and better cooperation, including information sharing, and criminal prosecution.²⁴¹ Such an instrument can also incentivize tech-savvy states to advise and assist less-developed ones,²⁴² and promote the creation of an independent international attribution mechanism which would minimize factual disagreements and de-escalate international conflict.

Introduction\nCyberspace constitute an unstable environment, featuring rapid changes in the nature of the actors using it, the technologies applied and the inter-personal, governmental and commercial interactions facilitated thereby. The nature of the threats posed by those who abuse cyberspace is also highly dynamic in nature.¹ At the same time, the growing reliance of individuals, markets and society at large on digital devices (including on the Internet of things), and on networks which connect them to one another, generates high susceptibility in the face of malicious cyber-operations (also referred to as cyber-attacks).² The global COVID-19 pandemic exponentially accelerated the trend of digitalization in various fields of life, increasing even more the dependency on cyber-infrastructure and with it the potential for harmful cyber-attacks.³\nTraditionally, states have been cautious in invoking international law in the context of cyber-attacks, and they tended to refrain from denouncing attacks against them as violations of international law, or attributing it to other states.⁴ Such reluctance appears to derive primarily from political and operational considerations: enhancing the regulatory role of international law in cyberspace might impede espionage activities resorted to by all states, and limit the retaliation options of victim states.⁵ Another reason for the reluctance might be the lack of a credible international attribution mechanism for hostile cyber operations.⁶ Instead, states targeted by cyber-attacks resort at times to private companies providing technical attribution aimed at identifying the computer system from which the attack had originated, followed by\n¹ Kenneth Geers, *The Cyber Threat to National Critical Infrastructures: Beyond Theory*, 18 INFORMATION SECURITY JOURNAL: A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE 1, 3 (2009).\n² Oona Hathaway et al., *The Law of Cyber-Attack*, 100 CAL.

While there are of disagreements as to the way that international law applies in the cyberspace, a common understanding had emerged about some key international law norms that apply in this field.⁸ States like Australia,⁹ France,¹⁰ Germany,¹¹ Israel,¹² the United Kingdom,¹³ and the Netherlands¹⁴ have recently articulated their legal positions on how international law applies in cyberspace. In the same vein, states who fell victim to cyber-attacks are increasingly attributing them, as an international law matter, to other states, or non-state actors.¹⁵ Arguably, the increased role played by international law in cyberspace constitutes a reaction to the fact that cyber-attacks become more and more frequent, and dangerous, capable of shutting down critical infrastructure,¹⁶ including nuclear centrifuges¹⁷ and water pumping facilities.¹⁸\n⁷ Israel asserts that attribution remains a mostly technical matter that should not be overregulated, and that the choice of disclosing information supporting attribution claims remains at the exclusive discretion of the state.

Part IV concludes and suggests a way forward.\n1. A Short History of Cyber-attacks\nIt is hard to exaggerate the crucial role cyberspace plays in almost all aspects of everyday life. AI systems relying on online databases and computer networks facilitate the management of huge amounts of governmental services, economic transactions, health data and more.¹⁹ The recent COVID-19 pandemic accelerated digitalization of fields like workplace meetings, distant teaching and online shopping.²⁰\nAgainst this background, it is no surprise that cyber-attacks can and do cause significant and widespread damage.²¹ Notable attacks from recent years were directed against nuclear infrastructure²² and other basic utilities,²³ hospitals,²⁴ commercial entities,²⁵ Internet services²⁶ and more. The possible consequences of such cyber-attacks do not fall short from risks caused by kinetic military or terror attacks.²⁷ What’s more, cyber-attacks can cause a significant damage in a matter of seconds from launch to impact.²⁸ For example, the WannaCry\n¹⁹ Geers, supra note 1, at 2.\n²⁰ Laurent Gisel, Tilman Rodenhäuser &amp; Knut Dörmann, Twenty years on: International humanitarian law and the protection of civilians against the effects of cyber operations during armed conflicts, 102 INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF THE RED CROSS 287, 293 (2020).\n²¹ Tran, supra note 4, at 380.\n²² Kim Zetter, An Unprecedented Look at Stuxnet, the World's First Digital Weapon, WIRED (Nov. 3, 2014, 6:30 AM), https://www.wired.com/2014/11/countdown-to-zero-day-stuxnet/.\n²³ Herzog, supra note 16.\n²⁴ Tilman Rodenhäuser, “Cyber Attacks against Hospitals and the COVID-19 Pandemic: How Strong are International Law Protections?”, Just Security, 27 March 2020, available at: https://www.justsecurity.org/69407/cyber-attacks-against-hospitals-and-the-covid-19-pandemic-how-strong-are-international-law-protections/.\n²⁵ Andrea Peterson, The Sony Pictures Hack, Explained, WASH.

As will be elaborated in the part below dealing with attribution, tracing attacks back to their source is not an easy task even for states with advanced cyber capabilities.⁴¹ In fact, the low entry barrier for developing cyber-attack capabilities allows militarily weaker parties to international conflicts, including non-state actors,⁴² to ‘bridge the gap’ and take on powerful states (who may, paradoxically, be more vulnerable to cyber-attacks because of their greater reliance on online services and platforms).⁴³ Moreover, at times, states use non-state actors to perform cyber operations at their behest, with a view to hiding their own involvement.⁴⁴\nCyber-attacks can take a variety of forms, entailing different types of harms and inviting different preventive measures and regulatory responses. A highly common form of a cyberattack is a Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) operation, during which botnets devastate computer servers through large scale repeat visits to designated websites.⁴⁵ DDOS attacks come in many forms, including network flooding, data modification, electromagnetic interference and more.⁴⁶ Famous DDOS attacks are the attacks conducted during April 2007 on the densely wired Estonia, as well as attacks in Georgia during 2008, ahead of the Russian invasion to South Ossetia.⁴⁷ Nashi – a youth-movement supporting Russian President Putin – accepted responsibility for the attacks,⁴⁸ which appear to have been motivated by political reasons related to tensions in Estonian-Russian relations. Many believe that the attacks can be traced back to Russia, despite Russia’s denial of any involvement.⁴⁹ Similarly, Georgia claimed that Russia initiated DDoS attacks against a number of its governmental, commercial and media\n⁴⁰ Ido Kilovaty, *Cyber Warfare and the Jus Ad Bellum Challenges: Evaluation in the Light of the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare*, 1(5) AMERICAN UNIVERSITY NATIONAL SECURITY LAW BRIEF VOLUME 91, 95 (2014); Geers, supra note 1, at 3.\n⁴¹ For discussion, see: FRED KAPLAN, DARK TERRITORY: THE SECRET HISTORY OF CYBER WAR (2016).\n⁴² JOSEPH NYE, THE FUTURE OF POWER 124 (2011); Christian Payne &amp; Lorraine Finlay, *Addressing Obstacles to Cyber-Attribution: A Model Based on State Response to Cyber-Attack*, 49 GEO.

As a result, there is greater urgency in regulating threat and harm-generating cyber-operations and the responses of the victim state. We will now refer to some international legal instruments which are provide the framework for regulation of cyber-attacks and state responses to them.\n## 2. The International Law Framework governing Cyber-attacks\nCyberspace has been characterized by some as a domain devoid of normative limitations.⁹⁶ This is because Internet and other cyber-infrastructures allegedly operate as a global network that is beyond the sovereign control of any specific state and there is no international cooperation agreement underlying its existence or manner of operation (unlike other international infrastructure such as telephone systems).⁹⁷ While, in the future, a new branch of law specifically aimed at regulating the conduct of all relevant stakeholders in cyberspace (lex cybernetica) might emerge,⁹⁸ legal experts and state officials – especially, officials coming from victim states that have much more to lose from cyber-attacks than their attackers – have attempted to fill the normative void by adjusting existing rules of international law to the challenges posed by cyber-attacks.\nWe will now present shortly some international law norms which might be of relevance to regulating cyber-attacks, and discuss in this connection international instruments, such as the United Nations (UN) Charter,⁹⁹ and the International Law Commission Articles on State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts (\"ARSIWA\").¹⁰⁰\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3961263\n10\n## 2.1. Due diligence\nAs a starting point, a state should not allow its territory to be used to violate the rights of other states – including via hostile cyber operations. This international law obligation of due-diligence (DD) requires a state to take reasonable measures to safeguard its territory from being to misused to commit violations of international law.¹⁰¹ If such violations nonetheless occur, then the state should investigate them properly, and provide a remedy to the victims.¹⁰² Based on the DD principle, states should prevent non-state actors, or other states, from conducting cyber-attacks from within their territory.¹⁰³ A failure to meet DD obligations might give rise to a violation of international law, even if the harm was done in practice by private persons or entities.¹⁰⁴ DD is an obligation of conduct, not one of result, in the sense that it demands from the state to employ all means reasonably available to it.¹⁰⁵ It sets a standard of conduct that depends on state capacity and its actual ability to operate.¹⁰⁶ This standard was recognized by states such as Finland,¹⁰⁷ France,¹⁰⁸ and Germany, as applicable to cyber-attacks.¹⁰⁹\n## 2.2. Use of force and non-intervention\nTo the extent that cyber operations constitute an integral part of the reality of armed conflicts,¹¹⁰ there is little question that the laws that apply to armed conflicts also apply to aggressive and defensive cyber operations. However, cyber operations also occur during situations of political tension and conflict which do not involve the use of kinetic weapons.¹¹¹\n¹⁰¹ Corfu Channel (U.K. v.

Prohibition on the use of force and non-intervention – general\nThe prohibition against the use of force in international law, which is a *jus cogens* (peremptory) norm,¹¹⁸ is enshrined in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.¹¹⁹ There are two exceptions to the prohibition which are stipulated in the Charter: (1) Authorization by the Security Council (SC) under the collective security system; (2) Individual self-defense or collective self-defense against an armed attack.¹²⁰ There is some debate regarding the existence of additional exceptions.¹²¹\nCyberattack on Iranian Port Facility, WASHINGTON POST, 18 May 2020, available at: https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/officials-israel-linked-to-a-disruptive-cyberattack-on-iranian-port-facility/2020/05/18/9d1da866-9942-11ea-89fd-28fb313d1886_story.html.\n¹¹² United Nations Charter, 24 October 1945, 1 UNTS XVI.

On the one hand, the SC has recognized the right of self-defense in the context of terror attacks conducted by non-state actors.¹²⁵ By contrast, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has presented a state-centered perspective, according to which an attack by a non-state entity would only qualify as an armed attack, if it is possible to attribute the act to a sovereign state.¹²⁶ As a result, some claim that there is no right to use force against non-state entities found in the territory of another state unless attribution to a state exists,¹²⁷ while others believe that victim states to an attack by non-state entities may respond with the use of military force directed against them.¹²⁸\nCyber-attacks can also originate from the territory of a state that is unwilling or unable to suppress such activities.¹²⁹ It is relevant to note in this regard the discussion in international law surrounding the doctrine of “unwilling or unable”, which justifies the use of force against a non-state entity, when the entity operates from the territory of a state that is “unwilling or unable” to take DD measures to deal with it.¹³⁰ While most international law scholars reject the doctrine,¹³¹ the doctrine cannot be discarded altogether since it was used by the US in its “war\n¹²² Michael P.

Cyber-attacks and the prohibition on the use of force\nThe applicability to cyberspace of the prohibition against the use of force, as well as the self-defense exception, are reaffirmed in rules 10 and 13 of the Tallinn Manual,¹³⁸ and is supported by a recent UN Group of Governmental Experts report.¹³⁹ Yet, there are three main approaches, in the academic literature, to the application of the right to self-defense against an armed attack in the context of cyber-attacks: 1) the instrument-based approach; 2) the target-based approach; and 3) the effects-based approach.¹⁴⁰\nThe instrument-based approach categorizes an act as an armed attack giving rise to the right to self-defense only if the harm it causes has characteristics traditionally associated with the harm caused by military force.¹⁴¹ While this approach promotes predictability,¹⁴² it is perceived as outmoded.¹⁴³ The second approach, the target-based approach, classifies a cyberattack against critical infrastructure as an armed attack, regardless of its consequences.¹⁴⁴ It\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3961263\nignores the actual effects of the attack and places all emphasis on the nature of the target.¹⁴⁵ Critical infrastructure includes computer systems central to the operation of the banking, health, transportation and management of natural resources sectors.¹⁴⁶ Whereas the instrument-based approach has been criticized for placing too high the bar for armed attacks, target-based approach has been criticized for placing the bar too low, facilitating thereby unnecessary escalation of international conflicts.¹⁴⁷\nThe third approach, the effects-based approach, constitutes the middle road between the other two approaches and is, perhaps not surprisingly, the dominant of the three.¹⁴⁸ Under this approach, a cyber-attack can constitute an armed attack which may be responded to by force based on several criteria, elaborated by Schmitt:¹⁴⁹ the degree of physical destruction; temporal proximity between the attack and its consequences; the existence of a direct link between the damage and the attack; the level of invasiveness of the attack; and measurability of the harm. The Tallinn Manual also suggests looking into the military character of the attack.¹⁵⁰ Put simply, the effect-based approach requires physical damage to people or property.¹⁵¹\nA similar normative debate also exists with respect to the definition of a prohibited use of force, which nonetheless does not reach the level of gravity associated with an “armed attack” and which does not give rise to the right to self-defense. A low threshold for considering what amounts to a use of force provides states with greater discretion in responding to malicious online activity.¹⁵² Conversely, the concern with lowering the bar is that of military escalation.¹⁵³ Significantly, some states have taken a broad view on what constitutes a use of force which justifies the imposition of counter-measures (i.e., sanctions) falling short of use of force in self-defense. For example, France considers that a cyber operation without physical effects can be perceived as prohibited use of force,¹⁵⁴ and the Netherlands has taken the position\n¹⁴⁵ Sheng Li, *When Does Internet Denial Trigger the Right of Armed Self-Defense?*, 38 YALE J.

One notable disagreement revolves around the question of whether data can be regarded a “protected object” due to its predominantly civilian nature.¹⁶⁹ The position of Tallinn Manual, which is supported by some states, is that only tangible things can constitute objects,¹⁷⁰ but other states, like France, maintain that civilian data can constitute a protected object.¹⁷¹\nThe cyber context presents a difficult challenge for distinguishing between military and civilians objects given the dual-use of cyberspace and the integrated nature of its infrastructures.¹⁷² For example, civilian transportation vehicles and traffic controls are\n¹⁶⁴ Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I), June 8, 1977, 1125 U.N.T.S. 3, article 48 &amp; 54; JEAN-MARIE HENCKAERTS &amp; LOUISE DOSWALD-BECK, CUSTOMARY INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW, rules 7 &amp; 54 (2006).\n¹⁶⁵ Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I), June 8, 1977, 1125 U.N.T.S. 3, article 51; AMICHAI COHEN, PROPORTIONALITY IN MODERN ASYMMETRICAL ARMED WARS (2010).\n¹⁶⁶ Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I), June 8, 1977, 1125 U.N.T.S. 3, article 48 &amp; 54; HENCKAERTS &amp; LOUISE DOSWALD-BECK, supra note 164, rules 7 &amp; 54 (2006).\n¹⁶⁷ TALLINN MANUAL 2.0, supra note 34, commentary on Rule 141.\n¹⁶⁸ Islamic Republic of Iran, The Initial “Pre-draft” of the report of the OEWG on developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security Preliminary reflection (April 2020), p. 2, available at: https://front.un-arm.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/iran-preliminary-on-oewg-pre-draft-15-april-2020-1.pdf (“applying the international humanitarian law, which is exclusively for armed conflicts, into ICT environment… need to be avoided”).\n¹⁶⁹ Some consider the notion of “object” to be limited to items with physical characteristics, namely tangible items. See: TALLINN MANUAL 2.0, supra note 34, at 373.

In the same vein, it is almost impossible to delimit the impact of malwares used in cyber-attacks, since they can spread quickly to computers across many geographical regions.¹⁷⁴ For example, in the Stuxnet incident, the worm targeting computers in Iran also infiltrated computers in other states like India and Russia.¹⁷⁵ Still, one positive aspect in introducing IHL in the cyber-context is that certain cyber operations might cause less severe damage to civilians and civilian objects than traditional means of warfare.¹⁷⁶\n## 2.3. Cyber-attacks and the non-intervention principle\nAnother important principle of international law regulating cyber-attacks and responses thereto is the principle of non-intervention. According to this principle, states are entitled to conduct key domestic government functions (domaine réservé) without foreign interference.¹⁷⁷ And while, it has been observed that, in practice, this non-intervention principles is often honored in the breach,¹⁷⁸ it is nevertheless a key component of the international legal order.¹⁷⁹ Cyber operations have opened new avenues of intervention in the internal affairs of foreign states, including manipulation of elections (e.g., the 2016 intervention in the US Presidential elections),¹⁸⁰ bringing into focus claims about violation of the principle of non-intervention.¹⁸¹\nIn sum, the prohibition against the use of force, as well as the principle of non-intervention and the obligation of due diligence, are applicable to hostile cyber operations.

Other relevant regulatory frameworks\n### 2.4.1. Specific branches of international law\nThere are additional international law regimes that are relevant to the regulation of cyber-attacks in specific circumstances.¹⁸³ International telecommunication regulations prohibit interference with broadcasts of authorized frequencies of other states, as well as harmful interferences that endanger radio-navigation or radio-communication service or other radio safety services, or seriously degrade, obstruct or repeatedly interrupt such services.¹⁸⁴ Cyber-attacks that disrupt telecommunication infrastructure may violate these international regulations. Still, international telecommunications regulations do not prohibit, as a rule, attacks aimed at military radio.¹⁸⁵\nCyber-attacks aimed at disruption of air traffic control and flight passenger lists might implicate international aviation law.¹⁸⁶ Cyber operations that target civilian flights also run contrary to this international regime.¹⁸⁷ In the same vein, cyber-attacks directed against submarine cables implicate the international law of the sea, which requires states to punish those who damage them.¹⁸⁸ Also prohibited are unauthorized broadcasting from the high seas,¹⁸⁹ which may cover certain marine-based cyber-attacks. Given the very specific circumstances in which these provisions apply, they provide minimal protections in the face of cyber-attacks.¹⁹⁰\n¹⁸² The Tallinn Manual, for example, suggests that force is not mere economic or political coercion. See: TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 151.\n¹⁸³ Some suggested that international space law could be used to regulate cyber-attacks. For discussion, see: Hathaway, supra note 2, at 866, 870-872. As noted by Hathaway, these potentially effective tools fail to provide a complete nor a coherent response for cyber-attacks.\n¹⁸⁴ Constitution of the International Telecommunications Union, Dec. 22, 1992, art. 45, available at: https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%201825/volume-1825-I-31251-English.pdf.\n¹⁸⁵ Ibid, art. 48.

International organizations\nInternational organizations serve as important venues for regulating cyber-attacks and responses thereto. At the UN level, several General Assembly resolutions dealt with developments in cyberspace,¹⁹¹ and the General Assembly initiated, since 2004, six Groups of Governmental Experts (GGE) sessions aimed at identifying international law principles applicable in cyberspace.¹⁹² The most recent round of GGE meetings began on 2019 and included the permanent members of the Security Council and government experts from other countries, selected based on the principle of equitable geographical representation.¹⁹³ The recent report of the Group highlighted the need to respect in cyberspace the following UN Charter principles: 1) sovereign equality; 2) the settlement of disputes by peaceful means; 3) the prohibition against the use of force; and 4) non-intervention.¹⁹⁴ The General Assembly also established in 2018 an Open-ended Working Group, open to all UN members, to consider ways to advance international cooperation in light of new developments in cyberspace.¹⁹⁵\nAt the regional level, one may note the role of the Council of Europe in advancing standards relating to the regulation of cyberspace. Key among them is the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, which is open to countries from other regions as well, and is the most prominent international instrument dealing with cybercrime.¹⁹⁶ Cyber-attacks undertaken by non-state actors would be covered by the prohibitions and law-enforcement provisions of the Budapest Convention, which bans all forms of illegal access to computer data and systems, or data\n¹⁹¹ See, for example: G.A.

Still, the Convention does not apply to acts undertaken by law enforcement agencies or to other governmental acts undertaken in the name of national security.¹⁹⁷\nThe Shanghai Cooperation Organization has also been active in this field and has adopted a broad definition of cyber-attacks or “information war” tools, which includes cyber operations that seek to destabilize society and affect the political affairs of a foreign State.¹⁹⁸ This approach is at odds with the approach taken by Western states, since the latter generally oppose restrictions on cyber-activity which limit freedoms.¹⁹⁹\nThe EU is another significant regional framework addressing cyber-attacks. It has developed in 2017 a Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox, which prescribes a collective response to cyber-attacks,²⁰⁰ and in 2019 it developed a blacklist of individuals and non-state entities involved in cyber-attacks.²⁰¹ The Organization of American States (“OAS”) has also advanced the field of cyber-security, with its focus being on providing expertise in support of efforts by its member States to draft domestic cyber security regulations.²⁰²\nAn important regional development came with the establishment of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (“NATO”) Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (“CCDCOE”), in the aftermath of the cyber-attacks against Estonia during 2007.²⁰³ The CCDCOE seeks to develop international cyber doctrine and strategy, and its flagship research initiative has been the Tallinn Manual which purports to interpret the main rules of international law of relevance to the regulation of cyberspace.²⁰⁴ While the Manual contains a non-binding\n¹⁹⁷ Council of Europe, Convention on Cybercrime, Explanatory Report, C.E.T.S.

The attribution challenge\nWhen confronted with a cyber-attack, States can choose to respond through cyber tools, such as hack-backs,²⁰⁷ resort to kinetic military force or engage in diplomacy. A preliminary issue, regardless of the type of response selected is attribution.²⁰⁸ This is since establishing the identity of the attacker is crucial to direct a response against it.\nFor example, a victim state to a violation of international law which does not amount to an armed attack, is permitted to take non-forceful proportionate countermeasures against the violating state provided it can legally attribute the original attack to it or show it violated its DD obligations.²⁰⁹ Lawful countermeasures are measures that would normally be considered themselves as a violation of international law, but their wrongfulness is precluded when they come in response to a prior unlawful act (provided that they are notified as such and are proportionate to the violation).²¹⁰ They are an important self-help tool for states,²¹¹ in a decentralized international legal system.²¹² Still, as indicated above, states might prefer not to disclose evidence – even if doing so is critical for attribution.²¹³ So, although advancements have been made in regard to the technical ability to attribute cyber-attacks,²¹⁴ political will to publicly make legal attribution is often lacking.²¹⁵\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3961263\n22\nThe legal framework governing the attribution of responsibility of states was codified in the ARSIWA,²¹⁶ which is largely reflective of customary international law.²¹⁷ State responsibility can usually arise when acts are performed by an organ of the state, persons entrusted with governmental authority, or pursuant to state instructions, direction or control.²¹⁸ States can also be responsible for acts that they acknowledged and adopted as their own.²¹⁹\nThere are some noteworthy challenges when applying the ARSIWA framework to cyber-attacks. Part of the attribution problem derives from the structural design of the Internet, and the processes through which data is transmitted between networks, which offers excellent conditions for maintaining anonymity.²²⁰ Attackers can, for example, delay being discovered by using ‘logic bombs’, and perform attacks via intermediaries in other jurisdictions.²²¹ They can also harness zombie computers,²²² use proxy servers or resort to ‘spoofing’ tools (incorporating a misleading return address by the sender).²²³ When a cyber-attacker employs techniques, such as ‘proxy’ or ‘Stepping Stones’, the available forensic evidence might not be enough to allow technical attribution.²²⁴ The difficulty in obtaining forensic evidence from computer systems under the control of other states is another factor.²²⁵ Hence, only states with access to sophisticated forensic investigative capacities and strong intelligence services are well-positioned to succeed in undertaking technical attribution.²²⁶ Still, the context of the attack might sometimes be strongly suggestive of the identity of the perpetrator.

The way forward\nThe evolving nature of cyberspace and technology invites constant assessment of the applicable regulatory frameworks, including regulation of cyber-attacks. The threat of cyber-\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3961263\n24\nattacks, capable of shutting down economic activity and media and communication networks, or disrupting commerce and impair governmental activity, is ever-present and ubiquitous in the digital age, and the recent COVID-19 crisis illustrated the growing dependency of information societies on digital technology and network connectivity. While cyber-security, cyber-diplomacy, technical training and education are of importance, experience in other fields related to international conflicts shows that effective regulation aimed at shaping the conduct of state and non-state actors is also of great importance.\nInternational law currently provides a relatively weak regulatory framework and there is a need for clearer rules that prohibit and respond to cyber-attacks, including rules that delineate what cyber-attacks constitutes an unlawful armed attack, and legal procedures that facilitate the proving and attributing of cyber-attacks. Greater reliance on international law offers states the possibility of dealing with cyber threats through public diplomacy and multilateral sanctions – policy options that go over and beyond self-reliance on passive and active cyber defense. The ability to rely on an effective international law framework might encourage states to accept reciprocal restraints in cross-border cyber operations and to exercise more intensive control over non-state actors active in this field.\nAlas, it will not be an easy task to promote an international agreement specifying the application of international law rules to cyber operations. For example, Russia proposed in the past an international treaty that will ban secretly embedding malicious codes for future use in case of a need, but the US opposed it.²⁴⁰ Other significant challenges relate to disagreement about the structure of the Internet (i.e., and the extent of ‘digital sovereignty’ over parts thereof) and attribution. An international instrument regulating cyber-attacks could promote greater harmonization of practices and better cooperation, including information sharing, and criminal prosecution.²⁴¹ Such an instrument can also incentivize tech-savvy states to advise and assist less-developed ones,²⁴² and promote the creation of an independent international attribution mechanism which would minimize factual disagreements and de-escalate international conflict. Despite the many challenges ahead, the project of strengthening international regulation of cyber-attacks should not be discarded.\n²⁴⁰ For discussion, see: O’Connell, supra note 36, at 205-206.\n²⁴¹ Hathaway, supra note 2, at 878-880.

Introduction\nCyberspace constitute an unstable environment, featuring rapid changes in the nature of the actors using it, the technologies applied and the inter-personal, governmental and commercial interactions facilitated thereby. The nature of the threats posed by those who abuse cyberspace is also highly dynamic in nature. At the same time, the growing reliance of individuals, markets and society at large on digital devices (including on the Internet of things), and on networks which connect them to one another, generates high susceptibility in the face of malicious cyber-operations (also referred to as cyber-attacks). The global COVID-19 pandemic exponentially accelerated the trend of digitalization in various fields of life, increasing even more the dependency on cyber-infrastructure and with it the potential for harmful cyber-attacks.\nTraditionally, states have been cautious in invoking international law in the context of cyber-attacks, and they tended to refrain from denouncing attacks against them as violations of international law, or attributing it to other states. Such reluctance appears to derive primarily from political and operational considerations: enhancing the regulatory role of international law in cyberspace might impede espionage activities resorted to by all states, and limit the retaliation options of victim states. Another reason for the reluctance might be the lack of a credible international attribution mechanism for hostile cyber operations.

While there are of disagreements as to the way that international law applies in the cyberspace, a common understanding had emerged about some key international law norms that apply in this field. States like Australia, France, Germany, Israel, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands have recently articulated their legal positions on how international law applies in cyberspace. In the same vein, states who fell victim to cyber-attacks are increasingly attributing them, as an international law matter, to other states, or non-state actors. Arguably, the increased role played by international law in cyberspace constitutes a reaction to the fact that cyber-attacks become more and more frequent, and dangerous, capable of shutting down critical infrastructure, including nuclear centrifuges and water pumping facilities.\n Israel asserts that attribution remains a mostly technical matter that should not be overregulated, and that the choice of disclosing information supporting attribution claims remains at the exclusive discretion of the state.

Part IV concludes and suggests a way forward.\n1. A Short History of Cyber-attacks\nIt is hard to exaggerate the crucial role cyberspace plays in almost all aspects of everyday life. AI systems relying on online databases and computer networks facilitate the management of huge amounts of governmental services, economic transactions, health data and more. The recent COVID-19 pandemic accelerated digitalization of fields like workplace meetings, distant teaching and online shopping.\nAgainst this background, it is no surprise that cyber-attacks can and do cause significant and widespread damage. Notable attacks from recent years were directed against nuclear infrastructure and other basic utilities, hospitals, commercial entities, Internet services and more. The possible consequences of such cyber-attacks do not fall short from risks caused by kinetic military or terror attacks. What’s more, cyber-attacks can cause a significant damage in a matter of seconds from launch to impact.

The Tallinn Manual, which presents a comprehensive effort by an international group of experts to adapt international law to cyberspace, defines cyber-attack as an offensive or defensive cyber operation that is reasonably expected to bring about to injury or death to individuals, or to destruction of objects.\nThe challenge such attacks pose for policy makers stems not only from the transition of critical infrastructure systems from dedicated internal networks to the open Internet and the ensuing growing reliance of information societies on inter-connected platforms for important public functions, but also from the fact that private corporations have an increasingly important role in the management of critical infrastructures. This makes the rise in number, frequency and severity of cyber-attacks in recent years a serious problem for the national security interests of states, as well as a serious threat for the business interests of the private sector. The relations between private and governmental bodies in cyberspace also complicate the ability to rely on international law as a regulatory framework.\nSignificantly, the mix between public and private entities also exists on the attacking side. The relative low costs of conducting cyber-attacks and the ability to maintain a high\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3961263\n\ndegree of anonymity while engaging in such attacks, renders resort to such attacks an available and attractive option in the eyes of criminals, hacktivists and political extremists. As will be elaborated in the part below dealing with attribution, tracing attacks back to their source is not an easy task even for states with advanced cyber capabilities. In fact, the low entry barrier for developing cyber-attack capabilities allows militarily weaker parties to international conflicts, including non-state actors, to ‘bridge the gap’ and take on powerful states (who may, paradoxically, be more vulnerable to cyber-attacks because of their greater reliance on online services and platforms). Moreover, at times, states use non-state actors to perform cyber operations at their behest, with a view to hiding their own involvement.\nCyber-attacks can take a variety of forms, entailing different types of harms and inviting different preventive measures and regulatory responses. A highly common form of a cyberattack is a Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) operation, during which botnets devastate computer servers through large scale repeat visits to designated websites. DDOS attacks come in many forms, including network flooding, data modification, electromagnetic interference and more. Famous DDOS attacks are the attacks conducted during April 2007 on the densely wired Estonia, as well as attacks in Georgia during 2008, ahead of the Russian invasion to South Ossetia. Nashi – a youth-movement supporting Russian President Putin – accepted responsibility for the attacks, which appear to have been motivated by political reasons related to tensions in Estonian-Russian relations. Many believe that the attacks can be traced back to Russia, despite Russia’s denial of any involvement. Similarly, Georgia claimed that Russia initiated DDoS attacks against a number of its governmental, commercial and media\n Ido Kilovaty, *Cyber Warfare and the Jus Ad Bellum Challenges: Evaluation in the Light of the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare*, 1(5) AMERICAN UNIVERSITY NATIONAL SECURITY LAW BRIEF VOLUME 91, 95 (2014); Geers, supra note 1, at 3.\n For discussion, see: FRED KAPLAN, DARK TERRITORY: THE SECRET HISTORY OF CYBER WAR (2016).\n JOSEPH NYE, THE FUTURE OF POWER 124 (2011); Christian Payne &amp; Lorraine Finlay, *Addressing Obstacles to Cyber-Attribution: A Model Based on State Response to Cyber-Attack*, 49 GEO.

More recently, hospitals around the globe faced DDOS attacks during the Covid-19 pandemic; the motives underlying such attacks are less than clear. $^{52}$\nA more sophisticated form of cyber-attack is a syntactic attack that involves malware that manipulates and damages the operation of computer systems.53 A prime example is Stuxnet,54 which was described as a joint US and Israeli effort.55 Stuxnet was a malware that infiltrated Iranian nuclear facilities in or before 2010 in order to destroy centrifuges used for uranium enrichment.56 It disrupted the systems at the nuclear facilities,57 and destroyed centrifuges while sending false signals that disabled safety systems in place.58 Stuxnet was the first syntactic attack directed against security infrastructure.59 Unlike previous cyber-attacks, such as the one in Estonia, Stuxnet caused significant damage to physical objects.60\nBeyond that, there are other cyber-operations that may qualify as cyber-attacks. $^{61}$ These include data theft and doxing, $^{62}$ ransomware attacks, $^{63}$ network attacks, $^{64}$ spoofing $^{65}$ and\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3961263\n\nOver the years, states have developed mechanisms to prevent and respond to cyber-attacks. These include defensive-passive tools like firewalls, but also offensive-active tools, comprising active defense measures, which attempt to disable the source of an attack. The legality of such active defense measures is questionable, however, under the norms of international law applicable to cyberspace articulated in the Tallinn Manual, which do not themselves enjoy full political and legal consensus.\nAs mentioned above, states have been traditionally hesitant to invoke international law in the context of cyber-attacks. Even victim states have often refrained from acknowledging they were attacked; and when acknowledging it, they were slow in invoking international law norms or attempting to attribute the attack to another state. This reluctance might be driven by concerns about the reputation for safety of their digital environment, or a wish to deflect domestic pressures to react. Also, when responding to attacks, states appear to prefer the pragmatic pursuit of political and national security interests over making public legal claims which would bind them to a particular interpretation of international law and might require the disclosure of confidential information. Instead, tech-savvy states feel well positioned to rely on their own capabilities, alongside those of their partners, to defend themselves from cyber-attacks. Another possible reason for the hesitancy of states is that there is no credible international attribution mechanism that can support legal claims concerning cyber-attacks. A number of proposals for the establishment of an international attribution mechanism have\n See, for example: MARTIN C.

A growing number of states outlined their legal views as to the way in which international law governs cyberspace. $^{82}$ Examples include statements by Australia, $^{83}$ Finland, $^{84}$ France, $^{85}$ Germany, $^{86}$ Israel, $^{87}$ the United Kingdom, $^{88}$ the Netherlands $^{89}$ and New Zealand. $^{90}$ This change may be attributed in part to the rise in cyber-attacks around the world during the Covid-19 crisis. The health-care sector has proved itself particularly vulnerable to cyber-attacks and hospitals, other health-care facilities and research institutions involved in developing vaccines were targeted by hostile cyber operations. $^{91}$ In addition, cyber-attackers directed their attention towards international organizations involved in responding to the crisis, $^{92}$ most notably the World Health\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3961263\nOrganization, complicating international efforts to cope with the pandemic. Another problem that arose during the crisis was the spread on-line of disinformation campaigns.\nIn sum, cyber-attacks pose a growing threat for states and their critical infrastructure. As a result, there is greater urgency in regulating threat and harm-generating cyber-operations and the responses of the victim state. We will now refer to some international legal instruments which are provide the framework for regulation of cyber-attacks and state responses to them.\n## 2. The International Law Framework governing Cyber-attacks\nCyberspace has been characterized by some as a domain devoid of normative limitations. This is because Internet and other cyber-infrastructures allegedly operate as a global network that is beyond the sovereign control of any specific state and there is no international cooperation agreement underlying its existence or manner of operation (unlike other international infrastructure such as telephone systems). While, in the future, a new branch of law specifically aimed at regulating the conduct of all relevant stakeholders in cyberspace (lex cybernetica) might emerge, legal experts and state officials – especially, officials coming from victim states that have much more to lose from cyber-attacks than their attackers – have attempted to fill the normative void by adjusting existing rules of international law to the challenges posed by cyber-attacks.\nWe will now present shortly some international law norms which might be of relevance to regulating cyber-attacks, and discuss in this connection international instruments, such as the United Nations (UN) Charter, and the International Law Commission Articles on State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts (\"ARSIWA\").\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3961263\n\nAs a starting point, a state should not allow its territory to be used to violate the rights of other states – including via hostile cyber operations. This international law obligation of due-diligence (DD) requires a state to take reasonable measures to safeguard its territory from being to misused to commit violations of international law. If such violations nonetheless occur, then the state should investigate them properly, and provide a remedy to the victims. Based on the DD principle, states should prevent non-state actors, or other states, from conducting cyber-attacks from within their territory. A failure to meet DD obligations might give rise to a violation of international law, even if the harm was done in practice by private persons or entities. DD is an obligation of conduct, not one of result, in the sense that it demands from the state to employ all means reasonably available to it. It sets a standard of conduct that depends on state capacity and its actual ability to operate. This standard was recognized by states such as Finland, France, and Germany, as applicable to cyber-attacks.\n## 2.2. Use of force and non-intervention\nTo the extent that cyber operations constitute an integral part of the reality of armed conflicts, there is little question that the laws that apply to armed conflicts also apply to aggressive and defensive cyber operations. However, cyber operations also occur during situations of political tension and conflict which do not involve the use of kinetic weapons.\n Corfu Channel (U.K. v.

Note that cyber-attacks can have a deadly result, even when conducted outside armed conflicts – e.g., when a malware interferes with the functioning of hospitals.\nThere are three main approaches to appraise if and when a cyber-attack constitutes an armed attack: the instrument-based approach, the target-based approach, and the effects-based approach. As will be elaborated below, the effects-based approach seems to be the most suitable one for regulating cyber-attacks. In this part, we will introduce the regime regulating the use of force in international law (jus ad bellum), and consider the three main approaches for applying it to cyber-attacks.\n## 2.2.1. Prohibition on the use of force and non-intervention – general\nThe prohibition against the use of force in international law, which is a *jus cogens* (peremptory) norm, is enshrined in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. There are two exceptions to the prohibition which are stipulated in the Charter: (1) Authorization by the Security Council (SC) under the collective security system; (2) Individual self-defense or collective self-defense against an armed attack. There is some debate regarding the existence of additional exceptions.\nCyberattack on Iranian Port Facility, WASHINGTON POST, 18 May 2020, available at: https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/officials-israel-linked-to-a-disruptive-cyberattack-on-iranian-port-facility/2020/05/18/9d1da866-9942-11ea-89fd-28fb313d1886_story.html.\n United Nations Charter, 24 October 1945, 1 UNTS XVI.

On the one hand, the SC has recognized the right of self-defense in the context of terror attacks conducted by non-state actors. By contrast, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has presented a state-centered perspective, according to which an attack by a non-state entity would only qualify as an armed attack, if it is possible to attribute the act to a sovereign state. As a result, some claim that there is no right to use force against non-state entities found in the territory of another state unless attribution to a state exists, while others believe that victim states to an attack by non-state entities may respond with the use of military force directed against them.\nCyber-attacks can also originate from the territory of a state that is unwilling or unable to suppress such activities. It is relevant to note in this regard the discussion in international law surrounding the doctrine of “unwilling or unable”, which justifies the use of force against a non-state entity, when the entity operates from the territory of a state that is “unwilling or unable” to take DD measures to deal with it. While most international law scholars reject the doctrine, the doctrine cannot be discarded altogether since it was used by the US in its “war\n Michael P.

Cyber-attacks and the prohibition on the use of force\nThe applicability to cyberspace of the prohibition against the use of force, as well as the self-defense exception, are reaffirmed in rules 10 and 13 of the Tallinn Manual, and is supported by a recent UN Group of Governmental Experts report. Yet, there are three main approaches, in the academic literature, to the application of the right to self-defense against an armed attack in the context of cyber-attacks: 1) the instrument-based approach; 2) the target-based approach; and 3) the effects-based approach.\nThe instrument-based approach categorizes an act as an armed attack giving rise to the right to self-defense only if the harm it causes has characteristics traditionally associated with the harm caused by military force. While this approach promotes predictability, it is perceived as outmoded. The second approach, the target-based approach, classifies a cyberattack against critical infrastructure as an armed attack, regardless of its consequences. It\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3961263\nignores the actual effects of the attack and places all emphasis on the nature of the target. Critical infrastructure includes computer systems central to the operation of the banking, health, transportation and management of natural resources sectors. Whereas the instrument-based approach has been criticized for placing too high the bar for armed attacks, target-based approach has been criticized for placing the bar too low, facilitating thereby unnecessary escalation of international conflicts.\nThe third approach, the effects-based approach, constitutes the middle road between the other two approaches and is, perhaps not surprisingly, the dominant of the three. Under this approach, a cyber-attack can constitute an armed attack which may be responded to by force based on several criteria, elaborated by Schmitt: the degree of physical destruction; temporal proximity between the attack and its consequences; the existence of a direct link between the damage and the attack; the level of invasiveness of the attack; and measurability of the harm. The Tallinn Manual also suggests looking into the military character of the attack. Put simply, the effect-based approach requires physical damage to people or property.\nA similar normative debate also exists with respect to the definition of a prohibited use of force, which nonetheless does not reach the level of gravity associated with an “armed attack” and which does not give rise to the right to self-defense. A low threshold for considering what amounts to a use of force provides states with greater discretion in responding to malicious online activity. Conversely, the concern with lowering the bar is that of military escalation. Significantly, some states have taken a broad view on what constitutes a use of force which justifies the imposition of counter-measures (i.e., sanctions) falling short of use of force in self-defense. For example, France considers that a cyber operation without physical effects can be perceived as prohibited use of force, and the Netherlands has taken the position\n Sheng Li, *When Does Internet Denial Trigger the Right of Armed Self-Defense?*, 38 YALE J.

The counter-force used may be kinetic or cybernetic.\n## 2.2.3 Cyber-attacks and the laws of armed conflict\nOnce an armed conflict has erupted, or if cyber-attacks have occurred in the context of an already active armed conflict, then another set of rules kicks in - International Humanitarian Law (IHL), adding an additional layer of legal regulation. Some protections under IHL are particularly relevant to cyber-attacks.

Cyber-attacks directed at critical computer system infrastructure supporting objects indispensable for the survival of the civilian population, such as food or water supplies, would appear to violate all the aforementioned principles. The Tallinn Manual suggests, however, that the Internet as such cannot be considered as an object indispensable to the survival of the civilian population.\nWhereas a few states, like Iran, express deep reservations concerning the application of IHL to cyberspace, the majority of states to do not contest its application, but still disagree on specific questions relating to its exact manner of application. One notable disagreement revolves around the question of whether data can be regarded a “protected object” due to its predominantly civilian nature. The position of Tallinn Manual, which is supported by some states, is that only tangible things can constitute objects, but other states, like France, maintain that civilian data can constitute a protected object.\nThe cyber context presents a difficult challenge for distinguishing between military and civilians objects given the dual-use of cyberspace and the integrated nature of its infrastructures. For example, civilian transportation vehicles and traffic controls are\n Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I), June 8, 1977, 1125 U.N.T.S. 3, article 48 &amp; 54; JEAN-MARIE HENCKAERTS &amp; LOUISE DOSWALD-BECK, CUSTOMARY INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW, rules 7 &amp; 54 (2006).\n Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I), June 8, 1977, 1125 U.N.T.S. 3, article 51; AMICHAI COHEN, PROPORTIONALITY IN MODERN ASYMMETRICAL ARMED WARS (2010).\n Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I), June 8, 1977, 1125 U.N.T.S. 3, article 48 &amp; 54; HENCKAERTS &amp; LOUISE DOSWALD-BECK, supra note 164, rules 7 &amp; 54 (2006).\n TALLINN MANUAL 2.0, supra note 34, commentary on Rule 141.\n Islamic Republic of Iran, The Initial “Pre-draft” of the report of the OEWG on developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security Preliminary reflection (April 2020), p. 2, available at: https://front.un-arm.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/iran-preliminary-on-oewg-pre-draft-15-april-2020-1.pdf (“applying the international humanitarian law, which is exclusively for armed conflicts, into ICT environment… need to be avoided”).\n Some consider the notion of “object” to be limited to items with physical characteristics, namely tangible items.

Hence, even if a cyber-attack was designed to harm a particular military system, reliant on satellite navigation infrastructure, a spill-over effect disrupting a vast number of other systems and networks dependent on the same infrastructure is likely to occur. In the same vein, it is almost impossible to delimit the impact of malwares used in cyber-attacks, since they can spread quickly to computers across many geographical regions. For example, in the Stuxnet incident, the worm targeting computers in Iran also infiltrated computers in other states like India and Russia. Still, one positive aspect in introducing IHL in the cyber-context is that certain cyber operations might cause less severe damage to civilians and civilian objects than traditional means of warfare.\n## 2.3. Cyber-attacks and the non-intervention principle\nAnother important principle of international law regulating cyber-attacks and responses thereto is the principle of non-intervention. According to this principle, states are entitled to conduct key domestic government functions (domaine réservé) without foreign interference. And while, it has been observed that, in practice, this non-intervention principles is often honored in the breach, it is nevertheless a key component of the international legal order. Cyber operations have opened new avenues of intervention in the internal affairs of foreign states, including manipulation of elections (e.g., the 2016 intervention in the US Presidential elections), bringing into focus claims about violation of the principle of non-intervention.\nIn sum, the prohibition against the use of force, as well as the principle of non-intervention and the obligation of due diligence, are applicable to hostile cyber operations.

Accordingly, such questions are often raised and sorted out in the life of international law and relations on a case-by-case basis.\n## 2.4. Other relevant regulatory frameworks\n### 2.4.1. Specific branches of international law\nThere are additional international law regimes that are relevant to the regulation of cyber-attacks in specific circumstances. International telecommunication regulations prohibit interference with broadcasts of authorized frequencies of other states, as well as harmful interferences that endanger radio-navigation or radio-communication service or other radio safety services, or seriously degrade, obstruct or repeatedly interrupt such services. Cyber-attacks that disrupt telecommunication infrastructure may violate these international regulations. Still, international telecommunications regulations do not prohibit, as a rule, attacks aimed at military radio.\nCyber-attacks aimed at disruption of air traffic control and flight passenger lists might implicate international aviation law. Cyber operations that target civilian flights also run contrary to this international regime. In the same vein, cyber-attacks directed against submarine cables implicate the international law of the sea, which requires states to punish those who damage them. Also prohibited are unauthorized broadcasting from the high seas, which may cover certain marine-based cyber-attacks. Given the very specific circumstances in which these provisions apply, they provide minimal protections in the face of cyber-attacks.\n The Tallinn Manual, for example, suggests that force is not mere economic or political coercion. See: TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 151.\n Some suggested that international space law could be used to regulate cyber-attacks. For discussion, see: Hathaway, supra note 2, at 866, 870-872. As noted by Hathaway, these potentially effective tools fail to provide a complete nor a coherent response for cyber-attacks.\n Constitution of the International Telecommunications Union, Dec. 22, 1992, art. 45, available at: https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%201825/volume-1825-I-31251-English.pdf.\n Ibid, art. 48.

At the UN level, several General Assembly resolutions dealt with developments in cyberspace, and the General Assembly initiated, since 2004, six Groups of Governmental Experts (GGE) sessions aimed at identifying international law principles applicable in cyberspace. The most recent round of GGE meetings began on 2019 and included the permanent members of the Security Council and government experts from other countries, selected based on the principle of equitable geographical representation. The recent report of the Group highlighted the need to respect in cyberspace the following UN Charter principles: 1) sovereign equality; 2) the settlement of disputes by peaceful means; 3) the prohibition against the use of force; and 4) non-intervention. The General Assembly also established in 2018 an Open-ended Working Group, open to all UN members, to consider ways to advance international cooperation in light of new developments in cyberspace.\nAt the regional level, one may note the role of the Council of Europe in advancing standards relating to the regulation of cyberspace. Key among them is the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, which is open to countries from other regions as well, and is the most prominent international instrument dealing with cybercrime. Cyber-attacks undertaken by non-state actors would be covered by the prohibitions and law-enforcement provisions of the Budapest Convention, which bans all forms of illegal access to computer data and systems, or data\n See, for example: G.A.

Still, the Convention does not apply to acts undertaken by law enforcement agencies or to other governmental acts undertaken in the name of national security.\nThe Shanghai Cooperation Organization has also been active in this field and has adopted a broad definition of cyber-attacks or “information war” tools, which includes cyber operations that seek to destabilize society and affect the political affairs of a foreign State. This approach is at odds with the approach taken by Western states, since the latter generally oppose restrictions on cyber-activity which limit freedoms.\nThe EU is another significant regional framework addressing cyber-attacks. It has developed in 2017 a Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox, which prescribes a collective response to cyber-attacks, and in 2019 it developed a blacklist of individuals and non-state entities involved in cyber-attacks. The Organization of American States (“OAS”) has also advanced the field of cyber-security, with its focus being on providing expertise in support of efforts by its member States to draft domestic cyber security regulations.\nAn important regional development came with the establishment of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (“NATO”) Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (“CCDCOE”), in the aftermath of the cyber-attacks against Estonia during 2007. The CCDCOE seeks to develop international cyber doctrine and strategy, and its flagship research initiative has been the Tallinn Manual which purports to interpret the main rules of international law of relevance to the regulation of cyberspace.

The attribution challenge\nWhen confronted with a cyber-attack, States can choose to respond through cyber tools, such as hack-backs, resort to kinetic military force or engage in diplomacy. A preliminary issue, regardless of the type of response selected is attribution. This is since establishing the identity of the attacker is crucial to direct a response against it.\nFor example, a victim state to a violation of international law which does not amount to an armed attack, is permitted to take non-forceful proportionate countermeasures against the violating state provided it can legally attribute the original attack to it or show it violated its DD obligations. Lawful countermeasures are measures that would normally be considered themselves as a violation of international law, but their wrongfulness is precluded when they come in response to a prior unlawful act (provided that they are notified as such and are proportionate to the violation). They are an important self-help tool for states, in a decentralized international legal system. Still, as indicated above, states might prefer not to disclose evidence – even if doing so is critical for attribution. So, although advancements have been made in regard to the technical ability to attribute cyber-attacks, political will to publicly make legal attribution is often lacking.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3961263\n\nThere are some noteworthy challenges when applying the ARSIWA framework to cyber-attacks. Part of the attribution problem derives from the structural design of the Internet, and the processes through which data is transmitted between networks, which offers excellent conditions for maintaining anonymity. Attackers can, for example, delay being discovered by using ‘logic bombs’, and perform attacks via intermediaries in other jurisdictions. They can also harness zombie computers, use proxy servers or resort to ‘spoofing’ tools (incorporating a misleading return address by the sender). When a cyber-attacker employs techniques, such as ‘proxy’ or ‘Stepping Stones’, the available forensic evidence might not be enough to allow technical attribution. The difficulty in obtaining forensic evidence from computer systems under the control of other states is another factor. Hence, only states with access to sophisticated forensic investigative capacities and strong intelligence services are well-positioned to succeed in undertaking technical attribution. Still, the context of the attack might sometimes be strongly suggestive of the identity of the perpetrator.

It can be noted that ICJ practice on standards of proof in cases before it tends to be inconsistent, ranging from ‘too improbable’ or ‘consistent with the probabilities’, through proof ‘to the Court’s satisfaction’, to ‘sufficient certainty’, ‘evidence that is fully conclusive’ or ‘beyond any reasonable doubt’. The general trend appears to be that a claim of exceptional gravity against a state needs to be proved by fully conclusive evidence, with the same approach emerging from the Tallinn 2.0 Manual which links the standard of proof to the severity of the breach. Schmitt suggests that an injured state is required to present clear and compelling evidence, while others called for the lowering of the standard of proof.\n## 4. The way forward\nThe evolving nature of cyberspace and technology invites constant assessment of the applicable regulatory frameworks, including regulation of cyber-attacks. The threat of cyber-\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3961263\n\nInternational law currently provides a relatively weak regulatory framework and there is a need for clearer rules that prohibit and respond to cyber-attacks, including rules that delineate what cyber-attacks constitutes an unlawful armed attack, and legal procedures that facilitate the proving and attributing of cyber-attacks. Greater reliance on international law offers states the possibility of dealing with cyber threats through public diplomacy and multilateral sanctions – policy options that go over and beyond self-reliance on passive and active cyber defense. The ability to rely on an effective international law framework might encourage states to accept reciprocal restraints in cross-border cyber operations and to exercise more intensive control over non-state actors active in this field.\nAlas, it will not be an easy task to promote an international agreement specifying the application of international law rules to cyber operations. For example, Russia proposed in the past an international treaty that will ban secretly embedding malicious codes for future use in case of a need, but the US opposed it. Other significant challenges relate to disagreement about the structure of the Internet (i.e., and the extent of ‘digital sovereignty’ over parts thereof) and attribution. An international instrument regulating cyber-attacks could promote greater harmonization of practices and better cooperation, including information sharing, and criminal prosecution. Such an instrument can also incentivize tech-savvy states to advise and assist less-developed ones, and promote the creation of an independent international attribution mechanism which would minimize factual disagreements and de-escalate international conflict. Despite the many challenges ahead, the project of strengthening international regulation of cyber-attacks should not be discarded.\n For discussion, see: O’Connell, supra note 36, at 205-206.\n Hathaway, supra note 2, at 878-880.

Introduction\nCyberspace constitute an unstable environment, featuring rapid changes in the nature of the actors using it, the technologies applied and the inter-personal, governmental and commercial interactions facilitated thereby. The nature of the threats posed by those who abuse cyberspace is also highly dynamic in nature. At the same time, the growing reliance of individuals, markets and society at large on digital devices (including on the Internet of things), and on networks which connect them to one another, generates high susceptibility in the face of malicious cyber-operations (also referred to as cyber-attacks). The global COVID-19 pandemic exponentially accelerated the trend of digitalization in various fields of life, increasing even more the dependency on cyber-infrastructure and with it the potential for harmful cyber-attacks.\nTraditionally, states have been cautious in invoking international law in the context of cyber-attacks, and they tended to refrain from denouncing attacks against them as violations of international law, or attributing it to other states. Such reluctance appears to derive primarily from political and operational considerations: enhancing the regulatory role of international law in cyberspace might impede espionage activities resorted to by all states, and limit the retaliation options of victim states. Another reason for the reluctance might be the lack of a credible international attribution mechanism for hostile cyber operations. Instead, states targeted by cyber-attacks resort at times to private companies providing technical attribution aimed at identifying the computer system from which the attack had originated, followed by\n Kenneth Geers, *The Cyber Threat to National Critical Infrastructures: Beyond Theory*, 18 INFORMATION SECURITY JOURNAL: A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE 1, 3 (2009).\n Oona Hathaway et al., *The Law of Cyber-Attack*, 100 CAL.

While there are of disagreements as to the way that international law applies in the cyberspace, a common understanding had emerged about some key international law norms that apply in this field. States like Australia, France, Germany, Israel, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands have recently articulated their legal positions on how international law applies in cyberspace. In the same vein, states who fell victim to cyber-attacks are increasingly attributing them, as an international law matter, to other states, or non-state actors. Arguably, the increased role played by international law in cyberspace constitutes a reaction to the fact that cyber-attacks become more and more frequent, and dangerous, capable of shutting down critical infrastructure, including nuclear centrifuges and water pumping facilities.\n Israel asserts that attribution remains a mostly technical matter that should not be overregulated, and that the choice of disclosing information supporting attribution claims remains at the exclusive discretion of the state.

Part IV concludes and suggests a way forward.\n1. A Short History of Cyber-attacks\nIt is hard to exaggerate the crucial role cyberspace plays in almost all aspects of everyday life. AI systems relying on online databases and computer networks facilitate the management of huge amounts of governmental services, economic transactions, health data and more. The recent COVID-19 pandemic accelerated digitalization of fields like workplace meetings, distant teaching and online shopping.\nAgainst this background, it is no surprise that cyber-attacks can and do cause significant and widespread damage. Notable attacks from recent years were directed against nuclear infrastructure and other basic utilities, hospitals, commercial entities, Internet services and more. The possible consequences of such cyber-attacks do not fall short from risks caused by kinetic military or terror attacks. What’s more, cyber-attacks can cause a significant damage in a matter of seconds from launch to impact.

The Tallinn Manual, which presents a comprehensive effort by an international group of experts to adapt international law to cyberspace, defines cyber-attack as an offensive or defensive cyber operation that is reasonably expected to bring about to injury or death to individuals, or to destruction of objects.\nThe challenge such attacks pose for policy makers stems not only from the transition of critical infrastructure systems from dedicated internal networks to the open Internet and the ensuing growing reliance of information societies on inter-connected platforms for important public functions, but also from the fact that private corporations have an increasingly important role in the management of critical infrastructures. This makes the rise in number, frequency and severity of cyber-attacks in recent years a serious problem for the national security interests of states, as well as a serious threat for the business interests of the private sector. The relations between private and governmental bodies in cyberspace also complicate the ability to rely on international law as a regulatory framework.\nSignificantly, the mix between public and private entities also exists on the attacking side. The relative low costs of conducting cyber-attacks and the ability to maintain a high\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3961263\n\ndegree of anonymity while engaging in such attacks, renders resort to such attacks an available and attractive option in the eyes of criminals, hacktivists and political extremists. As will be elaborated in the part below dealing with attribution, tracing attacks back to their source is not an easy task even for states with advanced cyber capabilities. In fact, the low entry barrier for developing cyber-attack capabilities allows militarily weaker parties to international conflicts, including non-state actors, to ‘bridge the gap’ and take on powerful states (who may, paradoxically, be more vulnerable to cyber-attacks because of their greater reliance on online services and platforms). Moreover, at times, states use non-state actors to perform cyber operations at their behest, with a view to hiding their own involvement.\nCyber-attacks can take a variety of forms, entailing different types of harms and inviting different preventive measures and regulatory responses. A highly common form of a cyberattack is a Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) operation, during which botnets devastate computer servers through large scale repeat visits to designated websites. DDOS attacks come in many forms, including network flooding, data modification, electromagnetic interference and more. Famous DDOS attacks are the attacks conducted during April 2007 on the densely wired Estonia, as well as attacks in Georgia during 2008, ahead of the Russian invasion to South Ossetia. Nashi – a youth-movement supporting Russian President Putin – accepted responsibility for the attacks, which appear to have been motivated by political reasons related to tensions in Estonian-Russian relations. Many believe that the attacks can be traced back to Russia, despite Russia’s denial of any involvement. Similarly, Georgia claimed that Russia initiated DDoS attacks against a number of its governmental, commercial and media\n Ido Kilovaty, *Cyber Warfare and the Jus Ad Bellum Challenges: Evaluation in the Light of the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare*, 1(5) AMERICAN UNIVERSITY NATIONAL SECURITY LAW BRIEF VOLUME 91, 95 (2014); Geers, supra note 1, at 3.\n For discussion, see: FRED KAPLAN, DARK TERRITORY: THE SECRET HISTORY OF CYBER WAR (2016).\n JOSEPH NYE, THE FUTURE OF POWER 124 (2011); Christian Payne &amp; Lorraine Finlay, *Addressing Obstacles to Cyber-Attribution: A Model Based on State Response to Cyber-Attack*, 49 GEO.

More recently, hospitals around the globe faced DDOS attacks during the Covid-19 pandemic; the motives underlying such attacks are less than clear. $^{52}$\nA more sophisticated form of cyber-attack is a syntactic attack that involves malware that manipulates and damages the operation of computer systems.53 A prime example is Stuxnet,54 which was described as a joint US and Israeli effort.55 Stuxnet was a malware that infiltrated Iranian nuclear facilities in or before 2010 in order to destroy centrifuges used for uranium enrichment.56 It disrupted the systems at the nuclear facilities,57 and destroyed centrifuges while sending false signals that disabled safety systems in place.58 Stuxnet was the first syntactic attack directed against security infrastructure.59 Unlike previous cyber-attacks, such as the one in Estonia, Stuxnet caused significant damage to physical objects.60\nBeyond that, there are other cyber-operations that may qualify as cyber-attacks. $^{61}$ These include data theft and doxing, $^{62}$ ransomware attacks, $^{63}$ network attacks, $^{64}$ spoofing $^{65}$ and\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3961263\n\nOver the years, states have developed mechanisms to prevent and respond to cyber-attacks. These include defensive-passive tools like firewalls, but also offensive-active tools, comprising active defense measures, which attempt to disable the source of an attack. The legality of such active defense measures is questionable, however, under the norms of international law applicable to cyberspace articulated in the Tallinn Manual, which do not themselves enjoy full political and legal consensus.\nAs mentioned above, states have been traditionally hesitant to invoke international law in the context of cyber-attacks. Even victim states have often refrained from acknowledging they were attacked; and when acknowledging it, they were slow in invoking international law norms or attempting to attribute the attack to another state. This reluctance might be driven by concerns about the reputation for safety of their digital environment, or a wish to deflect domestic pressures to react. Also, when responding to attacks, states appear to prefer the pragmatic pursuit of political and national security interests over making public legal claims which would bind them to a particular interpretation of international law and might require the disclosure of confidential information. Instead, tech-savvy states feel well positioned to rely on their own capabilities, alongside those of their partners, to defend themselves from cyber-attacks. Another possible reason for the hesitancy of states is that there is no credible international attribution mechanism that can support legal claims concerning cyber-attacks. A number of proposals for the establishment of an international attribution mechanism have\n See, for example: MARTIN C.

A growing number of states outlined their legal views as to the way in which international law governs cyberspace. $^{82}$ Examples include statements by Australia, $^{83}$ Finland, $^{84}$ France, $^{85}$ Germany, $^{86}$ Israel, $^{87}$ the United Kingdom, $^{88}$ the Netherlands $^{89}$ and New Zealand. $^{90}$ This change may be attributed in part to the rise in cyber-attacks around the world during the Covid-19 crisis. The health-care sector has proved itself particularly vulnerable to cyber-attacks and hospitals, other health-care facilities and research institutions involved in developing vaccines were targeted by hostile cyber operations. $^{91}$ In addition, cyber-attackers directed their attention towards international organizations involved in responding to the crisis, $^{92}$ most notably the World Health\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3961263\nOrganization, complicating international efforts to cope with the pandemic. Another problem that arose during the crisis was the spread on-line of disinformation campaigns.\nIn sum, cyber-attacks pose a growing threat for states and their critical infrastructure. As a result, there is greater urgency in regulating threat and harm-generating cyber-operations and the responses of the victim state. We will now refer to some international legal instruments which are provide the framework for regulation of cyber-attacks and state responses to them.\n## 2. The International Law Framework governing Cyber-attacks\nCyberspace has been characterized by some as a domain devoid of normative limitations. This is because Internet and other cyber-infrastructures allegedly operate as a global network that is beyond the sovereign control of any specific state and there is no international cooperation agreement underlying its existence or manner of operation (unlike other international infrastructure such as telephone systems). While, in the future, a new branch of law specifically aimed at regulating the conduct of all relevant stakeholders in cyberspace (lex cybernetica) might emerge, legal experts and state officials – especially, officials coming from victim states that have much more to lose from cyber-attacks than their attackers – have attempted to fill the normative void by adjusting existing rules of international law to the challenges posed by cyber-attacks.\nWe will now present shortly some international law norms which might be of relevance to regulating cyber-attacks, and discuss in this connection international instruments, such as the United Nations (UN) Charter, and the International Law Commission Articles on State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts (\"ARSIWA\").\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3961263\n\nAs a starting point, a state should not allow its territory to be used to violate the rights of other states – including via hostile cyber operations. This international law obligation of due-diligence (DD) requires a state to take reasonable measures to safeguard its territory from being to misused to commit violations of international law. If such violations nonetheless occur, then the state should investigate them properly, and provide a remedy to the victims. Based on the DD principle, states should prevent non-state actors, or other states, from conducting cyber-attacks from within their territory. A failure to meet DD obligations might give rise to a violation of international law, even if the harm was done in practice by private persons or entities. DD is an obligation of conduct, not one of result, in the sense that it demands from the state to employ all means reasonably available to it. It sets a standard of conduct that depends on state capacity and its actual ability to operate. This standard was recognized by states such as Finland, France, and Germany, as applicable to cyber-attacks.\n## 2.2. Use of force and non-intervention\nTo the extent that cyber operations constitute an integral part of the reality of armed conflicts, there is little question that the laws that apply to armed conflicts also apply to aggressive and defensive cyber operations. However, cyber operations also occur during situations of political tension and conflict which do not involve the use of kinetic weapons.\n Corfu Channel (U.K. v.

Note that cyber-attacks can have a deadly result, even when conducted outside armed conflicts – e.g., when a malware interferes with the functioning of hospitals.\nThere are three main approaches to appraise if and when a cyber-attack constitutes an armed attack: the instrument-based approach, the target-based approach, and the effects-based approach. As will be elaborated below, the effects-based approach seems to be the most suitable one for regulating cyber-attacks. In this part, we will introduce the regime regulating the use of force in international law (jus ad bellum), and consider the three main approaches for applying it to cyber-attacks.\n## 2.2.1. Prohibition on the use of force and non-intervention – general\nThe prohibition against the use of force in international law, which is a *jus cogens* (peremptory) norm, is enshrined in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. There are two exceptions to the prohibition which are stipulated in the Charter: (1) Authorization by the Security Council (SC) under the collective security system; (2) Individual self-defense or collective self-defense against an armed attack. There is some debate regarding the existence of additional exceptions.\nCyberattack on Iranian Port Facility, WASHINGTON POST, 18 May 2020, available at: https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/officials-israel-linked-to-a-disruptive-cyberattack-on-iranian-port-facility/2020/05/18/9d1da866-9942-11ea-89fd-28fb313d1886_story.html.\n United Nations Charter, 24 October 1945, 1 UNTS XVI.

On the one hand, the SC has recognized the right of self-defense in the context of terror attacks conducted by non-state actors. By contrast, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has presented a state-centered perspective, according to which an attack by a non-state entity would only qualify as an armed attack, if it is possible to attribute the act to a sovereign state. As a result, some claim that there is no right to use force against non-state entities found in the territory of another state unless attribution to a state exists, while others believe that victim states to an attack by non-state entities may respond with the use of military force directed against them.\nCyber-attacks can also originate from the territory of a state that is unwilling or unable to suppress such activities. It is relevant to note in this regard the discussion in international law surrounding the doctrine of “unwilling or unable”, which justifies the use of force against a non-state entity, when the entity operates from the territory of a state that is “unwilling or unable” to take DD measures to deal with it. While most international law scholars reject the doctrine, the doctrine cannot be discarded altogether since it was used by the US in its “war\n Michael P.

Cyber-attacks and the prohibition on the use of force\nThe applicability to cyberspace of the prohibition against the use of force, as well as the self-defense exception, are reaffirmed in rules 10 and 13 of the Tallinn Manual, and is supported by a recent UN Group of Governmental Experts report. Yet, there are three main approaches, in the academic literature, to the application of the right to self-defense against an armed attack in the context of cyber-attacks: 1) the instrument-based approach; 2) the target-based approach; and 3) the effects-based approach.\nThe instrument-based approach categorizes an act as an armed attack giving rise to the right to self-defense only if the harm it causes has characteristics traditionally associated with the harm caused by military force. While this approach promotes predictability, it is perceived as outmoded. The second approach, the target-based approach, classifies a cyberattack against critical infrastructure as an armed attack, regardless of its consequences. It\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3961263\nignores the actual effects of the attack and places all emphasis on the nature of the target. Critical infrastructure includes computer systems central to the operation of the banking, health, transportation and management of natural resources sectors. Whereas the instrument-based approach has been criticized for placing too high the bar for armed attacks, target-based approach has been criticized for placing the bar too low, facilitating thereby unnecessary escalation of international conflicts.\nThe third approach, the effects-based approach, constitutes the middle road between the other two approaches and is, perhaps not surprisingly, the dominant of the three. Under this approach, a cyber-attack can constitute an armed attack which may be responded to by force based on several criteria, elaborated by Schmitt: the degree of physical destruction; temporal proximity between the attack and its consequences; the existence of a direct link between the damage and the attack; the level of invasiveness of the attack; and measurability of the harm. The Tallinn Manual also suggests looking into the military character of the attack. Put simply, the effect-based approach requires physical damage to people or property.\nA similar normative debate also exists with respect to the definition of a prohibited use of force, which nonetheless does not reach the level of gravity associated with an “armed attack” and which does not give rise to the right to self-defense. A low threshold for considering what amounts to a use of force provides states with greater discretion in responding to malicious online activity. Conversely, the concern with lowering the bar is that of military escalation. Significantly, some states have taken a broad view on what constitutes a use of force which justifies the imposition of counter-measures (i.e., sanctions) falling short of use of force in self-defense. For example, France considers that a cyber operation without physical effects can be perceived as prohibited use of force, and the Netherlands has taken the position\n Sheng Li, *When Does Internet Denial Trigger the Right of Armed Self-Defense?*, 38 YALE J.

The counter-force used may be kinetic or cybernetic.\n## 2.2.3 Cyber-attacks and the laws of armed conflict\nOnce an armed conflict has erupted, or if cyber-attacks have occurred in the context of an already active armed conflict, then another set of rules kicks in - International Humanitarian Law (IHL), adding an additional layer of legal regulation. Some protections under IHL are particularly relevant to cyber-attacks. For example, IHL prohibits attacks that are not directed\n Letter from the Netherlands, supra note 14.\n Estonia, President of the Republic at the Opening of CyCon 2019, 29 May 2019, available at: https://www.president.ee/en/official-duties/speeches/15241-president-of-the-republic-at-the-opening-of-cycon-2019/index.html; Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Australia’s International Cyber Engagement Strategy, 2019, available at: https://www.internationalcybertech.gov.au/sites/default/files/2020-11/The%20Strategy.pdf; Finland’s positions, supra note 84.\n New Zealand, supra note 90.\n On the Application of International Law in Cyberspace, supra note 11.\n US Department of Defense (DoD), Law of War Manual, 2015, available at: https://dod.defense.gov/Portals/1/Documents/pubs/DoD%20Law%20of%20War%20Manual%20-%20June%202015%20Updated%20Dec%202016.pdf?ver=2016-12-13-172036-190.\n For discussion of the US position, see: Matthew C.

For general discussion concerning International Humanitarian Law, see: INGRID DETTER, THE LAW OF WAR (2013).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3961263\nagainst military targets, based on the principles of military necessity and distinction, as well as those expected to cause harm to civilians and civilian objects that exceeds their military utility (principle of proportionality). Cyber-attacks directed at critical computer system infrastructure supporting objects indispensable for the survival of the civilian population, such as food or water supplies, would appear to violate all the aforementioned principles. The Tallinn Manual suggests, however, that the Internet as such cannot be considered as an object indispensable to the survival of the civilian population.\nWhereas a few states, like Iran, express deep reservations concerning the application of IHL to cyberspace, the majority of states to do not contest its application, but still disagree on specific questions relating to its exact manner of application. One notable disagreement revolves around the question of whether data can be regarded a “protected object” due to its predominantly civilian nature. The position of Tallinn Manual, which is supported by some states, is that only tangible things can constitute objects, but other states, like France, maintain that civilian data can constitute a protected object.\nThe cyber context presents a difficult challenge for distinguishing between military and civilians objects given the dual-use of cyberspace and the integrated nature of its infrastructures. For example, civilian transportation vehicles and traffic controls are\n Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I), June 8, 1977, 1125 U.N.T.S. 3, article 48 &amp; 54; JEAN-MARIE HENCKAERTS &amp; LOUISE DOSWALD-BECK, CUSTOMARY INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW, rules 7 &amp; 54 (2006).\n Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I), June 8, 1977, 1125 U.N.T.S. 3, article 51; AMICHAI COHEN, PROPORTIONALITY IN MODERN ASYMMETRICAL ARMED WARS (2010).\n Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I), June 8, 1977, 1125 U.N.T.S. 3, article 48 &amp; 54; HENCKAERTS &amp; LOUISE DOSWALD-BECK, supra note 164, rules 7 &amp; 54 (2006).\n TALLINN MANUAL 2.0, supra note 34, commentary on Rule 141.\n Islamic Republic of Iran, The Initial “Pre-draft” of the report of the OEWG on developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security Preliminary reflection (April 2020), p. 2, available at: https://front.un-arm.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/iran-preliminary-on-oewg-pre-draft-15-april-2020-1.pdf (“applying the international humanitarian law, which is exclusively for armed conflicts, into ICT environment… need to be avoided”).\n Some consider the notion of “object” to be limited to items with physical characteristics, namely tangible items. See: TALLINN MANUAL 2.0, supra note 34, at 373.

Hence, even if a cyber-attack was designed to harm a particular military system, reliant on satellite navigation infrastructure, a spill-over effect disrupting a vast number of other systems and networks dependent on the same infrastructure is likely to occur. In the same vein, it is almost impossible to delimit the impact of malwares used in cyber-attacks, since they can spread quickly to computers across many geographical regions. For example, in the Stuxnet incident, the worm targeting computers in Iran also infiltrated computers in other states like India and Russia. Still, one positive aspect in introducing IHL in the cyber-context is that certain cyber operations might cause less severe damage to civilians and civilian objects than traditional means of warfare.\n## 2.3. Cyber-attacks and the non-intervention principle\nAnother important principle of international law regulating cyber-attacks and responses thereto is the principle of non-intervention. According to this principle, states are entitled to conduct key domestic government functions (domaine réservé) without foreign interference. And while, it has been observed that, in practice, this non-intervention principles is often honored in the breach, it is nevertheless a key component of the international legal order. Cyber operations have opened new avenues of intervention in the internal affairs of foreign states, including manipulation of elections (e.g., the 2016 intervention in the US Presidential elections), bringing into focus claims about violation of the principle of non-intervention.\nIn sum, the prohibition against the use of force, as well as the principle of non-intervention and the obligation of due diligence, are applicable to hostile cyber operations.

Accordingly, such questions are often raised and sorted out in the life of international law and relations on a case-by-case basis.\n## 2.4. Other relevant regulatory frameworks\n### 2.4.1. Specific branches of international law\nThere are additional international law regimes that are relevant to the regulation of cyber-attacks in specific circumstances. International telecommunication regulations prohibit interference with broadcasts of authorized frequencies of other states, as well as harmful interferences that endanger radio-navigation or radio-communication service or other radio safety services, or seriously degrade, obstruct or repeatedly interrupt such services. Cyber-attacks that disrupt telecommunication infrastructure may violate these international regulations. Still, international telecommunications regulations do not prohibit, as a rule, attacks aimed at military radio.\nCyber-attacks aimed at disruption of air traffic control and flight passenger lists might implicate international aviation law. Cyber operations that target civilian flights also run contrary to this international regime. In the same vein, cyber-attacks directed against submarine cables implicate the international law of the sea, which requires states to punish those who damage them. Also prohibited are unauthorized broadcasting from the high seas, which may cover certain marine-based cyber-attacks. Given the very specific circumstances in which these provisions apply, they provide minimal protections in the face of cyber-attacks.\n The Tallinn Manual, for example, suggests that force is not mere economic or political coercion. See: TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 151.\n Some suggested that international space law could be used to regulate cyber-attacks. For discussion, see: Hathaway, supra note 2, at 866, 870-872. As noted by Hathaway, these potentially effective tools fail to provide a complete nor a coherent response for cyber-attacks.\n Constitution of the International Telecommunications Union, Dec. 22, 1992, art. 45, available at: https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%201825/volume-1825-I-31251-English.pdf.\n Ibid, art. 48.

At the UN level, several General Assembly resolutions dealt with developments in cyberspace, and the General Assembly initiated, since 2004, six Groups of Governmental Experts (GGE) sessions aimed at identifying international law principles applicable in cyberspace. The most recent round of GGE meetings began on 2019 and included the permanent members of the Security Council and government experts from other countries, selected based on the principle of equitable geographical representation. The recent report of the Group highlighted the need to respect in cyberspace the following UN Charter principles: 1) sovereign equality; 2) the settlement of disputes by peaceful means; 3) the prohibition against the use of force; and 4) non-intervention. The General Assembly also established in 2018 an Open-ended Working Group, open to all UN members, to consider ways to advance international cooperation in light of new developments in cyberspace.\nAt the regional level, one may note the role of the Council of Europe in advancing standards relating to the regulation of cyberspace. Key among them is the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, which is open to countries from other regions as well, and is the most prominent international instrument dealing with cybercrime. Cyber-attacks undertaken by non-state actors would be covered by the prohibitions and law-enforcement provisions of the Budapest Convention, which bans all forms of illegal access to computer data and systems, or data\n See, for example: G.A.

Still, the Convention does not apply to acts undertaken by law enforcement agencies or to other governmental acts undertaken in the name of national security.\nThe Shanghai Cooperation Organization has also been active in this field and has adopted a broad definition of cyber-attacks or “information war” tools, which includes cyber operations that seek to destabilize society and affect the political affairs of a foreign State. This approach is at odds with the approach taken by Western states, since the latter generally oppose restrictions on cyber-activity which limit freedoms.\nThe EU is another significant regional framework addressing cyber-attacks. It has developed in 2017 a Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox, which prescribes a collective response to cyber-attacks, and in 2019 it developed a blacklist of individuals and non-state entities involved in cyber-attacks. The Organization of American States (“OAS”) has also advanced the field of cyber-security, with its focus being on providing expertise in support of efforts by its member States to draft domestic cyber security regulations.\nAn important regional development came with the establishment of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (“NATO”) Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (“CCDCOE”), in the aftermath of the cyber-attacks against Estonia during 2007. The CCDCOE seeks to develop international cyber doctrine and strategy, and its flagship research initiative has been the Tallinn Manual which purports to interpret the main rules of international law of relevance to the regulation of cyberspace.

The attribution challenge\nWhen confronted with a cyber-attack, States can choose to respond through cyber tools, such as hack-backs, resort to kinetic military force or engage in diplomacy. A preliminary issue, regardless of the type of response selected is attribution. This is since establishing the identity of the attacker is crucial to direct a response against it.\nFor example, a victim state to a violation of international law which does not amount to an armed attack, is permitted to take non-forceful proportionate countermeasures against the violating state provided it can legally attribute the original attack to it or show it violated its DD obligations. Lawful countermeasures are measures that would normally be considered themselves as a violation of international law, but their wrongfulness is precluded when they come in response to a prior unlawful act (provided that they are notified as such and are proportionate to the violation). They are an important self-help tool for states, in a decentralized international legal system. Still, as indicated above, states might prefer not to disclose evidence – even if doing so is critical for attribution. So, although advancements have been made in regard to the technical ability to attribute cyber-attacks, political will to publicly make legal attribution is often lacking.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3961263\n\nThere are some noteworthy challenges when applying the ARSIWA framework to cyber-attacks. Part of the attribution problem derives from the structural design of the Internet, and the processes through which data is transmitted between networks, which offers excellent conditions for maintaining anonymity. Attackers can, for example, delay being discovered by using ‘logic bombs’, and perform attacks via intermediaries in other jurisdictions. They can also harness zombie computers, use proxy servers or resort to ‘spoofing’ tools (incorporating a misleading return address by the sender). When a cyber-attacker employs techniques, such as ‘proxy’ or ‘Stepping Stones’, the available forensic evidence might not be enough to allow technical attribution. The difficulty in obtaining forensic evidence from computer systems under the control of other states is another factor. Hence, only states with access to sophisticated forensic investigative capacities and strong intelligence services are well-positioned to succeed in undertaking technical attribution. Still, the context of the attack might sometimes be strongly suggestive of the identity of the perpetrator.

It can be noted that ICJ practice on standards of proof in cases before it tends to be inconsistent, ranging from ‘too improbable’ or ‘consistent with the probabilities’, through proof ‘to the Court’s satisfaction’, to ‘sufficient certainty’, ‘evidence that is fully conclusive’ or ‘beyond any reasonable doubt’. The general trend appears to be that a claim of exceptional gravity against a state needs to be proved by fully conclusive evidence, with the same approach emerging from the Tallinn 2.0 Manual which links the standard of proof to the severity of the breach. Schmitt suggests that an injured state is required to present clear and compelling evidence, while others called for the lowering of the standard of proof.\n## 4. The way forward\nThe evolving nature of cyberspace and technology invites constant assessment of the applicable regulatory frameworks, including regulation of cyber-attacks. The threat of cyber-\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3961263\n\nInternational law currently provides a relatively weak regulatory framework and there is a need for clearer rules that prohibit and respond to cyber-attacks, including rules that delineate what cyber-attacks constitutes an unlawful armed attack, and legal procedures that facilitate the proving and attributing of cyber-attacks. Greater reliance on international law offers states the possibility of dealing with cyber threats through public diplomacy and multilateral sanctions – policy options that go over and beyond self-reliance on passive and active cyber defense. The ability to rely on an effective international law framework might encourage states to accept reciprocal restraints in cross-border cyber operations and to exercise more intensive control over non-state actors active in this field.\nAlas, it will not be an easy task to promote an international agreement specifying the application of international law rules to cyber operations. For example, Russia proposed in the past an international treaty that will ban secretly embedding malicious codes for future use in case of a need, but the US opposed it. Other significant challenges relate to disagreement about the structure of the Internet (i.e., and the extent of ‘digital sovereignty’ over parts thereof) and attribution. An international instrument regulating cyber-attacks could promote greater harmonization of practices and better cooperation, including information sharing, and criminal prosecution. Such an instrument can also incentivize tech-savvy states to advise and assist less-developed ones, and promote the creation of an independent international attribution mechanism which would minimize factual disagreements and de-escalate international conflict. Despite the many challenges ahead, the project of strengthening international regulation of cyber-attacks should not be discarded.\n For discussion, see: O’Connell, supra note 36, at 205-206.\n Hathaway, supra note 2, at 878-880.

Introduction\nCyberspace constitute an unstable environment, featuring rapid changes in the nature of the actors using it, the technologies applied and the inter-personal, governmental and commercial interactions facilitated thereby. The nature of the threats posed by those who abuse cyberspace is also highly dynamic in nature. At the same time, the growing reliance of individuals, markets and society at large on digital devices (including on the Internet of things), and on networks which connect them to one another, generates high susceptibility in the face of malicious cyber-operations (also referred to as cyber-attacks). The global COVID-19 pandemic exponentially accelerated the trend of digitalization in various fields of life, increasing even more the dependency on cyber-infrastructure and with it the potential for harmful cyber-attacks.\nTraditionally, states have been cautious in invoking international law in the context of cyber-attacks, and they tended to refrain from denouncing attacks against them as violations of international law, or attributing it to other states. Such reluctance appears to derive primarily from political and operational considerations: enhancing the regulatory role of international law in cyberspace might impede espionage activities resorted to by all states, and limit the retaliation options of victim states. Another reason for the reluctance might be the lack of a credible international attribution mechanism for hostile cyber operations. Instead, states targeted by cyber-attacks resort at times to private companies providing technical attribution aimed at identifying the computer system from which the attack had originated, followed by\n Kenneth Geers, *The Cyber Threat to National Critical Infrastructures: Beyond Theory*, 18 INFORMATION SECURITY JOURNAL: A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE 1, 3 (2009).\n Oona Hathaway et al., *The Law of Cyber-Attack*, 100 CAL.

STUD. 196, 199 (2020).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3961263\n\nThis state of affairs appears to be changing, however. While there are of disagreements as to the way that international law applies in the cyberspace, a common understanding had emerged about some key international law norms that apply in this field. States like Australia, France, Germany, Israel, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands have recently articulated their legal positions on how international law applies in cyberspace. In the same vein, states who fell victim to cyber-attacks are increasingly attributing them, as an international law matter, to other states, or non-state actors. Arguably, the increased role played by international law in cyberspace constitutes a reaction to the fact that cyber-attacks become more and more frequent, and dangerous, capable of shutting down critical infrastructure, including nuclear centrifuges and water pumping facilities.\n Israel asserts that attribution remains a mostly technical matter that should not be overregulated, and that the choice of disclosing information supporting attribution claims remains at the exclusive discretion of the state.

Part IV concludes and suggests a way forward.\n1. A Short History of Cyber-attacks\nIt is hard to exaggerate the crucial role cyberspace plays in almost all aspects of everyday life. AI systems relying on online databases and computer networks facilitate the management of huge amounts of governmental services, economic transactions, health data and more. The recent COVID-19 pandemic accelerated digitalization of fields like workplace meetings, distant teaching and online shopping.\nAgainst this background, it is no surprise that cyber-attacks can and do cause significant and widespread damage. Notable attacks from recent years were directed against nuclear infrastructure and other basic utilities, hospitals, commercial entities, Internet services and more. The possible consequences of such cyber-attacks do not fall short from risks caused by kinetic military or terror attacks. What’s more, cyber-attacks can cause a significant damage in a matter of seconds from launch to impact.

The Tallinn Manual, which presents a comprehensive effort by an international group of experts to adapt international law to cyberspace, defines cyber-attack as an offensive or defensive cyber operation that is reasonably expected to bring about to injury or death to individuals, or to destruction of objects.\nThe challenge such attacks pose for policy makers stems not only from the transition of critical infrastructure systems from dedicated internal networks to the open Internet and the ensuing growing reliance of information societies on inter-connected platforms for important public functions, but also from the fact that private corporations have an increasingly important role in the management of critical infrastructures. This makes the rise in number, frequency and severity of cyber-attacks in recent years a serious problem for the national security interests of states, as well as a serious threat for the business interests of the private sector. The relations between private and governmental bodies in cyberspace also complicate the ability to rely on international law as a regulatory framework.\nSignificantly, the mix between public and private entities also exists on the attacking side. The relative low costs of conducting cyber-attacks and the ability to maintain a high\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3961263\n\ndegree of anonymity while engaging in such attacks, renders resort to such attacks an available and attractive option in the eyes of criminals, hacktivists and political extremists. As will be elaborated in the part below dealing with attribution, tracing attacks back to their source is not an easy task even for states with advanced cyber capabilities. In fact, the low entry barrier for developing cyber-attack capabilities allows militarily weaker parties to international conflicts, including non-state actors, to ‘bridge the gap’ and take on powerful states (who may, paradoxically, be more vulnerable to cyber-attacks because of their greater reliance on online services and platforms). Moreover, at times, states use non-state actors to perform cyber operations at their behest, with a view to hiding their own involvement.\nCyber-attacks can take a variety of forms, entailing different types of harms and inviting different preventive measures and regulatory responses. A highly common form of a cyberattack is a Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) operation, during which botnets devastate computer servers through large scale repeat visits to designated websites. DDOS attacks come in many forms, including network flooding, data modification, electromagnetic interference and more. Famous DDOS attacks are the attacks conducted during April 2007 on the densely wired Estonia, as well as attacks in Georgia during 2008, ahead of the Russian invasion to South Ossetia. Nashi – a youth-movement supporting Russian President Putin – accepted responsibility for the attacks, which appear to have been motivated by political reasons related to tensions in Estonian-Russian relations. Many believe that the attacks can be traced back to Russia, despite Russia’s denial of any involvement. Similarly, Georgia claimed that Russia initiated DDoS attacks against a number of its governmental, commercial and media\n Ido Kilovaty, *Cyber Warfare and the Jus Ad Bellum Challenges: Evaluation in the Light of the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare*, 1(5) AMERICAN UNIVERSITY NATIONAL SECURITY LAW BRIEF VOLUME 91, 95 (2014); Geers, supra note 1, at 3.\n For discussion, see: FRED KAPLAN, DARK TERRITORY: THE SECRET HISTORY OF CYBER WAR (2016).\n JOSEPH NYE, THE FUTURE OF POWER 124 (2011); Christian Payne &amp; Lorraine Finlay, *Addressing Obstacles to Cyber-Attribution: A Model Based on State Response to Cyber-Attack*, 49 GEO.

More recently, hospitals around the globe faced DDOS attacks during the Covid-19 pandemic; the motives underlying such attacks are less than clear. $^{52}$\nA more sophisticated form of cyber-attack is a syntactic attack that involves malware that manipulates and damages the operation of computer systems.53 A prime example is Stuxnet,54 which was described as a joint US and Israeli effort.55 Stuxnet was a malware that infiltrated Iranian nuclear facilities in or before 2010 in order to destroy centrifuges used for uranium enrichment.56 It disrupted the systems at the nuclear facilities,57 and destroyed centrifuges while sending false signals that disabled safety systems in place.58 Stuxnet was the first syntactic attack directed against security infrastructure.59 Unlike previous cyber-attacks, such as the one in Estonia, Stuxnet caused significant damage to physical objects.60\nBeyond that, there are other cyber-operations that may qualify as cyber-attacks. $^{61}$ These include data theft and doxing, $^{62}$ ransomware attacks, $^{63}$ network attacks, $^{64}$ spoofing $^{65}$ and\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3961263\n\nOver the years, states have developed mechanisms to prevent and respond to cyber-attacks. These include defensive-passive tools like firewalls, but also offensive-active tools, comprising active defense measures, which attempt to disable the source of an attack. The legality of such active defense measures is questionable, however, under the norms of international law applicable to cyberspace articulated in the Tallinn Manual, which do not themselves enjoy full political and legal consensus.\nAs mentioned above, states have been traditionally hesitant to invoke international law in the context of cyber-attacks. Even victim states have often refrained from acknowledging they were attacked; and when acknowledging it, they were slow in invoking international law norms or attempting to attribute the attack to another state. This reluctance might be driven by concerns about the reputation for safety of their digital environment, or a wish to deflect domestic pressures to react. Also, when responding to attacks, states appear to prefer the pragmatic pursuit of political and national security interests over making public legal claims which would bind them to a particular interpretation of international law and might require the disclosure of confidential information. Instead, tech-savvy states feel well positioned to rely on their own capabilities, alongside those of their partners, to defend themselves from cyber-attacks. Another possible reason for the hesitancy of states is that there is no credible international attribution mechanism that can support legal claims concerning cyber-attacks. A number of proposals for the establishment of an international attribution mechanism have\n See, for example: MARTIN C.

The health-care sector has proved itself particularly vulnerable to cyber-attacks and hospitals, other health-care facilities and research institutions involved in developing vaccines were targeted by hostile cyber operations. $^{91}$ In addition, cyber-attackers directed their attention towards international organizations involved in responding to the crisis, $^{92}$ most notably the World Health\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3961263\nOrganization, complicating international efforts to cope with the pandemic. Another problem that arose during the crisis was the spread on-line of disinformation campaigns.\nIn sum, cyber-attacks pose a growing threat for states and their critical infrastructure. As a result, there is greater urgency in regulating threat and harm-generating cyber-operations and the responses of the victim state. We will now refer to some international legal instruments which are provide the framework for regulation of cyber-attacks and state responses to them.\n## 2. The International Law Framework governing Cyber-attacks\nCyberspace has been characterized by some as a domain devoid of normative limitations. This is because Internet and other cyber-infrastructures allegedly operate as a global network that is beyond the sovereign control of any specific state and there is no international cooperation agreement underlying its existence or manner of operation (unlike other international infrastructure such as telephone systems). While, in the future, a new branch of law specifically aimed at regulating the conduct of all relevant stakeholders in cyberspace (lex cybernetica) might emerge, legal experts and state officials – especially, officials coming from victim states that have much more to lose from cyber-attacks than their attackers – have attempted to fill the normative void by adjusting existing rules of international law to the challenges posed by cyber-attacks.\nWe will now present shortly some international law norms which might be of relevance to regulating cyber-attacks, and discuss in this connection international instruments, such as the United Nations (UN) Charter, and the International Law Commission Articles on State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts (\"ARSIWA\").\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3961263\n\nAs a starting point, a state should not allow its territory to be used to violate the rights of other states – including via hostile cyber operations. This international law obligation of due-diligence (DD) requires a state to take reasonable measures to safeguard its territory from being to misused to commit violations of international law. If such violations nonetheless occur, then the state should investigate them properly, and provide a remedy to the victims. Based on the DD principle, states should prevent non-state actors, or other states, from conducting cyber-attacks from within their territory. A failure to meet DD obligations might give rise to a violation of international law, even if the harm was done in practice by private persons or entities. DD is an obligation of conduct, not one of result, in the sense that it demands from the state to employ all means reasonably available to it. It sets a standard of conduct that depends on state capacity and its actual ability to operate. This standard was recognized by states such as Finland, France, and Germany, as applicable to cyber-attacks.\n## 2.2. Use of force and non-intervention\nTo the extent that cyber operations constitute an integral part of the reality of armed conflicts, there is little question that the laws that apply to armed conflicts also apply to aggressive and defensive cyber operations. However, cyber operations also occur during situations of political tension and conflict which do not involve the use of kinetic weapons.\n Corfu Channel (U.K. v.

Note that cyber-attacks can have a deadly result, even when conducted outside armed conflicts – e.g., when a malware interferes with the functioning of hospitals.\nThere are three main approaches to appraise if and when a cyber-attack constitutes an armed attack: the instrument-based approach, the target-based approach, and the effects-based approach. As will be elaborated below, the effects-based approach seems to be the most suitable one for regulating cyber-attacks. In this part, we will introduce the regime regulating the use of force in international law (jus ad bellum), and consider the three main approaches for applying it to cyber-attacks.\n## 2.2.1. Prohibition on the use of force and non-intervention – general\nThe prohibition against the use of force in international law, which is a *jus cogens* (peremptory) norm, is enshrined in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. There are two exceptions to the prohibition which are stipulated in the Charter: (1) Authorization by the Security Council (SC) under the collective security system; (2) Individual self-defense or collective self-defense against an armed attack. There is some debate regarding the existence of additional exceptions.\nCyberattack on Iranian Port Facility, WASHINGTON POST, 18 May 2020, available at: https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/officials-israel-linked-to-a-disruptive-cyberattack-on-iranian-port-facility/2020/05/18/9d1da866-9942-11ea-89fd-28fb313d1886_story.html.\n United Nations Charter, 24 October 1945, 1 UNTS XVI.

On the one hand, the SC has recognized the right of self-defense in the context of terror attacks conducted by non-state actors. By contrast, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has presented a state-centered perspective, according to which an attack by a non-state entity would only qualify as an armed attack, if it is possible to attribute the act to a sovereign state. As a result, some claim that there is no right to use force against non-state entities found in the territory of another state unless attribution to a state exists, while others believe that victim states to an attack by non-state entities may respond with the use of military force directed against them.\nCyber-attacks can also originate from the territory of a state that is unwilling or unable to suppress such activities. It is relevant to note in this regard the discussion in international law surrounding the doctrine of “unwilling or unable”, which justifies the use of force against a non-state entity, when the entity operates from the territory of a state that is “unwilling or unable” to take DD measures to deal with it. While most international law scholars reject the doctrine, the doctrine cannot be discarded altogether since it was used by the US in its “war\n Michael P.

Cyber-attacks and the prohibition on the use of force\nThe applicability to cyberspace of the prohibition against the use of force, as well as the self-defense exception, are reaffirmed in rules 10 and 13 of the Tallinn Manual, and is supported by a recent UN Group of Governmental Experts report. Yet, there are three main approaches, in the academic literature, to the application of the right to self-defense against an armed attack in the context of cyber-attacks: 1) the instrument-based approach; 2) the target-based approach; and 3) the effects-based approach.\nThe instrument-based approach categorizes an act as an armed attack giving rise to the right to self-defense only if the harm it causes has characteristics traditionally associated with the harm caused by military force. While this approach promotes predictability, it is perceived as outmoded. The second approach, the target-based approach, classifies a cyberattack against critical infrastructure as an armed attack, regardless of its consequences. It\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3961263\nignores the actual effects of the attack and places all emphasis on the nature of the target. Critical infrastructure includes computer systems central to the operation of the banking, health, transportation and management of natural resources sectors. Whereas the instrument-based approach has been criticized for placing too high the bar for armed attacks, target-based approach has been criticized for placing the bar too low, facilitating thereby unnecessary escalation of international conflicts.\nThe third approach, the effects-based approach, constitutes the middle road between the other two approaches and is, perhaps not surprisingly, the dominant of the three. Under this approach, a cyber-attack can constitute an armed attack which may be responded to by force based on several criteria, elaborated by Schmitt: the degree of physical destruction; temporal proximity between the attack and its consequences; the existence of a direct link between the damage and the attack; the level of invasiveness of the attack; and measurability of the harm. The Tallinn Manual also suggests looking into the military character of the attack. Put simply, the effect-based approach requires physical damage to people or property.\nA similar normative debate also exists with respect to the definition of a prohibited use of force, which nonetheless does not reach the level of gravity associated with an “armed attack” and which does not give rise to the right to self-defense. A low threshold for considering what amounts to a use of force provides states with greater discretion in responding to malicious online activity. Conversely, the concern with lowering the bar is that of military escalation. Significantly, some states have taken a broad view on what constitutes a use of force which justifies the imposition of counter-measures (i.e., sanctions) falling short of use of force in self-defense. For example, France considers that a cyber operation without physical effects can be perceived as prohibited use of force, and the Netherlands has taken the position\n Sheng Li, *When Does Internet Denial Trigger the Right of Armed Self-Defense?*, 38 YALE J.

The counter-force used may be kinetic or cybernetic.\n## 2.2.3 Cyber-attacks and the laws of armed conflict\nOnce an armed conflict has erupted, or if cyber-attacks have occurred in the context of an already active armed conflict, then another set of rules kicks in - International Humanitarian Law (IHL), adding an additional layer of legal regulation. Some protections under IHL are particularly relevant to cyber-attacks.

Cyber-attacks directed at critical computer system infrastructure supporting objects indispensable for the survival of the civilian population, such as food or water supplies, would appear to violate all the aforementioned principles. The Tallinn Manual suggests, however, that the Internet as such cannot be considered as an object indispensable to the survival of the civilian population.\nWhereas a few states, like Iran, express deep reservations concerning the application of IHL to cyberspace, the majority of states to do not contest its application, but still disagree on specific questions relating to its exact manner of application. One notable disagreement revolves around the question of whether data can be regarded a “protected object” due to its predominantly civilian nature. The position of Tallinn Manual, which is supported by some states, is that only tangible things can constitute objects, but other states, like France, maintain that civilian data can constitute a protected object.\nThe cyber context presents a difficult challenge for distinguishing between military and civilians objects given the dual-use of cyberspace and the integrated nature of its infrastructures. For example, civilian transportation vehicles and traffic controls are\n Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I), June 8, 1977, 1125 U.N.T.S. 3, article 48 &amp; 54; JEAN-MARIE HENCKAERTS &amp; LOUISE DOSWALD-BECK, CUSTOMARY INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW, rules 7 &amp; 54 (2006).\n Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I), June 8, 1977, 1125 U.N.T.S. 3, article 51; AMICHAI COHEN, PROPORTIONALITY IN MODERN ASYMMETRICAL ARMED WARS (2010).\n Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I), June 8, 1977, 1125 U.N.T.S. 3, article 48 &amp; 54; HENCKAERTS &amp; LOUISE DOSWALD-BECK, supra note 164, rules 7 &amp; 54 (2006).\n TALLINN MANUAL 2.0, supra note 34, commentary on Rule 141.\n Islamic Republic of Iran, The Initial “Pre-draft” of the report of the OEWG on developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security Preliminary reflection (April 2020), p. 2, available at: https://front.un-arm.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/iran-preliminary-on-oewg-pre-draft-15-april-2020-1.pdf (“applying the international humanitarian law, which is exclusively for armed conflicts, into ICT environment… need to be avoided”).\n Some consider the notion of “object” to be limited to items with physical characteristics, namely tangible items.

Hence, even if a cyber-attack was designed to harm a particular military system, reliant on satellite navigation infrastructure, a spill-over effect disrupting a vast number of other systems and networks dependent on the same infrastructure is likely to occur. In the same vein, it is almost impossible to delimit the impact of malwares used in cyber-attacks, since they can spread quickly to computers across many geographical regions. For example, in the Stuxnet incident, the worm targeting computers in Iran also infiltrated computers in other states like India and Russia. Still, one positive aspect in introducing IHL in the cyber-context is that certain cyber operations might cause less severe damage to civilians and civilian objects than traditional means of warfare.\n## 2.3. Cyber-attacks and the non-intervention principle\nAnother important principle of international law regulating cyber-attacks and responses thereto is the principle of non-intervention. According to this principle, states are entitled to conduct key domestic government functions (domaine réservé) without foreign interference. And while, it has been observed that, in practice, this non-intervention principles is often honored in the breach, it is nevertheless a key component of the international legal order. Cyber operations have opened new avenues of intervention in the internal affairs of foreign states, including manipulation of elections (e.g., the 2016 intervention in the US Presidential elections), bringing into focus claims about violation of the principle of non-intervention.\nIn sum, the prohibition against the use of force, as well as the principle of non-intervention and the obligation of due diligence, are applicable to hostile cyber operations.

Accordingly, such questions are often raised and sorted out in the life of international law and relations on a case-by-case basis.\n## 2.4. Other relevant regulatory frameworks\n### 2.4.1. Specific branches of international law\nThere are additional international law regimes that are relevant to the regulation of cyber-attacks in specific circumstances. International telecommunication regulations prohibit interference with broadcasts of authorized frequencies of other states, as well as harmful interferences that endanger radio-navigation or radio-communication service or other radio safety services, or seriously degrade, obstruct or repeatedly interrupt such services. Cyber-attacks that disrupt telecommunication infrastructure may violate these international regulations. Still, international telecommunications regulations do not prohibit, as a rule, attacks aimed at military radio.\nCyber-attacks aimed at disruption of air traffic control and flight passenger lists might implicate international aviation law. Cyber operations that target civilian flights also run contrary to this international regime. In the same vein, cyber-attacks directed against submarine cables implicate the international law of the sea, which requires states to punish those who damage them. Also prohibited are unauthorized broadcasting from the high seas, which may cover certain marine-based cyber-attacks. Given the very specific circumstances in which these provisions apply, they provide minimal protections in the face of cyber-attacks.\n The Tallinn Manual, for example, suggests that force is not mere economic or political coercion. See: TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 151.\n Some suggested that international space law could be used to regulate cyber-attacks. For discussion, see: Hathaway, supra note 2, at 866, 870-872. As noted by Hathaway, these potentially effective tools fail to provide a complete nor a coherent response for cyber-attacks.\n Constitution of the International Telecommunications Union, Dec. 22, 1992, art. 45, available at: https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%201825/volume-1825-I-31251-English.pdf.\n Ibid, art. 48.

At the UN level, several General Assembly resolutions dealt with developments in cyberspace, and the General Assembly initiated, since 2004, six Groups of Governmental Experts (GGE) sessions aimed at identifying international law principles applicable in cyberspace. The most recent round of GGE meetings began on 2019 and included the permanent members of the Security Council and government experts from other countries, selected based on the principle of equitable geographical representation. The recent report of the Group highlighted the need to respect in cyberspace the following UN Charter principles: 1) sovereign equality; 2) the settlement of disputes by peaceful means; 3) the prohibition against the use of force; and 4) non-intervention. The General Assembly also established in 2018 an Open-ended Working Group, open to all UN members, to consider ways to advance international cooperation in light of new developments in cyberspace.\nAt the regional level, one may note the role of the Council of Europe in advancing standards relating to the regulation of cyberspace. Key among them is the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, which is open to countries from other regions as well, and is the most prominent international instrument dealing with cybercrime. Cyber-attacks undertaken by non-state actors would be covered by the prohibitions and law-enforcement provisions of the Budapest Convention, which bans all forms of illegal access to computer data and systems, or data\n See, for example: G.A. Res. 58/32, U.N. Doc. A/RES/58/32 (Dec. 8, 2003); G.A. Res. 60/45, U.N. Doc. A/RES/60/45 (Jan. 6, 2006); G.A. Res. 62/17, U.N. Doc. A/RES/62/17 (Jan. 8, 2008); G.A. Res. 63/37, U.N. Doc.

Still, the Convention does not apply to acts undertaken by law enforcement agencies or to other governmental acts undertaken in the name of national security.\nThe Shanghai Cooperation Organization has also been active in this field and has adopted a broad definition of cyber-attacks or “information war” tools, which includes cyber operations that seek to destabilize society and affect the political affairs of a foreign State. This approach is at odds with the approach taken by Western states, since the latter generally oppose restrictions on cyber-activity which limit freedoms.\nThe EU is another significant regional framework addressing cyber-attacks. It has developed in 2017 a Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox, which prescribes a collective response to cyber-attacks, and in 2019 it developed a blacklist of individuals and non-state entities involved in cyber-attacks. The Organization of American States (“OAS”) has also advanced the field of cyber-security, with its focus being on providing expertise in support of efforts by its member States to draft domestic cyber security regulations.\nAn important regional development came with the establishment of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (“NATO”) Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (“CCDCOE”), in the aftermath of the cyber-attacks against Estonia during 2007. The CCDCOE seeks to develop international cyber doctrine and strategy, and its flagship research initiative has been the Tallinn Manual which purports to interpret the main rules of international law of relevance to the regulation of cyberspace.

The attribution challenge\nWhen confronted with a cyber-attack, States can choose to respond through cyber tools, such as hack-backs, resort to kinetic military force or engage in diplomacy. A preliminary issue, regardless of the type of response selected is attribution. This is since establishing the identity of the attacker is crucial to direct a response against it.\nFor example, a victim state to a violation of international law which does not amount to an armed attack, is permitted to take non-forceful proportionate countermeasures against the violating state provided it can legally attribute the original attack to it or show it violated its DD obligations. Lawful countermeasures are measures that would normally be considered themselves as a violation of international law, but their wrongfulness is precluded when they come in response to a prior unlawful act (provided that they are notified as such and are proportionate to the violation). They are an important self-help tool for states, in a decentralized international legal system. Still, as indicated above, states might prefer not to disclose evidence – even if doing so is critical for attribution. So, although advancements have been made in regard to the technical ability to attribute cyber-attacks, political will to publicly make legal attribution is often lacking.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3961263\n\nThere are some noteworthy challenges when applying the ARSIWA framework to cyber-attacks. Part of the attribution problem derives from the structural design of the Internet, and the processes through which data is transmitted between networks, which offers excellent conditions for maintaining anonymity. Attackers can, for example, delay being discovered by using ‘logic bombs’, and perform attacks via intermediaries in other jurisdictions. They can also harness zombie computers, use proxy servers or resort to ‘spoofing’ tools (incorporating a misleading return address by the sender). When a cyber-attacker employs techniques, such as ‘proxy’ or ‘Stepping Stones’, the available forensic evidence might not be enough to allow technical attribution. The difficulty in obtaining forensic evidence from computer systems under the control of other states is another factor. Hence, only states with access to sophisticated forensic investigative capacities and strong intelligence services are well-positioned to succeed in undertaking technical attribution. Still, the context of the attack might sometimes be strongly suggestive of the identity of the perpetrator.

It can be noted that ICJ practice on standards of proof in cases before it tends to be inconsistent, ranging from ‘too improbable’ or ‘consistent with the probabilities’, through proof ‘to the Court’s satisfaction’, to ‘sufficient certainty’, ‘evidence that is fully conclusive’ or ‘beyond any reasonable doubt’. The general trend appears to be that a claim of exceptional gravity against a state needs to be proved by fully conclusive evidence, with the same approach emerging from the Tallinn 2.0 Manual which links the standard of proof to the severity of the breach. Schmitt suggests that an injured state is required to present clear and compelling evidence, while others called for the lowering of the standard of proof.\n## 4. The way forward\nThe evolving nature of cyberspace and technology invites constant assessment of the applicable regulatory frameworks, including regulation of cyber-attacks. The threat of cyber-\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3961263\n\nInternational law currently provides a relatively weak regulatory framework and there is a need for clearer rules that prohibit and respond to cyber-attacks, including rules that delineate what cyber-attacks constitutes an unlawful armed attack, and legal procedures that facilitate the proving and attributing of cyber-attacks. Greater reliance on international law offers states the possibility of dealing with cyber threats through public diplomacy and multilateral sanctions – policy options that go over and beyond self-reliance on passive and active cyber defense. The ability to rely on an effective international law framework might encourage states to accept reciprocal restraints in cross-border cyber operations and to exercise more intensive control over non-state actors active in this field.\nAlas, it will not be an easy task to promote an international agreement specifying the application of international law rules to cyber operations. For example, Russia proposed in the past an international treaty that will ban secretly embedding malicious codes for future use in case of a need, but the US opposed it. Other significant challenges relate to disagreement about the structure of the Internet (i.e., and the extent of ‘digital sovereignty’ over parts thereof) and attribution. An international instrument regulating cyber-attacks could promote greater harmonization of practices and better cooperation, including information sharing, and criminal prosecution. Such an instrument can also incentivize tech-savvy states to advise and assist less-developed ones, and promote the creation of an independent international attribution mechanism which would minimize factual disagreements and de-escalate international conflict.

Introduction\nCyberspace constitute an unstable environment, featuring rapid changes in the nature of the actors using it, the technologies applied and the inter-personal, governmental and commercial interactions facilitated thereby. The nature of the threats posed by those who abuse cyberspace is also highly dynamic in nature.¹ At the same time, the growing reliance of individuals, markets and society at large on digital devices (including on the Internet of things), and on networks which connect them to one another, generates high susceptibility in the face of malicious cyber-operations (also referred to as cyber-attacks).² The global COVID-19 pandemic exponentially accelerated the trend of digitalization in various fields of life, increasing even more the dependency on cyber-infrastructure and with it the potential for harmful cyber-attacks.³\nTraditionally, states have been cautious in invoking international law in the context of cyber-attacks, and they tended to refrain from denouncing attacks against them as violations of international law, or attributing it to other states.⁴ Such reluctance appears to derive primarily from political and operational considerations: enhancing the regulatory role of international law in cyberspace might impede espionage activities resorted to by all states, and limit the retaliation options of victim states.⁵ Another reason for the reluctance might be the lack of a credible international attribution mechanism for hostile cyber operations.⁶ Instead, states targeted by cyber-attacks resort at times to private companies providing technical attribution aimed at identifying the computer system from which the attack had originated, followed by\n¹ Kenneth Geers, *The Cyber Threat to National Critical Infrastructures: Beyond Theory*, 18 INFORMATION SECURITY JOURNAL: A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE 1, 3 (2009).\n² Oona Hathaway et al., *The Law of Cyber-Attack*, 100 CAL.

While there are of disagreements as to the way that international law applies in the cyberspace, a common understanding had emerged about some key international law norms that apply in this field.⁸ States like Australia,⁹ France,¹⁰ Germany,¹¹ Israel,¹² the United Kingdom,¹³ and the Netherlands¹⁴ have recently articulated their legal positions on how international law applies in cyberspace. In the same vein, states who fell victim to cyber-attacks are increasingly attributing them, as an international law matter, to other states, or non-state actors.¹⁵ Arguably, the increased role played by international law in cyberspace constitutes a reaction to the fact that cyber-attacks become more and more frequent, and dangerous, capable of shutting down critical infrastructure,¹⁶ including nuclear centrifuges¹⁷ and water pumping facilities.¹⁸\n⁷ Israel asserts that attribution remains a mostly technical matter that should not be overregulated, and that the choice of disclosing information supporting attribution claims remains at the exclusive discretion of the state.

Part IV concludes and suggests a way forward.\n1. A Short History of Cyber-attacks\nIt is hard to exaggerate the crucial role cyberspace plays in almost all aspects of everyday life. AI systems relying on online databases and computer networks facilitate the management of huge amounts of governmental services, economic transactions, health data and more.¹⁹ The recent COVID-19 pandemic accelerated digitalization of fields like workplace meetings, distant teaching and online shopping.²⁰\nAgainst this background, it is no surprise that cyber-attacks can and do cause significant and widespread damage.²¹ Notable attacks from recent years were directed against nuclear infrastructure²² and other basic utilities,²³ hospitals,²⁴ commercial entities,²⁵ Internet services²⁶ and more. The possible consequences of such cyber-attacks do not fall short from risks caused by kinetic military or terror attacks.²⁷ What’s more, cyber-attacks can cause a significant damage in a matter of seconds from launch to impact.²⁸ For example, the WannaCry\n¹⁹ Geers, supra note 1, at 2.\n²⁰ Laurent Gisel, Tilman Rodenhäuser &amp; Knut Dörmann, Twenty years on: International humanitarian law and the protection of civilians against the effects of cyber operations during armed conflicts, 102 INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF THE RED CROSS 287, 293 (2020).\n²¹ Tran, supra note 4, at 380.\n²² Kim Zetter, An Unprecedented Look at Stuxnet, the World's First Digital Weapon, WIRED (Nov. 3, 2014, 6:30 AM), https://www.wired.com/2014/11/countdown-to-zero-day-stuxnet/.\n²³ Herzog, supra note 16.\n²⁴ Tilman Rodenhäuser, “Cyber Attacks against Hospitals and the COVID-19 Pandemic: How Strong are International Law Protections?”, Just Security, 27 March 2020, available at: https://www.justsecurity.org/69407/cyber-attacks-against-hospitals-and-the-covid-19-pandemic-how-strong-are-international-law-protections/.\n²⁵ Andrea Peterson, The Sony Pictures Hack, Explained, WASH.

As will be elaborated in the part below dealing with attribution, tracing attacks back to their source is not an easy task even for states with advanced cyber capabilities.⁴¹ In fact, the low entry barrier for developing cyber-attack capabilities allows militarily weaker parties to international conflicts, including non-state actors,⁴² to ‘bridge the gap’ and take on powerful states (who may, paradoxically, be more vulnerable to cyber-attacks because of their greater reliance on online services and platforms).⁴³ Moreover, at times, states use non-state actors to perform cyber operations at their behest, with a view to hiding their own involvement.⁴⁴\nCyber-attacks can take a variety of forms, entailing different types of harms and inviting different preventive measures and regulatory responses. A highly common form of a cyberattack is a Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) operation, during which botnets devastate computer servers through large scale repeat visits to designated websites.⁴⁵ DDOS attacks come in many forms, including network flooding, data modification, electromagnetic interference and more.⁴⁶ Famous DDOS attacks are the attacks conducted during April 2007 on the densely wired Estonia, as well as attacks in Georgia during 2008, ahead of the Russian invasion to South Ossetia.⁴⁷ Nashi – a youth-movement supporting Russian President Putin – accepted responsibility for the attacks,⁴⁸ which appear to have been motivated by political reasons related to tensions in Estonian-Russian relations. Many believe that the attacks can be traced back to Russia, despite Russia’s denial of any involvement.⁴⁹ Similarly, Georgia claimed that Russia initiated DDoS attacks against a number of its governmental, commercial and media\n⁴⁰ Ido Kilovaty, *Cyber Warfare and the Jus Ad Bellum Challenges: Evaluation in the Light of the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare*, 1(5) AMERICAN UNIVERSITY NATIONAL SECURITY LAW BRIEF VOLUME 91, 95 (2014); Geers, supra note 1, at 3.\n⁴¹ For discussion, see: FRED KAPLAN, DARK TERRITORY: THE SECRET HISTORY OF CYBER WAR (2016).\n⁴² JOSEPH NYE, THE FUTURE OF POWER 124 (2011); Christian Payne &amp; Lorraine Finlay, *Addressing Obstacles to Cyber-Attribution: A Model Based on State Response to Cyber-Attack*, 49 GEO.

More recently, hospitals around the globe faced DDOS attacks during the Covid-19 pandemic; the motives underlying such attacks are less than clear. $^{52}$\nA more sophisticated form of cyber-attack is a syntactic attack that involves malware that manipulates and damages the operation of computer systems.53 A prime example is Stuxnet,54 which was described as a joint US and Israeli effort.55 Stuxnet was a malware that infiltrated Iranian nuclear facilities in or before 2010 in order to destroy centrifuges used for uranium enrichment.56 It disrupted the systems at the nuclear facilities,57 and destroyed centrifuges while sending false signals that disabled safety systems in place.58 Stuxnet was the first syntactic attack directed against security infrastructure.59 Unlike previous cyber-attacks, such as the one in Estonia, Stuxnet caused significant damage to physical objects.60\nBeyond that, there are other cyber-operations that may qualify as cyber-attacks. $^{61}$ These include data theft and doxing, $^{62}$ ransomware attacks, $^{63}$ network attacks, $^{64}$ spoofing $^{65}$ and\n50 For discussion, see: O’Connell, supra note 36, at 193.

As a result, there is greater urgency in regulating threat and harm-generating cyber-operations and the responses of the victim state. We will now refer to some international legal instruments which are provide the framework for regulation of cyber-attacks and state responses to them.\n## 2. The International Law Framework governing Cyber-attacks\nCyberspace has been characterized by some as a domain devoid of normative limitations.⁹⁶ This is because Internet and other cyber-infrastructures allegedly operate as a global network that is beyond the sovereign control of any specific state and there is no international cooperation agreement underlying its existence or manner of operation (unlike other international infrastructure such as telephone systems).⁹⁷ While, in the future, a new branch of law specifically aimed at regulating the conduct of all relevant stakeholders in cyberspace (lex cybernetica) might emerge,⁹⁸ legal experts and state officials – especially, officials coming from victim states that have much more to lose from cyber-attacks than their attackers – have attempted to fill the normative void by adjusting existing rules of international law to the challenges posed by cyber-attacks.\nWe will now present shortly some international law norms which might be of relevance to regulating cyber-attacks, and discuss in this connection international instruments, such as the United Nations (UN) Charter,⁹⁹ and the International Law Commission Articles on State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts (\"ARSIWA\").¹⁰⁰\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3961263\n10\n## 2.1. Due diligence\nAs a starting point, a state should not allow its territory to be used to violate the rights of other states – including via hostile cyber operations. This international law obligation of due-diligence (DD) requires a state to take reasonable measures to safeguard its territory from being to misused to commit violations of international law.¹⁰¹ If such violations nonetheless occur, then the state should investigate them properly, and provide a remedy to the victims.¹⁰² Based on the DD principle, states should prevent non-state actors, or other states, from conducting cyber-attacks from within their territory.¹⁰³ A failure to meet DD obligations might give rise to a violation of international law, even if the harm was done in practice by private persons or entities.¹⁰⁴ DD is an obligation of conduct, not one of result, in the sense that it demands from the state to employ all means reasonably available to it.¹⁰⁵ It sets a standard of conduct that depends on state capacity and its actual ability to operate.¹⁰⁶ This standard was recognized by states such as Finland,¹⁰⁷ France,¹⁰⁸ and Germany, as applicable to cyber-attacks.¹⁰⁹\n## 2.2. Use of force and non-intervention\nTo the extent that cyber operations constitute an integral part of the reality of armed conflicts,¹¹⁰ there is little question that the laws that apply to armed conflicts also apply to aggressive and defensive cyber operations. However, cyber operations also occur during situations of political tension and conflict which do not involve the use of kinetic weapons.¹¹¹\n¹⁰¹ Corfu Channel (U.K. v.

Prohibition on the use of force and non-intervention – general\nThe prohibition against the use of force in international law, which is a *jus cogens* (peremptory) norm,¹¹⁸ is enshrined in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.¹¹⁹ There are two exceptions to the prohibition which are stipulated in the Charter: (1) Authorization by the Security Council (SC) under the collective security system; (2) Individual self-defense or collective self-defense against an armed attack.¹²⁰ There is some debate regarding the existence of additional exceptions.¹²¹\nCyberattack on Iranian Port Facility, WASHINGTON POST, 18 May 2020, available at: https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/officials-israel-linked-to-a-disruptive-cyberattack-on-iranian-port-facility/2020/05/18/9d1da866-9942-11ea-89fd-28fb313d1886_story.html.\n¹¹² United Nations Charter, 24 October 1945, 1 UNTS XVI.

On the one hand, the SC has recognized the right of self-defense in the context of terror attacks conducted by non-state actors.¹²⁵ By contrast, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has presented a state-centered perspective, according to which an attack by a non-state entity would only qualify as an armed attack, if it is possible to attribute the act to a sovereign state.¹²⁶ As a result, some claim that there is no right to use force against non-state entities found in the territory of another state unless attribution to a state exists,¹²⁷ while others believe that victim states to an attack by non-state entities may respond with the use of military force directed against them.¹²⁸\nCyber-attacks can also originate from the territory of a state that is unwilling or unable to suppress such activities.¹²⁹ It is relevant to note in this regard the discussion in international law surrounding the doctrine of “unwilling or unable”, which justifies the use of force against a non-state entity, when the entity operates from the territory of a state that is “unwilling or unable” to take DD measures to deal with it.¹³⁰ While most international law scholars reject the doctrine,¹³¹ the doctrine cannot be discarded altogether since it was used by the US in its “war\n¹²² Michael P.

Cyber-attacks and the prohibition on the use of force\nThe applicability to cyberspace of the prohibition against the use of force, as well as the self-defense exception, are reaffirmed in rules 10 and 13 of the Tallinn Manual,¹³⁸ and is supported by a recent UN Group of Governmental Experts report.¹³⁹ Yet, there are three main approaches, in the academic literature, to the application of the right to self-defense against an armed attack in the context of cyber-attacks: 1) the instrument-based approach; 2) the target-based approach; and 3) the effects-based approach.¹⁴⁰\nThe instrument-based approach categorizes an act as an armed attack giving rise to the right to self-defense only if the harm it causes has characteristics traditionally associated with the harm caused by military force.¹⁴¹ While this approach promotes predictability,¹⁴² it is perceived as outmoded.¹⁴³ The second approach, the target-based approach, classifies a cyberattack against critical infrastructure as an armed attack, regardless of its consequences.¹⁴⁴ It\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3961263\nignores the actual effects of the attack and places all emphasis on the nature of the target.¹⁴⁵ Critical infrastructure includes computer systems central to the operation of the banking, health, transportation and management of natural resources sectors.¹⁴⁶ Whereas the instrument-based approach has been criticized for placing too high the bar for armed attacks, target-based approach has been criticized for placing the bar too low, facilitating thereby unnecessary escalation of international conflicts.¹⁴⁷\nThe third approach, the effects-based approach, constitutes the middle road between the other two approaches and is, perhaps not surprisingly, the dominant of the three.¹⁴⁸ Under this approach, a cyber-attack can constitute an armed attack which may be responded to by force based on several criteria, elaborated by Schmitt:¹⁴⁹ the degree of physical destruction; temporal proximity between the attack and its consequences; the existence of a direct link between the damage and the attack; the level of invasiveness of the attack; and measurability of the harm. The Tallinn Manual also suggests looking into the military character of the attack.¹⁵⁰ Put simply, the effect-based approach requires physical damage to people or property.¹⁵¹\nA similar normative debate also exists with respect to the definition of a prohibited use of force, which nonetheless does not reach the level of gravity associated with an “armed attack” and which does not give rise to the right to self-defense. A low threshold for considering what amounts to a use of force provides states with greater discretion in responding to malicious online activity.¹⁵² Conversely, the concern with lowering the bar is that of military escalation.¹⁵³ Significantly, some states have taken a broad view on what constitutes a use of force which justifies the imposition of counter-measures (i.e., sanctions) falling short of use of force in self-defense. For example, France considers that a cyber operation without physical effects can be perceived as prohibited use of force,¹⁵⁴ and the Netherlands has taken the position\n¹⁴⁵ Sheng Li, *When Does Internet Denial Trigger the Right of Armed Self-Defense?*, 38 YALE J.

One notable disagreement revolves around the question of whether data can be regarded a “protected object” due to its predominantly civilian nature.¹⁶⁹ The position of Tallinn Manual, which is supported by some states, is that only tangible things can constitute objects,¹⁷⁰ but other states, like France, maintain that civilian data can constitute a protected object.¹⁷¹\nThe cyber context presents a difficult challenge for distinguishing between military and civilians objects given the dual-use of cyberspace and the integrated nature of its infrastructures.¹⁷² For example, civilian transportation vehicles and traffic controls are\n¹⁶⁴ Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I), June 8, 1977, 1125 U.N.T.S. 3, article 48 &amp; 54; JEAN-MARIE HENCKAERTS &amp; LOUISE DOSWALD-BECK, CUSTOMARY INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW, rules 7 &amp; 54 (2006).\n¹⁶⁵ Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I), June 8, 1977, 1125 U.N.T.S. 3, article 51; AMICHAI COHEN, PROPORTIONALITY IN MODERN ASYMMETRICAL ARMED WARS (2010).\n¹⁶⁶ Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I), June 8, 1977, 1125 U.N.T.S. 3, article 48 &amp; 54; HENCKAERTS &amp; LOUISE DOSWALD-BECK, supra note 164, rules 7 &amp; 54 (2006).\n¹⁶⁷ TALLINN MANUAL 2.0, supra note 34, commentary on Rule 141.\n¹⁶⁸ Islamic Republic of Iran, The Initial “Pre-draft” of the report of the OEWG on developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security Preliminary reflection (April 2020), p. 2, available at: https://front.un-arm.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/iran-preliminary-on-oewg-pre-draft-15-april-2020-1.pdf (“applying the international humanitarian law, which is exclusively for armed conflicts, into ICT environment… need to be avoided”).\n¹⁶⁹ Some consider the notion of “object” to be limited to items with physical characteristics, namely tangible items.

In the same vein, it is almost impossible to delimit the impact of malwares used in cyber-attacks, since they can spread quickly to computers across many geographical regions.¹⁷⁴ For example, in the Stuxnet incident, the worm targeting computers in Iran also infiltrated computers in other states like India and Russia.¹⁷⁵ Still, one positive aspect in introducing IHL in the cyber-context is that certain cyber operations might cause less severe damage to civilians and civilian objects than traditional means of warfare.¹⁷⁶\n## 2.3. Cyber-attacks and the non-intervention principle\nAnother important principle of international law regulating cyber-attacks and responses thereto is the principle of non-intervention. According to this principle, states are entitled to conduct key domestic government functions (domaine réservé) without foreign interference.¹⁷⁷ And while, it has been observed that, in practice, this non-intervention principles is often honored in the breach,¹⁷⁸ it is nevertheless a key component of the international legal order.¹⁷⁹ Cyber operations have opened new avenues of intervention in the internal affairs of foreign states, including manipulation of elections (e.g., the 2016 intervention in the US Presidential elections),¹⁸⁰ bringing into focus claims about violation of the principle of non-intervention.¹⁸¹\nIn sum, the prohibition against the use of force, as well as the principle of non-intervention and the obligation of due diligence, are applicable to hostile cyber operations.

Other relevant regulatory frameworks\n### 2.4.1. Specific branches of international law\nThere are additional international law regimes that are relevant to the regulation of cyber-attacks in specific circumstances.¹⁸³ International telecommunication regulations prohibit interference with broadcasts of authorized frequencies of other states, as well as harmful interferences that endanger radio-navigation or radio-communication service or other radio safety services, or seriously degrade, obstruct or repeatedly interrupt such services.¹⁸⁴ Cyber-attacks that disrupt telecommunication infrastructure may violate these international regulations. Still, international telecommunications regulations do not prohibit, as a rule, attacks aimed at military radio.¹⁸⁵\nCyber-attacks aimed at disruption of air traffic control and flight passenger lists might implicate international aviation law.¹⁸⁶ Cyber operations that target civilian flights also run contrary to this international regime.¹⁸⁷ In the same vein, cyber-attacks directed against submarine cables implicate the international law of the sea, which requires states to punish those who damage them.¹⁸⁸ Also prohibited are unauthorized broadcasting from the high seas,¹⁸⁹ which may cover certain marine-based cyber-attacks. Given the very specific circumstances in which these provisions apply, they provide minimal protections in the face of cyber-attacks.¹⁹⁰\n¹⁸² The Tallinn Manual, for example, suggests that force is not mere economic or political coercion. See: TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 151.\n¹⁸³ Some suggested that international space law could be used to regulate cyber-attacks. For discussion, see: Hathaway, supra note 2, at 866, 870-872.

International organizations\nInternational organizations serve as important venues for regulating cyber-attacks and responses thereto. At the UN level, several General Assembly resolutions dealt with developments in cyberspace,¹⁹¹ and the General Assembly initiated, since 2004, six Groups of Governmental Experts (GGE) sessions aimed at identifying international law principles applicable in cyberspace.¹⁹² The most recent round of GGE meetings began on 2019 and included the permanent members of the Security Council and government experts from other countries, selected based on the principle of equitable geographical representation.¹⁹³ The recent report of the Group highlighted the need to respect in cyberspace the following UN Charter principles: 1) sovereign equality; 2) the settlement of disputes by peaceful means; 3) the prohibition against the use of force; and 4) non-intervention.¹⁹⁴ The General Assembly also established in 2018 an Open-ended Working Group, open to all UN members, to consider ways to advance international cooperation in light of new developments in cyberspace.¹⁹⁵\nAt the regional level, one may note the role of the Council of Europe in advancing standards relating to the regulation of cyberspace. Key among them is the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, which is open to countries from other regions as well, and is the most prominent international instrument dealing with cybercrime.¹⁹⁶ Cyber-attacks undertaken by non-state actors would be covered by the prohibitions and law-enforcement provisions of the Budapest Convention, which bans all forms of illegal access to computer data and systems, or data\n¹⁹¹ See, for example: G.A.

Still, the Convention does not apply to acts undertaken by law enforcement agencies or to other governmental acts undertaken in the name of national security.¹⁹⁷\nThe Shanghai Cooperation Organization has also been active in this field and has adopted a broad definition of cyber-attacks or “information war” tools, which includes cyber operations that seek to destabilize society and affect the political affairs of a foreign State.¹⁹⁸ This approach is at odds with the approach taken by Western states, since the latter generally oppose restrictions on cyber-activity which limit freedoms.¹⁹⁹\nThe EU is another significant regional framework addressing cyber-attacks. It has developed in 2017 a Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox, which prescribes a collective response to cyber-attacks,²⁰⁰ and in 2019 it developed a blacklist of individuals and non-state entities involved in cyber-attacks.²⁰¹ The Organization of American States (“OAS”) has also advanced the field of cyber-security, with its focus being on providing expertise in support of efforts by its member States to draft domestic cyber security regulations.²⁰²\nAn important regional development came with the establishment of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (“NATO”) Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (“CCDCOE”), in the aftermath of the cyber-attacks against Estonia during 2007.²⁰³ The CCDCOE seeks to develop international cyber doctrine and strategy, and its flagship research initiative has been the Tallinn Manual which purports to interpret the main rules of international law of relevance to the regulation of cyberspace.²⁰⁴ While the Manual contains a non-binding\n¹⁹⁷ Council of Europe, Convention on Cybercrime, Explanatory Report, C.E.T.S.

The attribution challenge\nWhen confronted with a cyber-attack, States can choose to respond through cyber tools, such as hack-backs,²⁰⁷ resort to kinetic military force or engage in diplomacy. A preliminary issue, regardless of the type of response selected is attribution.²⁰⁸ This is since establishing the identity of the attacker is crucial to direct a response against it.\nFor example, a victim state to a violation of international law which does not amount to an armed attack, is permitted to take non-forceful proportionate countermeasures against the violating state provided it can legally attribute the original attack to it or show it violated its DD obligations.²⁰⁹ Lawful countermeasures are measures that would normally be considered themselves as a violation of international law, but their wrongfulness is precluded when they come in response to a prior unlawful act (provided that they are notified as such and are proportionate to the violation).²¹⁰ They are an important self-help tool for states,²¹¹ in a decentralized international legal system.²¹² Still, as indicated above, states might prefer not to disclose evidence – even if doing so is critical for attribution.²¹³ So, although advancements have been made in regard to the technical ability to attribute cyber-attacks,²¹⁴ political will to publicly make legal attribution is often lacking.²¹⁵\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3961263\n22\nThe legal framework governing the attribution of responsibility of states was codified in the ARSIWA,²¹⁶ which is largely reflective of customary international law.²¹⁷ State responsibility can usually arise when acts are performed by an organ of the state, persons entrusted with governmental authority, or pursuant to state instructions, direction or control.²¹⁸ States can also be responsible for acts that they acknowledged and adopted as their own.²¹⁹\nThere are some noteworthy challenges when applying the ARSIWA framework to cyber-attacks. Part of the attribution problem derives from the structural design of the Internet, and the processes through which data is transmitted between networks, which offers excellent conditions for maintaining anonymity.²²⁰ Attackers can, for example, delay being discovered by using ‘logic bombs’, and perform attacks via intermediaries in other jurisdictions.²²¹ They can also harness zombie computers,²²² use proxy servers or resort to ‘spoofing’ tools (incorporating a misleading return address by the sender).²²³ When a cyber-attacker employs techniques, such as ‘proxy’ or ‘Stepping Stones’, the available forensic evidence might not be enough to allow technical attribution.²²⁴ The difficulty in obtaining forensic evidence from computer systems under the control of other states is another factor.²²⁵ Hence, only states with access to sophisticated forensic investigative capacities and strong intelligence services are well-positioned to succeed in undertaking technical attribution.²²⁶ Still, the context of the attack might sometimes be strongly suggestive of the identity of the perpetrator.

The way forward\nThe evolving nature of cyberspace and technology invites constant assessment of the applicable regulatory frameworks, including regulation of cyber-attacks. The threat of cyber-\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3961263\n24\nattacks, capable of shutting down economic activity and media and communication networks, or disrupting commerce and impair governmental activity, is ever-present and ubiquitous in the digital age, and the recent COVID-19 crisis illustrated the growing dependency of information societies on digital technology and network connectivity. While cyber-security, cyber-diplomacy, technical training and education are of importance, experience in other fields related to international conflicts shows that effective regulation aimed at shaping the conduct of state and non-state actors is also of great importance.\nInternational law currently provides a relatively weak regulatory framework and there is a need for clearer rules that prohibit and respond to cyber-attacks, including rules that delineate what cyber-attacks constitutes an unlawful armed attack, and legal procedures that facilitate the proving and attributing of cyber-attacks. Greater reliance on international law offers states the possibility of dealing with cyber threats through public diplomacy and multilateral sanctions – policy options that go over and beyond self-reliance on passive and active cyber defense. The ability to rely on an effective international law framework might encourage states to accept reciprocal restraints in cross-border cyber operations and to exercise more intensive control over non-state actors active in this field.\nAlas, it will not be an easy task to promote an international agreement specifying the application of international law rules to cyber operations. For example, Russia proposed in the past an international treaty that will ban secretly embedding malicious codes for future use in case of a need, but the US opposed it.²⁴⁰ Other significant challenges relate to disagreement about the structure of the Internet (i.e., and the extent of ‘digital sovereignty’ over parts thereof) and attribution. An international instrument regulating cyber-attacks could promote greater harmonization of practices and better cooperation, including information sharing, and criminal prosecution.²⁴¹ Such an instrument can also incentivize tech-savvy states to advise and assist less-developed ones,²⁴² and promote the creation of an independent international attribution mechanism which would minimize factual disagreements and de-escalate international conflict. Despite the many challenges ahead, the project of strengthening international regulation of cyber-attacks should not be discarded.\n²⁴⁰ For discussion, see: O’Connell, supra note 36, at 205-206.\n²⁴¹ Hathaway, supra note 2, at 878-880.

Introduction\nCyberspace constitute an unstable environment, featuring rapid changes in the nature of the actors using it, the technologies applied and the inter-personal, governmental and commercial interactions facilitated thereby. The nature of the threats posed by those who abuse cyberspace is also highly dynamic in nature.¹ At the same time, the growing reliance of individuals, markets and society at large on digital devices (including on the Internet of things), and on networks which connect them to one another, generates high susceptibility in the face of malicious cyber-operations (also referred to as cyber-attacks).² The global COVID-19 pandemic exponentially accelerated the trend of digitalization in various fields of life, increasing even more the dependency on cyber-infrastructure and with it the potential for harmful cyber-attacks.³\nTraditionally, states have been cautious in invoking international law in the context of cyber-attacks, and they tended to refrain from denouncing attacks against them as violations of international law, or attributing it to other states.⁴ Such reluctance appears to derive primarily from political and operational considerations: enhancing the regulatory role of international law in cyberspace might impede espionage activities resorted to by all states, and limit the retaliation options of victim states.⁵ Another reason for the reluctance might be the lack of a credible international attribution mechanism for hostile cyber operations.⁶ Instead, states targeted by cyber-attacks resort at times to private companies providing technical attribution aimed at identifying the computer system from which the attack had originated, followed by\n¹ Kenneth Geers, *The Cyber Threat to National Critical Infrastructures: Beyond Theory*, 18 INFORMATION SECURITY JOURNAL: A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE 1, 3 (2009).\n² Oona Hathaway et al., *The Law of Cyber-Attack*, 100 CAL.

While there are of disagreements as to the way that international law applies in the cyberspace, a common understanding had emerged about some key international law norms that apply in this field.⁸ States like Australia,⁹ France,¹⁰ Germany,¹¹ Israel,¹² the United Kingdom,¹³ and the Netherlands¹⁴ have recently articulated their legal positions on how international law applies in cyberspace. In the same vein, states who fell victim to cyber-attacks are increasingly attributing them, as an international law matter, to other states, or non-state actors.¹⁵ Arguably, the increased role played by international law in cyberspace constitutes a reaction to the fact that cyber-attacks become more and more frequent, and dangerous, capable of shutting down critical infrastructure,¹⁶ including nuclear centrifuges¹⁷ and water pumping facilities.¹⁸ ⁷ Israel asserts that attribution remains a mostly technical matter that should not be overregulated, and that the choice of disclosing information supporting attribution claims remains at the exclusive discretion of the state.

Part IV concludes and suggests a way forward.\n\nIt is hard to exaggerate the crucial role cyberspace plays in almost all aspects of everyday life. AI systems relying on online databases and computer networks facilitate the management of huge amounts of governmental services, economic transactions, health data and more.¹⁹ The recent COVID-19 pandemic accelerated digitalization of fields like workplace meetings, distant teaching and online shopping.²⁰ Against this background, it is no surprise that cyber-attacks can and do cause significant and widespread damage.²¹ Notable attacks from recent years were directed against nuclear infrastructure²² and other basic utilities,²³ hospitals,²⁴ commercial entities,²⁵ Internet services²⁶ and more. The possible consequences of such cyber-attacks do not fall short from risks caused by kinetic military or terror attacks.²⁷ What’s more, cyber-attacks can cause a significant damage in a matter of seconds from launch to impact.²⁸ For example, the WannaCry ¹⁹ Geers, supra note 1, at 2.\n²⁰ Laurent Gisel, Tilman Rodenhäuser &amp; Knut Dörmann, Twenty years on: International humanitarian law and the protection of civilians against the effects of cyber operations during armed conflicts, 102 INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF THE RED CROSS 287, 293 (2020).\n²¹ Tran, supra note 4, at 380.\n²² Kim Zetter, An Unprecedented Look at Stuxnet, the World's First Digital Weapon, WIRED (Nov. 3, 2014, 6:30 AM), https://www.wired.com/2014/11/countdown-to-zero-day-stuxnet/.\n²³ Herzog, supra note 16.\n²⁴ Tilman Rodenhäuser, “Cyber Attacks against Hospitals and the COVID-19 Pandemic: How Strong are International Law Protections?”, Just Security, 27 March 2020, available at: https://www.justsecurity.org/69407/cyber-attacks-against-hospitals-and-the-covid-19-pandemic-how-strong-are-international-law-protections/.\n²⁵ Andrea Peterson, The Sony Pictures Hack, Explained, WASH.

The relative low costs of conducting cyber-attacks³⁹ and the ability to maintain a high Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3961263 degree of anonymity while engaging in such attacks,⁴⁰ renders resort to such attacks an available and attractive option in the eyes of criminals, hacktivists and political extremists. As will be elaborated in the part below dealing with attribution, tracing attacks back to their source is not an easy task even for states with advanced cyber capabilities.⁴¹ In fact, the low entry barrier for developing cyber-attack capabilities allows militarily weaker parties to international conflicts, including non-state actors,⁴² to ‘bridge the gap’ and take on powerful states (who may, paradoxically, be more vulnerable to cyber-attacks because of their greater reliance on online services and platforms).⁴³ Moreover, at times, states use non-state actors to perform cyber operations at their behest, with a view to hiding their own involvement.⁴⁴ Cyber-attacks can take a variety of forms, entailing different types of harms and inviting different preventive measures and regulatory responses. A highly common form of a cyberattack is a Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) operation, during which botnets devastate computer servers through large scale repeat visits to designated websites.⁴⁵ DDOS attacks come in many forms, including network flooding, data modification, electromagnetic interference and more.⁴⁶ Famous DDOS attacks are the attacks conducted during April 2007 on the densely wired Estonia, as well as attacks in Georgia during 2008, ahead of the Russian invasion to South Ossetia.⁴⁷ Nashi – a youth-movement supporting Russian President Putin – accepted responsibility for the attacks,⁴⁸ which appear to have been motivated by political reasons related to tensions in Estonian-Russian relations. Many believe that the attacks can be traced back to Russia, despite Russia’s denial of any involvement.⁴⁹ Similarly, Georgia claimed that Russia initiated DDoS attacks against a number of its governmental, commercial and media ⁴⁰ Ido Kilovaty, *Cyber Warfare and the Jus Ad Bellum Challenges: Evaluation in the Light of the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare*, 1(5) AMERICAN UNIVERSITY NATIONAL SECURITY LAW BRIEF VOLUME 91, 95 (2014); Geers, supra note 1, at 3.\n⁴¹ For discussion, see: FRED KAPLAN, DARK TERRITORY: THE SECRET HISTORY OF CYBER WAR (2016).\n⁴² JOSEPH NYE, THE FUTURE OF POWER 124 (2011); Christian Payne &amp; Lorraine Finlay, *Addressing Obstacles to Cyber-Attribution: A Model Based on State Response to Cyber-Attack*, 49 GEO.

More recently, hospitals around the globe faced DDOS attacks during the Covid-19 pandemic; the motives underlying such attacks are less than clear. \nA more sophisticated form of cyber-attack is a syntactic attack that involves malware that manipulates and damages the operation of computer systems.53 A prime example is Stuxnet,54 which was described as a joint US and Israeli effort.55 Stuxnet was a malware that infiltrated Iranian nuclear facilities in or before 2010 in order to destroy centrifuges used for uranium enrichment.56 It disrupted the systems at the nuclear facilities,57 and destroyed centrifuges while sending false signals that disabled safety systems in place.58 Stuxnet was the first syntactic attack directed against security infrastructure.59 Unlike previous cyber-attacks, such as the one in Estonia, Stuxnet caused significant damage to physical objects.60 Beyond that, there are other cyber-operations that may qualify as cyber-attacks. These include data theft and doxing, ransomware attacks, network attacks, spoofing and Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3961263 Over the years, states have developed mechanisms to prevent and respond to cyber-attacks.⁶⁷ These include defensive-passive tools like firewalls, but also offensive-active tools, comprising active defense measures, which attempt to disable the source of an attack.⁶⁸ The legality of such active defense measures is questionable, however, under the norms of international law applicable to cyberspace articulated in the Tallinn Manual,⁶⁹ which do not themselves enjoy full political and legal consensus.⁷⁰ As mentioned above, states have been traditionally hesitant to invoke international law in the context of cyber-attacks.⁷¹ Even victim states have often refrained from acknowledging they were attacked; and when acknowledging it, they were slow in invoking international law norms or attempting to attribute the attack to another state.⁷² This reluctance might be driven by concerns about the reputation for safety of their digital environment, or a wish to deflect domestic pressures to react.⁷³ Also, when responding to attacks, states appear to prefer the pragmatic pursuit of political and national security interests over making public legal claims which would bind them to a particular interpretation of international law and might require the disclosure of confidential information.⁷⁴ Instead, tech-savvy states feel well positioned to rely on their own capabilities, alongside those of their partners, to defend themselves from cyber-attacks.⁷⁵ Another possible reason for the hesitancy of states is that there is no credible international attribution mechanism that can support legal claims concerning cyber-attacks.⁷⁶ A number of proposals for the establishment of an international attribution mechanism have ⁶⁶ See, for example: MARTIN C.

A growing number of states outlined their legal views as to the way in which international law governs cyberspace. Examples include statements by Australia, Finland, France, Germany, Israel, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and New Zealand. This change may be attributed in part to the rise in cyber-attacks around the world during the Covid-19 crisis. The health-care sector has proved itself particularly vulnerable to cyber-attacks and hospitals, other health-care facilities and research institutions involved in developing vaccines were targeted by hostile cyber operations. In addition, cyber-attackers directed their attention towards international organizations involved in responding to the crisis, most notably the World Health Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3961263 Organization,⁹³ complicating international efforts to cope with the pandemic.⁹⁴ Another problem that arose during the crisis was the spread on-line of disinformation campaigns.⁹⁵ In sum, cyber-attacks pose a growing threat for states and their critical infrastructure. As a result, there is greater urgency in regulating threat and harm-generating cyber-operations and the responses of the victim state. We will now refer to some international legal instruments which are provide the framework for regulation of cyber-attacks and state responses to them.\n## 2. The International Law Framework governing Cyber-attacks Cyberspace has been characterized by some as a domain devoid of normative limitations.⁹⁶ This is because Internet and other cyber-infrastructures allegedly operate as a global network that is beyond the sovereign control of any specific state and there is no international cooperation agreement underlying its existence or manner of operation (unlike other international infrastructure such as telephone systems).⁹⁷ While, in the future, a new branch of law specifically aimed at regulating the conduct of all relevant stakeholders in cyberspace (lex cybernetica) might emerge,⁹⁸ legal experts and state officials – especially, officials coming from victim states that have much more to lose from cyber-attacks than their attackers – have attempted to fill the normative void by adjusting existing rules of international law to the challenges posed by cyber-attacks.\nWe will now present shortly some international law norms which might be of relevance to regulating cyber-attacks, and discuss in this connection international instruments, such as the United Nations (UN) Charter,⁹⁹ and the International Law Commission Articles on State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts (\"ARSIWA\").¹⁰⁰ Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3961263 As a starting point, a state should not allow its territory to be used to violate the rights of other states – including via hostile cyber operations. This international law obligation of due-diligence (DD) requires a state to take reasonable measures to safeguard its territory from being to misused to commit violations of international law.¹⁰¹ If such violations nonetheless occur, then the state should investigate them properly, and provide a remedy to the victims.¹⁰² Based on the DD principle, states should prevent non-state actors, or other states, from conducting cyber-attacks from within their territory.¹⁰³ A failure to meet DD obligations might give rise to a violation of international law, even if the harm was done in practice by private persons or entities.¹⁰⁴ DD is an obligation of conduct, not one of result, in the sense that it demands from the state to employ all means reasonably available to it.¹⁰⁵ It sets a standard of conduct that depends on state capacity and its actual ability to operate.¹⁰⁶ This standard was recognized by states such as Finland,¹⁰⁷ France,¹⁰⁸ and Germany, as applicable to cyber-attacks.¹⁰⁹ ## 2.2. Use of force and non-intervention To the extent that cyber operations constitute an integral part of the reality of armed conflicts,¹¹⁰ there is little question that the laws that apply to armed conflicts also apply to aggressive and defensive cyber operations. However, cyber operations also occur during situations of political tension and conflict which do not involve the use of kinetic weapons.¹¹¹ ¹⁰¹ Corfu Channel (U.K. v.

Prohibition on the use of force and non-intervention – general The prohibition against the use of force in international law, which is a *jus cogens* (peremptory) norm,¹¹⁸ is enshrined in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.¹¹⁹ There are two exceptions to the prohibition which are stipulated in the Charter: (1) Authorization by the Security Council (SC) under the collective security system; (2) Individual self-defense or collective self-defense against an armed attack.¹²⁰ There is some debate regarding the existence of additional exceptions.¹²¹ Cyberattack on Iranian Port Facility, WASHINGTON POST, 18 May 2020, available at: https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/officials-israel-linked-to-a-disruptive-cyberattack-on-iranian-port-facility/2020/05/18/9d1da866-9942-11ea-89fd-28fb313d1886_story.html.\n¹¹² United Nations Charter, 24 October 1945, 1 UNTS XVI.

On the one hand, the SC has recognized the right of self-defense in the context of terror attacks conducted by non-state actors.¹²⁵ By contrast, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has presented a state-centered perspective, according to which an attack by a non-state entity would only qualify as an armed attack, if it is possible to attribute the act to a sovereign state.¹²⁶ As a result, some claim that there is no right to use force against non-state entities found in the territory of another state unless attribution to a state exists,¹²⁷ while others believe that victim states to an attack by non-state entities may respond with the use of military force directed against them.¹²⁸ Cyber-attacks can also originate from the territory of a state that is unwilling or unable to suppress such activities.¹²⁹ It is relevant to note in this regard the discussion in international law surrounding the doctrine of “unwilling or unable”, which justifies the use of force against a non-state entity, when the entity operates from the territory of a state that is “unwilling or unable” to take DD measures to deal with it.¹³⁰ While most international law scholars reject the doctrine,¹³¹ the doctrine cannot be discarded altogether since it was used by the US in its “war ¹²² Michael P.

Cyber-attacks and the prohibition on the use of force The applicability to cyberspace of the prohibition against the use of force, as well as the self-defense exception, are reaffirmed in rules 10 and 13 of the Tallinn Manual,¹³⁸ and is supported by a recent UN Group of Governmental Experts report.¹³⁹ Yet, there are three main approaches, in the academic literature, to the application of the right to self-defense against an armed attack in the context of cyber-attacks: 1) the instrument-based approach; 2) the target-based approach; and 3) the effects-based approach.¹⁴⁰ The instrument-based approach categorizes an act as an armed attack giving rise to the right to self-defense only if the harm it causes has characteristics traditionally associated with the harm caused by military force.¹⁴¹ While this approach promotes predictability,¹⁴² it is perceived as outmoded.¹⁴³ The second approach, the target-based approach, classifies a cyberattack against critical infrastructure as an armed attack, regardless of its consequences.¹⁴⁴ It Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3961263 ignores the actual effects of the attack and places all emphasis on the nature of the target.¹⁴⁵ Critical infrastructure includes computer systems central to the operation of the banking, health, transportation and management of natural resources sectors.¹⁴⁶ Whereas the instrument-based approach has been criticized for placing too high the bar for armed attacks, target-based approach has been criticized for placing the bar too low, facilitating thereby unnecessary escalation of international conflicts.¹⁴⁷ The third approach, the effects-based approach, constitutes the middle road between the other two approaches and is, perhaps not surprisingly, the dominant of the three.¹⁴⁸ Under this approach, a cyber-attack can constitute an armed attack which may be responded to by force based on several criteria, elaborated by Schmitt:¹⁴⁹ the degree of physical destruction; temporal proximity between the attack and its consequences; the existence of a direct link between the damage and the attack; the level of invasiveness of the attack; and measurability of the harm. The Tallinn Manual also suggests looking into the military character of the attack.¹⁵⁰ Put simply, the effect-based approach requires physical damage to people or property.¹⁵¹ A similar normative debate also exists with respect to the definition of a prohibited use of force, which nonetheless does not reach the level of gravity associated with an “armed attack” and which does not give rise to the right to self-defense. A low threshold for considering what amounts to a use of force provides states with greater discretion in responding to malicious online activity.¹⁵² Conversely, the concern with lowering the bar is that of military escalation.¹⁵³ Significantly, some states have taken a broad view on what constitutes a use of force which justifies the imposition of counter-measures (i.e., sanctions) falling short of use of force in self-defense. For example, France considers that a cyber operation without physical effects can be perceived as prohibited use of force,¹⁵⁴ and the Netherlands has taken the position ¹⁴⁵ Sheng Li, *When Does Internet Denial Trigger the Right of Armed Self-Defense?*, 38 YALE J.

For example, IHL prohibits attacks that are not directed ¹⁵⁵ Letter from the Netherlands, supra note 14.\n¹⁵⁶ Estonia, President of the Republic at the Opening of CyCon 2019, 29 May 2019, available at: https://www.president.ee/en/official-duties/speeches/15241-president-of-the-republic-at-the-opening-of-cycon-2019/index.html; Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Australia’s International Cyber Engagement Strategy, 2019, available at: https://www.internationalcybertech.gov.au/sites/default/files/2020-11/The%20Strategy.pdf; Finland’s positions, supra note 84.\n¹⁵⁷ New Zealand, supra note 90.\n¹⁵⁸ On the Application of International Law in Cyberspace, supra note 11.\n¹⁵⁹ US Department of Defense (DoD), Law of War Manual, 2015, available at: https://dod.defense.gov/Portals/1/Documents/pubs/DoD%20Law%20of%20War%20Manual%20-%20June%202015%20Updated%20Dec%202016.pdf?ver=2016-12-13-172036-190.\n¹⁶⁰ For discussion of the US position, see: Matthew C.

One notable disagreement revolves around the question of whether data can be regarded a “protected object” due to its predominantly civilian nature.¹⁶⁹ The position of Tallinn Manual, which is supported by some states, is that only tangible things can constitute objects,¹⁷⁰ but other states, like France, maintain that civilian data can constitute a protected object.¹⁷¹ The cyber context presents a difficult challenge for distinguishing between military and civilians objects given the dual-use of cyberspace and the integrated nature of its infrastructures.¹⁷² For example, civilian transportation vehicles and traffic controls are ¹⁶⁴ Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I), June 8, 1977, 1125 U.N.T.S. 3, article 48 &amp; 54; JEAN-MARIE HENCKAERTS &amp; LOUISE DOSWALD-BECK, CUSTOMARY INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW, rules 7 &amp; 54 (2006).\n¹⁶⁵ Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I), June 8, 1977, 1125 U.N.T.S. 3, article 51; AMICHAI COHEN, PROPORTIONALITY IN MODERN ASYMMETRICAL ARMED WARS (2010).\n¹⁶⁶ Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I), June 8, 1977, 1125 U.N.T.S. 3, article 48 &amp; 54; HENCKAERTS &amp; LOUISE DOSWALD-BECK, supra note 164, rules 7 &amp; 54 (2006).\n¹⁶⁷ TALLINN MANUAL 2.0, supra note 34, commentary on Rule 141.\n¹⁶⁸ Islamic Republic of Iran, The Initial “Pre-draft” of the report of the OEWG on developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security Preliminary reflection, p. 2, available at: https://front.un-arm.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/iran-preliminary-on-oewg-pre-draft-15-april-2020-1.pdf (“applying the international humanitarian law, which is exclusively for armed conflicts, into ICT environment… need to be avoided”).\n¹⁶⁹ Some consider the notion of “object” to be limited to items with physical characteristics, namely tangible items.

In the same vein, it is almost impossible to delimit the impact of malwares used in cyber-attacks, since they can spread quickly to computers across many geographical regions.¹⁷⁴ For example, in the Stuxnet incident, the worm targeting computers in Iran also infiltrated computers in other states like India and Russia.¹⁷⁵ Still, one positive aspect in introducing IHL in the cyber-context is that certain cyber operations might cause less severe damage to civilians and civilian objects than traditional means of warfare.¹⁷⁶ ## 2.3. Cyber-attacks and the non-intervention principle Another important principle of international law regulating cyber-attacks and responses thereto is the principle of non-intervention. According to this principle, states are entitled to conduct key domestic government functions (domaine réservé) without foreign interference.¹⁷⁷ And while, it has been observed that, in practice, this non-intervention principles is often honored in the breach,¹⁷⁸ it is nevertheless a key component of the international legal order.¹⁷⁹ Cyber operations have opened new avenues of intervention in the internal affairs of foreign states, including manipulation of elections (e.g., the 2016 intervention in the US Presidential elections),¹⁸⁰ bringing into focus claims about violation of the principle of non-intervention.¹⁸¹ In sum, the prohibition against the use of force, as well as the principle of non-intervention and the obligation of due diligence, are applicable to hostile cyber operations.

Other relevant regulatory frameworks ### 2.4.1. Specific branches of international law There are additional international law regimes that are relevant to the regulation of cyber-attacks in specific circumstances.¹⁸³ International telecommunication regulations prohibit interference with broadcasts of authorized frequencies of other states, as well as harmful interferences that endanger radio-navigation or radio-communication service or other radio safety services, or seriously degrade, obstruct or repeatedly interrupt such services.¹⁸⁴ Cyber-attacks that disrupt telecommunication infrastructure may violate these international regulations. Still, international telecommunications regulations do not prohibit, as a rule, attacks aimed at military radio.¹⁸⁵ Cyber-attacks aimed at disruption of air traffic control and flight passenger lists might implicate international aviation law.¹⁸⁶ Cyber operations that target civilian flights also run contrary to this international regime.¹⁸⁷ In the same vein, cyber-attacks directed against submarine cables implicate the international law of the sea, which requires states to punish those who damage them.¹⁸⁸ Also prohibited are unauthorized broadcasting from the high seas,¹⁸⁹ which may cover certain marine-based cyber-attacks. Given the very specific circumstances in which these provisions apply, they provide minimal protections in the face of cyber-attacks.¹⁹⁰ ¹⁸² The Tallinn Manual, for example, suggests that force is not mere economic or political coercion. See: TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 151.\n¹⁸³ Some suggested that international space law could be used to regulate cyber-attacks. For discussion, see: Hathaway, supra note 2, at 866, 870-872.

At the UN level, several General Assembly resolutions dealt with developments in cyberspace,¹⁹¹ and the General Assembly initiated, since 2004, six Groups of Governmental Experts (GGE) sessions aimed at identifying international law principles applicable in cyberspace.¹⁹² The most recent round of GGE meetings began on 2019 and included the permanent members of the Security Council and government experts from other countries, selected based on the principle of equitable geographical representation.¹⁹³ The recent report of the Group highlighted the need to respect in cyberspace the following UN Charter principles: 1) sovereign equality; 2) the settlement of disputes by peaceful means; 3) the prohibition against the use of force; and 4) non-intervention.¹⁹⁴ The General Assembly also established in 2018 an Open-ended Working Group, open to all UN members, to consider ways to advance international cooperation in light of new developments in cyberspace.¹⁹⁵ At the regional level, one may note the role of the Council of Europe in advancing standards relating to the regulation of cyberspace. Key among them is the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, which is open to countries from other regions as well, and is the most prominent international instrument dealing with cybercrime.¹⁹⁶ Cyber-attacks undertaken by non-state actors would be covered by the prohibitions and law-enforcement provisions of the Budapest Convention, which bans all forms of illegal access to computer data and systems, or data ¹⁹¹ See, for example: G.A.

Still, the Convention does not apply to acts undertaken by law enforcement agencies or to other governmental acts undertaken in the name of national security.¹⁹⁷ The Shanghai Cooperation Organization has also been active in this field and has adopted a broad definition of cyber-attacks or “information war” tools, which includes cyber operations that seek to destabilize society and affect the political affairs of a foreign State.¹⁹⁸ This approach is at odds with the approach taken by Western states, since the latter generally oppose restrictions on cyber-activity which limit freedoms.¹⁹⁹ The EU is another significant regional framework addressing cyber-attacks. It has developed in 2017 a Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox, which prescribes a collective response to cyber-attacks,²⁰⁰ and in 2019 it developed a blacklist of individuals and non-state entities involved in cyber-attacks.²⁰¹ The Organization of American States (“OAS”) has also advanced the field of cyber-security, with its focus being on providing expertise in support of efforts by its member States to draft domestic cyber security regulations.²⁰² An important regional development came with the establishment of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (“NATO”) Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (“CCDCOE”), in the aftermath of the cyber-attacks against Estonia during 2007.²⁰³ The CCDCOE seeks to develop international cyber doctrine and strategy, and its flagship research initiative has been the Tallinn Manual which purports to interpret the main rules of international law of relevance to the regulation of cyberspace.²⁰⁴ While the Manual contains a non-binding ¹⁹⁷ Council of Europe, Convention on Cybercrime, Explanatory Report, C.E.T.S.

The attribution challenge When confronted with a cyber-attack, States can choose to respond through cyber tools, such as hack-backs,²⁰⁷ resort to kinetic military force or engage in diplomacy. A preliminary issue, regardless of the type of response selected is attribution.²⁰⁸ This is since establishing the identity of the attacker is crucial to direct a response against it.\nFor example, a victim state to a violation of international law which does not amount to an armed attack, is permitted to take non-forceful proportionate countermeasures against the violating state provided it can legally attribute the original attack to it or show it violated its DD obligations.²⁰⁹ Lawful countermeasures are measures that would normally be considered themselves as a violation of international law, but their wrongfulness is precluded when they come in response to a prior unlawful act (provided that they are notified as such and are proportionate to the violation).²¹⁰ They are an important self-help tool for states,²¹¹ in a decentralized international legal system.²¹² Still, as indicated above, states might prefer not to disclose evidence – even if doing so is critical for attribution.²¹³ So, although advancements have been made in regard to the technical ability to attribute cyber-attacks,²¹⁴ political will to publicly make legal attribution is often lacking.²¹⁵ Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3961263 There are some noteworthy challenges when applying the ARSIWA framework to cyber-attacks. Part of the attribution problem derives from the structural design of the Internet, and the processes through which data is transmitted between networks, which offers excellent conditions for maintaining anonymity.²²⁰ Attackers can, for example, delay being discovered by using ‘logic bombs’, and perform attacks via intermediaries in other jurisdictions.²²¹ They can also harness zombie computers,²²² use proxy servers or resort to ‘spoofing’ tools (incorporating a misleading return address by the sender).²²³ When a cyber-attacker employs techniques, such as ‘proxy’ or ‘Stepping Stones’, the available forensic evidence might not be enough to allow technical attribution.²²⁴ The difficulty in obtaining forensic evidence from computer systems under the control of other states is another factor.²²⁵ Hence, only states with access to sophisticated forensic investigative capacities and strong intelligence services are well-positioned to succeed in undertaking technical attribution.²²⁶ Still, the context of the attack might sometimes be strongly suggestive of the identity of the perpetrator.

The way forward The evolving nature of cyberspace and technology invites constant assessment of the applicable regulatory frameworks, including regulation of cyber-attacks. The threat of cyber- Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3961263 International law currently provides a relatively weak regulatory framework and there is a need for clearer rules that prohibit and respond to cyber-attacks, including rules that delineate what cyber-attacks constitutes an unlawful armed attack, and legal procedures that facilitate the proving and attributing of cyber-attacks. Greater reliance on international law offers states the possibility of dealing with cyber threats through public diplomacy and multilateral sanctions – policy options that go over and beyond self-reliance on passive and active cyber defense. The ability to rely on an effective international law framework might encourage states to accept reciprocal restraints in cross-border cyber operations and to exercise more intensive control over non-state actors active in this field.\nAlas, it will not be an easy task to promote an international agreement specifying the application of international law rules to cyber operations. For example, Russia proposed in the past an international treaty that will ban secretly embedding malicious codes for future use in case of a need, but the US opposed it.²⁴⁰ Other significant challenges relate to disagreement about the structure of the Internet (i.e., and the extent of ‘digital sovereignty’ over parts thereof) and attribution. An international instrument regulating cyber-attacks could promote greater harmonization of practices and better cooperation, including information sharing, and criminal prosecution.²⁴¹ Such an instrument can also incentivize tech-savvy states to advise and assist less-developed ones,²⁴² and promote the creation of an independent international attribution mechanism which would minimize factual disagreements and de-escalate international conflict. Despite the many challenges ahead, the project of strengthening international regulation of cyber-attacks should not be discarded.\n²⁴⁰ For discussion, see: O’Connell, supra note 36, at 205-206.\n²⁴¹ Hathaway, supra note 2, at 878-880.
