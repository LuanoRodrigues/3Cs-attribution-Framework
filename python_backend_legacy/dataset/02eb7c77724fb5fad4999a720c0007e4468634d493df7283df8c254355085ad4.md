The Note argues that the law of armed conflict (LOAC)—also referred to as international humanitarian law (IHL)—should apply to protect the three categories of cultural property which cyberwarfare could affect: real-word cultural property, digitized cultural property (cultural property which has been converted into digital form), and digital cultural property (cultural property which has always existed in digital form). Lastly, this Note argues for a novel interpretation of the 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection for Cultural Property that would encompass digital and digitized cultural property.\n* JD Candidate 2022, Columbia Law School; B.A. 2019, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

He spent his life as the Chief of Antiquities at the historic site of Palmyra in Syria, his hometown, where he protected one of the world's best-preserved archaeological sites—until ISIS seized his home and took him hostage.¹ After a month of torture, the terrorist group publicly beheaded Khaled al-Asaad for refusing to reveal the location of hidden antiquities.² Khaled al-Assad's sacrifice demonstrates the importance of cultural property to humanity: it is not only a record of humanity, but a fundamental pillar supporting it. Cultural property is so indispensable and so invaluable to humankind that the law must shield it from the bombs and bloodshed of war, just as Khaled al-Assad did. Yet, one hundred years from now, the artifacts worth dying for will not only be physical but also digital, made of code rather than stone or steel.³ This Note aims to address the fundamental question of how humanity will protect this new form of cultural property during armed conflicts.\nThere is widespread consensus that the law of armed conflict (\"LOAC\") applies to state and non-state actors in cyberspace, but there is far less consensus as to exactly how it applies.⁴ The application of settled principles of LOAC to cyber operations is a difficult one, as the cyber domain\n1.

This emergence also created a new form: digital cultural property, which is sometimes termed “born-digital cultural heritage.”¹³ Just as culture has become increasingly digital, so too has warfare, with large numbers of state and non-state actors fielding substantial cyber capabilities.¹⁴ This shift must prompt a reevaluation of the long-standing protections for cultural property in LOAC, which was made to protect columns and arches, not ones and zeroes.

It is worth clarifying the terms \"cultural property\" and \"cultural heritage.\" The two terms are almost always used interchangeably in international treaties and scholarship. While cultural property is an older term, it has largely been superseded by cultural heritage, which is conceptually oriented around preservation for future generations rather than the rights and powers of the possessor. The term cultural heritage also encompasses practices that do not fall within any definition of tangible or intangible cultural heritage, making it a broader category than cultural property, although the terms are often synonymous. For example, the Great Wall of China is cultural property that forms part of China's cultural heritage. Yet the practice of Chinese calligraphy, an intangible cultural tradition, is not cultural property despite being part of China's cultural heritage. However, unlike cultural heritage, cultural property has a clear legal meaning, defined in the 1954 Hague Convention and 1970 UNESCO Convention.

Q. 61, 65(2000).\nDigitized cultural property is cultural property that has been copied or converted into digital format, yet which came from a real-world copy. Common examples of digitized cultural property include scanned books, audio recordings of music or culturally significant stories, and 3D renderings of monuments and artifacts.\nDigital cultural property is cultural property that has no original physical or real-world copy. Common examples of digital cultural property include digital artwork, blogs, vlogs, webcomics, e-books, certain audio recordings that are only digital downloads, some television shows and films, some journalism, and any other content that exists solely in digital form. The line between digital and digitized cultural property is not always clear. Take JSTOR, which is a digital repository for academic research similar to SSRN or PubMed.

This would bring digital and digitized cultural property within treaty-based definitions of protected cultural property during times of armed conflict. As states increasingly turn to digitization to protect cultural property from the threats of climate change, terrorism, and physical degradation, and as human culture becomes increasingly digital, these protections will become increasingly important.¹⁷ Because LOAC's rules on cultural property and heritage do not vary substantially between international and non-international armed conflicts involving non-state actors,¹⁸ this paper's arguments extend to both.

Part II discusses the development of digital and digitized cultural property and current threats to digital cultural heritage. Part III proposes a novel interpretation of digital and digitized cultural property as historically significant archives or documents and addresses what obligations belligerents ought to have towards cultural property in cyberspace.\n## I. Place of Cultural Property in the Law of Armed Conflict\n### A. Development of Protections for Cultural Property\nWith some exceptions, the wanton destruction of cultural property and heritage in ancient and medieval warfare was commonplace, governed by the maxim “to the victor go the spoils.”²⁰ Athenian historian Xenophon wrote, “It is an eternal law the wide world over, that when a city is taken in war, the citizens, their persons, and all their property fall into the hands of the conquerors.”²¹ The Roman Triumph prominently featured stolen art from defeated enemies,²² the Bible repeatedly references the plundering of art and treasures as spoils of war,²³ and when the Mongols sacked Baghdad in 1258 and destroyed the city’s great libraries, they threw so many books\nespecially in cyber space.

INT’L L. 643, 652 (2019); Michael Schmitt &amp; Sean Watts, *Beyond State-Centrism: International Law and Non-State Actors in Cyberspace*, 21 J. CONFLICT SEC. L. 595, 611 (2016) (“In many respects, the state-centric legal regime of public international law may seem ill-suited or even inadequate to address the challenges the super-empowered non-state actors of cyberspace present”). However, because state actors possess the most substantial capabilities in cyberspace and because IHL speaks with greater clarity on international armed conflicts, this paper focuses on international armed conflicts.\n²⁰. Or, as more eloquently phrased by Thucydides, “right, as the world goes, is only in question between equals in power, while the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must.” THUCYDIDES, *HISTORY OF THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 566–67* (Richard Crawley trans., *Floating Press* 2008) (Fourth century BCE).\n²¹.

And they smote all the cities round about Gerar . . . and they spoiled all the cities; for there was exceeding much spoil in them.”); see also Deuteronomy 20:10 (elaborating the practices of war and articulating divine endorsement of expropriating cultural property).\n2021]\nHard Drive Heritage\n255\ninto the Tigris that \"they formed a bridge that would support men on horseback\" and apocryphally turned the river black with ink.²⁴ During the sack of Constantinople in the Fourth Crusade, \"the palaces were burnt. The accumulated treasures of antiquity were recklessly looted and destroyed... The libraries containing the assembled literature of the classical and early Christian ages, went up in flames.\"²⁵ These are minor examples of the countless works of art, architecture, and literature that became casualties of war.²⁶\nYet some ancient thinkers and commanders took steps to exempt art, architecture, and houses of worship from the rampant destruction of civilian property. Greek historian Polybius wrote that while the destruction or taking of civilian property \"are necessary acts according to the laws and rights of war; to deface temples, statues, and such like erections in pure wantonness... must be regarded as an act of blind passion and insanity.\"²⁷ Cicero later used this line of reasoning to prosecute Gaius Verres in 70 BCE for expropriating artworks from temples and citizens during his governorship of Sicily.²⁸ To mitigate the damage of war to spiritual institutions, Frederick Barbarossa issued an edict in 1158 forbidding the pillaging of churches, although the ransacking of houses of worship remained ubiquitous in medieval warfare.²⁹ The Quran likewise prohibits fighting in sacred places, such as mosques and other houses of worship.³⁰\nThe Enlightenment marked a substantial shift in the treatment of cultural property and heritage in international legal thought.³¹ French jurist Emer de Vattel wrote that destroying cultural property renders a belligerent\n24.

[sic] is absolutely condemned, even by the voluntary law of nations, as never being conducive to the lawful object of war.”³² Reasoning that no party would gain from the destruction of cultural property, Vattel argued such destruction or expropriation was unlawful.³³ This protection complemented Vattel’s principle of moderation in warfare, especially regarding pillaging hostile territory. “All damage done to the enemy unnecessarily, every act of hostility which does not tend to procure victory and bring the war to a conclusion, is licentiousness condemned by the laws of nature.”³⁴ Drawing on Cicero and Polybius, influential Dutch jurist Hugo Grotius similarly argued for protecting cultural property under the laws of war. “Porticos, Temples, statues, and all other elegant works and monuments of art” are “of such a nature, as to contribute, no way, to the support and prolongation of war.”³⁵ As a result, Grotius thought belligerents ought to exercise moderation in their treatment of enemy civilian property generally and cultural property in particular.³⁶\nRegardless, it would take the arrival of industrialized warfare to transform legal theory into legal agreements. The nineteenth century saw further refinement of the laws of war and its provisions concerning cultural property. The 1863 Lieber Code, a set of instructions issued to Union soldiers during the American Civil War, provided that “[c]lassical works of art, libraries, scientific collections, or precious instruments, such as astronomical telescopes, as well as hospitals, must be secured against all avoidable injury, even when they are contained in fortified places whilst besieged or bombarded.”³⁷ But the Lieber Code’s protection for such cultural property was limited at best; it also allowed for the seizure of cultural property by an invading or occupying force if it could remove cultural property without injury, with the determination of ownership left to the final peace conference.³⁸ Although it was not intended as a legal agreement, the Lieber Code nevertheless had an immense influence on the development of the laws\n32.

Article 56 of the 1907 Hague Convention states that, during an occupation, “[t]he property of municipalities, that of institutions dedicated to religion, charity and education, the arts and sciences, even when State property, shall be treated as private property.”⁴³ The treaty further mandates that “[a]ll seizure of, destruction or wilful [sic] damage done to institutions of this character, historic monuments, works of art and science, is forbidden, and should be made the subject of legal proceedings.”⁴⁴ Article 27 also requires that “all necessary steps must be taken to spare, as far as possible, buildings dedicated to religion, art, science, or charitable purposes, [and] historic monuments” and states that belligerents have a duty to clearly demarcate protected buildings or property.⁴⁵ However, the 1907 treaty proved ineffective at protecting cultural property during the Second World War, as Axis forces blatantly disregarded it.⁴⁶ The extensive looting of cultural\n39.

Hague Convention, Additional Protocols, and the Evolution of Cultural Property Protections\nThe 1954 Hague Convention is a core treaty shielding cultural property in armed conflicts. It aims to prevent “damage to cultural property belonging to any people whatsoever…since each people makes its contribution to the culture of the world.”⁴⁸ The 1954 Convention, faced with “the developments in the technique of warfare” which exacerbated the dangers posed to cultural property, built on the 1907 framework by requiring states to secure cultural property during peacetime and prohibiting the destruction of cultural heritage witnessed in World War II.⁴⁹ The treaty defines cultural property as “movable or immovable property of great importance to the cultural heritage of every people.”⁵⁰ This includes,\nof Militarism in Postwar Japan, 33 JAPAN REV. 195. 195 (2019). However, the Nazi’s systematic campaign of looting and eradicating important cultural works was so extensive it resulted in charges at the Nuremberg Tribunal and led Allied forces to establish the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives Program (also referred to as the “Monuments Men”) to safeguard plundered cultural works.

The 1954 Hague Convention’s approach is highly internationalist in that it frames cultural property as being of great significance to humanity regardless of location or national jurisdiction. See John Merryman, Two Ways of Thinking About Cultural Property, 80 AM. J. INT’L L. 831, 836 (1986). The Convention’s preamble states “that damage to cultural property belonging to any people whatsoever means damage to the cultural heritage of all mankind, since each people makes its contribution to the culture of the world.” Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict pmbl., May 14, 1954, S.

As a result, the Convention protects the cultural property “of each respective people” rather than property “of all peoples jointly,” an interpretation which the parties’ implementation reports support. ROGER O’KEEFE, THE PROTECTION OF CULTURAL PROPERTY IN ARMED CONFLICT 104–05 (2006). This interpretation is significant as it expands the scope of the treaty beyond cultural property of global significance and protects each people’s distinct cultural heritage.\n49. 1954 Hague Convention, supra note 48, at pmbl.

The party in whose territory the property is situated determines its cultural importance, and thus whether it is legally protected—a determination which parties must make in good faith.53 Absent notice to opposing parties under Articles 3 and 6 of the Hague Convention—notice that is left up to the parties' discretion—belligerents must hazard an educated guess, weighed down with caution, as to any item's cultural importance.54 Belligerents must then \"respect cultural property\" by refraining from conduct that would expose it to destruction or damage and further have a duty to protect cultural property from vandalism, theft, or\n51.

While the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) successfully led several prosecutions for the destruction of cultural property,63 recent terrorist attacks have destroyed similarly irreplaceable works of cultural property. In 2001, the Taliban destroyed the Bamiyan Buddhas, 1,500-year-old statues over 100 feet tall—which were then the largest in the world.64 The looting of the National Museum of Iraq in the wake of Operation Iraqi Freedom was another shameful chapter, and stolen artifacts continue to flood illicit antiquities markets fifteen years later.65 Pointing to these contemptible episodes, some scholars have criticized the 1954 Hague Convention as ineffective at preventing the loss of these cultural treasures, even as the 1954 Convention's Second Additional Protocol clearly extended its protections to non-state actors.66 The Hague Convention, Additional Protocol II, and the 1970 World Heritage Convention have concededly not protected every piece of cultural property, but surely they have saved some.67 Yet, because of these treaties, not only does the destruction of cultural property often yield widespread international\n61.

Yet, cyberspace is also a means through which state and non-state actors can accomplish their goals. Cyberwarfare consists of using digital means to accomplish political objectives in an armed conflict and occurs in the same virtual environment that houses culturally significant data.¹⁰⁵ One often-cited example is the Stuxnet computer worm, which the United States and Israel used to damage Iranian uranium centrifuges by altering the centrifuges' rotational frequencies through an exploit in Windows and Siemens software.¹⁰⁶ Because digital and digitized cultural property is often stored on devices connected to cyberspace, it is vulnerable to both cyberattacks and conventional attacks.\nProtections for real-world cultural property from cyber-attacks are fairly straightforward. The 1907 Hague Regulations and the 1954 Hague Convention apply regardless of a parties' method of warfare.¹⁰⁷ Thus, it would be just as unlawful to use a cyberattack to cause a gas leak at an enemy's historic museum, thereby causing a fire to damage art, artifacts, and the building itself, as it would be to attack the museum with a cruise missile.

As mentioned previously, international law has no objective test for what is or is not protected as cultural property. See O’Keefe, supra note 48, at 110–11 (“[W]hile in principle the Convention leaves it to the Party in whose territory the relevant property is situated to determine whether or not that property is of great importance to its cultural heritage and is therefore protected by the Convention,” the practical effect of this is that “the opposing Party must hazard an assessment as to the cultural importance of the property in question to the territorial Party.”); see also 1954 Hague Convention, supra note 48 (broadly defining the scope of cultural property protected under the Convention without referencing an objective test). As a result, in cyberspace, belligerents must weigh the importance of targets and determine, reasonably and in compliance with the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, whether the target is legal.\n123. What amounts to an “attack” in cyberspace under international law is a fraught question beyond the scope of this paper. Regarding jus ad bellum, the key question is whether a cyberattack can amount to a “use of force” prohibited by Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter. U.N. Charter art. 2, ¶ 4. One common answer is to look at the effects of a cyber operation and determine whether it meets that threshold. See Matthew Waxman, *Cyber Attacks as “Force” Under UN Charter Article 2(4)*, 87 INT’L L. STUD. 43, 45–48 (2011) (stating that a cyber-attack that is sufficiently coercive might amount to a use of force, or that interference in another state’s internal matters might cross that threshold, and that the United States’ position tended towards an effects-based test); see also TALLINN MANUAL 2.0., supra note 4, at 330 (“A cyber operation constitutes a use of force when its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force”); Jeremy Wright, *Att’y Gen. of the U.K., Cyber and International Law in the 21st Century* (May 23, 2018) [check R17.2 on public speeches and addresses] (May 3, 2018), https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/cyber-and-international-law-in-the-21st-century (on file with the *Columbia Human Rights Law Review*) (“If a hostile state interferes with the operation of one of our nuclear reactors, resulting in widespread loss of life, the fact that the act is carried out by way of a cyber operation does not prevent it from being viewed as an unlawful use of force or an armed attack against us.”).\nHowever, the threshold for what constitutes a use of force is fluid and heavily influenced by state practice. Schmitt, *The Law of Cyber Warfare*, supra note 10 (“Over time, the reaction of states to cyber operations, as well as how they characterize their own cyber operations, will inform the process of interpretive maturation.”) It is unclear whether data deletion of non-culturally significant data would amount to a use of force.

Interpreting International Law to Protect Cultural Property in Cyberspace\n## A. Digital and Digitized Cultural Property as Archives\nA new interpretation of international law is the most effective way to extend international law to cyberspace. Because belligerents are reluctant to acknowledge their actions in cyberspace—indeed, ostensible anonymity and difficulty attributing cyber operations to a state or non-state actor is part of the appeal of cyber operations—it is unlikely that customary international law will bring order to the cyber arena.¹³⁶ The ossification of customary international law requires open state practice driven by a sense of international obligation. This is unlikely to occur in cyberwarfare where states engage in highly classified cyber operations in relative anonymity.¹³⁷ Furthermore, without grievous cyberattacks affecting large numbers of states equally, international political will would likely be insufficient to produce a new treaty to regulate armed conflict in cyberspace, let alone clarify digital cultural property’s status in international humanitarian law. As a result, interpretations of existing legal instruments and principles will likely define the evolution of international law in cyberspace.¹³⁸ These interpretations may come through formal statements by states as to their legal position or their armed forces’ manuals on the laws of war.¹³⁹ Additionally, “[o]ver time, the reaction of states to cyber operations, as well as how they characterize their own cyber operations, will inform the process of interpretive maturation.”¹⁴⁰\n135. *Id.*; see also Eliza Chapman, *Should Data Be Considered Critical Infrastructure?*, AUSTL.

An archive, \"a repository or collection especially of information,\" 142 is a particularly apt description of digital information, which is normally stored either on a device's local hard drive or a server connected to the internet. While a 3D scan of a historic monument is not a historic monument itself, it is a reproduction of an important monument of architecture that is filed away alongside other 3D scans, like books on a shelf. Likewise, archived born-digital cultural property ought to be protected as \"moveable or immovable property of great importance to the cultural heritage of every people . . .\" 143 The fact that digital cultural property exists to preserve cultural heritage, maintain cultural integrity, and provide access to societal memory only strengthens arguments for its protection, since a society implicitly preserves what it values. 144 This is not to say that every scrap of data ought to fall within the ambit of cultural property in IHL. However, data of sufficient cultural, scientific, or religious import, or which when aggregated take on sufficient importance, surely fall within the scope of the 1954 Hague Convention and customary international law. Born-digital cultural property is especially worthy of protection 145 since, unlike digitized cultural property, there is no physical backup if it is altered or destroyed.\n141.

Libraries and archives form the center of a society's collective memory: \"[t]he loss of archives is as serious as the loss of memory in a human being.\"¹⁴⁷ \"By their very nature archives are unique both as individual documents and as documents in context. Lost Archives are irreplaceable, any loss is final, reconstruction is impossible.\"¹⁴⁸ Likewise, though galleries, libraries, archives, and museums (\"GLAMs,\" which are sometimes also referred to as Cultural Heritage Institutions (\"CHIs\")) do not always hold unique documents, they are irreplaceable centers of cultural heritage and meaning, with this being especially true of national libraries.¹⁴⁹ Archives are \"a basic part of the cultural property of States\" and are \"universally recognized as an essential part of the heritage of every national community.\"¹⁵⁰ As a result, large collections of documents warrant substantial protection under IHL, subject to limited exceptions for military necessity.¹⁵¹ These protections should extend to digital and digitized cultural\n146.

Libraries, archives, and records, unlike other forms of cultural property, such as historic monuments, can be significant to military or intelligence operations. Generally speaking, belligerents have a right to seize documents during hostilities or occupation with some nexus to the conflict or some level of military importance. See 1907 Hague Convention, supra note 43, at art. 53 (\"An occupying army may generally take \"all movable property belonging to the State which may be used for military operations.\"); id. at art. 23(g) (noting that during hostilities, \"it is especially forbidden . . .

Belligerents’ Obligations Towards Digital and Digitized Cultural Property\nAlthough digital cultural property should fall within the scope of the law of armed conflict, novel characteristics of the cyber domain alter what obligations belligerents have towards cultural property. In the current international legal regime, states have the following core obligations to cultural property: 1) states are prohibited from targeting cultural property or directing “acts of hostility [towards it]”;¹⁷⁴ 2) states are prohibited from using cultural property in a way that would imperil it; 3) states are prohibited from plundering or looting cultural property or from making reprisals against it; and 4) states are obliged to stop the theft, pillage, misappropriation, and vandalism of cultural property.¹⁷⁵ These obligations, rooted in the 1954 Hague Convention and customary international law, are core protections for cultural property and heritage.¹⁷⁶\n167.

For example, Wikipedia has over six million articles in English,¹⁷⁷ articles in over 314 languages,¹⁷⁸ and, with two billion unique visitors per month,¹⁷⁹ is the thirteenth most-visited website in the world.¹⁸⁰ Wikipedia’s fifty-two million pages, along with its complete edit history, amounted to ten uncompressed terabytes in 2015, and Wikimedia Commons, which hosts all the media files on Wikipedia, totaled over twenty-three terabytes as of 2014.¹⁸¹ As the largest encyclopedia ever created,¹⁸² Wikipedia surely falls into the category of an archive under the 1954 Hague Convention and the 1907 Hague Regulations, as it is dedicated to “science, or charitable purposes.”¹⁸³ However, by its very nature, Wikipedia is constantly changing and growing, making destruction or vandalism by a state difficult to define. Wikipedia, like many online spaces, is a collaborative exchange between users. Acts of vandalism and the occasional deletion of articles by Wikipedia editors are not uncommon on the site.

Perhaps more humorously, in 2006 American comedian Stephen Colbert attempted to assist the endangered African elephant by encouraging his viewers to change the African elephant’s Wikipedia page to show elephant populations were skyrocketing. Similarly, in 2007,\nCOLUMBIA HUMAN RIGHTS LAW REVIEW\n[53.1\nsinisterly, the BBC reported in 2019 on how the People's Republic of China was encouraging its citizens to edit Wikipedia entries on several sensitive topics, to \"reflect our voices and opinions in the entry, so as to objectively and truly reflect the influence of Chinese path and Chinese thoughts on other countries and history.\" 185 Approximately 1,600 edits were made to Wikipedia pages for Hong Kong, Taiwan, the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, and nineteen other politically sensitive articles, although no coordinated cyber operation was uncovered.186\nOne way to determine when state activity in cyberspace impermissibly disrupts cultural property is a sliding scale analysis: how much of an effect does the military operation have on the digital cultural property? A group of soldiers stealing, defacing, or destroying one book or document from an archive likely has a de minimis effect on the entirety of the archive. Similarly, a proper analysis might be to what degree a cyber operation affects the entirety of a cultural data set. North Korea might decide to selectively edit the Wikipedia page of Kim Jong-un as part of an information operation, but that would be far less damaging than a broad cyber operation defacing or deleting large quantities of Wikipedia, or any other interactive cultural data set. It would be important to consider the ease of repair as well. For instance, digitized cultural data might be the sole remnant of lost cultural property, and thus critical for reconstruction, similar to how eighteen century art was essential to reconstructing Warsaw's Old Town after World War II.187 In the twenty-first century, cultural heritage experts are repairing the damage done by ISIS by using crowdsourced images of Mosul and historic sites in the Levant to 3D print lost artifacts and reproduce destroyed urban environments in virtual reality.188 Respect for these 3D prints and images during warfare is critical, as they are the last remnants of now-destroyed cultural property.\nStates' other obligations towards cultural property translate well into cyberspace.

For instance, a distributed denial of service (“DDOS”) attack, one of the most common forms of cyberattacks which takes down a network by flooding it with requests, on digital or digitized cultural property, would not necessarily violate international law.¹⁹¹\nHowever, a DDOS attack might be considered an “act of hostility” within the meaning of the Additional Protocols to the Geneva Convention IV.¹⁹² Additional Protocol II does not protect archives or libraries, but instead protects “historic monuments, works of art, or places of worship which constitute the cultural or spiritual heritage of peoples.”¹⁹³ At the same time, the ICRC interprets the Additional Protocols to incorporate the 1954 Hague Convention’s definition of cultural heritage and property, which would extend protections for cultural property despite the Additional Protocols’ text not mentioning archives.¹⁹⁴ According to the ICRC, an “act of hostility” need not have a substantive effect on the cultural property itself, so long as it is “directed against” the cultural property.¹⁹⁵ Indeed, if a DDOS attack qualifies as an “act of hostility,” then Additional Protocols I and II and the 1954 Hague Convention would prohibit it.¹⁹⁶ Thus, it is conceivable that IHL would prohibit a DDOS attack on digital cultural property.¹⁹⁷\n189. 1954 Hague Convention, supra note 48, at arts. 3, 7.\n190.

See Additional Protocol I, supra note 57, at art. 53. For example, if a belligerent decided to launch a DDOS attack on the Internet Archive—an American non-profit digital library with the mission of providing “Universal Access to All Knowledge,” then under the ICRC’s interpretation of Additional Protocols I and II—that attack may amount to an act of hostility and thus a violation of international law. See About the Internet Archive, supra note 89.\n282 COLUMBIA HUMAN RIGHTS LAW REVIEW [53.1\nAnother major issue in international legal obligations comes from how data challenges the territoriality of the 1954 Hague Convention.¹⁹⁸ While territorial location does not affect customary international legal obligation to refrain from damaging cultural property during armed conflict,¹⁹⁹ the Convention requires parties to “undertake to prepare in time of peace for the safeguarding of cultural property situated within their own territory against the foreseeable effects of an armed conflict . . .”²⁰⁰ Articles 12 and 13 of the Convention outline specific provisions for the safety of cultural property during transport.²⁰¹ However, data, unlike physical cultural property, rapidly crosses international boundaries along pre-determined paths and is often highly divisible.²⁰² A reasonable interpretation of states’ peacetime obligation might include replicating cultural data that resides in their territory for a substantial time or replicating cultural property of particular importance to the state’s own culture.\nThis shift in established notions of territoriality has additional implications. Traditionally, states would claim ownership over real-world cultural property within their borders. For example, the Taj Mahal is a UNESCO World Heritage Site²⁰³ that has special cultural importance to India, where it is located. Most nations seek to control their cultural property in the interest of its “retention, preservation, study, enjoyment, and exploitation.”²⁰⁴ This may be the case for digital cultural property as well,²⁰⁵ but others might be content with storing digital cultural property on a server in another country. International law’s focus on cultural internationalism simplifies this issue.²⁰⁶ Insofar as cultural property is the “cultural heritage of all mankind,”²⁰⁷ a state must protect digital cultural property within its territory regardless of its cultural origin. Museums across the world already do this; for example, the MET Digital Collection features scans of masks from\n198.

Protections for Replicas of Cultural Property in Cyberspace: Addressing Counter-Arguments\nA common question scholars pose is how digital technologies affect the authenticity of art.²¹¹ German philosopher Walter Benjamin argued that each work of art possesses a unique “aura” which mechanical reproduction erases, and thus, reproduction destroys the work’s authenticity.²¹² This is undeniably a motivation for protecting real-world cultural property and it is why reproductions often fail to stand in for stolen cultural property.²¹³ Humanity yearns for cultural objects because they are true and certain and possess some kind of uniqueness.²¹⁴ In addition to serving as surrogates,\n208.

Photographs, according to Roland Barthes, radiate an aura, a distance, reference to a past and memory.”²¹⁶ However, authenticity is not the only reason why cultural property is considered worth preserving. Cultural property contains a society’s memories, brings substantial economic benefits through the antiquities trade or tourism, fosters a sense of community and identity, and by extension, has political value.²¹⁷ This is to say nothing of the value digitized reproductions have as a means of preservation and access, or how societies are capable of creating complex emotional relationships with replicas.²¹⁸\nThe strongest argument against interpreting LOAC to protect digital and digitized cultural property is that data is easily reproducible and disseminated, making its destruction exceedingly difficult and legal protections unnecessary. The Tallinn Manual 2.0, an influential academic publication outlining international law in cyberspace, incorporates this point; it argues that belligerents “must respect and protect cultural property that may be affected by cyber operations or that is located in cyberspace.”²¹⁹ However, the Manual continues, “[p]rotection only applies to digital copies or versions where the original is either inaccessible or has been destroyed,\n215.

First, the fact that cultural property may be lodged on a hard drive somewhere else in the world does not mean that it is or will be. Even accepting the replication argument as valid fails to recognize the peacetime duty to preserve and protect cultural property, which is recognized under the Hague Convention.²²² Digital cultural property is easily duplicated and stored, but this does not eliminate the need for a legal duty to duplicate and store digital cultural property. There are numerous examples of digital cultural works being lost or nearly lost because of a failure to maintain proper backups.²²³ Even the existence of a backup is no guarantee if the data storage is centralized, as a conventional attack on a data center could destroy all existing copies of a culturally significant file.²²⁴ Such a conventional attack is not unlikely, as military and civilian internet infrastructure are largely\n220.

The intricacies of domestic IP laws cut against any presumption that digital cultural property, wherever located, will have backups, and thus counsels in favor of protecting digital cultural property in the event of an armed conflict.\n## 1. Copyright Law and the Problems It Presents for Digital Cultural Heritage\nCurrent cultural property law regimes impede the replication of digital cultural property. For instance, most digital cultural property is available in encrypted formats, which ties the digital goods to a specific account to prevent duplication; as a result, cultural heritage institutions are capable of licensing these digital goods, but they are unable to create archival copies until the expiration of the copyright.²³⁸ The Digital Millennium Copyright Act makes circumventing these technical measures against duplication a federal crime punishable by up to five years in prison.²³⁹ As a result, GLAMs must often wait ninety-five years after a work’s publication—or seventy years after the death of the author—to produce an archival copy,²⁴⁰ by which point the cultural property will likely have been lost to technological obsolescence, degraded hard drives, human error, or malicious attacks.²⁴¹ According to the Library of Congress, this has happened before.

For example, the Berne Convention and the WIPO Copyright Treaty merely allow for states to permit reproduction “[p]rovided that such reproduction does not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work and does not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the author.”²⁵⁰ This labyrinth of copyright law makes it legally dubious to rely on random reproductions to protect digital and digitized cultural property.\nFinally, the rise in non-fungible tokens (“NFTs”) have made certain copies of digital art unique, and thus irreproducible, through blockchain technology.²⁵¹ NFTs thus make digital goods artificially scarce, causing a boom in digital art while also making some digital cultural property completely unique.

NFTs offer an opportunity to authenticate certain works of digital cultural property and accord them protection under LOAC, while rendering non-NFT copies lawful targets.

How to Protect Digital Cultural Property in Practice\nThe question remains of how to ensure the Hague Convention and its Additional Protocols, as well as the Geneva Convention and its Additional Protocols, carry weight. One idea might be technical solutions. Articles 16 and 17 of the 1954 Hague Convention establish a distinctive marking to identify physical cultural property and to provide notice to all parties of the property's protected status.²⁵⁹ This could easily be adapted into a number of technical solutions, including file naming conventions and coding schemes to tag cultural data.²⁶⁰ Militaries have already developed no-strike lists for culturally significant sites, which prevented the destruction of ancient monuments by Coalition Forces during the First Gulf War and the 2011 Libya Intervention.²⁶¹ Such no-strike lists might extend to certain servers, data centers, or IP addresses housing culturally significant data. Additionally, a published register of IP addresses, analogous to already-extant national or international registers of cultural property, would help provide notice and further remove cultural property from hostilities in cyberspace.²⁶² By segregating the civilian internet from the locus of military operations, states can better preserve digital cultural property in an armed conflict. At a minimum, states ought to ensure digital cultural data is preserved through at least some basic cybersecurity provisions as a means of fulfilling their peacetime obligations under Article 3 of the 1954 Hague Convention.²⁶³\nInternational collaboration is also key to preserving digital cultural property.

This protection is particularly valuable, given the lack of an international effort to expand cultural heritage protections in the law of armed conflict.

He spent his life as the Chief of Antiquities at the historic site of Palmyra in Syria, his hometown, where he protected one of the world's best-preserved archaeological sites—until ISIS seized his home and took him hostage.¹ After a month of torture, the terrorist group publicly beheaded Khaled al-Asaad for refusing to reveal the location of hidden antiquities.² Khaled al-Assad's sacrifice demonstrates the importance of cultural property to humanity: it is not only a record of humanity, but a fundamental pillar supporting it. Cultural property is so indispensable and so invaluable to humankind that the law must shield it from the bombs and bloodshed of war, just as Khaled al-Assad did. Yet, one hundred years from now, the artifacts worth dying for will not only be physical but also digital, made of code rather than stone or steel.³ This Note aims to address the fundamental question of how humanity will protect this new form of cultural property during armed conflicts.\nThere is widespread consensus that the law of armed conflict (\"LOAC\") applies to state and non-state actors in cyberspace, but there is far less consensus as to exactly how it applies.⁴ The application of settled principles of LOAC to cyber operations is a difficult one, as the cyber domain lacks the physical characteristics which have always marked battlefields.⁵ This has resulted in a great deal of literature discussing how the principles of proportionality,⁶ distinction,⁷ attribution,⁸ and neutrality⁹ can exist in cyberspace. The current intricacies of global politics have also complicated matters, as norms and interpretations of international law in cyberspace are continuously evolving to match shifting political and technical realities.¹⁰ This interpretive uncertainty has raised the question of how protection for cultural property under LOAC, a longstanding goal of international law, can extend to cyberspace.\nCultural property is protected under both treaty-based and customary international law.

This paper then contends that digital and digitized cultural property should be categorized as archives and ¹⁵. The specialized terminology surrounding this topic deserves clarification. It is worth clarifying the terms\"cultural property\"and\"cultural heritage.\"The two terms are almost always used interchangeably in international treaties and scholarship. While cultural property is an older term, it has largely been superseded by cultural heritage, which is conceptually oriented around preservation for future generations rather than the rights and powers of the possessor. The term cultural heritage also encompasses practices that do not fall within any definition of tangible or intangible cultural heritage, making it a broader category than cultural property, although the terms are often synonymous. For example, the Great Wall of China is cultural property that forms part of China's cultural heritage. Yet the practice of Chinese calligraphy, an intangible cultural tradition, is not cultural property despite being part of China's cultural heritage. However, unlike cultural heritage, cultural property has a clear legal meaning, defined in the 1954 Hague Convention and 1970 UNESCO Convention. See Lyndel Prott &amp; Patrick O'Keefe, 'Cultural Heritage' or 'Cultural Property'?, 1 INT'L J. CULTURAL PROPERTY 307, 309 (1992); Manlio Frigo, Cultural Property v.

Q. 61, 65(2000).\nDigitized cultural property is cultural property that has been copied or converted into digital format, yet which came from a real-world copy. Common examples of digitized cultural property include scanned books, audio recordings of music or culturally significant stories, and 3D renderings of monuments and artifacts.\nDigital cultural property is cultural property that has no original physical or real-world copy. Common examples of digital cultural property include digital artwork, blogs, vlogs, webcomics, e-books, certain audio recordings that are only digital downloads, some television shows and films, some journalism, and any other content that exists solely in digital form. The line between digital and digitized cultural property is not always clear. Take JSTOR, which is a digital repository for academic research similar to SSRN or PubMed. JSTOR hosts 12 million academic journal articles, books, and primary sources, yet only some lack any original physical version.

International humanitarian law (\"IHL\") is\"broadly speaking, that branch of public international law that seeks to moderate the conduct of armed conflict and to mitigate the suffering that it causes.\"Amanda Alexander, A Short History of International Humanitarian Law, 26 EUR. J. INT'L L. 109, 111 (2015). IHL, which is synonymous with the law of armed conflict, encompasses treaties on the rules of war, ius in bello, as well as international norms that have ossified into binding customary international law. Id.\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage begins by exploring the history of protections for cultural property and heritage in times of war, with particular emphasis on the reasons for such protections. Part II discusses the development of digital and digitized cultural property and current threats to digital cultural heritage. Part III proposes a novel interpretation of digital and digitized cultural property as historically significant archives or documents and addresses what obligations belligerents ought to have towards cultural property in cyberspace.\n## I. Place of Cultural Property in the Law of Armed Conflict ### A. Development of Protections for Cultural Property With some exceptions, the wanton destruction of cultural property and heritage in ancient and medieval warfare was commonplace, governed by the maxim “to the victor go the spoils.”²⁰ Athenian historian Xenophon wrote, “It is an eternal law the wide world over, that when a city is taken in war, the citizens, their persons, and all their property fall into the hands of the conquerors.”²¹ The Roman Triumph prominently featured stolen art from defeated enemies,²² the Bible repeatedly references the plundering of art and treasures as spoils of war,²³ and when the Mongols sacked Baghdad in 1258 and destroyed the city’s great libraries, they threw so many books especially in cyber space. David Wallace &amp; Christopher Jacobs, *Conflict Classification and Cyber Operations: Gaps, Ambiguities and Fault Lines*, 40 U. PA. J. INT’L L. 643, 652 (2019); Michael Schmitt &amp; Sean Watts, *Beyond State-Centrism: International Law and Non-State Actors in Cyberspace*, 21 J. CONFLICT SEC. L. 595, 611 (2016) (“In many respects, the state-centric legal regime of public international law may seem ill-suited or even inadequate to address the challenges the super-empowered non-state actors of cyberspace present”). However, because state actors possess the most substantial capabilities in cyberspace and because IHL speaks with greater clarity on international armed conflicts, this paper focuses on international armed conflicts.\n²⁰. Or, as more eloquently phrased by Thucydides, “right, as the world goes, is only in question between equals in power, while the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must.” THUCYDIDES, *HISTORY OF THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 566–67* (Richard Crawley trans., *Floating Press* 2008) (Fourth century BCE).\n²¹. XENOPHON, CYROPAEDIA, at book VII, ch. 5, l. 73 (F.M. Stawell ed., Henry Graham Dakyns trans., *Project Gutenberg* 2009) (370 BCE) (ebook).\n²². MARY BEARD, *THE ROMAN TRIUMPH 159* (2009).\n²³. Jeremiah 15:13 (King James) (“Thy substance and thy treasures will I give to the spoil without price, and that for all thy sins, even in all thy borders.”); 2 Chronicles 14:13-14 (“And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto Gerar... and they carried away very much spoil. And they smote all the cities round about Gerar... and they spoiled all the cities; for there was exceeding much spoil in them.”); see also Deuteronomy 20:10 (elaborating the practices of war and articulating divine endorsement of expropriating cultural property).\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage Yet some ancient thinkers and commanders took steps to exempt art, architecture, and houses of worship from the rampant destruction of civilian property. Greek historian Polybius wrote that while the destruction or taking of civilian property\"are necessary acts according to the laws and rights of war; to deface temples, statues, and such like erections in pure wantonness... must be regarded as an act of blind passion and insanity.\"²⁷ Cicero later used this line of reasoning to prosecute Gaius Verres in 70 BCE for expropriating artworks from temples and citizens during his governorship of Sicily.²⁸ To mitigate the damage of war to spiritual institutions, Frederick Barbarossa issued an edict in 1158 forbidding the pillaging of churches, although the ransacking of houses of worship remained ubiquitous in medieval warfare.²⁹ The Quran likewise prohibits fighting in sacred places, such as mosques and other houses of worship.³⁰ The Enlightenment marked a substantial shift in the treatment of cultural property and heritage in international legal thought.³¹ French jurist Emer de Vattel wrote that destroying cultural property renders a belligerent an enemy to all mankind and that “the wanton destruction of public monuments, temples, tombs, statues, paintings, &amp;c. [sic] is absolutely condemned, even by the voluntary law of nations, as never being conducive to the lawful object of war.”³² Reasoning that no party would gain from the destruction of cultural property, Vattel argued such destruction or expropriation was unlawful.³³ This protection complemented Vattel’s principle of moderation in warfare, especially regarding pillaging hostile territory. “All damage done to the enemy unnecessarily, every act of hostility which does not tend to procure victory and bring the war to a conclusion, is licentiousness condemned by the laws of nature.”³⁴ Drawing on Cicero and Polybius, influential Dutch jurist Hugo Grotius similarly argued for protecting cultural property under the laws of war. “Porticos, Temples, statues, and all other elegant works and monuments of art” are “of such a nature, as to contribute, no way, to the support and prolongation of war.”³⁵ As a result, Grotius thought belligerents ought to exercise moderation in their treatment of enemy civilian property generally and cultural property in particular.³⁶ Regardless, it would take the arrival of industrialized warfare to transform legal theory into legal agreements. The nineteenth century saw further refinement of the laws of war and its provisions concerning cultural property. The 1863 Lieber Code, a set of instructions issued to Union soldiers during the American Civil War, provided that “[c]lassical works of art, libraries, scientific collections, or precious instruments, such as astronomical telescopes, as well as hospitals, must be secured against all avoidable injury, even when they are contained in fortified places whilst besieged or bombarded.”³⁷ But the Lieber Code’s protection for such cultural property was limited at best; it also allowed for the seizure of cultural property by an invading or occupying force if it could remove cultural property without injury, with the determination of ownership left to the final peace conference.³⁸ Although it was not intended as a legal agreement, the Lieber Code nevertheless had an immense influence on the development of the laws\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\nBy the twentieth century, foundational international treaties on the laws of war began to give greater force to protections for cultural property. Article 56 of the 1907 Hague Convention states that, during an occupation, “[t]he property of municipalities, that of institutions dedicated to religion, charity and education, the arts and sciences, even when State property, shall be treated as private property.”⁴³ The treaty further mandates that “[a]ll seizure of, destruction or wilful [sic] damage done to institutions of this character, historic monuments, works of art and science, is forbidden, and should be made the subject of legal proceedings.”⁴⁴ Article 27 also requires that “all necessary steps must be taken to spare, as far as possible, buildings dedicated to religion, art, science, or charitable purposes, [and] historic monuments” and states that belligerents have a duty to clearly demarcate protected buildings or property.⁴⁵ However, the 1907 treaty proved ineffective at protecting cultural property during the Second World War, as Axis forces blatantly disregarded it.⁴⁶ The extensive looting of cultural treasures by the Nazi regime led to the creation of the 1954 Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict (“1954 Hague Convention”).⁴⁷ ## B. Hague Convention, Additional Protocols, and the Evolution of Cultural Property Protections The 1954 Hague Convention is a core treaty shielding cultural property in armed conflicts. It aims to prevent “damage to cultural property belonging to any people whatsoever…since each people makes its contribution to the culture of the world.”⁴⁸ The 1954 Convention, faced with “the developments in the technique of warfare” which exacerbated the dangers posed to cultural property, built on the 1907 framework by requiring states to secure cultural property during peacetime and prohibiting the destruction of cultural heritage witnessed in World War II.⁴⁹ The treaty defines cultural property as “movable or immovable property of great importance to the cultural heritage of every people.”⁵⁰ This includes, of Militarism in Postwar Japan, 33 JAPAN REV. 195. 195 (2019). However, the Nazi’s systematic campaign of looting and eradicating important cultural works was so extensive it resulted in charges at the Nuremberg Tribunal and led Allied forces to establish the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives Program (also referred to as the “Monuments Men”) to safeguard plundered cultural works. Sanja Zgonjanin, The Prosecution of War Crimes for the Destruction of Libraries and Archives During Times of Armed Conflict, 40 LIBR. &amp; CULTURE 128, 133–35 (2005); see generally ROBERT EDSEL &amp; BRETT WITTER, THE MONUMENTS MEN: ALLIED HEROES, NAZI THIEVES, AND THE GREATEST TREASURE HUNT IN HISTORY (2009).\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\nThe Convention clearly defines the scope of its protection, but there is no objective test for determining which monuments, buildings, or manuscripts IHL protects. The party in whose territory the property is situated determines its cultural importance, and thus whether it is legally protected—a determination which parties must make in good faith.53 Absent notice to opposing parties under Articles 3 and 6 of the Hague Convention—notice that is left up to the parties' discretion—belligerents must hazard an educated guess, weighed down with caution, as to any item's cultural importance.54 Belligerents must then\"respect cultural property\"by refraining from conduct that would expose it to destruction or damage and further have a duty to protect cultural property from vandalism, theft, or The other commonly used definition of cultural property in international law comes from the Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property of 1970, often referred to as the UNESCO Convention. That treaty defines cultural property with greater specificity and more expansively than the 1954 Convention, and, like the 1954 Convention, defers to parties' respective views of cultural importance. See Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property, art. 1, Nov. 14 1970, 823 U.N.T.S. 231, http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=130 39&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html [https://perma.cc/D53M-BHZK].\n\n[53.1 misappropriation.⁵⁵ Likewise, belligerents are forbidden from directing reprisals toward cultural property and from requisitioning it.⁵⁶ The adoption of Additional Protocols I and II to the 1949 Geneva Conventions in 1977 bolstered the 1954 Hague Convention and provided additional protections for cultural heritage.⁵⁷ In both international and non-international armed conflicts, these protocols prohibit “acts of hostility directed against the historic monuments, works of art or places of worship which constitute the cultural or spiritual heritage of peoples.”⁵⁸ The Additional Protocols to the Geneva Convention refer to objects which “constitute the cultural or spiritual heritage of peoples.” This is different than the Hague Convention’s protections for property which apply when an object is “of great importance to the cultural heritage.” However, the International Committee of the Red Cross (“ICRC”) has clarified that “the basic idea is the same.” The Additional Protocols cover “objects whose value transcends geographical boundaries, and which are unique in character and are intimately associated with the history and culture of a people.”⁵⁹ In addition to the aforementioned treaties, customary international law also protects cultural property. The International Committee of the Red Cross lists respect for cultural property during armed conflict as part of customary international law.⁶⁰ Belligerents are prohibited from using cultural property for military purposes except when required by military\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\nThe current regime for protecting cultural property in war has had mixed success. While the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) successfully led several prosecutions for the destruction of cultural property,63 recent terrorist attacks have destroyed similarly irreplaceable works of cultural property. In 2001, the Taliban destroyed the Bamiyan Buddhas, 1,500-year-old statues over 100 feet tall—which were then the largest in the world.64 The looting of the National Museum of Iraq in the wake of Operation Iraqi Freedom was another shameful chapter, and stolen artifacts continue to flood illicit antiquities markets fifteen years later.65 Pointing to these contemptible episodes, some scholars have criticized the 1954 Hague Convention as ineffective at preventing the loss of these cultural treasures, even as the 1954 Convention's Second Additional Protocol clearly extended its protections to non-state actors.66 The Hague Convention, Additional Protocol II, and the 1970 World Heritage Convention have concededly not protected every piece of cultural property, but surely they have saved some.67 Yet, because of these treaties, not only does the destruction of cultural property often yield widespread international COLUMBIA HUMAN RIGHTS LAW REVIEW [53.1 condemnation, but international tribunals have also imposed criminal liability for attacks on cultural property. \n## II. Protecting Cultural Property in Cyberspace ## A. Defining Digital and Digitized Cultural Property ## 1. Digitized Cultural Property As with almost everything else, advances in computing, digital storage, and connectivity have revolutionized the field of cultural heritage. Owing to these recent technological advancements, digitized cultural property—whereby tangible or intangible cultural heritage is transformed into information—has exploded in recent years as a method of preserving cultural heritage, offering novel educational opportunities and increasing public access. Digitized cultural property can take several forms, such as scanned texts, audio-visual recordings of music, and 3D renderings. Take, for instance, CyArk, a non-profit established in 2003 after the Taliban's destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas to\"digitally record, archive and share the world's most significant cultural heritage...\"CyArk uses high-tech laser scanning tools to create 3D models of cultural heritage, which it then draws on to create an\"immersive virtual reality environment.\"To date,\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\nThis digitization push includes not only tangible but also intangible cultural property.78 For example, motion capture technology has allowed the digitization of traditional Japanese dances, allowing master performers to study their craft in a new way while also allowing for the archiving of cultural practices and events.79 Additionally, novel digital technologies offer a promising pathway for communities to preserve their cultural heritage, whether it be the oral narratives and song traditions of indigenous communities in Canada⁸⁰ or the collective memory and cultural knowledge of Pacific Island communities.⁸¹ These projects are inevitably converted to digital files, placed on storage devices, and often made publicly available through the internet.⁸² ## 2. Digital Cultural Property as It Exists Today Digital cultural property, while stored in the same medium as digitized cultural property, is created in a digital format and almost always remains digital.⁸³ The 2003 UNESCO Charter on the Preservation of Digital Heritage defines digital heritage as “cultural, educational, scientific and administrative resources, as well as technical, legal, medical and other kinds of information created digitally, or converted into digital form from existing analog resources.”⁸⁴ The Charter, much like the 1954 Hague Convention, states, “the disappearance of heritage in whatever form constitutes an impoverishment of the heritage of all nations” and that “[digital cultural heritage] should be protected and preserved for current and future generations.”⁸⁵ Also similar to the 1954 Hague Convention, the Charter delegates the decision of what items should and should not be protected to states.⁸⁶ Digital cultural heritage is defined by its ephemerality and its shifting format.⁸⁷ Common examples of digital cultural property include gifs,\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\nFor a good example of digital cultural heritage, take YouTube, the world's second most-visited website with two billion unique monthly users.90 Every minute, YouTube gains an additional 500 hours of content and hosts content in over eighty languages.91 Every day, YouTube gains on average four billion daily views.92 Google, YouTube's parent company, is secretive about how its storage system works; one estimate is that in 2013, Google had approximately ten exabytes of data, although it is unclear how much of that is YouTube videos.93 Google stores every video uploaded to the website in one of its twenty-three global Google data centers.94 Thus, YouTube hosts a wide range of traditional cultural property, such as COLUMBIA HUMAN RIGHTS LAW REVIEW [53.1 traditional Mongolian throat singing,95 traditional American Indian dance,96 and the Turkish Mevlevi Sema ceremony, in addition to born-digital cultural property.97 The website is similarly home to videos of substantial cultural importance to the internet as a whole.98 By virtue of its sheer size and popularity, YouTube's kaleidoscopic inventory carries substantial cultural importance. The Internet Archive, an American non-profit known for cataloging the internet through its Wayback Machine, provides a similar example.99 As of this writing, the website contains 475 billion webpages, 28 million books and texts, 14 million audio recordings, 3.5 million images, and 6 million videos, totaling over forty-five petabytes of server storage.100 ## 3. Cyberspace Today It is worth reflecting on the architecture of cyberspace and how cultural property fits into it. Cyberspace is\"[a] global domain within the information environment consisting of interdependent networks of information technology infrastructures and resident data, including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers.\"101 It is\"the sharedness of the virtual environment\"which forms the backbone of global telecommunications and media.102 The information age has produced an extraordinary amount of\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\nProtections for real-world cultural property from cyber-attacks are fairly straightforward. The 1907 Hague Regulations and the 1954 Hague Convention apply regardless of a parties' method of warfare.¹⁰⁷ Thus, it would be just as unlawful to use a cyberattack to cause a gas leak at an enemy's historic museum, thereby causing a fire to damage art, artifacts, and the building itself, as it would be to attack the museum with a cruise missile. The core principles animating the protection of cultural property persist NEUROMANCER 51 (1982) (\"Cyberspace. A consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators, in every nation, by children being taught mathematical concepts...A graphic representation of data abstracted from the banks of every computer in the human system... Lines of light ranged in the nonspace of the mind, clusters and constellations of data.\"); PETER KOLLOCK &amp; MARC A. SMITH, COMMUNITIES IN CYBERSPACE 3 (1999) (describing how cyberspace is defined by text chat, the World Wide Web, and graphical worlds, and how\"[i]n cyberspace the economies of interaction, communication, and coordination are different than when people meet face-to-face.\").\n\ndespite the changes in warfare.¹⁰⁸ However, the application of IHL to digital and digitized cultural property is more complex.\n## B. Current Protections in LOAC for Cultural Property are Insufficient As unsettled as IHL is in cyberspace, it is even more unsettled with regards to digital cultural property. Exacerbating this, states are expanding their cyber arsenals as state-launched cyber-attacks become more common.¹⁰⁹ Military units dedicated to computer network operations have risen from five units in 2000 to sixty-three in 2017, a number which is only expected to grow.¹¹⁰ Quantifying the number of cyber operations is almost as difficult as determining their legality in international law. Despite this, the Council on Foreign Relations estimates that state actors perpetrated approximately 480 cyberattacks from 2005 to 2019.¹¹¹ Cyberattacks can have disastrous consequences. Russia’s hack of SolarWinds and its government clients in March 2020—a hack so massive that its scope is still unknown¹¹²—is merely the latest demonstration of states’ ample cyber arsenals.¹¹³ Other examples are the WannaCry ransomware attack, which\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\n## 1. The Extensive Use of Cyberspace for Cultural Property\nThere are numerous reasons why a state or non-state actor might target cultural property in cyberspace. States or non-state actors might conduct such attacks in \"campaigns of ethnic cleansing, identity-bound wars and iconoclastic actions.\"¹¹⁸ State and non-state actors might make cultural property part of their war aim, attack cultural property to gain tactical benefits or as a form of costly signaling, or seize cultural property for economic reasons.¹¹⁹ In 2014, North Korea allegedly hacked the U.S. film studio Sony Pictures, destroyed large quantities of data and exposed the personal information of Sony employees and management, showing the vulnerability of cultural data in cyberspace.¹²⁰ The attack was supposedly\n\nmotivated by Sony Pictures' release of a film deeply critical of North Korea which depicted the death of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.¹²¹ This is not to say that Seth Rogan and James Franco’s 2014 film *The Interview* is of such cultural importance as to warrant protection under international law,¹²² or that the 2014 Sony hack amounted to an armed attack or use of force,¹²³ but pictures-hack-explained/ (on file with the *Columbia Human Rights Law Review*); see also Tim McCormack, *The Sony and OPM Double Whammy: International Law and Cyber Attacks*, 18 SMU Sci. &amp; Tech. L.

Schmitt, *The Law of Cyber Warfare*, supra note 10 (“Over time, the reaction of states to cyber operations, as well as how they characterize their own cyber operations, will inform the process of interpretive maturation.”) It is unclear whether data deletion of non-culturally significant data would amount to a use of force.

In the past twenty years, virtual museums have exploded, with the development of both online-only museums and digitally augmented physical museums.¹²⁴ The Vatican offers 3D virtual tours, as do the Natural History Museum and National Gallery in London, the Dutch Rijksmuseum, the French Musée d'Orsay, and the American Getty Museum.¹²⁵ The American Smithsonian Natural History Museum offers virtual tours online and the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art boasts an impressive online digital collection.¹²⁶ Online-only virtual museums—such as the WebMuseum, the Swedish Internetmuseum, and the National Digital Repository for Museums of India—offer unique access to digital materials and challenge pre-existing notions of cultural heritage institutions.¹²⁷ The advent of immersive virtual and augmented reality provides a new form of access to cultural property, but also creates “a means to produce new forms of art.”¹²⁸ For example, the Petersen Automotive Museum uses virtual reality Data as Objects Under International Humanitarian Law, 48 ISRAELI L.

Interpreting International Law to Protect Cultural Property in Cyberspace\n## A. Digital and Digitized Cultural Property as Archives\nA new interpretation of international law is the most effective way to extend international law to cyberspace. Because belligerents are reluctant to acknowledge their actions in cyberspace—indeed, ostensible anonymity and difficulty attributing cyber operations to a state or non-state actor is part of the appeal of cyber operations—it is unlikely that customary international law will bring order to the cyber arena.¹³⁶ The ossification of customary international law requires open state practice driven by a sense of international obligation. This is unlikely to occur in cyberwarfare where states engage in highly classified cyber operations in relative anonymity.¹³⁷ Furthermore, without grievous cyberattacks affecting large numbers of states equally, international political will would likely be insufficient to produce a new treaty to regulate armed conflict in cyberspace, let alone clarify digital cultural property’s status in international humanitarian law. As a result, interpretations of existing legal instruments and principles will likely define the evolution of international law in cyberspace.¹³⁸ These interpretations may come through formal statements by states as to their legal position or their armed forces’ manuals on the laws of war.¹³⁹ Additionally, “[o]ver time, the reaction of states to cyber operations, as well as how they characterize their own cyber operations, will inform the process of interpretive maturation.”¹⁴⁰\n\nThis Note argues that digital and digitized cultural property are data of cultural importance 141 that fall under the 1954 Hague Convention's protections for culturally significant archives and records. An archive,\"a repository or collection especially of information,\"142 is a particularly apt description of digital information, which is normally stored either on a device's local hard drive or a server connected to the internet. While a 3D scan of a historic monument is not a historic monument itself, it is a reproduction of an important monument of architecture that is filed away alongside other 3D scans, like books on a shelf. Likewise, archived born-digital cultural property ought to be protected as\"moveable or immovable property of great importance to the cultural heritage of every people...\"143 The fact that digital cultural property exists to preserve cultural heritage, maintain cultural integrity, and provide access to societal memory only strengthens arguments for its protection, since a society implicitly preserves what it values. 144 This is not to say that every scrap of data ought to fall within the ambit of cultural property in IHL. However, data of sufficient cultural, scientific, or religious import, or which when aggregated take on sufficient importance, surely fall within the scope of the 1954 Hague Convention and customary international law. Born-digital cultural property is especially worthy of protection 145 since, unlike digitized cultural property, there is no physical backup if it is altered or destroyed.\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\nproperty, which holds immense societal value but happens to be digital rather than analog.\nOutside of international law, views of internet websites and digital repositories as archives are not new.¹⁵² One media studies scholar has termed YouTube “the world’s largest archive of moving images.”¹⁵³ Scholars have taken a broad view of an archive, defining it to include “inactive records of continuing value” or “a selection of digital records or digital surrogates of records made available as a curated online collection.”¹⁵⁴ While many websites, such as YouTube and Wikipedia, explicitly state that their mission is not preservation, these online platforms have become de facto democratic digital repositories of substantial cultural importance.¹⁵⁵ As a result, both the content hosted by these websites, as well as the websites themselves, ought to be protected by IHL, just as it already protects the documents contained within a physical archive.\nThis interpretation is consistent with articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.¹⁵⁶ According to the Vienna Convention, courts and parties should construe a treaty according to the text’s “ordinary meaning” taken “in the light of its object and purpose.”¹⁵⁷ The\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\nSubsequent practice by parties to the Hague Convention also supports protection for digital and digitized cultural property.¹⁶³ Several states have included digitized cultural data in their implementation reports filed consistent with the 1954 Hague Convention.¹⁶⁴ Belgium included its digitization of museum institutions,¹⁶⁵ Cyprus mentioned its use of GIS technologies to create an inventory of ancient monuments,¹⁶⁶ Greece with the Columbia Human Rights Law Review) (“[Treaties] are instruments for providing stability to their parties and to fulfil the purposes which they embody. They can therefore change over time, must adapt to new situations, evolve according to the social needs of the international community...”); Sergio Marchisio, Remarks at the 10th United Nations Workshop on Space Law, (Sept. 5–8, 2016).\n\nreferenced its “digitalization of the archive of monuments,”¹⁶⁷ and Australia noted its efforts at digitizing archives,¹⁶⁸ as did Turkey¹⁶⁹ and Estonia.¹⁷⁰ Azerbaijan considered its digitization of aged sound records to be a fulfillment of its peacetime treaty obligations under the 1954 Hague Convention,¹⁷¹ and Germany did the same with over two million archival documents from the Wossidlo ethnographic archive.¹⁷² Following suit, the Holy See has digitized over 400,000 pages of reproductions from its archives, “providing the minimum necessary redundancy to guarantee the conservation of high-quality copies in the event the originals are lost.”¹⁷³ Such efforts demonstrate that parties to the 1954 Hague Convention consider digital archives and records to be an essential means of cultural heritage preservation and lend credence to the treaty’s protection of digital and digitized cultural property.\n## B. Belligerents’ Obligations Towards Digital and Digitized Cultural Property Although digital cultural property should fall within the scope of the law of armed conflict, novel characteristics of the cyber domain alter what obligations belligerents have towards cultural property. In the current international legal regime, states have the following core obligations to cultural property: 1) states are prohibited from targeting cultural property or directing “acts of hostility [towards it]”;¹⁷⁴ 2) states are prohibited from using cultural property in a way that would imperil it; 3) states are prohibited from plundering or looting cultural property or from making reprisals against it; and 4) states are obliged to stop the theft, pillage, misappropriation, and vandalism of cultural property.¹⁷⁵ These obligations, rooted in the 1954 Hague Convention and customary international law, are core protections for cultural property and heritage.¹⁷⁶\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\nCOLUMBIA HUMAN RIGHTS LAW REVIEW [53.1 sinisterly, the BBC reported in 2019 on how the People's Republic of China was encouraging its citizens to edit Wikipedia entries on several sensitive topics, to\"reflect our voices and opinions in the entry, so as to objectively and truly reflect the influence of Chinese path and Chinese thoughts on other countries and history.\"185 Approximately 1,600 edits were made to Wikipedia pages for Hong Kong, Taiwan, the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, and nineteen other politically sensitive articles, although no coordinated cyber operation was uncovered.186 One way to determine when state activity in cyberspace impermissibly disrupts cultural property is a sliding scale analysis: how much of an effect does the military operation have on the digital cultural property? A group of soldiers stealing, defacing, or destroying one book or document from an archive likely has a de minimis effect on the entirety of the archive. Similarly, a proper analysis might be to what degree a cyber operation affects the entirety of a cultural data set. North Korea might decide to selectively edit the Wikipedia page of Kim Jong-un as part of an information operation, but that would be far less damaging than a broad cyber operation defacing or deleting large quantities of Wikipedia, or any other interactive cultural data set. It would be important to consider the ease of repair as well. For instance, digitized cultural data might be the sole remnant of lost cultural property, and thus critical for reconstruction, similar to how eighteen century art was essential to reconstructing Warsaw's Old Town after World War II.187 In the twenty-first century, cultural heritage experts are repairing the damage done by ISIS by using crowdsourced images of Mosul and historic sites in the Levant to 3D print lost artifacts and reproduce destroyed urban environments in virtual reality.188 Respect for these 3D prints and images during warfare is critical, as they are the last remnants of now-destroyed cultural property.\nStates' other obligations towards cultural property translate well into cyberspace. In peacetime, states must protect digital and digitized Microsoft allegedly offered to pay software engineers to edit certain Wikipedia pages so that they might be more favorable to Microsoft. Conflict of Interest Editing on Wikipedia, WIKIPEDIA (Nov. 9, 2021), https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-of-interest_editing_on_Wikipedia#Microsoft [https://perma.cc/MND8-PKXX].\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\nHowever, a DDOS attack might be considered an “act of hostility” within the meaning of the Additional Protocols to the Geneva Convention IV.¹⁹² Additional Protocol II does not protect archives or libraries, but instead protects “historic monuments, works of art, or places of worship which constitute the cultural or spiritual heritage of peoples.”¹⁹³ At the same time, the ICRC interprets the Additional Protocols to incorporate the 1954 Hague Convention’s definition of cultural heritage and property, which would extend protections for cultural property despite the Additional Protocols’ text not mentioning archives.¹⁹⁴ According to the ICRC, an “act of hostility” need not have a substantive effect on the cultural property itself, so long as it is “directed against” the cultural property.¹⁹⁵ Indeed, if a DDOS attack qualifies as an “act of hostility,” then Additional Protocols I and II and the 1954 Hague Convention would prohibit it.¹⁹⁶ Thus, it is conceivable that IHL would prohibit a DDOS attack on digital cultural property.¹⁹⁷ Another major issue in international legal obligations comes from how data challenges the territoriality of the 1954 Hague Convention.¹⁹⁸ While territorial location does not affect customary international legal obligation to refrain from damaging cultural property during armed conflict,¹⁹⁹ the Convention requires parties to “undertake to prepare in time of peace for the safeguarding of cultural property situated within their own territory against the foreseeable effects of an armed conflict...”²⁰⁰ Articles 12 and 13 of the Convention outline specific provisions for the safety of cultural property during transport.²⁰¹ However, data, unlike physical cultural property, rapidly crosses international boundaries along pre-determined paths and is often highly divisible.²⁰² A reasonable interpretation of states’ peacetime obligation might include replicating cultural data that resides in their territory for a substantial time or replicating cultural property of particular importance to the state’s own culture.\nThis shift in established notions of territoriality has additional implications. Traditionally, states would claim ownership over real-world cultural property within their borders. For example, the Taj Mahal is a UNESCO World Heritage Site²⁰³ that has special cultural importance to India, where it is located. Most nations seek to control their cultural property in the interest of its “retention, preservation, study, enjoyment, and exploitation.”²⁰⁴ This may be the case for digital cultural property as well,²⁰⁵ but others might be content with storing digital cultural property on a server in another country. International law’s focus on cultural internationalism simplifies this issue.²⁰⁶ Insofar as cultural property is the “cultural heritage of all mankind,”²⁰⁷ a state must protect digital cultural property within its territory regardless of its cultural origin. Museums across the world already do this; for example, the MET Digital Collection features scans of masks from\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\n## C. Protections for Replicas of Cultural Property in Cyberspace: Addressing Counter-Arguments\nA common question scholars pose is how digital technologies affect the authenticity of art.²¹¹ German philosopher Walter Benjamin argued that each work of art possesses a unique “aura” which mechanical reproduction erases, and thus, reproduction destroys the work’s authenticity.²¹² This is undeniably a motivation for protecting real-world cultural property and it is why reproductions often fail to stand in for stolen cultural property.²¹³ Humanity yearns for cultural objects because they are true and certain and possess some kind of uniqueness.²¹⁴ In addition to serving as surrogates,\n\n[53.1 digital objects are material in their own right, existing in space and time independently of that which they replicate.²¹⁵ For example, where once a photograph was seen as a simulacrum, “it has now attained a status of its own as a creative work as well as value as a historical document, along with its archival and interpretive roles. Photographs, according to Roland Barthes, radiate an aura, a distance, reference to a past and memory.”²¹⁶ However, authenticity is not the only reason why cultural property is considered worth preserving. Cultural property contains a society’s memories, brings substantial economic benefits through the antiquities trade or tourism, fosters a sense of community and identity, and by extension, has political value.²¹⁷ This is to say nothing of the value digitized reproductions have as a means of preservation and access, or how societies are capable of creating complex emotional relationships with replicas.²¹⁸ The strongest argument against interpreting LOAC to protect digital and digitized cultural property is that data is easily reproducible and disseminated, making its destruction exceedingly difficult and legal protections unnecessary. The Tallinn Manual 2.0, an influential academic publication outlining international law in cyberspace, incorporates this point; it argues that belligerents “must respect and protect cultural property that may be affected by cyber operations or that is located in cyberspace.”²¹⁹ However, the Manual continues, “[p]rotection only applies to digital copies or versions where the original is either inaccessible or has been destroyed,\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\nThe\"replication\"argument fails for several reasons. First, the fact that cultural property may be lodged on a hard drive somewhere else in the world does not mean that it is or will be. Even accepting the replication argument as valid fails to recognize the peacetime duty to preserve and protect cultural property, which is recognized under the Hague Convention.²²² Digital cultural property is easily duplicated and stored, but this does not eliminate the need for a legal duty to duplicate and store digital cultural property. There are numerous examples of digital cultural works being lost or nearly lost because of a failure to maintain proper backups.²²³ Even the existence of a backup is no guarantee if the data storage is centralized, as a conventional attack on a data center could destroy all existing copies of a culturally significant file.²²⁴ Such a conventional attack is not unlikely, as military and civilian internet infrastructure are largely interconnected.²²⁵ For example, Microsoft has contracted to store 80% of Department of Defense data and applications, making it difficult to distinguish between military and civilian targets.²²⁶ In addition to their peacetime duty to duplicate digital cultural property, belligerents during an armed conflict have to engage in a foreseeability analysis before conducting certain cyber operations to determine whether the digital cultural property they might jeopardize has in fact been duplicated, or even if it is endangered. Belligerents already use this test to determine the lawfulness of a target in the absence of notice of its cultural importance.²²⁷ Second, the texts of the Hague Convention and the Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions refute this argument. The Hague Convention explicitly protects “important collections of books or archives or of reproductions,” so copies of digital cultural property would likely warrant protection.²²⁸ During the Convention’s negotiations, the delegates from Switzerland and France insisted on the inclusion of protections for reproductions, “so that future generations would at least have the opportunity of seeing photographs of such works if the originals had been destroyed.”²²⁹ Additional Protocols I and II to the Geneva Convention outlaw “any acts of hostility directed against” cultural property.²³⁰ Applying this language, ICTY in Prosecutor v. Jokic, which concerned Yugoslav attacks on the Old Town of Dubrovnik, a UNESCO World Heritage site, concluded that Additional Protocols I and II prohibit attacks on cultural property “whether or not the attacks result in actual damage.”²³¹ Following this reasoning, LOAC\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\nThird, and most importantly, domestic copyright laws can impede the dissemination of cultural data, making it far more complicated than simply copying files.²³³ Copyright generally prohibits the reproduction of copyrighted work, whether for profit or not.²³⁴ For example, in the United States, archives and libraries are limited in their ability to reproduce copyrighted materials, and the number of copies they can make depends on the time remaining on the copyright, whether the material is unpublished, and whether the work is subject to “commercial exploitation.”²³⁵ This is further complicated by substantial differences in national intellectual property (“IP”) legal regimes, which may or may not inhibit the reproduction and preservation of cultural heritage, and to what extent copyright can cover cultural data.²³⁶ However, “[t]he traditional point of view of museums, no [https://perma.cc/G48W-79AW]. “For a violation of the article to take place it is therefore not necessary for there to be any damage.” Id.\n\nmatter where they are located, has been that IP, in particular copyright, has inhibited their ability to carry out their mission and mandate.”²³⁷ Domestic IP regimes undercut the assumption that cultural heritage institutions can replicate cultural data *ad infinitum* as a means of eliminating practical threats to digital and digitized cultural property. The intricacies of domestic IP laws cut against any presumption that digital cultural property, wherever located, will have backups, and thus counsels in favor of protecting digital cultural property in the event of an armed conflict.\n## 1. Copyright Law and the Problems It Presents for Digital Cultural Heritage Current cultural property law regimes impede the replication of digital cultural property. For instance, most digital cultural property is available in encrypted formats, which ties the digital goods to a specific account to prevent duplication; as a result, cultural heritage institutions are capable of licensing these digital goods, but they are unable to create archival copies until the expiration of the copyright.²³⁸ The Digital Millennium Copyright Act makes circumventing these technical measures against duplication a federal crime punishable by up to five years in prison.²³⁹ As a result, GLAMs must often wait ninety-five years after a work’s publication—or seventy years after the death of the author—to produce an archival copy,²⁴⁰ by which point the cultural property will likely have been lost to technological obsolescence, degraded hard drives, human error, or malicious attacks.²⁴¹ According to the Library of Congress, this has happened before. Because film studios lacked the resources, the foresight, or the commercial museums can make and the purposes for which museums can digitize culture property.

Edwards, *supra* note 238.\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage Copyright holders, as opposed to GLAMs, might produce backups of their work, but that is up to the copyright holder's discretion; a possessive copyright holder might actively hinder any reproductions. Take Star Wars, a film included in the Library of Congress's National Film Registry because of its historical and cultural significance.²⁴⁴ Since the theatrical release of A New Hope in 1977, George Lucas, and later Disney, made several alterations to the film, including introducing Computer Generated Imagery (\"CGI\"), adding entirely new scenes, altering the sound mixing and color palette, and including entirely new lines.²⁴⁵ George Lucas has publicly stated that he only wants his updated versions of the film to survive and Disney has continued that policy.²⁴⁶ As a result, the only digital versions of the original cut of A New Hope are fan-made and arguably constitute copyright infringement.²⁴⁷ In its current form, copyright places the preservation of cultural heritage at the whims of the copyright holder, making it difficult for belligerents in an armed conflict to presume that they can target digital cultural property haphazardly.\nA Library of Congress report on copyright laws from the United Kingdom, Australia, the Netherlands, and the United States concluded that “[a]lthough copyright and related laws are not the only obstacle to digital preservation activities, there is no question that those laws present significant challenges.”²⁴⁸ None of the jurisdictions surveyed have a uniform system for collecting digital materials, none of the exceptions to copyright laws for GLAMs were designed for digital preservation, and exceptions to copyright law for GLAMs are wildly inconsistent across jurisdictions.²⁴⁹ International copyright treaties are of little help in ensuring the preservation of cultural heritage. For example, the Berne Convention and the WIPO Copyright Treaty merely allow for states to permit reproduction “[p]rovided that such reproduction does not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work and does not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the author.”²⁵⁰ This labyrinth of copyright law makes it legally dubious to rely on random reproductions to protect digital and digitized cultural property.\nFinally, the rise in non-fungible tokens (“NFTs”) have made certain copies of digital art unique, and thus irreproducible, through blockchain technology.²⁵¹ NFTs thus make digital goods artificially scarce, causing a boom in digital art while also making some digital cultural property completely unique. In March 2021, Beeple, the online name of Charleston-based artist Mike Winkelmann, sold a digital painting called “Everydays–The\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\nFor the purposes of digital cultural property, NFTs ensure the authenticity of a piece of digital art. For example, the Mona Lisa is clearly protected cultural property under international law, but prints of da Vinci's masterpiece sold at the Louvre gift shop are not. NFTs offer an opportunity to authenticate certain works of digital cultural property and accord them protection under LOAC, while rendering non-NFT copies lawful targets. Because an NFT is an inherently unique entry on a blockchain ledger, it cannot be reproduced beyond the quantity specified by the NFT creator.²⁵⁸ As the primary means of ensuring authenticity in digital art, NFTs are likely the future of digital art, and thus ought to be protected under the laws of war.\n\nCOLUMBIA HUMAN RIGHTS LAW REVIEW [53.1 # D. How to Protect Digital Cultural Property in Practice The question remains of how to ensure the Hague Convention and its Additional Protocols, as well as the Geneva Convention and its Additional Protocols, carry weight. One idea might be technical solutions. Articles 16 and 17 of the 1954 Hague Convention establish a distinctive marking to identify physical cultural property and to provide notice to all parties of the property's protected status.²⁵⁹ This could easily be adapted into a number of technical solutions, including file naming conventions and coding schemes to tag cultural data.²⁶⁰ Militaries have already developed no-strike lists for culturally significant sites, which prevented the destruction of ancient monuments by Coalition Forces during the First Gulf War and the 2011 Libya Intervention.²⁶¹ Such no-strike lists might extend to certain servers, data centers, or IP addresses housing culturally significant data. Additionally, a published register of IP addresses, analogous to already-extant national or international registers of cultural property, would help provide notice and further remove cultural property from hostilities in cyberspace.²⁶² By segregating the civilian internet from the locus of military operations, states can better preserve digital cultural property in an armed conflict. At a minimum, states ought to ensure digital cultural data is preserved through at least some basic cybersecurity provisions as a means of fulfilling their peacetime obligations under Article 3 of the 1954 Hague Convention.²⁶³ International collaboration is also key to preserving digital cultural property. As part of their peacetime obligations under the 1954 Hague Convention, public cultural agencies and ministries could collaborate\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\nWhen responding to attacks on cultural property, states might also collaborate to overcome the difficulties of attribution in cyberspace. Because of technical advancements in recent years, successfully attributing major cyberattacks to individual perpetrators has gone from impossible to probable.²⁶⁸ By establishing an international evidentiary standard for cyberattack attribution, states can legitimately deter hostile states and ensure legal liability for law-breaking individuals.²⁶⁹ Additionally, states might share evidence with each other, or in collaboration with the private sector, as part of an international attribution mechanism.²⁷⁰ While such COLUMBIA HUMAN RIGHTS LAW REVIEW [53.1 proposals have largely focused on *jus ad bellum* concerns, attribution is equally critical to *jus in bello* issues, such as protecting cultural property.²⁷¹ The COVID-19 pandemic has made protections for digital cultural property all the more salient. In April 2020, 130 ministers of culture from around the world met virtually through Zoom to discuss the impact of the pandemic on the culture sector.²⁷² During the pandemic, “86% of countries... closed or partially closed their World Heritage Sites and 90% of museums... were closed.”²⁷³ Saudi Arabia, India, Colombia, Estonia, Greece, Albania, and Belize all emphasized the need to transition to digital cultural platforms and provide financial support for digital cultural production.²⁷⁴ “A large share of countries, including Kenya, Mexico and Lithuania, have made the digital transition one of the cornerstones of their cultural policy...”²⁷⁵ while other states, such as Serbia, Botswana, Cyprus, and Andorra questioned how this digital transformation would affect copyright protections.²⁷⁶ There was a general consensus among states that “[t]he digital transition must be the subject of global reflection and international regulation,”²⁷⁷ and that the digital cultural transition would certainly accelerate moving forward.²⁷⁸ ## CONCLUSION By framing digital and digitized cultural property as archives and records, existing international treaties can provide some degree of legal protection to this rapidly growing form of cultural heritage. This protection is particularly valuable, given the lack of an international effort to expand cultural heritage protections in the law of armed conflict. Because of the lack of a political will to create a new treaty for cultural property in cyberspace, states, international organizations, and scholars should further pursue novel interpretations to protect cultural heritage and adjust their policies\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\nThe emergence of digital cultural property raises further interesting questions surrounding international human rights law and its intersection with cultural heritage and cyberspace. To the extent that participation in cultural life creates a human right to cultural heritage,[279] and insofar as internet access is a human right,[280] protections for digital cultural property might also emerge from international human rights law, in addition to international humanitarian law. The use of an international human rights framework could bolster protections for digital cultural heritage in peacetime to a greater degree than international humanitarian law. Raising interesting questions surrounding privacy, sovereignty, intellectual property, and the freedom of expression, the use of a human rights [53.1 framework to protect digital cultural heritage and property is a promising subject for future research.",

He spent his life as the Chief of Antiquities at the historic site of Palmyra in Syria, his hometown, where he protected one of the world's best-preserved archaeological sites—until ISIS seized his home and took him hostage.¹ After a month of torture, the terrorist group publicly beheaded Khaled al-Asaad for refusing to reveal the location of hidden antiquities.² Khaled al-Assad's sacrifice demonstrates the importance of cultural property to humanity: it is not only a record of humanity, but a fundamental pillar supporting it. Cultural property is so indispensable and so invaluable to humankind that the law must shield it from the bombs and bloodshed of war, just as Khaled al-Assad did. Yet, one hundred years from now, the artifacts worth dying for will not only be physical but also digital, made of code rather than stone or steel.³ This Note aims to address the fundamental question of how humanity will protect this new form of cultural property during armed conflicts.\nThere is widespread consensus that the law of armed conflict (\"LOAC\") applies to state and non-state actors in cyberspace, but there is far less consensus as to exactly how it applies.⁴ The application of settled principles of LOAC to cyber operations is a difficult one, as the cyber domain lacks the physical characteristics which have always marked battlefields.⁵ This has resulted in a great deal of literature discussing how the principles of proportionality,⁶ distinction,⁷ attribution,⁸ and neutrality⁹ can exist in cyberspace. The current intricacies of global politics have also complicated matters, as norms and interpretations of international law in cyberspace are continuously evolving to match shifting political and technical realities.¹⁰ This interpretive uncertainty has raised the question of how protection for cultural property under LOAC, a longstanding goal of international law, can extend to cyberspace.\nCultural property is protected under both treaty-based and customary international law. The destruction, degradation, theft, vandalism, or misappropriation of cultural property is a war crime.¹¹ International law\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\nmilitary objectives” a war crime).

This paper then contends that digital and digitized cultural property should be categorized as archives and ¹⁵. The specialized terminology surrounding this topic deserves clarification. It is worth clarifying the terms\"cultural property\"and\"cultural heritage.\"The two terms are almost always used interchangeably in international treaties and scholarship. While cultural property is an older term, it has largely been superseded by cultural heritage, which is conceptually oriented around preservation for future generations rather than the rights and powers of the possessor. The term cultural heritage also encompasses practices that do not fall within any definition of tangible or intangible cultural heritage, making it a broader category than cultural property, although the terms are often synonymous. For example, the Great Wall of China is cultural property that forms part of China's cultural heritage. Yet the practice of Chinese calligraphy, an intangible cultural tradition, is not cultural property despite being part of China's cultural heritage. However, unlike cultural heritage, cultural property has a clear legal meaning, defined in the 1954 Hague Convention and 1970 UNESCO Convention.

Q. 61, 65(2000).\nDigitized cultural property is cultural property that has been copied or converted into digital format, yet which came from a real-world copy. Common examples of digitized cultural property include scanned books, audio recordings of music or culturally significant stories, and 3D renderings of monuments and artifacts.\nDigital cultural property is cultural property that has no original physical or real-world copy. Common examples of digital cultural property include digital artwork, blogs, vlogs, webcomics, e-books, certain audio recordings that are only digital downloads, some television shows and films, some journalism, and any other content that exists solely in digital form. The line between digital and digitized cultural property is not always clear. Take JSTOR, which is a digital repository for academic research similar to SSRN or PubMed. JSTOR hosts 12 million academic journal articles, books, and primary sources, yet only some lack any original physical version.

International humanitarian law (\"IHL\") is\"broadly speaking, that branch of public international law that seeks to moderate the conduct of armed conflict and to mitigate the suffering that it causes.\"Amanda Alexander, A Short History of International Humanitarian Law, 26 EUR. J. INT'L L. 109, 111 (2015). IHL, which is synonymous with the law of armed conflict, encompasses treaties on the rules of war, ius in bello, as well as international norms that have ossified into binding customary international law. Id.\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage begins by exploring the history of protections for cultural property and heritage in times of war, with particular emphasis on the reasons for such protections. Part II discusses the development of digital and digitized cultural property and current threats to digital cultural heritage. Part III proposes a novel interpretation of digital and digitized cultural property as historically significant archives or documents and addresses what obligations belligerents ought to have towards cultural property in cyberspace.",
    "I. Place of Cultural Property in the Law of Armed Conflict ### A. Development of Protections for Cultural Property With some exceptions, the wanton destruction of cultural property and heritage in ancient and medieval warfare was commonplace, governed by the maxim “to the victor go the spoils.”²⁰ Athenian historian Xenophon wrote, “It is an eternal law the wide world over, that when a city is taken in war, the citizens, their persons, and all their property fall into the hands of the conquerors.”²¹ The Roman Triumph prominently featured stolen art from defeated enemies,²² the Bible repeatedly references the plundering of art and treasures as spoils of war,²³ and when the Mongols sacked Baghdad in 1258 and destroyed the city’s great libraries, they threw so many books especially in cyber space. David Wallace &amp; Christopher Jacobs, *Conflict Classification and Cyber Operations: Gaps, Ambiguities and Fault Lines*, 40 U. PA. J. INT’L L. 643, 652 (2019); Michael Schmitt &amp; Sean Watts, *Beyond State-Centrism: International Law and Non-State Actors in Cyberspace*, 21 J. CONFLICT SEC. L. 595, 611 (2016) (“In many respects, the state-centric legal regime of public international law may seem ill-suited or even inadequate to address the challenges the super-empowered non-state actors of cyberspace present”). However, because state actors possess the most substantial capabilities in cyberspace and because IHL speaks with greater clarity on international armed conflicts, this paper focuses on international armed conflicts.": "²⁰. Or, as more eloquently phrased by Thucydides, “right, as the world goes, is only in question between equals in power, while the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must.” THUCYDIDES, *HISTORY OF THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 566–67* (Richard Crawley trans., *Floating Press* 2008) (Fourth century BCE).\n²¹.

Jeremiah 15:13 (King James) (“Thy substance and thy treasures will I give to the spoil without price, and that for all thy sins, even in all thy borders.”); 2 Chronicles 14:13-14 (“And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto Gerar... and they carried away very much spoil. And they smote all the cities round about Gerar... and they spoiled all the cities; for there was exceeding much spoil in them.”); see also Deuteronomy 20:10 (elaborating the practices of war and articulating divine endorsement of expropriating cultural property).\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage Yet some ancient thinkers and commanders took steps to exempt art, architecture, and houses of worship from the rampant destruction of civilian property. Greek historian Polybius wrote that while the destruction or taking of civilian property\"are necessary acts according to the laws and rights of war; to deface temples, statues, and such like erections in pure wantonness... must be regarded as an act of blind passion and insanity.\"²⁷ Cicero later used this line of reasoning to prosecute Gaius Verres in 70 BCE for expropriating artworks from temples and citizens during his governorship of Sicily.²⁸ To mitigate the damage of war to spiritual institutions, Frederick Barbarossa issued an edict in 1158 forbidding the pillaging of churches, although the ransacking of houses of worship remained ubiquitous in medieval warfare.²⁹ The Quran likewise prohibits fighting in sacred places, such as mosques and other houses of worship.³⁰ The Enlightenment marked a substantial shift in the treatment of cultural property and heritage in international legal thought.³¹ French jurist Emer de Vattel wrote that destroying cultural property renders a belligerent an enemy to all mankind and that “the wanton destruction of public monuments, temples, tombs, statues, paintings, &amp;c. [sic] is absolutely condemned, even by the voluntary law of nations, as never being conducive to the lawful object of war.”³² Reasoning that no party would gain from the destruction of cultural property, Vattel argued such destruction or expropriation was unlawful.³³ This protection complemented Vattel’s principle of moderation in warfare, especially regarding pillaging hostile territory. “All damage done to the enemy unnecessarily, every act of hostility which does not tend to procure victory and bring the war to a conclusion, is licentiousness condemned by the laws of nature.”³⁴ Drawing on Cicero and Polybius, influential Dutch jurist Hugo Grotius similarly argued for protecting cultural property under the laws of war. “Porticos, Temples, statues, and all other elegant works and monuments of art” are “of such a nature, as to contribute, no way, to the support and prolongation of war.”³⁵ As a result, Grotius thought belligerents ought to exercise moderation in their treatment of enemy civilian property generally and cultural property in particular.³⁶ Regardless, it would take the arrival of industrialized warfare to transform legal theory into legal agreements. The nineteenth century saw further refinement of the laws of war and its provisions concerning cultural property. The 1863 Lieber Code, a set of instructions issued to Union soldiers during the American Civil War, provided that “[c]lassical works of art, libraries, scientific collections, or precious instruments, such as astronomical telescopes, as well as hospitals, must be secured against all avoidable injury, even when they are contained in fortified places whilst besieged or bombarded.”³⁷ But the Lieber Code’s protection for such cultural property was limited at best; it also allowed for the seizure of cultural property by an invading or occupying force if it could remove cultural property without injury, with the determination of ownership left to the final peace conference.³⁸ Although it was not intended as a legal agreement, the Lieber Code nevertheless had an immense influence on the development of the laws\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\nBy the twentieth century, foundational international treaties on the laws of war began to give greater force to protections for cultural property. Article 56 of the 1907 Hague Convention states that, during an occupation, “[t]he property of municipalities, that of institutions dedicated to religion, charity and education, the arts and sciences, even when State property, shall be treated as private property.”⁴³ The treaty further mandates that “[a]ll seizure of, destruction or wilful [sic] damage done to institutions of this character, historic monuments, works of art and science, is forbidden, and should be made the subject of legal proceedings.”⁴⁴ Article 27 also requires that “all necessary steps must be taken to spare, as far as possible, buildings dedicated to religion, art, science, or charitable purposes, [and] historic monuments” and states that belligerents have a duty to clearly demarcate protected buildings or property.⁴⁵ However, the 1907 treaty proved ineffective at protecting cultural property during the Second World War, as Axis forces blatantly disregarded it.⁴⁶ The extensive looting of cultural treasures by the Nazi regime led to the creation of the 1954 Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict (“1954 Hague Convention”).⁴⁷ ## B. Hague Convention, Additional Protocols, and the Evolution of Cultural Property Protections The 1954 Hague Convention is a core treaty shielding cultural property in armed conflicts. It aims to prevent “damage to cultural property belonging to any people whatsoever…since each people makes its contribution to the culture of the world.”⁴⁸ The 1954 Convention, faced with “the developments in the technique of warfare” which exacerbated the dangers posed to cultural property, built on the 1907 framework by requiring states to secure cultural property during peacetime and prohibiting the destruction of cultural heritage witnessed in World War II.⁴⁹ The treaty defines cultural property as “movable or immovable property of great importance to the cultural heritage of every people.”⁵⁰ This includes, of Militarism in Postwar Japan, 33 JAPAN REV. 195. 195 (2019). However, the Nazi’s systematic campaign of looting and eradicating important cultural works was so extensive it resulted in charges at the Nuremberg Tribunal and led Allied forces to establish the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives Program (also referred to as the “Monuments Men”) to safeguard plundered cultural works. Sanja Zgonjanin, The Prosecution of War Crimes for the Destruction of Libraries and Archives During Times of Armed Conflict, 40 LIBR. &amp; CULTURE 128, 133–35 (2005); see generally ROBERT EDSEL &amp; BRETT WITTER, THE MONUMENTS MEN: ALLIED HEROES, NAZI THIEVES, AND THE GREATEST TREASURE HUNT IN HISTORY (2009).\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\nThe Convention clearly defines the scope of its protection, but there is no objective test for determining which monuments, buildings, or manuscripts IHL protects. The party in whose territory the property is situated determines its cultural importance, and thus whether it is legally protected—a determination which parties must make in good faith.53 Absent notice to opposing parties under Articles 3 and 6 of the Hague Convention—notice that is left up to the parties' discretion—belligerents must hazard an educated guess, weighed down with caution, as to any item's cultural importance.54 Belligerents must then\"respect cultural property\"by refraining from conduct that would expose it to destruction or damage and further have a duty to protect cultural property from vandalism, theft, or The other commonly used definition of cultural property in international law comes from the Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property of 1970, often referred to as the UNESCO Convention. That treaty defines cultural property with greater specificity and more expansively than the 1954 Convention, and, like the 1954 Convention, defers to parties' respective views of cultural importance. See Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property, art. 1, Nov. 14 1970, 823 U.N.T.S. 231, http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=130 39&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html [https://perma.cc/D53M-BHZK].\n[53.1 misappropriation.⁵⁵ Likewise, belligerents are forbidden from directing reprisals toward cultural property and from requisitioning it.⁵⁶ The adoption of Additional Protocols I and II to the 1949 Geneva Conventions in 1977 bolstered the 1954 Hague Convention and provided additional protections for cultural heritage.⁵⁷ In both international and non-international armed conflicts, these protocols prohibit “acts of hostility directed against the historic monuments, works of art or places of worship which constitute the cultural or spiritual heritage of peoples.”⁵⁸ The Additional Protocols to the Geneva Convention refer to objects which “constitute the cultural or spiritual heritage of peoples.” This is different than the Hague Convention’s protections for property which apply when an object is “of great importance to the cultural heritage.” However, the International Committee of the Red Cross (“ICRC”) has clarified that “the basic idea is the same.” The Additional Protocols cover “objects whose value transcends geographical boundaries, and which are unique in character and are intimately associated with the history and culture of a people.”⁵⁹ In addition to the aforementioned treaties, customary international law also protects cultural property. The International Committee of the Red Cross lists respect for cultural property during armed conflict as part of customary international law.⁶⁰ Belligerents are prohibited from using cultural property for military purposes except when required by military\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\nThe current regime for protecting cultural property in war has had mixed success. While the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) successfully led several prosecutions for the destruction of cultural property,63 recent terrorist attacks have destroyed similarly irreplaceable works of cultural property. In 2001, the Taliban destroyed the Bamiyan Buddhas, 1,500-year-old statues over 100 feet tall—which were then the largest in the world.64 The looting of the National Museum of Iraq in the wake of Operation Iraqi Freedom was another shameful chapter, and stolen artifacts continue to flood illicit antiquities markets fifteen years later.65 Pointing to these contemptible episodes, some scholars have criticized the 1954 Hague Convention as ineffective at preventing the loss of these cultural treasures, even as the 1954 Convention's Second Additional Protocol clearly extended its protections to non-state actors.66 The Hague Convention, Additional Protocol II, and the 1970 World Heritage Convention have concededly not protected every piece of cultural property, but surely they have saved some.67 Yet, because of these treaties, not only does the destruction of cultural property often yield widespread international COLUMBIA HUMAN RIGHTS LAW REVIEW [53.1 condemnation, but international tribunals have also imposed criminal liability for attacks on cultural property.",
    "II. Protecting Cultural Property in Cyberspace ## A. Defining Digital and Digitized Cultural Property ## 1. Digitized Cultural Property As with almost everything else, advances in computing, digital storage, and connectivity have revolutionized the field of cultural heritage. Owing to these recent technological advancements, digitized cultural property—whereby tangible or intangible cultural heritage is transformed into information—has exploded in recent years as a method of preserving cultural heritage, offering novel educational opportunities and increasing public access. Digitized cultural property can take several forms, such as scanned texts, audio-visual recordings of music, and 3D renderings. Take, for instance, CyArk, a non-profit established in 2003 after the Taliban's destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas to\"digitally record, archive and share the world's most significant cultural heritage...\"CyArk uses high-tech laser scanning tools to create 3D models of cultural heritage, which it then draws on to create an\"immersive virtual reality environment.\"To date,": "2021] Hard Drive Heritage\nThis digitization push includes not only tangible but also intangible cultural property.78 For example, motion capture technology has allowed the digitization of traditional Japanese dances, allowing master performers to study their craft in a new way while also allowing for the archiving of cultural practices and events.79 Additionally, novel digital technologies offer a promising pathway for communities to preserve their cultural heritage, whether it be the oral narratives and song traditions of indigenous communities in Canada⁸⁰ or the collective memory and cultural knowledge of Pacific Island communities.⁸¹ These projects are inevitably converted to digital files, placed on storage devices, and often made publicly available through the internet.⁸² ## 2. Digital Cultural Property as It Exists Today Digital cultural property, while stored in the same medium as digitized cultural property, is created in a digital format and almost always remains digital.⁸³ The 2003 UNESCO Charter on the Preservation of Digital Heritage defines digital heritage as “cultural, educational, scientific and administrative resources, as well as technical, legal, medical and other kinds of information created digitally, or converted into digital form from existing analog resources.”⁸⁴ The Charter, much like the 1954 Hague Convention, states, “the disappearance of heritage in whatever form constitutes an impoverishment of the heritage of all nations” and that “[digital cultural heritage] should be protected and preserved for current and future generations.”⁸⁵ Also similar to the 1954 Hague Convention, the Charter delegates the decision of what items should and should not be protected to states.⁸⁶ Digital cultural heritage is defined by its ephemerality and its shifting format.⁸⁷ Common examples of digital cultural property include gifs,\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\nFor a good example of digital cultural heritage, take YouTube, the world's second most-visited website with two billion unique monthly users.90 Every minute, YouTube gains an additional 500 hours of content and hosts content in over eighty languages.91 Every day, YouTube gains on average four billion daily views.92 Google, YouTube's parent company, is secretive about how its storage system works; one estimate is that in 2013, Google had approximately ten exabytes of data, although it is unclear how much of that is YouTube videos.93 Google stores every video uploaded to the website in one of its twenty-three global Google data centers.94 Thus, YouTube hosts a wide range of traditional cultural property, such as COLUMBIA HUMAN RIGHTS LAW REVIEW [53.1 traditional Mongolian throat singing,95 traditional American Indian dance,96 and the Turkish Mevlevi Sema ceremony, in addition to born-digital cultural property.97 The website is similarly home to videos of substantial cultural importance to the internet as a whole.98 By virtue of its sheer size and popularity, YouTube's kaleidoscopic inventory carries substantial cultural importance. The Internet Archive, an American non-profit known for cataloging the internet through its Wayback Machine, provides a similar example.99 As of this writing, the website contains 475 billion webpages, 28 million books and texts, 14 million audio recordings, 3.5 million images, and 6 million videos, totaling over forty-five petabytes of server storage.100 ## 3. Cyberspace Today It is worth reflecting on the architecture of cyberspace and how cultural property fits into it. Cyberspace is\"[a] global domain within the information environment consisting of interdependent networks of information technology infrastructures and resident data, including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers.\"101 It is\"the sharedness of the virtual environment\"which forms the backbone of global telecommunications and media.102 The information age has produced an extraordinary amount of\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\nProtections for real-world cultural property from cyber-attacks are fairly straightforward. The 1907 Hague Regulations and the 1954 Hague Convention apply regardless of a parties' method of warfare.¹⁰⁷ Thus, it would be just as unlawful to use a cyberattack to cause a gas leak at an enemy's historic museum, thereby causing a fire to damage art, artifacts, and the building itself, as it would be to attack the museum with a cruise missile. The core principles animating the protection of cultural property persist NEUROMANCER 51 (1982) (\"Cyberspace. A consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators, in every nation, by children being taught mathematical concepts...A graphic representation of data abstracted from the banks of every computer in the human system... Lines of light ranged in the nonspace of the mind, clusters and constellations of data.\"); PETER KOLLOCK &amp; MARC A. SMITH, COMMUNITIES IN CYBERSPACE 3 (1999) (describing how cyberspace is defined by text chat, the World Wide Web, and graphical worlds, and how\"[i]n cyberspace the economies of interaction, communication, and coordination are different than when people meet face-to-face.\").\ndespite the changes in warfare.¹⁰⁸ However, the application of IHL to digital and digitized cultural property is more complex.\n## B. Current Protections in LOAC for Cultural Property are Insufficient As unsettled as IHL is in cyberspace, it is even more unsettled with regards to digital cultural property. Exacerbating this, states are expanding their cyber arsenals as state-launched cyber-attacks become more common.¹⁰⁹ Military units dedicated to computer network operations have risen from five units in 2000 to sixty-three in 2017, a number which is only expected to grow.¹¹⁰ Quantifying the number of cyber operations is almost as difficult as determining their legality in international law. Despite this, the Council on Foreign Relations estimates that state actors perpetrated approximately 480 cyberattacks from 2005 to 2019.¹¹¹ Cyberattacks can have disastrous consequences. Russia’s hack of SolarWinds and its government clients in March 2020—a hack so massive that its scope is still unknown¹¹²—is merely the latest demonstration of states’ ample cyber arsenals.¹¹³ Other examples are the WannaCry ransomware attack, which\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n## 1. The Extensive Use of Cyberspace for Cultural Property\nThere are numerous reasons why a state or non-state actor might target cultural property in cyberspace. States or non-state actors might conduct such attacks in \"campaigns of ethnic cleansing, identity-bound wars and iconoclastic actions.\"¹¹⁸ State and non-state actors might make cultural property part of their war aim, attack cultural property to gain tactical benefits or as a form of costly signaling, or seize cultural property for economic reasons.¹¹⁹ In 2014, North Korea allegedly hacked the U.S. film studio Sony Pictures, destroyed large quantities of data and exposed the personal information of Sony employees and management, showing the vulnerability of cultural data in cyberspace.¹²⁰ The attack was supposedly\nmotivated by Sony Pictures' release of a film deeply critical of North Korea which depicted the death of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.¹²¹ This is not to say that Seth Rogan and James Franco’s 2014 film *The Interview* is of such cultural importance as to warrant protection under international law,¹²² or that the 2014 Sony hack amounted to an armed attack or use of force,¹²³ but pictures-hack-explained/ (on file with the *Columbia Human Rights Law Review*); see also Tim McCormack, *The Sony and OPM Double Whammy: International Law and Cyber Attacks*, 18 SMU Sci. &amp; Tech. L. Rev. 379, 379–81 (2015) (discussing the ramifications of the Sony hack and various characterizations of the act).\nHowever, the threshold for what constitutes a use of force is fluid and heavily influenced by state practice. Schmitt, *The Law of Cyber Warfare*, supra note 10 (“Over time, the reaction of states to cyber operations, as well as how they characterize their own cyber operations, will inform the process of interpretive maturation.”) It is unclear whether data deletion of non-culturally significant data would amount to a use of force. TALLINN MANUAL 2.0., supra note 4 (“The development of further State practice notwithstanding, network intrusions, the deletion or destruction of data (even on a large scale), computer network exploitation, and data theft do not amount to a non-international armed conflict.”); Tim McCormack, *International Humanitarian Law and the Targeting of Data*, 94 INT’L L. STUD. 222, 237 (2018); Kubo Mačák, *Military Objectives 2.0: The Case for Interpreting Computer* 2021] Hard Drive Heritage Traditional cultural heritage institutions have also become increasingly digitized. In the past twenty years, virtual museums have exploded, with the development of both online-only museums and digitally augmented physical museums.¹²⁴ The Vatican offers 3D virtual tours, as do the Natural History Museum and National Gallery in London, the Dutch Rijksmuseum, the French Musée d'Orsay, and the American Getty Museum.¹²⁵ The American Smithsonian Natural History Museum offers virtual tours online and the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art boasts an impressive online digital collection.¹²⁶ Online-only virtual museums—such as the WebMuseum, the Swedish Internetmuseum, and the National Digital Repository for Museums of India—offer unique access to digital materials and challenge pre-existing notions of cultural heritage institutions.¹²⁷ The advent of immersive virtual and augmented reality provides a new form of access to cultural property, but also creates “a means to produce new forms of art.”¹²⁸ For example, the Petersen Automotive Museum uses virtual reality Data as Objects Under International Humanitarian Law, 48 ISRAELI L. REV. 55, 56 (2015) (“This article argues in favour of a broad understanding of the notion of ‘object’, bringing data within the scope of the rules on military objectives as codified in Additional Protocol I to the 1949 Geneva Conventions.”).\nCOLUMBIA HUMAN RIGHTS LAW REVIEW [53.1 and augmented reality to allow visitors to virtually view historic cars,¹²⁹ the National Museum of Finland uses virtual reality to allow visitors to step inside a painting,¹³⁰ and visitors to the British Museum can digitally handle Bronze Age artifacts through virtual reality technology.¹³¹ Virtual museums further the preservation of and access to cultural property and heritage, challenging notions of authenticity and transforming museums from silos of objects to interactive purveyors of information.¹³² Despite these significant changes in the preservation and presentation of cultural property, IHL has failed to adapt.\nRecognizing the threat of cyberattacks, states are already taking steps to back up their critical data. In 2017, Estonia announced that it was creating the world's first\"data embassy\"in Luxembourg, opening a high-security data center under Estonian control to ensure data continuity in the event of a cyber-attack, natural disaster, or conventional attack on Estonia.¹³³ Additionally, the Assistant Director-General of the National Archives of Australia published a report on the threat that cyber vulnerabilities pose to the nation's archives, galleries, and libraries, and thus Australia's national heritage.¹³⁴ These cultural institutions are so critical that one interesting\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage",
    "III. Interpreting International Law to Protect Cultural Property in Cyberspace": "## A. Digital and Digitized Cultural Property as Archives\nA new interpretation of international law is the most effective way to extend international law to cyberspace. Because belligerents are reluctant to acknowledge their actions in cyberspace—indeed, ostensible anonymity and difficulty attributing cyber operations to a state or non-state actor is part of the appeal of cyber operations—it is unlikely that customary international law will bring order to the cyber arena.¹³⁶ The ossification of customary international law requires open state practice driven by a sense of international obligation. This is unlikely to occur in cyberwarfare where states engage in highly classified cyber operations in relative anonymity.¹³⁷ Furthermore, without grievous cyberattacks affecting large numbers of states equally, international political will would likely be insufficient to produce a new treaty to regulate armed conflict in cyberspace, let alone clarify digital cultural property’s status in international humanitarian law. As a result, interpretations of existing legal instruments and principles will likely define the evolution of international law in cyberspace.¹³⁸ These interpretations may come through formal statements by states as to their legal position or their armed forces’ manuals on the laws of war.¹³⁹ Additionally, “[o]ver time, the reaction of states to cyber operations, as well as how they characterize their own cyber operations, will inform the process of interpretive maturation.”¹⁴⁰\nThis Note argues that digital and digitized cultural property are data of cultural importance 141 that fall under the 1954 Hague Convention's protections for culturally significant archives and records.

Belligerents’ Obligations Towards Digital and Digitized Cultural Property Although digital cultural property should fall within the scope of the law of armed conflict, novel characteristics of the cyber domain alter what obligations belligerents have towards cultural property. In the current international legal regime, states have the following core obligations to cultural property: 1) states are prohibited from targeting cultural property or directing “acts of hostility [towards it]”;¹⁷⁴ 2) states are prohibited from using cultural property in a way that would imperil it; 3) states are prohibited from plundering or looting cultural property or from making reprisals against it; and 4) states are obliged to stop the theft, pillage, misappropriation, and vandalism of cultural property.¹⁷⁵ These obligations, rooted in the 1954 Hague Convention and customary international law, are core protections for cultural property and heritage.¹⁷⁶\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\nCOLUMBIA HUMAN RIGHTS LAW REVIEW [53.1 sinisterly, the BBC reported in 2019 on how the People's Republic of China was encouraging its citizens to edit Wikipedia entries on several sensitive topics, to\"reflect our voices and opinions in the entry, so as to objectively and truly reflect the influence of Chinese path and Chinese thoughts on other countries and history.\"185 Approximately 1,600 edits were made to Wikipedia pages for Hong Kong, Taiwan, the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, and nineteen other politically sensitive articles, although no coordinated cyber operation was uncovered.186 One way to determine when state activity in cyberspace impermissibly disrupts cultural property is a sliding scale analysis: how much of an effect does the military operation have on the digital cultural property? A group of soldiers stealing, defacing, or destroying one book or document from an archive likely has a de minimis effect on the entirety of the archive. Similarly, a proper analysis might be to what degree a cyber operation affects the entirety of a cultural data set. North Korea might decide to selectively edit the Wikipedia page of Kim Jong-un as part of an information operation, but that would be far less damaging than a broad cyber operation defacing or deleting large quantities of Wikipedia, or any other interactive cultural data set. It would be important to consider the ease of repair as well. For instance, digitized cultural data might be the sole remnant of lost cultural property, and thus critical for reconstruction, similar to how eighteen century art was essential to reconstructing Warsaw's Old Town after World War II.187 In the twenty-first century, cultural heritage experts are repairing the damage done by ISIS by using crowdsourced images of Mosul and historic sites in the Levant to 3D print lost artifacts and reproduce destroyed urban environments in virtual reality.188 Respect for these 3D prints and images during warfare is critical, as they are the last remnants of now-destroyed cultural property.\nStates' other obligations towards cultural property translate well into cyberspace.

Traditionally, states would claim ownership over real-world cultural property within their borders. For example, the Taj Mahal is a UNESCO World Heritage Site²⁰³ that has special cultural importance to India, where it is located. Most nations seek to control their cultural property in the interest of its “retention, preservation, study, enjoyment, and exploitation.”²⁰⁴ This may be the case for digital cultural property as well,²⁰⁵ but others might be content with storing digital cultural property on a server in another country. International law’s focus on cultural internationalism simplifies this issue.²⁰⁶ Insofar as cultural property is the “cultural heritage of all mankind,”²⁰⁷ a state must protect digital cultural property within its territory regardless of its cultural origin. Museums across the world already do this; for example, the MET Digital Collection features scans of masks from\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n## C. Protections for Replicas of Cultural Property in Cyberspace: Addressing Counter-Arguments\nA common question scholars pose is how digital technologies affect the authenticity of art.²¹¹ German philosopher Walter Benjamin argued that each work of art possesses a unique “aura” which mechanical reproduction erases, and thus, reproduction destroys the work’s authenticity.²¹² This is undeniably a motivation for protecting real-world cultural property and it is why reproductions often fail to stand in for stolen cultural property.²¹³ Humanity yearns for cultural objects because they are true and certain and possess some kind of uniqueness.²¹⁴ In addition to serving as surrogates,\n[53.1 digital objects are material in their own right, existing in space and time independently of that which they replicate.²¹⁵ For example, where once a photograph was seen as a simulacrum, “it has now attained a status of its own as a creative work as well as value as a historical document, along with its archival and interpretive roles. Photographs, according to Roland Barthes, radiate an aura, a distance, reference to a past and memory.”²¹⁶ However, authenticity is not the only reason why cultural property is considered worth preserving. Cultural property contains a society’s memories, brings substantial economic benefits through the antiquities trade or tourism, fosters a sense of community and identity, and by extension, has political value.²¹⁷ This is to say nothing of the value digitized reproductions have as a means of preservation and access, or how societies are capable of creating complex emotional relationships with replicas.²¹⁸ The strongest argument against interpreting LOAC to protect digital and digitized cultural property is that data is easily reproducible and disseminated, making its destruction exceedingly difficult and legal protections unnecessary. The Tallinn Manual 2.0, an influential academic publication outlining international law in cyberspace, incorporates this point; it argues that belligerents “must respect and protect cultural property that may be affected by cyber operations or that is located in cyberspace.”²¹⁹ However, the Manual continues, “[p]rotection only applies to digital copies or versions where the original is either inaccessible or has been destroyed,\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\nThe\"replication\"argument fails for several reasons. First, the fact that cultural property may be lodged on a hard drive somewhere else in the world does not mean that it is or will be. Even accepting the replication argument as valid fails to recognize the peacetime duty to preserve and protect cultural property, which is recognized under the Hague Convention.²²² Digital cultural property is easily duplicated and stored, but this does not eliminate the need for a legal duty to duplicate and store digital cultural property. There are numerous examples of digital cultural works being lost or nearly lost because of a failure to maintain proper backups.²²³ Even the existence of a backup is no guarantee if the data storage is centralized, as a conventional attack on a data center could destroy all existing copies of a culturally significant file.²²⁴ Such a conventional attack is not unlikely, as military and civilian internet infrastructure are largely interconnected.²²⁵ For example, Microsoft has contracted to store 80% of Department of Defense data and applications, making it difficult to distinguish between military and civilian targets.²²⁶ In addition to their peacetime duty to duplicate digital cultural property, belligerents during an armed conflict have to engage in a foreseeability analysis before conducting certain cyber operations to determine whether the digital cultural property they might jeopardize has in fact been duplicated, or even if it is endangered. Belligerents already use this test to determine the lawfulness of a target in the absence of notice of its cultural importance.²²⁷ Second, the texts of the Hague Convention and the Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions refute this argument. The Hague Convention explicitly protects “important collections of books or archives or of reproductions,” so copies of digital cultural property would likely warrant protection.²²⁸ During the Convention’s negotiations, the delegates from Switzerland and France insisted on the inclusion of protections for reproductions, “so that future generations would at least have the opportunity of seeing photographs of such works if the originals had been destroyed.”²²⁹ Additional Protocols I and II to the Geneva Convention outlaw “any acts of hostility directed against” cultural property.²³⁰ Applying this language, ICTY in Prosecutor v. Jokic, which concerned Yugoslav attacks on the Old Town of Dubrovnik, a UNESCO World Heritage site, concluded that Additional Protocols I and II prohibit attacks on cultural property “whether or not the attacks result in actual damage.”²³¹ Following this reasoning, LOAC\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\nThird, and most importantly, domestic copyright laws can impede the dissemination of cultural data, making it far more complicated than simply copying files.²³³ Copyright generally prohibits the reproduction of copyrighted work, whether for profit or not.²³⁴ For example, in the United States, archives and libraries are limited in their ability to reproduce copyrighted materials, and the number of copies they can make depends on the time remaining on the copyright, whether the material is unpublished, and whether the work is subject to “commercial exploitation.”²³⁵ This is further complicated by substantial differences in national intellectual property (“IP”) legal regimes, which may or may not inhibit the reproduction and preservation of cultural heritage, and to what extent copyright can cover cultural data.²³⁶ However, “[t]he traditional point of view of museums, no [https://perma.cc/G48W-79AW]. “For a violation of the article to take place it is therefore not necessary for there to be any damage.” Id.\nmatter where they are located, has been that IP, in particular copyright, has inhibited their ability to carry out their mission and mandate.”²³⁷ Domestic IP regimes undercut the assumption that cultural heritage institutions can replicate cultural data *ad infinitum* as a means of eliminating practical threats to digital and digitized cultural property. The intricacies of domestic IP laws cut against any presumption that digital cultural property, wherever located, will have backups, and thus counsels in favor of protecting digital cultural property in the event of an armed conflict.\n## 1. Copyright Law and the Problems It Presents for Digital Cultural Heritage Current cultural property law regimes impede the replication of digital cultural property. For instance, most digital cultural property is available in encrypted formats, which ties the digital goods to a specific account to prevent duplication; as a result, cultural heritage institutions are capable of licensing these digital goods, but they are unable to create archival copies until the expiration of the copyright.²³⁸ The Digital Millennium Copyright Act makes circumventing these technical measures against duplication a federal crime punishable by up to five years in prison.²³⁹ As a result, GLAMs must often wait ninety-five years after a work’s publication—or seventy years after the death of the author—to produce an archival copy,²⁴⁰ by which point the cultural property will likely have been lost to technological obsolescence, degraded hard drives, human error, or malicious attacks.²⁴¹ According to the Library of Congress, this has happened before. Because film studios lacked the resources, the foresight, or the commercial museums can make and the purposes for which museums can digitize culture property.

Edwards, *supra* note 238.\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage Copyright holders, as opposed to GLAMs, might produce backups of their work, but that is up to the copyright holder's discretion; a possessive copyright holder might actively hinder any reproductions. Take Star Wars, a film included in the Library of Congress's National Film Registry because of its historical and cultural significance.²⁴⁴ Since the theatrical release of A New Hope in 1977, George Lucas, and later Disney, made several alterations to the film, including introducing Computer Generated Imagery (\"CGI\"), adding entirely new scenes, altering the sound mixing and color palette, and including entirely new lines.²⁴⁵ George Lucas has publicly stated that he only wants his updated versions of the film to survive and Disney has continued that policy.²⁴⁶ As a result, the only digital versions of the original cut of A New Hope are fan-made and arguably constitute copyright infringement.²⁴⁷ In its current form, copyright places the preservation of cultural heritage at the whims of the copyright holder, making it difficult for belligerents in an armed conflict to presume that they can target digital cultural property haphazardly.\nA Library of Congress report on copyright laws from the United Kingdom, Australia, the Netherlands, and the United States concluded that “[a]lthough copyright and related laws are not the only obstacle to digital preservation activities, there is no question that those laws present significant challenges.”²⁴⁸ None of the jurisdictions surveyed have a uniform system for collecting digital materials, none of the exceptions to copyright laws for GLAMs were designed for digital preservation, and exceptions to copyright law for GLAMs are wildly inconsistent across jurisdictions.²⁴⁹ International copyright treaties are of little help in ensuring the preservation of cultural heritage. For example, the Berne Convention and the WIPO Copyright Treaty merely allow for states to permit reproduction “[p]rovided that such reproduction does not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work and does not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the author.”²⁵⁰ This labyrinth of copyright law makes it legally dubious to rely on random reproductions to protect digital and digitized cultural property.\nFinally, the rise in non-fungible tokens (“NFTs”) have made certain copies of digital art unique, and thus irreproducible, through blockchain technology.²⁵¹ NFTs thus make digital goods artificially scarce, causing a boom in digital art while also making some digital cultural property completely unique. In March 2021, Beeple, the online name of Charleston-based artist Mike Winkelmann, sold a digital painting called “Everydays–The\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\nFor the purposes of digital cultural property, NFTs ensure the authenticity of a piece of digital art. For example, the Mona Lisa is clearly protected cultural property under international law, but prints of da Vinci's masterpiece sold at the Louvre gift shop are not. NFTs offer an opportunity to authenticate certain works of digital cultural property and accord them protection under LOAC, while rendering non-NFT copies lawful targets. Because an NFT is an inherently unique entry on a blockchain ledger, it cannot be reproduced beyond the quantity specified by the NFT creator.²⁵⁸ As the primary means of ensuring authenticity in digital art, NFTs are likely the future of digital art, and thus ought to be protected under the laws of war.\nCOLUMBIA HUMAN RIGHTS LAW REVIEW [53.1 # D. How to Protect Digital Cultural Property in Practice The question remains of how to ensure the Hague Convention and its Additional Protocols, as well as the Geneva Convention and its Additional Protocols, carry weight. One idea might be technical solutions. Articles 16 and 17 of the 1954 Hague Convention establish a distinctive marking to identify physical cultural property and to provide notice to all parties of the property's protected status.²⁵⁹ This could easily be adapted into a number of technical solutions, including file naming conventions and coding schemes to tag cultural data.²⁶⁰ Militaries have already developed no-strike lists for culturally significant sites, which prevented the destruction of ancient monuments by Coalition Forces during the First Gulf War and the 2011 Libya Intervention.²⁶¹ Such no-strike lists might extend to certain servers, data centers, or IP addresses housing culturally significant data. Additionally, a published register of IP addresses, analogous to already-extant national or international registers of cultural property, would help provide notice and further remove cultural property from hostilities in cyberspace.²⁶² By segregating the civilian internet from the locus of military operations, states can better preserve digital cultural property in an armed conflict. At a minimum, states ought to ensure digital cultural data is preserved through at least some basic cybersecurity provisions as a means of fulfilling their peacetime obligations under Article 3 of the 1954 Hague Convention.²⁶³ International collaboration is also key to preserving digital cultural property. As part of their peacetime obligations under the 1954 Hague Convention, public cultural agencies and ministries could collaborate\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\nWhen responding to attacks on cultural property, states might also collaborate to overcome the difficulties of attribution in cyberspace. Because of technical advancements in recent years, successfully attributing major cyberattacks to individual perpetrators has gone from impossible to probable.²⁶⁸ By establishing an international evidentiary standard for cyberattack attribution, states can legitimately deter hostile states and ensure legal liability for law-breaking individuals.²⁶⁹ Additionally, states might share evidence with each other, or in collaboration with the private sector, as part of an international attribution mechanism.²⁷⁰ While such COLUMBIA HUMAN RIGHTS LAW REVIEW [53.1 proposals have largely focused on *jus ad bellum* concerns, attribution is equally critical to *jus in bello* issues, such as protecting cultural property.²⁷¹ The COVID-19 pandemic has made protections for digital cultural property all the more salient. In April 2020, 130 ministers of culture from around the world met virtually through Zoom to discuss the impact of the pandemic on the culture sector.²⁷² During the pandemic, “86% of countries... closed or partially closed their World Heritage Sites and 90% of museums... were closed.”²⁷³ Saudi Arabia, India, Colombia, Estonia, Greece, Albania, and Belize all emphasized the need to transition to digital cultural platforms and provide financial support for digital cultural production.²⁷⁴ “A large share of countries, including Kenya, Mexico and Lithuania, have made the digital transition one of the cornerstones of their cultural policy...”²⁷⁵ while other states, such as Serbia, Botswana, Cyprus, and Andorra questioned how this digital transformation would affect copyright protections.²⁷⁶ There was a general consensus among states that “[t]he digital transition must be the subject of global reflection and international regulation,”²⁷⁷ and that the digital cultural transition would certainly accelerate moving forward.²⁷⁸ ## CONCLUSION By framing digital and digitized cultural property as archives and records, existing international treaties can provide some degree of legal protection to this rapidly growing form of cultural heritage. This protection is particularly valuable, given the lack of an international effort to expand cultural heritage protections in the law of armed conflict. Because of the lack of a political will to create a new treaty for cultural property in cyberspace, states, international organizations, and scholars should further pursue novel interpretations to protect cultural heritage and adjust their policies\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\nThe emergence of digital cultural property raises further interesting questions surrounding international human rights law and its intersection with cultural heritage and cyberspace. To the extent that participation in cultural life creates a human right to cultural heritage,[279] and insofar as internet access is a human right,[280] protections for digital cultural property might also emerge from international human rights law, in addition to international humanitarian law. The use of an international human rights framework could bolster protections for digital cultural heritage in peacetime to a greater degree than international humanitarian law. Raising interesting questions surrounding privacy, sovereignty, intellectual property, and the freedom of expression, the use of a human rights [53.1 framework to protect digital cultural heritage and property is a promising subject for future research.",
    "__postscript__": "## A. Digital and Digitized Cultural Property as Archives\nA new interpretation of international law is the most effective way to extend international law to cyberspace. Because belligerents are reluctant to acknowledge their actions in cyberspace—indeed, ostensible anonymity and difficulty attributing cyber operations to a state or non-state actor is part of the appeal of cyber operations—it is unlikely that customary international law will bring order to the cyber arena.¹³⁶ The ossification of customary international law requires open state practice driven by a sense of international obligation. This is unlikely to occur in cyberwarfare where states engage in highly classified cyber operations in relative anonymity.¹³⁷ Furthermore, without grievous cyberattacks affecting large numbers of states equally, international political will would likely be insufficient to produce a new treaty to regulate armed conflict in cyberspace, let alone clarify digital cultural property’s status in international humanitarian law. As a result, interpretations of existing legal instruments and principles will likely define the evolution of international law in cyberspace.¹³⁸ These interpretations may come through formal statements by states as to their legal position or their armed forces’ manuals on the laws of war.¹³⁹ Additionally, “[o]ver time, the reaction of states to cyber operations, as well as how they characterize their own cyber operations, will inform the process of interpretive maturation.”¹⁴⁰\nThis Note argues that digital and digitized cultural property are data of cultural importance 141 that fall under the 1954 Hague Convention's protections for culturally significant archives and records.

Conflict of Interest Editing on Wikipedia, WIKIPEDIA (Nov. 9, 2021), https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-of-interest_editing_on_Wikipedia#Microsoft [https://perma.cc/MND8-PKXX].\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\nHowever, a DDOS attack might be considered an “act of hostility” within the meaning of the Additional Protocols to the Geneva Convention IV.¹⁹² Additional Protocol II does not protect archives or libraries, but instead protects “historic monuments, works of art, or places of worship which constitute the cultural or spiritual heritage of peoples.”¹⁹³ At the same time, the ICRC interprets the Additional Protocols to incorporate the 1954 Hague Convention’s definition of cultural heritage and property, which would extend protections for cultural property despite the Additional Protocols’ text not mentioning archives.¹⁹⁴ According to the ICRC, an “act of hostility” need not have a substantive effect on the cultural property itself, so long as it is “directed against” the cultural property.¹⁹⁵ Indeed, if a DDOS attack qualifies as an “act of hostility,” then Additional Protocols I and II and the 1954 Hague Convention would prohibit it.¹⁹⁶ Thus, it is conceivable that IHL would prohibit a DDOS attack on digital cultural property.¹⁹⁷ Another major issue in international legal obligations comes from how data challenges the territoriality of the 1954 Hague Convention.¹⁹⁸ While territorial location does not affect customary international legal obligation to refrain from damaging cultural property during armed conflict,¹⁹⁹ the Convention requires parties to “undertake to prepare in time of peace for the safeguarding of cultural property situated within their own territory against the foreseeable effects of an armed conflict...”²⁰⁰ Articles 12 and 13 of the Convention outline specific provisions for the safety of cultural property during transport.²⁰¹ However, data, unlike physical cultural property, rapidly crosses international boundaries along pre-determined paths and is often highly divisible.²⁰² A reasonable interpretation of states’ peacetime obligation might include replicating cultural data that resides in their territory for a substantial time or replicating cultural property of particular importance to the state’s own culture.\nThis shift in established notions of territoriality has additional implications. Traditionally, states would claim ownership over real-world cultural property within their borders. For example, the Taj Mahal is a UNESCO World Heritage Site²⁰³ that has special cultural importance to India, where it is located. Most nations seek to control their cultural property in the interest of its “retention, preservation, study, enjoyment, and exploitation.”²⁰⁴ This may be the case for digital cultural property as well,²⁰⁵ but others might be content with storing digital cultural property on a server in another country. International law’s focus on cultural internationalism simplifies this issue.²⁰⁶ Insofar as cultural property is the “cultural heritage of all mankind,”²⁰⁷ a state must protect digital cultural property within its territory regardless of its cultural origin. Museums across the world already do this; for example, the MET Digital Collection features scans of masks from\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n## C. Protections for Replicas of Cultural Property in Cyberspace: Addressing Counter-Arguments\nA common question scholars pose is how digital technologies affect the authenticity of art.²¹¹ German philosopher Walter Benjamin argued that each work of art possesses a unique “aura” which mechanical reproduction erases, and thus, reproduction destroys the work’s authenticity.²¹² This is undeniably a motivation for protecting real-world cultural property and it is why reproductions often fail to stand in for stolen cultural property.²¹³ Humanity yearns for cultural objects because they are true and certain and possess some kind of uniqueness.²¹⁴ In addition to serving as surrogates,\n[53.1 digital objects are material in their own right, existing in space and time independently of that which they replicate.²¹⁵ For example, where once a photograph was seen as a simulacrum, “it has now attained a status of its own as a creative work as well as value as a historical document, along with its archival and interpretive roles. Photographs, according to Roland Barthes, radiate an aura, a distance, reference to a past and memory.”²¹⁶ However, authenticity is not the only reason why cultural property is considered worth preserving. Cultural property contains a society’s memories, brings substantial economic benefits through the antiquities trade or tourism, fosters a sense of community and identity, and by extension, has political value.²¹⁷ This is to say nothing of the value digitized reproductions have as a means of preservation and access, or how societies are capable of creating complex emotional relationships with replicas.²¹⁸ The strongest argument against interpreting LOAC to protect digital and digitized cultural property is that data is easily reproducible and disseminated, making its destruction exceedingly difficult and legal protections unnecessary. The Tallinn Manual 2.0, an influential academic publication outlining international law in cyberspace, incorporates this point; it argues that belligerents “must respect and protect cultural property that may be affected by cyber operations or that is located in cyberspace.”²¹⁹ However, the Manual continues, “[p]rotection only applies to digital copies or versions where the original is either inaccessible or has been destroyed,\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\nThe\"replication\"argument fails for several reasons. First, the fact that cultural property may be lodged on a hard drive somewhere else in the world does not mean that it is or will be. Even accepting the replication argument as valid fails to recognize the peacetime duty to preserve and protect cultural property, which is recognized under the Hague Convention.²²² Digital cultural property is easily duplicated and stored, but this does not eliminate the need for a legal duty to duplicate and store digital cultural property. There are numerous examples of digital cultural works being lost or nearly lost because of a failure to maintain proper backups.²²³ Even the existence of a backup is no guarantee if the data storage is centralized, as a conventional attack on a data center could destroy all existing copies of a culturally significant file.²²⁴ Such a conventional attack is not unlikely, as military and civilian internet infrastructure are largely interconnected.²²⁵ For example, Microsoft has contracted to store 80% of Department of Defense data and applications, making it difficult to distinguish between military and civilian targets.²²⁶ In addition to their peacetime duty to duplicate digital cultural property, belligerents during an armed conflict have to engage in a foreseeability analysis before conducting certain cyber operations to determine whether the digital cultural property they might jeopardize has in fact been duplicated, or even if it is endangered. Belligerents already use this test to determine the lawfulness of a target in the absence of notice of its cultural importance.²²⁷ Second, the texts of the Hague Convention and the Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions refute this argument. The Hague Convention explicitly protects “important collections of books or archives or of reproductions,” so copies of digital cultural property would likely warrant protection.²²⁸ During the Convention’s negotiations, the delegates from Switzerland and France insisted on the inclusion of protections for reproductions, “so that future generations would at least have the opportunity of seeing photographs of such works if the originals had been destroyed.”²²⁹ Additional Protocols I and II to the Geneva Convention outlaw “any acts of hostility directed against” cultural property.²³⁰ Applying this language, ICTY in Prosecutor v. Jokic, which concerned Yugoslav attacks on the Old Town of Dubrovnik, a UNESCO World Heritage site, concluded that Additional Protocols I and II prohibit attacks on cultural property “whether or not the attacks result in actual damage.”²³¹ Following this reasoning, LOAC\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\nThird, and most importantly, domestic copyright laws can impede the dissemination of cultural data, making it far more complicated than simply copying files.²³³ Copyright generally prohibits the reproduction of copyrighted work, whether for profit or not.²³⁴ For example, in the United States, archives and libraries are limited in their ability to reproduce copyrighted materials, and the number of copies they can make depends on the time remaining on the copyright, whether the material is unpublished, and whether the work is subject to “commercial exploitation.”²³⁵ This is further complicated by substantial differences in national intellectual property (“IP”) legal regimes, which may or may not inhibit the reproduction and preservation of cultural heritage, and to what extent copyright can cover cultural data.²³⁶ However, “[t]he traditional point of view of museums, no [https://perma.cc/G48W-79AW]. “For a violation of the article to take place it is therefore not necessary for there to be any damage.” Id.\nmatter where they are located, has been that IP, in particular copyright, has inhibited their ability to carry out their mission and mandate.”²³⁷ Domestic IP regimes undercut the assumption that cultural heritage institutions can replicate cultural data *ad infinitum* as a means of eliminating practical threats to digital and digitized cultural property. The intricacies of domestic IP laws cut against any presumption that digital cultural property, wherever located, will have backups, and thus counsels in favor of protecting digital cultural property in the event of an armed conflict.\n## 1. Copyright Law and the Problems It Presents for Digital Cultural Heritage Current cultural property law regimes impede the replication of digital cultural property. For instance, most digital cultural property is available in encrypted formats, which ties the digital goods to a specific account to prevent duplication; as a result, cultural heritage institutions are capable of licensing these digital goods, but they are unable to create archival copies until the expiration of the copyright.²³⁸ The Digital Millennium Copyright Act makes circumventing these technical measures against duplication a federal crime punishable by up to five years in prison.²³⁹ As a result, GLAMs must often wait ninety-five years after a work’s publication—or seventy years after the death of the author—to produce an archival copy,²⁴⁰ by which point the cultural property will likely have been lost to technological obsolescence, degraded hard drives, human error, or malicious attacks.²⁴¹ According to the Library of Congress, this has happened before. Because film studios lacked the resources, the foresight, or the commercial museums can make and the purposes for which museums can digitize culture property.

Edwards, *supra* note 238.\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage Copyright holders, as opposed to GLAMs, might produce backups of their work, but that is up to the copyright holder's discretion; a possessive copyright holder might actively hinder any reproductions. Take Star Wars, a film included in the Library of Congress's National Film Registry because of its historical and cultural significance.²⁴⁴ Since the theatrical release of A New Hope in 1977, George Lucas, and later Disney, made several alterations to the film, including introducing Computer Generated Imagery (\"CGI\"), adding entirely new scenes, altering the sound mixing and color palette, and including entirely new lines.²⁴⁵ George Lucas has publicly stated that he only wants his updated versions of the film to survive and Disney has continued that policy.²⁴⁶ As a result, the only digital versions of the original cut of A New Hope are fan-made and arguably constitute copyright infringement.²⁴⁷ In its current form, copyright places the preservation of cultural heritage at the whims of the copyright holder, making it difficult for belligerents in an armed conflict to presume that they can target digital cultural property haphazardly.\nA Library of Congress report on copyright laws from the United Kingdom, Australia, the Netherlands, and the United States concluded that “[a]lthough copyright and related laws are not the only obstacle to digital preservation activities, there is no question that those laws present significant challenges.”²⁴⁸ None of the jurisdictions surveyed have a uniform system for collecting digital materials, none of the exceptions to copyright laws for GLAMs were designed for digital preservation, and exceptions to copyright law for GLAMs are wildly inconsistent across jurisdictions.²⁴⁹ International copyright treaties are of little help in ensuring the preservation of cultural heritage. For example, the Berne Convention and the WIPO Copyright Treaty merely allow for states to permit reproduction “[p]rovided that such reproduction does not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work and does not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the author.”²⁵⁰ This labyrinth of copyright law makes it legally dubious to rely on random reproductions to protect digital and digitized cultural property.\nFinally, the rise in non-fungible tokens (“NFTs”) have made certain copies of digital art unique, and thus irreproducible, through blockchain technology.²⁵¹ NFTs thus make digital goods artificially scarce, causing a boom in digital art while also making some digital cultural property completely unique. In March 2021, Beeple, the online name of Charleston-based artist Mike Winkelmann, sold a digital painting called “Everydays–The\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\nFor the purposes of digital cultural property, NFTs ensure the authenticity of a piece of digital art. For example, the Mona Lisa is clearly protected cultural property under international law, but prints of da Vinci's masterpiece sold at the Louvre gift shop are not. NFTs offer an opportunity to authenticate certain works of digital cultural property and accord them protection under LOAC, while rendering non-NFT copies lawful targets. Because an NFT is an inherently unique entry on a blockchain ledger, it cannot be reproduced beyond the quantity specified by the NFT creator.²⁵⁸ As the primary means of ensuring authenticity in digital art, NFTs are likely the future of digital art, and thus ought to be protected under the laws of war.\nCOLUMBIA HUMAN RIGHTS LAW REVIEW [53.1 # D. How to Protect Digital Cultural Property in Practice The question remains of how to ensure the Hague Convention and its Additional Protocols, as well as the Geneva Convention and its Additional Protocols, carry weight. One idea might be technical solutions. Articles 16 and 17 of the 1954 Hague Convention establish a distinctive marking to identify physical cultural property and to provide notice to all parties of the property's protected status.²⁵⁹ This could easily be adapted into a number of technical solutions, including file naming conventions and coding schemes to tag cultural data.²⁶⁰ Militaries have already developed no-strike lists for culturally significant sites, which prevented the destruction of ancient monuments by Coalition Forces during the First Gulf War and the 2011 Libya Intervention.²⁶¹ Such no-strike lists might extend to certain servers, data centers, or IP addresses housing culturally significant data. Additionally, a published register of IP addresses, analogous to already-extant national or international registers of cultural property, would help provide notice and further remove cultural property from hostilities in cyberspace.²⁶² By segregating the civilian internet from the locus of military operations, states can better preserve digital cultural property in an armed conflict. At a minimum, states ought to ensure digital cultural data is preserved through at least some basic cybersecurity provisions as a means of fulfilling their peacetime obligations under Article 3 of the 1954 Hague Convention.²⁶³ International collaboration is also key to preserving digital cultural property. As part of their peacetime obligations under the 1954 Hague Convention, public cultural agencies and ministries could collaborate\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\nWhen responding to attacks on cultural property, states might also collaborate to overcome the difficulties of attribution in cyberspace. Because of technical advancements in recent years, successfully attributing major cyberattacks to individual perpetrators has gone from impossible to probable.²⁶⁸ By establishing an international evidentiary standard for cyberattack attribution, states can legitimately deter hostile states and ensure legal liability for law-breaking individuals.²⁶⁹ Additionally, states might share evidence with each other, or in collaboration with the private sector, as part of an international attribution mechanism.²⁷⁰ While such COLUMBIA HUMAN RIGHTS LAW REVIEW [53.1 proposals have largely focused on *jus ad bellum* concerns, attribution is equally critical to *jus in bello* issues, such as protecting cultural property.²⁷¹ The COVID-19 pandemic has made protections for digital cultural property all the more salient. In April 2020, 130 ministers of culture from around the world met virtually through Zoom to discuss the impact of the pandemic on the culture sector.²⁷² During the pandemic, “86% of countries... closed or partially closed their World Heritage Sites and 90% of museums... were closed.”²⁷³ Saudi Arabia, India, Colombia, Estonia, Greece, Albania, and Belize all emphasized the need to transition to digital cultural platforms and provide financial support for digital cultural production.²⁷⁴ “A large share of countries, including Kenya, Mexico and Lithuania, have made the digital transition one of the cornerstones of their cultural policy...”²⁷⁵ while other states, such as Serbia, Botswana, Cyprus, and Andorra questioned how this digital transformation would affect copyright protections.²⁷⁶ There was a general consensus among states that “[t]he digital transition must be the subject of global reflection and international regulation,”²⁷⁷ and that the digital cultural transition would certainly accelerate moving forward.²⁷⁸ ## CONCLUSION By framing digital and digitized cultural property as archives and records, existing international treaties can provide some degree of legal protection to this rapidly growing form of cultural heritage. This protection is particularly valuable, given the lack of an international effort to expand cultural heritage protections in the law of armed conflict. Because of the lack of a political will to create a new treaty for cultural property in cyberspace, states, international organizations, and scholars should further pursue novel interpretations to protect cultural heritage and adjust their policies\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\nThe emergence of digital cultural property raises further interesting questions surrounding international human rights law and its intersection with cultural heritage and cyberspace. To the extent that participation in cultural life creates a human right to cultural heritage,[279] and insofar as internet access is a human right,[280] protections for digital cultural property might also emerge from international human rights law, in addition to international humanitarian law. The use of an international human rights framework could bolster protections for digital cultural heritage in peacetime to a greater degree than international humanitarian law. Raising interesting questions surrounding privacy, sovereignty, intellectual property, and the freedom of expression, the use of a human rights [53.1 framework to protect digital cultural heritage and property is a promising subject for future research."

He spent his life as the Chief of Antiquities at the historic site of Palmyra in Syria, his hometown, where he protected one of the world's best-preserved archaeological sites—until ISIS seized his home and took him hostage.¹ After a month of torture, the terrorist group publicly beheaded Khaled al-Asaad for refusing to reveal the location of hidden antiquities.² Khaled al-Assad's sacrifice demonstrates the importance of cultural property to humanity: it is not only a record of humanity, but a fundamental pillar supporting it. Cultural property is so indispensable and so invaluable to humankind that the law must shield it from the bombs and bloodshed of war, just as Khaled al-Assad did. Yet, one hundred years from now, the artifacts worth dying for will not only be physical but also digital, made of code rather than stone or steel.³ This Note aims to address the fundamental question of how humanity will protect this new form of cultural property during armed conflicts.\nThere is widespread consensus that the law of armed conflict (\"LOAC\") applies to state and non-state actors in cyberspace, but there is far less consensus as to exactly how it applies.⁴ The application of settled principles of LOAC to cyber operations is a difficult one, as the cyber domain lacks the physical characteristics which have always marked battlefields.⁵ This has resulted in a great deal of literature discussing how the principles of proportionality,⁶ distinction,⁷ attribution,⁸ and neutrality⁹ can exist in cyberspace. The current intricacies of global politics have also complicated matters, as norms and interpretations of international law in cyberspace are continuously evolving to match shifting political and technical realities.¹⁰ This interpretive uncertainty has raised the question of how protection for cultural property under LOAC, a longstanding goal of international law, can extend to cyberspace.\nCultural property is protected under both treaty-based and customary international law.

This paper then contends that digital and digitized cultural property should be categorized as archives and ¹⁵. The specialized terminology surrounding this topic deserves clarification. It is worth clarifying the terms\"cultural property\"and\"cultural heritage.\"The two terms are almost always used interchangeably in international treaties and scholarship. While cultural property is an older term, it has largely been superseded by cultural heritage, which is conceptually oriented around preservation for future generations rather than the rights and powers of the possessor. The term cultural heritage also encompasses practices that do not fall within any definition of tangible or intangible cultural heritage, making it a broader category than cultural property, although the terms are often synonymous. For example, the Great Wall of China is cultural property that forms part of China's cultural heritage. Yet the practice of Chinese calligraphy, an intangible cultural tradition, is not cultural property despite being part of China's cultural heritage. However, unlike cultural heritage, cultural property has a clear legal meaning, defined in the 1954 Hague Convention and 1970 UNESCO Convention.

Place of Cultural Property in the Law of Armed Conflict ### A. Development of Protections for Cultural Property With some exceptions, the wanton destruction of cultural property and heritage in ancient and medieval warfare was commonplace, governed by the maxim “to the victor go the spoils.”²⁰ Athenian historian Xenophon wrote, “It is an eternal law the wide world over, that when a city is taken in war, the citizens, their persons, and all their property fall into the hands of the conquerors.”²¹ The Roman Triumph prominently featured stolen art from defeated enemies,²² the Bible repeatedly references the plundering of art and treasures as spoils of war,²³ and when the Mongols sacked Baghdad in 1258 and destroyed the city’s great libraries, they threw so many books especially in cyber space.

INT’L L. 643, 652 (2019); Michael Schmitt &amp; Sean Watts, *Beyond State-Centrism: International Law and Non-State Actors in Cyberspace*, 21 J. CONFLICT SEC. L. 595, 611 (2016) (“In many respects, the state-centric legal regime of public international law may seem ill-suited or even inadequate to address the challenges the super-empowered non-state actors of cyberspace present”). However, because state actors possess the most substantial capabilities in cyberspace and because IHL speaks with greater clarity on international armed conflicts, this paper focuses on international armed conflicts.\n²⁰. Or, as more eloquently phrased by Thucydides, “right, as the world goes, is only in question between equals in power, while the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must.” THUCYDIDES, *HISTORY OF THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 566–67* (Richard Crawley trans., *Floating Press* 2008) (Fourth century BCE).\n²¹.

Jeremiah 15:13 (King James) (“Thy substance and thy treasures will I give to the spoil without price, and that for all thy sins, even in all thy borders.”); 2 Chronicles 14:13-14 (“And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto Gerar... and they carried away very much spoil. And they smote all the cities round about Gerar... and they spoiled all the cities; for there was exceeding much spoil in them.”); see also Deuteronomy 20:10 (elaborating the practices of war and articulating divine endorsement of expropriating cultural property).\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage Yet some ancient thinkers and commanders took steps to exempt art, architecture, and houses of worship from the rampant destruction of civilian property. Greek historian Polybius wrote that while the destruction or taking of civilian property\"are necessary acts according to the laws and rights of war; to deface temples, statues, and such like erections in pure wantonness... must be regarded as an act of blind passion and insanity.\"²⁷ Cicero later used this line of reasoning to prosecute Gaius Verres in 70 BCE for expropriating artworks from temples and citizens during his governorship of Sicily.²⁸ To mitigate the damage of war to spiritual institutions, Frederick Barbarossa issued an edict in 1158 forbidding the pillaging of churches, although the ransacking of houses of worship remained ubiquitous in medieval warfare.²⁹ The Quran likewise prohibits fighting in sacred places, such as mosques and other houses of worship.³⁰ The Enlightenment marked a substantial shift in the treatment of cultural property and heritage in international legal thought.³¹ French jurist Emer de Vattel wrote that destroying cultural property renders a belligerent an enemy to all mankind and that “the wanton destruction of public monuments, temples, tombs, statues, paintings, &amp;c. [sic] is absolutely condemned, even by the voluntary law of nations, as never being conducive to the lawful object of war.”³² Reasoning that no party would gain from the destruction of cultural property, Vattel argued such destruction or expropriation was unlawful.³³ This protection complemented Vattel’s principle of moderation in warfare, especially regarding pillaging hostile territory. “All damage done to the enemy unnecessarily, every act of hostility which does not tend to procure victory and bring the war to a conclusion, is licentiousness condemned by the laws of nature.”³⁴ Drawing on Cicero and Polybius, influential Dutch jurist Hugo Grotius similarly argued for protecting cultural property under the laws of war. “Porticos, Temples, statues, and all other elegant works and monuments of art” are “of such a nature, as to contribute, no way, to the support and prolongation of war.”³⁵ As a result, Grotius thought belligerents ought to exercise moderation in their treatment of enemy civilian property generally and cultural property in particular.³⁶ Regardless, it would take the arrival of industrialized warfare to transform legal theory into legal agreements. The nineteenth century saw further refinement of the laws of war and its provisions concerning cultural property. The 1863 Lieber Code, a set of instructions issued to Union soldiers during the American Civil War, provided that “[c]lassical works of art, libraries, scientific collections, or precious instruments, such as astronomical telescopes, as well as hospitals, must be secured against all avoidable injury, even when they are contained in fortified places whilst besieged or bombarded.”³⁷ But the Lieber Code’s protection for such cultural property was limited at best; it also allowed for the seizure of cultural property by an invading or occupying force if it could remove cultural property without injury, with the determination of ownership left to the final peace conference.³⁸ Although it was not intended as a legal agreement, the Lieber Code nevertheless had an immense influence on the development of the laws\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\nBy the twentieth century, foundational international treaties on the laws of war began to give greater force to protections for cultural property. Article 56 of the 1907 Hague Convention states that, during an occupation, “[t]he property of municipalities, that of institutions dedicated to religion, charity and education, the arts and sciences, even when State property, shall be treated as private property.”⁴³ The treaty further mandates that “[a]ll seizure of, destruction or wilful [sic] damage done to institutions of this character, historic monuments, works of art and science, is forbidden, and should be made the subject of legal proceedings.”⁴⁴ Article 27 also requires that “all necessary steps must be taken to spare, as far as possible, buildings dedicated to religion, art, science, or charitable purposes, [and] historic monuments” and states that belligerents have a duty to clearly demarcate protected buildings or property.⁴⁵ However, the 1907 treaty proved ineffective at protecting cultural property during the Second World War, as Axis forces blatantly disregarded it.⁴⁶ The extensive looting of cultural treasures by the Nazi regime led to the creation of the 1954 Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict (“1954 Hague Convention”).⁴⁷ ## B. Hague Convention, Additional Protocols, and the Evolution of Cultural Property Protections The 1954 Hague Convention is a core treaty shielding cultural property in armed conflicts. It aims to prevent “damage to cultural property belonging to any people whatsoever…since each people makes its contribution to the culture of the world.”⁴⁸ The 1954 Convention, faced with “the developments in the technique of warfare” which exacerbated the dangers posed to cultural property, built on the 1907 framework by requiring states to secure cultural property during peacetime and prohibiting the destruction of cultural heritage witnessed in World War II.⁴⁹ The treaty defines cultural property as “movable or immovable property of great importance to the cultural heritage of every people.”⁵⁰ This includes, of Militarism in Postwar Japan, 33 JAPAN REV. 195. 195 (2019). However, the Nazi’s systematic campaign of looting and eradicating important cultural works was so extensive it resulted in charges at the Nuremberg Tribunal and led Allied forces to establish the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives Program (also referred to as the “Monuments Men”) to safeguard plundered cultural works. Sanja Zgonjanin, The Prosecution of War Crimes for the Destruction of Libraries and Archives During Times of Armed Conflict, 40 LIBR. &amp; CULTURE 128, 133–35 (2005); see generally ROBERT EDSEL &amp; BRETT WITTER, THE MONUMENTS MEN: ALLIED HEROES, NAZI THIEVES, AND THE GREATEST TREASURE HUNT IN HISTORY (2009).\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\nThe Convention clearly defines the scope of its protection, but there is no objective test for determining which monuments, buildings, or manuscripts IHL protects. The party in whose territory the property is situated determines its cultural importance, and thus whether it is legally protected—a determination which parties must make in good faith.53 Absent notice to opposing parties under Articles 3 and 6 of the Hague Convention—notice that is left up to the parties' discretion—belligerents must hazard an educated guess, weighed down with caution, as to any item's cultural importance.54 Belligerents must then\"respect cultural property\"by refraining from conduct that would expose it to destruction or damage and further have a duty to protect cultural property from vandalism, theft, or The other commonly used definition of cultural property in international law comes from the Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property of 1970, often referred to as the UNESCO Convention. That treaty defines cultural property with greater specificity and more expansively than the 1954 Convention, and, like the 1954 Convention, defers to parties' respective views of cultural importance. See Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property, art. 1, Nov. 14 1970, 823 U.N.T.S. 231, http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=130 39&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html [https://perma.cc/D53M-BHZK].\n\n[53.1 misappropriation.⁵⁵ Likewise, belligerents are forbidden from directing reprisals toward cultural property and from requisitioning it.⁵⁶ The adoption of Additional Protocols I and II to the 1949 Geneva Conventions in 1977 bolstered the 1954 Hague Convention and provided additional protections for cultural heritage.⁵⁷ In both international and non-international armed conflicts, these protocols prohibit “acts of hostility directed against the historic monuments, works of art or places of worship which constitute the cultural or spiritual heritage of peoples.”⁵⁸ The Additional Protocols to the Geneva Convention refer to objects which “constitute the cultural or spiritual heritage of peoples.” This is different than the Hague Convention’s protections for property which apply when an object is “of great importance to the cultural heritage.” However, the International Committee of the Red Cross (“ICRC”) has clarified that “the basic idea is the same.” The Additional Protocols cover “objects whose value transcends geographical boundaries, and which are unique in character and are intimately associated with the history and culture of a people.”⁵⁹ In addition to the aforementioned treaties, customary international law also protects cultural property. The International Committee of the Red Cross lists respect for cultural property during armed conflict as part of customary international law.⁶⁰ Belligerents are prohibited from using cultural property for military purposes except when required by military\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\nThe current regime for protecting cultural property in war has had mixed success. While the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) successfully led several prosecutions for the destruction of cultural property,63 recent terrorist attacks have destroyed similarly irreplaceable works of cultural property. In 2001, the Taliban destroyed the Bamiyan Buddhas, 1,500-year-old statues over 100 feet tall—which were then the largest in the world.64 The looting of the National Museum of Iraq in the wake of Operation Iraqi Freedom was another shameful chapter, and stolen artifacts continue to flood illicit antiquities markets fifteen years later.65 Pointing to these contemptible episodes, some scholars have criticized the 1954 Hague Convention as ineffective at preventing the loss of these cultural treasures, even as the 1954 Convention's Second Additional Protocol clearly extended its protections to non-state actors.66 The Hague Convention, Additional Protocol II, and the 1970 World Heritage Convention have concededly not protected every piece of cultural property, but surely they have saved some.67 Yet, because of these treaties, not only does the destruction of cultural property often yield widespread international COLUMBIA HUMAN RIGHTS LAW REVIEW [53.1 condemnation, but international tribunals have also imposed criminal liability for attacks on cultural property. \n## II. Protecting Cultural Property in Cyberspace ## A. Defining Digital and Digitized Cultural Property ## 1. Digitized Cultural Property As with almost everything else, advances in computing, digital storage, and connectivity have revolutionized the field of cultural heritage. Owing to these recent technological advancements, digitized cultural property—whereby tangible or intangible cultural heritage is transformed into information—has exploded in recent years as a method of preserving cultural heritage, offering novel educational opportunities and increasing public access. Digitized cultural property can take several forms, such as scanned texts, audio-visual recordings of music, and 3D renderings. Take, for instance, CyArk, a non-profit established in 2003 after the Taliban's destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas to\"digitally record, archive and share the world's most significant cultural heritage...\"CyArk uses high-tech laser scanning tools to create 3D models of cultural heritage, which it then draws on to create an\"immersive virtual reality environment.\"To date,\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\nThis digitization push includes not only tangible but also intangible cultural property.78 For example, motion capture technology has allowed the digitization of traditional Japanese dances, allowing master performers to study their craft in a new way while also allowing for the archiving of cultural practices and events.79 Additionally, novel digital technologies offer a promising pathway for communities to preserve their cultural heritage, whether it be the oral narratives and song traditions of indigenous communities in Canada⁸⁰ or the collective memory and cultural knowledge of Pacific Island communities.⁸¹ These projects are inevitably converted to digital files, placed on storage devices, and often made publicly available through the internet.⁸² ## 2. Digital Cultural Property as It Exists Today Digital cultural property, while stored in the same medium as digitized cultural property, is created in a digital format and almost always remains digital.⁸³ The 2003 UNESCO Charter on the Preservation of Digital Heritage defines digital heritage as “cultural, educational, scientific and administrative resources, as well as technical, legal, medical and other kinds of information created digitally, or converted into digital form from existing analog resources.”⁸⁴ The Charter, much like the 1954 Hague Convention, states, “the disappearance of heritage in whatever form constitutes an impoverishment of the heritage of all nations” and that “[digital cultural heritage] should be protected and preserved for current and future generations.”⁸⁵ Also similar to the 1954 Hague Convention, the Charter delegates the decision of what items should and should not be protected to states.⁸⁶ Digital cultural heritage is defined by its ephemerality and its shifting format.⁸⁷ Common examples of digital cultural property include gifs,\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\nFor a good example of digital cultural heritage, take YouTube, the world's second most-visited website with two billion unique monthly users.90 Every minute, YouTube gains an additional 500 hours of content and hosts content in over eighty languages.91 Every day, YouTube gains on average four billion daily views.92 Google, YouTube's parent company, is secretive about how its storage system works; one estimate is that in 2013, Google had approximately ten exabytes of data, although it is unclear how much of that is YouTube videos.93 Google stores every video uploaded to the website in one of its twenty-three global Google data centers.94 Thus, YouTube hosts a wide range of traditional cultural property, such as COLUMBIA HUMAN RIGHTS LAW REVIEW [53.1 traditional Mongolian throat singing,95 traditional American Indian dance,96 and the Turkish Mevlevi Sema ceremony, in addition to born-digital cultural property.97 The website is similarly home to videos of substantial cultural importance to the internet as a whole.98 By virtue of its sheer size and popularity, YouTube's kaleidoscopic inventory carries substantial cultural importance. The Internet Archive, an American non-profit known for cataloging the internet through its Wayback Machine, provides a similar example.99 As of this writing, the website contains 475 billion webpages, 28 million books and texts, 14 million audio recordings, 3.5 million images, and 6 million videos, totaling over forty-five petabytes of server storage.100 ## 3. Cyberspace Today It is worth reflecting on the architecture of cyberspace and how cultural property fits into it. Cyberspace is\"[a] global domain within the information environment consisting of interdependent networks of information technology infrastructures and resident data, including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers.\"101 It is\"the sharedness of the virtual environment\"which forms the backbone of global telecommunications and media.102 The information age has produced an extraordinary amount of\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\nProtections for real-world cultural property from cyber-attacks are fairly straightforward. The 1907 Hague Regulations and the 1954 Hague Convention apply regardless of a parties' method of warfare.¹⁰⁷ Thus, it would be just as unlawful to use a cyberattack to cause a gas leak at an enemy's historic museum, thereby causing a fire to damage art, artifacts, and the building itself, as it would be to attack the museum with a cruise missile. The core principles animating the protection of cultural property persist NEUROMANCER 51 (1982) (\"Cyberspace. A consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators, in every nation, by children being taught mathematical concepts...A graphic representation of data abstracted from the banks of every computer in the human system...

SMITH, COMMUNITIES IN CYBERSPACE 3 (1999) (describing how cyberspace is defined by text chat, the World Wide Web, and graphical worlds, and how\"[i]n cyberspace the economies of interaction, communication, and coordination are different than when people meet face-to-face.\").\n\ndespite the changes in warfare.¹⁰⁸ However, the application of IHL to digital and digitized cultural property is more complex.\n## B. Current Protections in LOAC for Cultural Property are Insufficient As unsettled as IHL is in cyberspace, it is even more unsettled with regards to digital cultural property. Exacerbating this, states are expanding their cyber arsenals as state-launched cyber-attacks become more common.¹⁰⁹ Military units dedicated to computer network operations have risen from five units in 2000 to sixty-three in 2017, a number which is only expected to grow.¹¹⁰ Quantifying the number of cyber operations is almost as difficult as determining their legality in international law. Despite this, the Council on Foreign Relations estimates that state actors perpetrated approximately 480 cyberattacks from 2005 to 2019.¹¹¹ Cyberattacks can have disastrous consequences. Russia’s hack of SolarWinds and its government clients in March 2020—a hack so massive that its scope is still unknown¹¹²—is merely the latest demonstration of states’ ample cyber arsenals.¹¹³ Other examples are the WannaCry ransomware attack, which\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\n## 1. The Extensive Use of Cyberspace for Cultural Property\nThere are numerous reasons why a state or non-state actor might target cultural property in cyberspace. States or non-state actors might conduct such attacks in \"campaigns of ethnic cleansing, identity-bound wars and iconoclastic actions.\"¹¹⁸ State and non-state actors might make cultural property part of their war aim, attack cultural property to gain tactical benefits or as a form of costly signaling, or seize cultural property for economic reasons.¹¹⁹ In 2014, North Korea allegedly hacked the U.S. film studio Sony Pictures, destroyed large quantities of data and exposed the personal information of Sony employees and management, showing the vulnerability of cultural data in cyberspace.¹²⁰ The attack was supposedly\n\nmotivated by Sony Pictures' release of a film deeply critical of North Korea which depicted the death of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.¹²¹ This is not to say that Seth Rogan and James Franco’s 2014 film *The Interview* is of such cultural importance as to warrant protection under international law,¹²² or that the 2014 Sony hack amounted to an armed attack or use of force,¹²³ but pictures-hack-explained/ (on file with the *Columbia Human Rights Law Review*); see also Tim McCormack, *The Sony and OPM Double Whammy: International Law and Cyber Attacks*, 18 SMU Sci. &amp; Tech. L.

Schmitt, *The Law of Cyber Warfare*, supra note 10 (“Over time, the reaction of states to cyber operations, as well as how they characterize their own cyber operations, will inform the process of interpretive maturation.”) It is unclear whether data deletion of non-culturally significant data would amount to a use of force.

STUD. 222, 237 (2018); Kubo Mačák, *Military Objectives 2.0: The Case for Interpreting Computer* 2021] Hard Drive Heritage Traditional cultural heritage institutions have also become increasingly digitized. In the past twenty years, virtual museums have exploded, with the development of both online-only museums and digitally augmented physical museums.¹²⁴ The Vatican offers 3D virtual tours, as do the Natural History Museum and National Gallery in London, the Dutch Rijksmuseum, the French Musée d'Orsay, and the American Getty Museum.¹²⁵ The American Smithsonian Natural History Museum offers virtual tours online and the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art boasts an impressive online digital collection.¹²⁶ Online-only virtual museums—such as the WebMuseum, the Swedish Internetmuseum, and the National Digital Repository for Museums of India—offer unique access to digital materials and challenge pre-existing notions of cultural heritage institutions.¹²⁷ The advent of immersive virtual and augmented reality provides a new form of access to cultural property, but also creates “a means to produce new forms of art.”¹²⁸ For example, the Petersen Automotive Museum uses virtual reality Data as Objects Under International Humanitarian Law, 48 ISRAELI L. REV. 55, 56 (2015) (“This article argues in favour of a broad understanding of the notion of ‘object’, bringing data within the scope of the rules on military objectives as codified in Additional Protocol I to the 1949 Geneva Conventions.”).\n\nCOLUMBIA HUMAN RIGHTS LAW REVIEW [53.1 and augmented reality to allow visitors to virtually view historic cars,¹²⁹ the National Museum of Finland uses virtual reality to allow visitors to step inside a painting,¹³⁰ and visitors to the British Museum can digitally handle Bronze Age artifacts through virtual reality technology.¹³¹ Virtual museums further the preservation of and access to cultural property and heritage, challenging notions of authenticity and transforming museums from silos of objects to interactive purveyors of information.¹³² Despite these significant changes in the preservation and presentation of cultural property, IHL has failed to adapt.\nRecognizing the threat of cyberattacks, states are already taking steps to back up their critical data. In 2017, Estonia announced that it was creating the world's first\"data embassy\"in Luxembourg, opening a high-security data center under Estonian control to ensure data continuity in the event of a cyber-attack, natural disaster, or conventional attack on Estonia.¹³³ Additionally, the Assistant Director-General of the National Archives of Australia published a report on the threat that cyber vulnerabilities pose to the nation's archives, galleries, and libraries, and thus Australia's national heritage.¹³⁴ These cultural institutions are so critical that one interesting\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\n## III. Interpreting International Law to Protect Cultural Property in Cyberspace\n## A. Digital and Digitized Cultural Property as Archives\nA new interpretation of international law is the most effective way to extend international law to cyberspace. Because belligerents are reluctant to acknowledge their actions in cyberspace—indeed, ostensible anonymity and difficulty attributing cyber operations to a state or non-state actor is part of the appeal of cyber operations—it is unlikely that customary international law will bring order to the cyber arena.¹³⁶ The ossification of customary international law requires open state practice driven by a sense of international obligation. This is unlikely to occur in cyberwarfare where states engage in highly classified cyber operations in relative anonymity.¹³⁷ Furthermore, without grievous cyberattacks affecting large numbers of states equally, international political will would likely be insufficient to produce a new treaty to regulate armed conflict in cyberspace, let alone clarify digital cultural property’s status in international humanitarian law. As a result, interpretations of existing legal instruments and principles will likely define the evolution of international law in cyberspace.¹³⁸ These interpretations may come through formal statements by states as to their legal position or their armed forces’ manuals on the laws of war.¹³⁹ Additionally, “[o]ver time, the reaction of states to cyber operations, as well as how they characterize their own cyber operations, will inform the process of interpretive maturation.”¹⁴⁰\n\nThis Note argues that digital and digitized cultural property are data of cultural importance 141 that fall under the 1954 Hague Convention's protections for culturally significant archives and records. An archive,\"a repository or collection especially of information,\"142 is a particularly apt description of digital information, which is normally stored either on a device's local hard drive or a server connected to the internet. While a 3D scan of a historic monument is not a historic monument itself, it is a reproduction of an important monument of architecture that is filed away alongside other 3D scans, like books on a shelf. Likewise, archived born-digital cultural property ought to be protected as\"moveable or immovable property of great importance to the cultural heritage of every people...\"143 The fact that digital cultural property exists to preserve cultural heritage, maintain cultural integrity, and provide access to societal memory only strengthens arguments for its protection, since a society implicitly preserves what it values. 144 This is not to say that every scrap of data ought to fall within the ambit of cultural property in IHL. However, data of sufficient cultural, scientific, or religious import, or which when aggregated take on sufficient importance, surely fall within the scope of the 1954 Hague Convention and customary international law. Born-digital cultural property is especially worthy of protection 145 since, unlike digitized cultural property, there is no physical backup if it is altered or destroyed.\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\nproperty, which holds immense societal value but happens to be digital rather than analog.\nOutside of international law, views of internet websites and digital repositories as archives are not new.¹⁵² One media studies scholar has termed YouTube “the world’s largest archive of moving images.”¹⁵³ Scholars have taken a broad view of an archive, defining it to include “inactive records of continuing value” or “a selection of digital records or digital surrogates of records made available as a curated online collection.”¹⁵⁴ While many websites, such as YouTube and Wikipedia, explicitly state that their mission is not preservation, these online platforms have become de facto democratic digital repositories of substantial cultural importance.¹⁵⁵ As a result, both the content hosted by these websites, as well as the websites themselves, ought to be protected by IHL, just as it already protects the documents contained within a physical archive.\nThis interpretation is consistent with articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.¹⁵⁶ According to the Vienna Convention, courts and parties should construe a treaty according to the text’s “ordinary meaning” taken “in the light of its object and purpose.”¹⁵⁷ The\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\nSubsequent practice by parties to the Hague Convention also supports protection for digital and digitized cultural property.¹⁶³ Several states have included digitized cultural data in their implementation reports filed consistent with the 1954 Hague Convention.¹⁶⁴ Belgium included its digitization of museum institutions,¹⁶⁵ Cyprus mentioned its use of GIS technologies to create an inventory of ancient monuments,¹⁶⁶ Greece with the Columbia Human Rights Law Review) (“[Treaties] are instruments for providing stability to their parties and to fulfil the purposes which they embody. They can therefore change over time, must adapt to new situations, evolve according to the social needs of the international community...”); Sergio Marchisio, Remarks at the 10th United Nations Workshop on Space Law, (Sept. 5–8, 2016).\n\nreferenced its “digitalization of the archive of monuments,”¹⁶⁷ and Australia noted its efforts at digitizing archives,¹⁶⁸ as did Turkey¹⁶⁹ and Estonia.¹⁷⁰ Azerbaijan considered its digitization of aged sound records to be a fulfillment of its peacetime treaty obligations under the 1954 Hague Convention,¹⁷¹ and Germany did the same with over two million archival documents from the Wossidlo ethnographic archive.¹⁷² Following suit, the Holy See has digitized over 400,000 pages of reproductions from its archives, “providing the minimum necessary redundancy to guarantee the conservation of high-quality copies in the event the originals are lost.”¹⁷³ Such efforts demonstrate that parties to the 1954 Hague Convention consider digital archives and records to be an essential means of cultural heritage preservation and lend credence to the treaty’s protection of digital and digitized cultural property.\n## B. Belligerents’ Obligations Towards Digital and Digitized Cultural Property Although digital cultural property should fall within the scope of the law of armed conflict, novel characteristics of the cyber domain alter what obligations belligerents have towards cultural property. In the current international legal regime, states have the following core obligations to cultural property: 1) states are prohibited from targeting cultural property or directing “acts of hostility [towards it]”;¹⁷⁴ 2) states are prohibited from using cultural property in a way that would imperil it; 3) states are prohibited from plundering or looting cultural property or from making reprisals against it; and 4) states are obliged to stop the theft, pillage, misappropriation, and vandalism of cultural property.¹⁷⁵ These obligations, rooted in the 1954 Hague Convention and customary international law, are core protections for cultural property and heritage.¹⁷⁶\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\nCOLUMBIA HUMAN RIGHTS LAW REVIEW [53.1 sinisterly, the BBC reported in 2019 on how the People's Republic of China was encouraging its citizens to edit Wikipedia entries on several sensitive topics, to\"reflect our voices and opinions in the entry, so as to objectively and truly reflect the influence of Chinese path and Chinese thoughts on other countries and history.\"185 Approximately 1,600 edits were made to Wikipedia pages for Hong Kong, Taiwan, the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, and nineteen other politically sensitive articles, although no coordinated cyber operation was uncovered.186 One way to determine when state activity in cyberspace impermissibly disrupts cultural property is a sliding scale analysis: how much of an effect does the military operation have on the digital cultural property? A group of soldiers stealing, defacing, or destroying one book or document from an archive likely has a de minimis effect on the entirety of the archive. Similarly, a proper analysis might be to what degree a cyber operation affects the entirety of a cultural data set. North Korea might decide to selectively edit the Wikipedia page of Kim Jong-un as part of an information operation, but that would be far less damaging than a broad cyber operation defacing or deleting large quantities of Wikipedia, or any other interactive cultural data set. It would be important to consider the ease of repair as well. For instance, digitized cultural data might be the sole remnant of lost cultural property, and thus critical for reconstruction, similar to how eighteen century art was essential to reconstructing Warsaw's Old Town after World War II.187 In the twenty-first century, cultural heritage experts are repairing the damage done by ISIS by using crowdsourced images of Mosul and historic sites in the Levant to 3D print lost artifacts and reproduce destroyed urban environments in virtual reality.188 Respect for these 3D prints and images during warfare is critical, as they are the last remnants of now-destroyed cultural property.\nStates' other obligations towards cultural property translate well into cyberspace. In peacetime, states must protect digital and digitized Microsoft allegedly offered to pay software engineers to edit certain Wikipedia pages so that they might be more favorable to Microsoft. Conflict of Interest Editing on Wikipedia, WIKIPEDIA (Nov. 9, 2021), https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-of-interest_editing_on_Wikipedia#Microsoft [https://perma.cc/MND8-PKXX].\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\nHowever, a DDOS attack might be considered an “act of hostility” within the meaning of the Additional Protocols to the Geneva Convention IV.¹⁹² Additional Protocol II does not protect archives or libraries, but instead protects “historic monuments, works of art, or places of worship which constitute the cultural or spiritual heritage of peoples.”¹⁹³ At the same time, the ICRC interprets the Additional Protocols to incorporate the 1954 Hague Convention’s definition of cultural heritage and property, which would extend protections for cultural property despite the Additional Protocols’ text not mentioning archives.¹⁹⁴ According to the ICRC, an “act of hostility” need not have a substantive effect on the cultural property itself, so long as it is “directed against” the cultural property.¹⁹⁵ Indeed, if a DDOS attack qualifies as an “act of hostility,” then Additional Protocols I and II and the 1954 Hague Convention would prohibit it.¹⁹⁶ Thus, it is conceivable that IHL would prohibit a DDOS attack on digital cultural property.¹⁹⁷ Another major issue in international legal obligations comes from how data challenges the territoriality of the 1954 Hague Convention.¹⁹⁸ While territorial location does not affect customary international legal obligation to refrain from damaging cultural property during armed conflict,¹⁹⁹ the Convention requires parties to “undertake to prepare in time of peace for the safeguarding of cultural property situated within their own territory against the foreseeable effects of an armed conflict...”²⁰⁰ Articles 12 and 13 of the Convention outline specific provisions for the safety of cultural property during transport.²⁰¹ However, data, unlike physical cultural property, rapidly crosses international boundaries along pre-determined paths and is often highly divisible.²⁰² A reasonable interpretation of states’ peacetime obligation might include replicating cultural data that resides in their territory for a substantial time or replicating cultural property of particular importance to the state’s own culture.\nThis shift in established notions of territoriality has additional implications. Traditionally, states would claim ownership over real-world cultural property within their borders. For example, the Taj Mahal is a UNESCO World Heritage Site²⁰³ that has special cultural importance to India, where it is located. Most nations seek to control their cultural property in the interest of its “retention, preservation, study, enjoyment, and exploitation.”²⁰⁴ This may be the case for digital cultural property as well,²⁰⁵ but others might be content with storing digital cultural property on a server in another country. International law’s focus on cultural internationalism simplifies this issue.²⁰⁶ Insofar as cultural property is the “cultural heritage of all mankind,”²⁰⁷ a state must protect digital cultural property within its territory regardless of its cultural origin. Museums across the world already do this; for example, the MET Digital Collection features scans of masks from\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\n## C. Protections for Replicas of Cultural Property in Cyberspace: Addressing Counter-Arguments\nA common question scholars pose is how digital technologies affect the authenticity of art.²¹¹ German philosopher Walter Benjamin argued that each work of art possesses a unique “aura” which mechanical reproduction erases, and thus, reproduction destroys the work’s authenticity.²¹² This is undeniably a motivation for protecting real-world cultural property and it is why reproductions often fail to stand in for stolen cultural property.²¹³ Humanity yearns for cultural objects because they are true and certain and possess some kind of uniqueness.²¹⁴ In addition to serving as surrogates,\n\n[53.1 digital objects are material in their own right, existing in space and time independently of that which they replicate.²¹⁵ For example, where once a photograph was seen as a simulacrum, “it has now attained a status of its own as a creative work as well as value as a historical document, along with its archival and interpretive roles. Photographs, according to Roland Barthes, radiate an aura, a distance, reference to a past and memory.”²¹⁶ However, authenticity is not the only reason why cultural property is considered worth preserving. Cultural property contains a society’s memories, brings substantial economic benefits through the antiquities trade or tourism, fosters a sense of community and identity, and by extension, has political value.²¹⁷ This is to say nothing of the value digitized reproductions have as a means of preservation and access, or how societies are capable of creating complex emotional relationships with replicas.²¹⁸ The strongest argument against interpreting LOAC to protect digital and digitized cultural property is that data is easily reproducible and disseminated, making its destruction exceedingly difficult and legal protections unnecessary. The Tallinn Manual 2.0, an influential academic publication outlining international law in cyberspace, incorporates this point; it argues that belligerents “must respect and protect cultural property that may be affected by cyber operations or that is located in cyberspace.”²¹⁹ However, the Manual continues, “[p]rotection only applies to digital copies or versions where the original is either inaccessible or has been destroyed,\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\nThe\"replication\"argument fails for several reasons. First, the fact that cultural property may be lodged on a hard drive somewhere else in the world does not mean that it is or will be. Even accepting the replication argument as valid fails to recognize the peacetime duty to preserve and protect cultural property, which is recognized under the Hague Convention.²²² Digital cultural property is easily duplicated and stored, but this does not eliminate the need for a legal duty to duplicate and store digital cultural property. There are numerous examples of digital cultural works being lost or nearly lost because of a failure to maintain proper backups.²²³ Even the existence of a backup is no guarantee if the data storage is centralized, as a conventional attack on a data center could destroy all existing copies of a culturally significant file.²²⁴ Such a conventional attack is not unlikely, as military and civilian internet infrastructure are largely interconnected.²²⁵ For example, Microsoft has contracted to store 80% of Department of Defense data and applications, making it difficult to distinguish between military and civilian targets.²²⁶ In addition to their peacetime duty to duplicate digital cultural property, belligerents during an armed conflict have to engage in a foreseeability analysis before conducting certain cyber operations to determine whether the digital cultural property they might jeopardize has in fact been duplicated, or even if it is endangered. Belligerents already use this test to determine the lawfulness of a target in the absence of notice of its cultural importance.²²⁷ Second, the texts of the Hague Convention and the Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions refute this argument. The Hague Convention explicitly protects “important collections of books or archives or of reproductions,” so copies of digital cultural property would likely warrant protection.²²⁸ During the Convention’s negotiations, the delegates from Switzerland and France insisted on the inclusion of protections for reproductions, “so that future generations would at least have the opportunity of seeing photographs of such works if the originals had been destroyed.”²²⁹ Additional Protocols I and II to the Geneva Convention outlaw “any acts of hostility directed against” cultural property.²³⁰ Applying this language, ICTY in Prosecutor v. Jokic, which concerned Yugoslav attacks on the Old Town of Dubrovnik, a UNESCO World Heritage site, concluded that Additional Protocols I and II prohibit attacks on cultural property “whether or not the attacks result in actual damage.”²³¹ Following this reasoning, LOAC\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\nThird, and most importantly, domestic copyright laws can impede the dissemination of cultural data, making it far more complicated than simply copying files.²³³ Copyright generally prohibits the reproduction of copyrighted work, whether for profit or not.²³⁴ For example, in the United States, archives and libraries are limited in their ability to reproduce copyrighted materials, and the number of copies they can make depends on the time remaining on the copyright, whether the material is unpublished, and whether the work is subject to “commercial exploitation.”²³⁵ This is further complicated by substantial differences in national intellectual property (“IP”) legal regimes, which may or may not inhibit the reproduction and preservation of cultural heritage, and to what extent copyright can cover cultural data.²³⁶ However, “[t]he traditional point of view of museums, no [https://perma.cc/G48W-79AW]. “For a violation of the article to take place it is therefore not necessary for there to be any damage.” Id.\n\nmatter where they are located, has been that IP, in particular copyright, has inhibited their ability to carry out their mission and mandate.”²³⁷ Domestic IP regimes undercut the assumption that cultural heritage institutions can replicate cultural data *ad infinitum* as a means of eliminating practical threats to digital and digitized cultural property. The intricacies of domestic IP laws cut against any presumption that digital cultural property, wherever located, will have backups, and thus counsels in favor of protecting digital cultural property in the event of an armed conflict.\n## 1. Copyright Law and the Problems It Presents for Digital Cultural Heritage Current cultural property law regimes impede the replication of digital cultural property. For instance, most digital cultural property is available in encrypted formats, which ties the digital goods to a specific account to prevent duplication; as a result, cultural heritage institutions are capable of licensing these digital goods, but they are unable to create archival copies until the expiration of the copyright.²³⁸ The Digital Millennium Copyright Act makes circumventing these technical measures against duplication a federal crime punishable by up to five years in prison.²³⁹ As a result, GLAMs must often wait ninety-five years after a work’s publication—or seventy years after the death of the author—to produce an archival copy,²⁴⁰ by which point the cultural property will likely have been lost to technological obsolescence, degraded hard drives, human error, or malicious attacks.²⁴¹ According to the Library of Congress, this has happened before. Because film studios lacked the resources, the foresight, or the commercial museums can make and the purposes for which museums can digitize culture property.

Edwards, *supra* note 238.\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage Copyright holders, as opposed to GLAMs, might produce backups of their work, but that is up to the copyright holder's discretion; a possessive copyright holder might actively hinder any reproductions. Take Star Wars, a film included in the Library of Congress's National Film Registry because of its historical and cultural significance.²⁴⁴ Since the theatrical release of A New Hope in 1977, George Lucas, and later Disney, made several alterations to the film, including introducing Computer Generated Imagery (\"CGI\"), adding entirely new scenes, altering the sound mixing and color palette, and including entirely new lines.²⁴⁵ George Lucas has publicly stated that he only wants his updated versions of the film to survive and Disney has continued that policy.²⁴⁶ As a result, the only digital versions of the original cut of A New Hope are fan-made and arguably constitute copyright infringement.²⁴⁷ In its current form, copyright places the preservation of cultural heritage at the whims of the copyright holder, making it difficult for belligerents in an armed conflict to presume that they can target digital cultural property haphazardly.\nA Library of Congress report on copyright laws from the United Kingdom, Australia, the Netherlands, and the United States concluded that “[a]lthough copyright and related laws are not the only obstacle to digital preservation activities, there is no question that those laws present significant challenges.”²⁴⁸ None of the jurisdictions surveyed have a uniform system for collecting digital materials, none of the exceptions to copyright laws for GLAMs were designed for digital preservation, and exceptions to copyright law for GLAMs are wildly inconsistent across jurisdictions.²⁴⁹ International copyright treaties are of little help in ensuring the preservation of cultural heritage. For example, the Berne Convention and the WIPO Copyright Treaty merely allow for states to permit reproduction “[p]rovided that such reproduction does not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work and does not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the author.”²⁵⁰ This labyrinth of copyright law makes it legally dubious to rely on random reproductions to protect digital and digitized cultural property.\nFinally, the rise in non-fungible tokens (“NFTs”) have made certain copies of digital art unique, and thus irreproducible, through blockchain technology.²⁵¹ NFTs thus make digital goods artificially scarce, causing a boom in digital art while also making some digital cultural property completely unique. In March 2021, Beeple, the online name of Charleston-based artist Mike Winkelmann, sold a digital painting called “Everydays–The\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\nFor the purposes of digital cultural property, NFTs ensure the authenticity of a piece of digital art. For example, the Mona Lisa is clearly protected cultural property under international law, but prints of da Vinci's masterpiece sold at the Louvre gift shop are not. NFTs offer an opportunity to authenticate certain works of digital cultural property and accord them protection under LOAC, while rendering non-NFT copies lawful targets. Because an NFT is an inherently unique entry on a blockchain ledger, it cannot be reproduced beyond the quantity specified by the NFT creator.²⁵⁸ As the primary means of ensuring authenticity in digital art, NFTs are likely the future of digital art, and thus ought to be protected under the laws of war.\n\nCOLUMBIA HUMAN RIGHTS LAW REVIEW [53.1 # D. How to Protect Digital Cultural Property in Practice The question remains of how to ensure the Hague Convention and its Additional Protocols, as well as the Geneva Convention and its Additional Protocols, carry weight. One idea might be technical solutions. Articles 16 and 17 of the 1954 Hague Convention establish a distinctive marking to identify physical cultural property and to provide notice to all parties of the property's protected status.²⁵⁹ This could easily be adapted into a number of technical solutions, including file naming conventions and coding schemes to tag cultural data.²⁶⁰ Militaries have already developed no-strike lists for culturally significant sites, which prevented the destruction of ancient monuments by Coalition Forces during the First Gulf War and the 2011 Libya Intervention.²⁶¹ Such no-strike lists might extend to certain servers, data centers, or IP addresses housing culturally significant data. Additionally, a published register of IP addresses, analogous to already-extant national or international registers of cultural property, would help provide notice and further remove cultural property from hostilities in cyberspace.²⁶² By segregating the civilian internet from the locus of military operations, states can better preserve digital cultural property in an armed conflict. At a minimum, states ought to ensure digital cultural data is preserved through at least some basic cybersecurity provisions as a means of fulfilling their peacetime obligations under Article 3 of the 1954 Hague Convention.²⁶³ International collaboration is also key to preserving digital cultural property. As part of their peacetime obligations under the 1954 Hague Convention, public cultural agencies and ministries could collaborate\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\nWhen responding to attacks on cultural property, states might also collaborate to overcome the difficulties of attribution in cyberspace. Because of technical advancements in recent years, successfully attributing major cyberattacks to individual perpetrators has gone from impossible to probable.²⁶⁸ By establishing an international evidentiary standard for cyberattack attribution, states can legitimately deter hostile states and ensure legal liability for law-breaking individuals.²⁶⁹ Additionally, states might share evidence with each other, or in collaboration with the private sector, as part of an international attribution mechanism.²⁷⁰ While such COLUMBIA HUMAN RIGHTS LAW REVIEW [53.1 proposals have largely focused on *jus ad bellum* concerns, attribution is equally critical to *jus in bello* issues, such as protecting cultural property.²⁷¹ The COVID-19 pandemic has made protections for digital cultural property all the more salient. In April 2020, 130 ministers of culture from around the world met virtually through Zoom to discuss the impact of the pandemic on the culture sector.²⁷² During the pandemic, “86% of countries... closed or partially closed their World Heritage Sites and 90% of museums... were closed.”²⁷³ Saudi Arabia, India, Colombia, Estonia, Greece, Albania, and Belize all emphasized the need to transition to digital cultural platforms and provide financial support for digital cultural production.²⁷⁴ “A large share of countries, including Kenya, Mexico and Lithuania, have made the digital transition one of the cornerstones of their cultural policy...”²⁷⁵ while other states, such as Serbia, Botswana, Cyprus, and Andorra questioned how this digital transformation would affect copyright protections.²⁷⁶ There was a general consensus among states that “[t]he digital transition must be the subject of global reflection and international regulation,”²⁷⁷ and that the digital cultural transition would certainly accelerate moving forward.²⁷⁸ ## CONCLUSION By framing digital and digitized cultural property as archives and records, existing international treaties can provide some degree of legal protection to this rapidly growing form of cultural heritage. This protection is particularly valuable, given the lack of an international effort to expand cultural heritage protections in the law of armed conflict. Because of the lack of a political will to create a new treaty for cultural property in cyberspace, states, international organizations, and scholars should further pursue novel interpretations to protect cultural heritage and adjust their policies\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\nThe emergence of digital cultural property raises further interesting questions surrounding international human rights law and its intersection with cultural heritage and cyberspace. To the extent that participation in cultural life creates a human right to cultural heritage,[279] and insofar as internet access is a human right,[280] protections for digital cultural property might also emerge from international human rights law, in addition to international humanitarian law. The use of an international human rights framework could bolster protections for digital cultural heritage in peacetime to a greater degree than international humanitarian law. Raising interesting questions surrounding privacy, sovereignty, intellectual property, and the freedom of expression, the use of a human rights [53.1 framework to protect digital cultural heritage and property is a promising subject for future research.",

The law of armed conflict should extend to protect the three categories of cultural property which cyber warfare could affect: real-world cultural property, digitized cultural property, which is cultural property that has been converted into a digital form, and digital cultural property, which is cultural property that has always existed in a digital form.¹⁵ This Note proposes a novel interpretation of existing legal instruments to extend significant protection under international humanitarian law (\"IHL\")¹⁶ for both digital and digitized cultural property. This paper then contends that digital and digitized cultural property should be categorized as archives and ¹⁵. The specialized terminology surrounding this topic deserves clarification. It is worth clarifying the terms \"cultural property\" and \"cultural heritage.\" The two terms are almost always used interchangeably in international treaties and scholarship. While cultural property is an older term, it has largely been superseded by cultural heritage, which is conceptually oriented around preservation for future generations rather than the rights and powers of the possessor. The term cultural heritage also encompasses practices that do not fall within any definition of tangible or intangible cultural heritage, making it a broader category than cultural property, although the terms are often synonymous. For example, the Great Wall of China is cultural property that forms part of China's cultural heritage. Yet the practice of Chinese calligraphy, an intangible cultural tradition, is not cultural property despite being part of China's cultural heritage. However, unlike cultural heritage, cultural property has a clear legal meaning, defined in the 1954 Hague Convention and 1970 UNESCO Convention.

Digitized cultural property is cultural property that has been copied or converted into digital format, yet which came from a real-world copy. Common examples of digitized cultural property include scanned books, audio recordings of music or culturally significant stories, and 3D renderings of monuments and artifacts. Digital cultural property is cultural property that has no original physical or real-world copy. Common examples of digital cultural property include digital artwork, blogs, vlogs, webcomics, e-books, certain audio recordings that are only digital downloads, some television shows and films, some journalism, and any other content that exists solely in digital form. The line between digital and digitized cultural property is not always clear. Take JSTOR, which is a digital repository for academic research similar to SSRN or PubMed.

The accumulated treasures of antiquity were recklessly looted and destroyed... The libraries containing the assembled literature of the classical and early Christian ages, went up in flames.\"²⁵ These are minor examples of the countless works of art, architecture, and literature that became casualties of war.²⁶ Yet some ancient thinkers and commanders took steps to exempt art, architecture, and houses of worship from the rampant destruction of civilian property. Greek historian Polybius wrote that while the destruction or taking of civilian property \"are necessary acts according to the laws and rights of war; to deface temples, statues, and such like erections in pure wantonness... must be regarded as an act of blind passion and insanity.\"²⁷ Cicero later used this line of reasoning to prosecute Gaius Verres in 70 BCE for expropriating artworks from temples and citizens during his governorship of Sicily.²⁸ To mitigate the damage of war to spiritual institutions, Frederick Barbarossa issued an edict in 1158 forbidding the pillaging of churches, although the ransacking of houses of worship remained ubiquitous in medieval warfare.²⁹ The Quran likewise prohibits fighting in sacred places, such as mosques and other houses of worship.³⁰ The Enlightenment marked a substantial shift in the treatment of cultural property and heritage in international legal thought.³¹ French jurist Emer de Vattel wrote that destroying cultural property renders a belligerent",

[sic] is absolutely condemned, even by the voluntary law of nations, as never being conducive to the lawful object of war.”³² Reasoning that no party would gain from the destruction of cultural property, Vattel argued such destruction or expropriation was unlawful.³³ This protection complemented Vattel’s principle of moderation in warfare, especially regarding pillaging hostile territory. “All damage done to the enemy unnecessarily, every act of hostility which does not tend to procure victory and bring the war to a conclusion, is licentiousness condemned by the laws of nature.”³⁴ Drawing on Cicero and Polybius, influential Dutch jurist Hugo Grotius similarly argued for protecting cultural property under the laws of war. “Porticos, Temples, statues, and all other elegant works and monuments of art” are “of such a nature, as to contribute, no way, to the support and prolongation of war.”³⁵ As a result, Grotius thought belligerents ought to exercise moderation in their treatment of enemy civilian property generally and cultural property in particular.³⁶ Regardless, it would take the arrival of industrialized warfare to transform legal theory into legal agreements. The nineteenth century saw further refinement of the laws of war and its provisions concerning cultural property. The 1863 Lieber Code, a set of instructions issued to Union soldiers during the American Civil War, provided that “[c]lassical works of art, libraries, scientific collections, or precious instruments, such as astronomical telescopes, as well as hospitals, must be secured against all avoidable injury, even when they are contained in fortified places whilst besieged or bombarded.”³⁷ But the Lieber Code’s protection for such cultural property was limited at best; it also allowed for the seizure of cultural property by an invading or occupying force if it could remove cultural property without injury, with the determination of ownership left to the final peace conference.³⁸ Although it was not intended as a legal agreement, the Lieber Code nevertheless had an immense influence on the development of the laws",

Article 56 of the 1907 Hague Convention states that, during an occupation, “[t]he property of municipalities, that of institutions dedicated to religion, charity and education, the arts and sciences, even when State property, shall be treated as private property.”⁴³ The treaty further mandates that “[a]ll seizure of, destruction or wilful [sic] damage done to institutions of this character, historic monuments, works of art and science, is forbidden, and should be made the subject of legal proceedings.”⁴⁴ Article 27 also requires that “all necessary steps must be taken to spare, as far as possible, buildings dedicated to religion, art, science, or charitable purposes, [and] historic monuments” and states that belligerents have a duty to clearly demarcate protected buildings or property.⁴⁵ However, the 1907 treaty proved ineffective at protecting cultural property during the Second World War, as Axis forces blatantly disregarded it.⁴⁶ The extensive looting of cultural",

Hague Convention, Additional Protocols, and the Evolution of Cultural Property Protections The 1954 Hague Convention is a core treaty shielding cultural property in armed conflicts. It aims to prevent “damage to cultural property belonging to any people whatsoever…since each people makes its contribution to the culture of the world.”⁴⁸ The 1954 Convention, faced with “the developments in the technique of warfare” which exacerbated the dangers posed to cultural property, built on the 1907 framework by requiring states to secure cultural property during peacetime and prohibiting the destruction of cultural heritage witnessed in World War II.⁴⁹ The treaty defines cultural property as “movable or immovable property of great importance to the cultural heritage of every people.”⁵⁰ This includes, of Militarism in Postwar Japan, 33 JAPAN REV. 195. 195 (2019).

Yet, cyberspace is also a means through which state and non-state actors can accomplish their goals. Cyberwarfare consists of using digital means to accomplish political objectives in an armed conflict and occurs in the same virtual environment that houses culturally significant data.¹⁰⁵ One often-cited example is the Stuxnet computer worm, which the United States and Israel used to damage Iranian uranium centrifuges by altering the centrifuges' rotational frequencies through an exploit in Windows and Siemens software.¹⁰⁶ Because digital and digitized cultural property is often stored on devices connected to cyberspace, it is vulnerable to both cyberattacks and conventional attacks. Protections for real-world cultural property from cyber-attacks are fairly straightforward. The 1907 Hague Regulations and the 1954 Hague Convention apply regardless of a parties' method of warfare.¹⁰⁷ Thus, it would be just as unlawful to use a cyberattack to cause a gas leak at an enemy's historic museum, thereby causing a fire to damage art, artifacts, and the building itself, as it would be to attack the museum with a cruise missile.

One common answer is to look at the effects of a cyber operation and determine whether it meets that threshold. See Matthew Waxman, *Cyber Attacks as “Force” Under UN Charter Article 2(4)*, 87 INT’L L. STUD. 43, 45–48 (2011) (stating that a cyber-attack that is sufficiently coercive might amount to a use of force, or that interference in another state’s internal matters might cross that threshold, and that the United States’ position tended towards an effects-based test); see also TALLINN MANUAL 2.0., supra note 4, at 330 (“A cyber operation constitutes a use of force when its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force”); Jeremy Wright, *Att’y Gen. of the U.K., Cyber and International Law in the 21st Century* (May 23, 2018) [check R17.2 on public speeches and addresses] (May 3, 2018), https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/cyber-and-international-law-in-the-21st-century (on file with the *Columbia Human Rights Law Review*) (“If a hostile state interferes with the operation of one of our nuclear reactors, resulting in widespread loss of life, the fact that the act is carried out by way of a cyber operation does not prevent it from being viewed as an unlawful use of force or an armed attack against us.”). However, the threshold for what constitutes a use of force is fluid and heavily influenced by state practice. Schmitt, *The Law of Cyber Warfare*, supra note 10 (“Over time, the reaction of states to cyber operations, as well as how they characterize their own cyber operations, will inform the process of interpretive maturation.”) It is unclear whether data deletion of non-culturally significant data would amount to a use of force. TALLINN MANUAL 2.0., supra note 4 (“The development of further State practice notwithstanding, network intrusions, the deletion or destruction of data (even on a large scale), computer network exploitation, and data theft do not amount to a non-international armed conflict.”); Tim McCormack, *International Humanitarian Law and the Targeting of Data*, 94 INT’L L.

Interpreting International Law to Protect Cultural Property in Cyberspace ## A. Digital and Digitized Cultural Property as Archives A new interpretation of international law is the most effective way to extend international law to cyberspace. Because belligerents are reluctant to acknowledge their actions in cyberspace—indeed, ostensible anonymity and difficulty attributing cyber operations to a state or non-state actor is part of the appeal of cyber operations—it is unlikely that customary international law will bring order to the cyber arena.¹³⁶ The ossification of customary international law requires open state practice driven by a sense of international obligation. This is unlikely to occur in cyberwarfare where states engage in highly classified cyber operations in relative anonymity.¹³⁷ Furthermore, without grievous cyberattacks affecting large numbers of states equally, international political will would likely be insufficient to produce a new treaty to regulate armed conflict in cyberspace, let alone clarify digital cultural property’s status in international humanitarian law. As a result, interpretations of existing legal instruments and principles will likely define the evolution of international law in cyberspace.¹³⁸ These interpretations may come through formal statements by states as to their legal position or their armed forces’ manuals on the laws of war.¹³⁹ Additionally, “[o]ver time, the reaction of states to cyber operations, as well as how they characterize their own cyber operations, will inform the process of interpretive maturation.”¹⁴⁰",

While a 3D scan of a historic monument is not a historic monument itself, it is a reproduction of an important monument of architecture that is filed away alongside other 3D scans, like books on a shelf. Likewise, archived born-digital cultural property ought to be protected as \"moveable or immovable property of great importance to the cultural heritage of every people . . .\" 143 The fact that digital cultural property exists to preserve cultural heritage, maintain cultural integrity, and provide access to societal memory only strengthens arguments for its protection, since a society implicitly preserves what it values. 144 This is not to say that every scrap of data ought to fall within the ambit of cultural property in IHL. However, data of sufficient cultural, scientific, or religious import, or which when aggregated take on sufficient importance, surely fall within the scope of the 1954 Hague Convention and customary international law.

A group of soldiers stealing, defacing, or destroying one book or document from an archive likely has a de minimis effect on the entirety of the archive. Similarly, a proper analysis might be to what degree a cyber operation affects the entirety of a cultural data set. North Korea might decide to selectively edit the Wikipedia page of Kim Jong-un as part of an information operation, but that would be far less damaging than a broad cyber operation defacing or deleting large quantities of Wikipedia, or any other interactive cultural data set. It would be important to consider the ease of repair as well. For instance, digitized cultural data might be the sole remnant of lost cultural property, and thus critical for reconstruction, similar to how eighteen century art was essential to reconstructing Warsaw's Old Town after World War II.187 In the twenty-first century, cultural heritage experts are repairing the damage done by ISIS by using crowdsourced images of Mosul and historic sites in the Levant to 3D print lost artifacts and reproduce destroyed urban environments in virtual reality.188 Respect for these 3D prints and images during warfare is critical, as they are the last remnants of now-destroyed cultural property.

For instance, a distributed denial of service (“DDOS”) attack, one of the most common forms of cyberattacks which takes down a network by flooding it with requests, on digital or digitized cultural property, would not necessarily violate international law.¹⁹¹ However, a DDOS attack might be considered an “act of hostility” within the meaning of the Additional Protocols to the Geneva Convention IV.¹⁹² Additional Protocol II does not protect archives or libraries, but instead protects “historic monuments, works of art, or places of worship which constitute the cultural or spiritual heritage of peoples.”¹⁹³ At the same time, the ICRC interprets the Additional Protocols to incorporate the 1954 Hague Convention’s definition of cultural heritage and property, which would extend protections for cultural property despite the Additional Protocols’ text not mentioning archives.¹⁹⁴ According to the ICRC, an “act of hostility” need not have a substantive effect on the cultural property itself, so long as it is “directed against” the cultural property.¹⁹⁵ Indeed, if a DDOS attack qualifies as an “act of hostility,” then Additional Protocols I and II and the 1954 Hague Convention would prohibit it.¹⁹⁶ Thus, it is conceivable that IHL would prohibit a DDOS attack on digital cultural property.¹⁹⁷",

See About the Internet Archive, supra note 89. 282 COLUMBIA HUMAN RIGHTS LAW REVIEW [53.1 Another major issue in international legal obligations comes from how data challenges the territoriality of the 1954 Hague Convention.¹⁹⁸ While territorial location does not affect customary international legal obligation to refrain from damaging cultural property during armed conflict,¹⁹⁹ the Convention requires parties to “undertake to prepare in time of peace for the safeguarding of cultural property situated within their own territory against the foreseeable effects of an armed conflict . . .”²⁰⁰ Articles 12 and 13 of the Convention outline specific provisions for the safety of cultural property during transport.²⁰¹ However, data, unlike physical cultural property, rapidly crosses international boundaries along pre-determined paths and is often highly divisible.²⁰² A reasonable interpretation of states’ peacetime obligation might include replicating cultural data that resides in their territory for a substantial time or replicating cultural property of particular importance to the state’s own culture. This shift in established notions of territoriality has additional implications. Traditionally, states would claim ownership over real-world cultural property within their borders. For example, the Taj Mahal is a UNESCO World Heritage Site²⁰³ that has special cultural importance to India, where it is located. Most nations seek to control their cultural property in the interest of its “retention, preservation, study, enjoyment, and exploitation.”²⁰⁴ This may be the case for digital cultural property as well,²⁰⁵ but others might be content with storing digital cultural property on a server in another country. International law’s focus on cultural internationalism simplifies this issue.²⁰⁶ Insofar as cultural property is the “cultural heritage of all mankind,”²⁰⁷ a state must protect digital cultural property within its territory regardless of its cultural origin.

Photographs, according to Roland Barthes, radiate an aura, a distance, reference to a past and memory.”²¹⁶ However, authenticity is not the only reason why cultural property is considered worth preserving. Cultural property contains a society’s memories, brings substantial economic benefits through the antiquities trade or tourism, fosters a sense of community and identity, and by extension, has political value.²¹⁷ This is to say nothing of the value digitized reproductions have as a means of preservation and access, or how societies are capable of creating complex emotional relationships with replicas.²¹⁸ The strongest argument against interpreting LOAC to protect digital and digitized cultural property is that data is easily reproducible and disseminated, making its destruction exceedingly difficult and legal protections unnecessary. The Tallinn Manual 2.0, an influential academic publication outlining international law in cyberspace, incorporates this point; it argues that belligerents “must respect and protect cultural property that may be affected by cyber operations or that is located in cyberspace.”²¹⁹ However, the Manual continues, “[p]rotection only applies to digital copies or versions where the original is either inaccessible or has been destroyed,",

Copyright Law and the Problems It Presents for Digital Cultural Heritage Current cultural property law regimes impede the replication of digital cultural property. For instance, most digital cultural property is available in encrypted formats, which ties the digital goods to a specific account to prevent duplication; as a result, cultural heritage institutions are capable of licensing these digital goods, but they are unable to create archival copies until the expiration of the copyright.²³⁸ The Digital Millennium Copyright Act makes circumventing these technical measures against duplication a federal crime punishable by up to five years in prison.²³⁹ As a result, GLAMs must often wait ninety-five years after a work’s publication—or seventy years after the death of the author—to produce an archival copy,²⁴⁰ by which point the cultural property will likely have been lost to technological obsolescence, degraded hard drives, human error, or malicious attacks.²⁴¹ According to the Library of Congress, this has happened before. Because film studios lacked the resources, the foresight, or the commercial museums can make and the purposes for which museums can digitize culture property.

A Library of Congress report on copyright laws from the United Kingdom, Australia, the Netherlands, and the United States concluded that “[a]lthough copyright and related laws are not the only obstacle to digital preservation activities, there is no question that those laws present significant challenges.”²⁴⁸ None of the jurisdictions surveyed have a uniform system for collecting digital materials, none of the exceptions to copyright laws for GLAMs were designed for digital preservation, and exceptions to copyright law for GLAMs are wildly inconsistent across jurisdictions.²⁴⁹ International copyright treaties are of little help in ensuring the preservation of cultural heritage. For example, the Berne Convention and the WIPO Copyright Treaty merely allow for states to permit reproduction “[p]rovided that such reproduction does not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work and does not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the author.”²⁵⁰ This labyrinth of copyright law makes it legally dubious to rely on random reproductions to protect digital and digitized cultural property. Finally, the rise in non-fungible tokens (“NFTs”) have made certain copies of digital art unique, and thus irreproducible, through blockchain technology.²⁵¹ NFTs thus make digital goods artificially scarce, causing a boom in digital art while also making some digital cultural property completely unique. In March 2021, Beeple, the online name of Charleston-based artist Mike Winkelmann, sold a digital painting called “Everydays–The",

For the purposes of digital cultural property, NFTs ensure the authenticity of a piece of digital art. For example, the Mona Lisa is clearly protected cultural property under international law, but prints of da Vinci's masterpiece sold at the Louvre gift shop are not. NFTs offer an opportunity to authenticate certain works of digital cultural property and accord them protection under LOAC, while rendering non-NFT copies lawful targets.

COLUMBIA HUMAN RIGHTS LAW REVIEW [53.1 # D. How to Protect Digital Cultural Property in Practice The question remains of how to ensure the Hague Convention and its Additional Protocols, as well as the Geneva Convention and its Additional Protocols, carry weight. One idea might be technical solutions. Articles 16 and 17 of the 1954 Hague Convention establish a distinctive marking to identify physical cultural property and to provide notice to all parties of the property's protected status.²⁵⁹ This could easily be adapted into a number of technical solutions, including file naming conventions and coding schemes to tag cultural data.²⁶⁰ Militaries have already developed no-strike lists for culturally significant sites, which prevented the destruction of ancient monuments by Coalition Forces during the First Gulf War and the 2011 Libya Intervention.²⁶¹ Such no-strike lists might extend to certain servers, data centers, or IP addresses housing culturally significant data. Additionally, a published register of IP addresses, analogous to already-extant national or international registers of cultural property, would help provide notice and further remove cultural property from hostilities in cyberspace.²⁶² By segregating the civilian internet from the locus of military operations, states can better preserve digital cultural property in an armed conflict. At a minimum, states ought to ensure digital cultural data is preserved through at least some basic cybersecurity provisions as a means of fulfilling their peacetime obligations under Article 3 of the 1954 Hague Convention.²⁶³ International collaboration is also key to preserving digital cultural property. As part of their peacetime obligations under the 1954 Hague Convention, public cultural agencies and ministries could collaborate",

COLUMBIA HUMAN RIGHTS LAW REVIEW [53.1 proposals have largely focused on *jus ad bellum* concerns, attribution is equally critical to *jus in bello* issues, such as protecting cultural property.²⁷¹ The COVID-19 pandemic has made protections for digital cultural property all the more salient. In April 2020, 130 ministers of culture from around the world met virtually through Zoom to discuss the impact of the pandemic on the culture sector.²⁷² During the pandemic, “86% of countries . . . closed or partially closed their World Heritage Sites and 90% of museums . . . were closed.”²⁷³ Saudi Arabia, India, Colombia, Estonia, Greece, Albania, and Belize all emphasized the need to transition to digital cultural platforms and provide financial support for digital cultural production.²⁷⁴ “A large share of countries, including Kenya, Mexico and Lithuania, have made the digital transition one of the cornerstones of their cultural policy . . .”²⁷⁵ while other states, such as Serbia, Botswana, Cyprus, and Andorra questioned how this digital transformation would affect copyright protections.²⁷⁶ There was a general consensus among states that “[t]he digital transition must be the subject of global reflection and international regulation,”²⁷⁷ and that the digital cultural transition would certainly accelerate moving forward.²⁷⁸ ## CONCLUSION By framing digital and digitized cultural property as archives and records, existing international treaties can provide some degree of legal protection to this rapidly growing form of cultural heritage. This protection is particularly valuable, given the lack of an international effort to expand cultural heritage protections in the law of armed conflict.

He spent his life as the Chief of Antiquities at the historic site of Palmyra in Syria, his hometown, where he protected one of the world's best-preserved archaeological sites—until ISIS seized his home and took him hostage.¹ After a month of torture, the terrorist group publicly beheaded Khaled al-Asaad for refusing to reveal the location of hidden antiquities.² Khaled al-Assad's sacrifice demonstrates the importance of cultural property to humanity: it is not only a record of humanity, but a fundamental pillar supporting it. Cultural property is so indispensable and so invaluable to humankind that the law must shield it from the bombs and bloodshed of war, just as Khaled al-Assad did. Yet, one hundred years from now, the artifacts worth dying for will not only be physical but also digital, made of code rather than stone or steel.³ This Note aims to address the fundamental question of how humanity will protect this new form of cultural property during armed conflicts.\nThere is widespread consensus that the law of armed conflict (\"LOAC\") applies to state and non-state actors in cyberspace, but there is far less consensus as to exactly how it applies.⁴ The application of settled principles of LOAC to cyber operations is a difficult one, as the cyber domain lacks the physical characteristics which have always marked battlefields.⁵ This has resulted in a great deal of literature discussing how the principles of proportionality,⁶ distinction,⁷ attribution,⁸ and neutrality⁹ can exist in cyberspace. The current intricacies of global politics have also complicated matters, as norms and interpretations of international law in cyberspace are continuously evolving to match shifting political and technical realities.¹⁰ This interpretive uncertainty has raised the question of how protection for cultural property under LOAC, a longstanding goal of international law, can extend to cyberspace.\nCultural property is protected under both treaty-based and customary international law. The destruction, degradation, theft, vandalism, or misappropriation of cultural property is a war crime.¹¹ International law\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\nmilitary objectives” a war crime). The Second Protocol to the Hague Convention of 1954, created in 1999, also requires states to conduct domestic prosecutions of serious violations of the 1954 Hague Convention.

J. INT’L L. 203 (2011).\n\nCOLUMBIA HUMAN RIGHTS LAW REVIEW [53.1 conventional warfare, but cyber warfare also poses a threat to this new form of human culture.\nThe law of armed conflict should extend to protect the three categories of cultural property which cyber warfare could affect: real-world cultural property, digitized cultural property, which is cultural property that has been converted into a digital form, and digital cultural property, which is cultural property that has always existed in a digital form.¹⁵ This Note proposes a novel interpretation of existing legal instruments to extend significant protection under international humanitarian law (\"IHL\")¹⁶ for both digital and digitized cultural property. This paper then contends that digital and digitized cultural property should be categorized as archives and ¹⁵. The specialized terminology surrounding this topic deserves clarification. It is worth clarifying the terms\"cultural property\"and\"cultural heritage.\"The two terms are almost always used interchangeably in international treaties and scholarship. While cultural property is an older term, it has largely been superseded by cultural heritage, which is conceptually oriented around preservation for future generations rather than the rights and powers of the possessor. The term cultural heritage also encompasses practices that do not fall within any definition of tangible or intangible cultural heritage, making it a broader category than cultural property, although the terms are often synonymous. For example, the Great Wall of China is cultural property that forms part of China's cultural heritage. Yet the practice of Chinese calligraphy, an intangible cultural tradition, is not cultural property despite being part of China's cultural heritage. However, unlike cultural heritage, cultural property has a clear legal meaning, defined in the 1954 Hague Convention and 1970 UNESCO Convention. See Lyndel Prott &amp; Patrick O'Keefe, 'Cultural Heritage' or 'Cultural Property'?, 1 INT'L J. CULTURAL PROPERTY 307, 309 (1992); Manlio Frigo, Cultural Property v. Cultural Heritage: A\"Battle of Concepts\"in International Law?, 86 INT'L REV. RED CROSS 367, 367 (2004); Janet Blake, On defining the cultural heritage, 49 INT'L &amp; COMPAR. L. Q. 61, 65(2000).\nDigitized cultural property is cultural property that has been copied or converted into digital format, yet which came from a real-world copy. Common examples of digitized cultural property include scanned books, audio recordings of music or culturally significant stories, and 3D renderings of monuments and artifacts.\nDigital cultural property is cultural property that has no original physical or real-world copy. Common examples of digital cultural property include digital artwork, blogs, vlogs, webcomics, e-books, certain audio recordings that are only digital downloads, some television shows and films, some journalism, and any other content that exists solely in digital form. The line between digital and digitized cultural property is not always clear. Take JSTOR, which is a digital repository for academic research similar to SSRN or PubMed. JSTOR hosts 12 million academic journal articles, books, and primary sources, yet only some lack any original physical version. See About JSTOR, JSTOR, https://about.jstor.org/ [https://perma.cc/FZN7-TT2U].\n¹⁶. International humanitarian law (\"IHL\") is\"broadly speaking, that branch of public international law that seeks to moderate the conduct of armed conflict and to mitigate the suffering that it causes.\"Amanda Alexander, A Short History of International Humanitarian Law, 26 EUR. J. INT'L L. 109, 111 (2015). IHL, which is synonymous with the law of armed conflict, encompasses treaties on the rules of war, ius in bello, as well as international norms that have ossified into binding customary international law. Id.\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage begins by exploring the history of protections for cultural property and heritage in times of war, with particular emphasis on the reasons for such protections. Part II discusses the development of digital and digitized cultural property and current threats to digital cultural heritage. Part III proposes a novel interpretation of digital and digitized cultural property as historically significant archives or documents and addresses what obligations belligerents ought to have towards cultural property in cyberspace.\n## I. Place of Cultural Property in the Law of Armed Conflict ### A. Development of Protections for Cultural Property With some exceptions, the wanton destruction of cultural property and heritage in ancient and medieval warfare was commonplace, governed by the maxim “to the victor go the spoils.”²⁰ Athenian historian Xenophon wrote, “It is an eternal law the wide world over, that when a city is taken in war, the citizens, their persons, and all their property fall into the hands of the conquerors.”²¹ The Roman Triumph prominently featured stolen art from defeated enemies,²² the Bible repeatedly references the plundering of art and treasures as spoils of war,²³ and when the Mongols sacked Baghdad in 1258 and destroyed the city’s great libraries, they threw so many books especially in cyber space. David Wallace &amp; Christopher Jacobs, *Conflict Classification and Cyber Operations: Gaps, Ambiguities and Fault Lines*, 40 U. PA. J. INT’L L. 643, 652 (2019); Michael Schmitt &amp; Sean Watts, *Beyond State-Centrism: International Law and Non-State Actors in Cyberspace*, 21 J. CONFLICT SEC. L. 595, 611 (2016) (“In many respects, the state-centric legal regime of public international law may seem ill-suited or even inadequate to address the challenges the super-empowered non-state actors of cyberspace present”). However, because state actors possess the most substantial capabilities in cyberspace and because IHL speaks with greater clarity on international armed conflicts, this paper focuses on international armed conflicts.\n²⁰. Or, as more eloquently phrased by Thucydides, “right, as the world goes, is only in question between equals in power, while the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must.” THUCYDIDES, *HISTORY OF THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 566–67* (Richard Crawley trans., *Floating Press* 2008) (Fourth century BCE).\n²¹. XENOPHON, CYROPAEDIA, at book VII, ch. 5, l. 73 (F.M. Stawell ed., Henry Graham Dakyns trans., *Project Gutenberg* 2009) (370 BCE) (ebook).\n²². MARY BEARD, *THE ROMAN TRIUMPH 159* (2009).\n²³. Jeremiah 15:13 (King James) (“Thy substance and thy treasures will I give to the spoil without price, and that for all thy sins, even in all thy borders.”); 2 Chronicles 14:13-14 (“And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto Gerar... and they carried away very much spoil. And they smote all the cities round about Gerar... and they spoiled all the cities; for there was exceeding much spoil in them.”); see also Deuteronomy 20:10 (elaborating the practices of war and articulating divine endorsement of expropriating cultural property).\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage Yet some ancient thinkers and commanders took steps to exempt art, architecture, and houses of worship from the rampant destruction of civilian property. Greek historian Polybius wrote that while the destruction or taking of civilian property\"are necessary acts according to the laws and rights of war; to deface temples, statues, and such like erections in pure wantonness... must be regarded as an act of blind passion and insanity.\"²⁷ Cicero later used this line of reasoning to prosecute Gaius Verres in 70 BCE for expropriating artworks from temples and citizens during his governorship of Sicily.²⁸ To mitigate the damage of war to spiritual institutions, Frederick Barbarossa issued an edict in 1158 forbidding the pillaging of churches, although the ransacking of houses of worship remained ubiquitous in medieval warfare.²⁹ The Quran likewise prohibits fighting in sacred places, such as mosques and other houses of worship.³⁰ The Enlightenment marked a substantial shift in the treatment of cultural property and heritage in international legal thought.³¹ French jurist Emer de Vattel wrote that destroying cultural property renders a belligerent an enemy to all mankind and that “the wanton destruction of public monuments, temples, tombs, statues, paintings, &amp;c. [sic] is absolutely condemned, even by the voluntary law of nations, as never being conducive to the lawful object of war.”³² Reasoning that no party would gain from the destruction of cultural property, Vattel argued such destruction or expropriation was unlawful.³³ This protection complemented Vattel’s principle of moderation in warfare, especially regarding pillaging hostile territory. “All damage done to the enemy unnecessarily, every act of hostility which does not tend to procure victory and bring the war to a conclusion, is licentiousness condemned by the laws of nature.”³⁴ Drawing on Cicero and Polybius, influential Dutch jurist Hugo Grotius similarly argued for protecting cultural property under the laws of war. “Porticos, Temples, statues, and all other elegant works and monuments of art” are “of such a nature, as to contribute, no way, to the support and prolongation of war.”³⁵ As a result, Grotius thought belligerents ought to exercise moderation in their treatment of enemy civilian property generally and cultural property in particular.³⁶ Regardless, it would take the arrival of industrialized warfare to transform legal theory into legal agreements. The nineteenth century saw further refinement of the laws of war and its provisions concerning cultural property. The 1863 Lieber Code, a set of instructions issued to Union soldiers during the American Civil War, provided that “[c]lassical works of art, libraries, scientific collections, or precious instruments, such as astronomical telescopes, as well as hospitals, must be secured against all avoidable injury, even when they are contained in fortified places whilst besieged or bombarded.”³⁷ But the Lieber Code’s protection for such cultural property was limited at best; it also allowed for the seizure of cultural property by an invading or occupying force if it could remove cultural property without injury, with the determination of ownership left to the final peace conference.³⁸ Although it was not intended as a legal agreement, the Lieber Code nevertheless had an immense influence on the development of the laws\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\nBy the twentieth century, foundational international treaties on the laws of war began to give greater force to protections for cultural property. Article 56 of the 1907 Hague Convention states that, during an occupation, “[t]he property of municipalities, that of institutions dedicated to religion, charity and education, the arts and sciences, even when State property, shall be treated as private property.”⁴³ The treaty further mandates that “[a]ll seizure of, destruction or wilful [sic] damage done to institutions of this character, historic monuments, works of art and science, is forbidden, and should be made the subject of legal proceedings.”⁴⁴ Article 27 also requires that “all necessary steps must be taken to spare, as far as possible, buildings dedicated to religion, art, science, or charitable purposes, [and] historic monuments” and states that belligerents have a duty to clearly demarcate protected buildings or property.⁴⁵ However, the 1907 treaty proved ineffective at protecting cultural property during the Second World War, as Axis forces blatantly disregarded it.⁴⁶ The extensive looting of cultural treasures by the Nazi regime led to the creation of the 1954 Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict (“1954 Hague Convention”).⁴⁷ ## B. Hague Convention, Additional Protocols, and the Evolution of Cultural Property Protections The 1954 Hague Convention is a core treaty shielding cultural property in armed conflicts. It aims to prevent “damage to cultural property belonging to any people whatsoever…since each people makes its contribution to the culture of the world.”⁴⁸ The 1954 Convention, faced with “the developments in the technique of warfare” which exacerbated the dangers posed to cultural property, built on the 1907 framework by requiring states to secure cultural property during peacetime and prohibiting the destruction of cultural heritage witnessed in World War II.⁴⁹ The treaty defines cultural property as “movable or immovable property of great importance to the cultural heritage of every people.”⁵⁰ This includes, of Militarism in Postwar Japan, 33 JAPAN REV. 195. 195 (2019). However, the Nazi’s systematic campaign of looting and eradicating important cultural works was so extensive it resulted in charges at the Nuremberg Tribunal and led Allied forces to establish the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives Program (also referred to as the “Monuments Men”) to safeguard plundered cultural works. Sanja Zgonjanin, The Prosecution of War Crimes for the Destruction of Libraries and Archives During Times of Armed Conflict, 40 LIBR. &amp; CULTURE 128, 133–35 (2005); see generally ROBERT EDSEL &amp; BRETT WITTER, THE MONUMENTS MEN: ALLIED HEROES, NAZI THIEVES, AND THE GREATEST TREASURE HUNT IN HISTORY (2009).\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\nThe Convention clearly defines the scope of its protection, but there is no objective test for determining which monuments, buildings, or manuscripts IHL protects. The party in whose territory the property is situated determines its cultural importance, and thus whether it is legally protected—a determination which parties must make in good faith.53 Absent notice to opposing parties under Articles 3 and 6 of the Hague Convention—notice that is left up to the parties' discretion—belligerents must hazard an educated guess, weighed down with caution, as to any item's cultural importance.54 Belligerents must then\"respect cultural property\"by refraining from conduct that would expose it to destruction or damage and further have a duty to protect cultural property from vandalism, theft, or The other commonly used definition of cultural property in international law comes from the Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property of 1970, often referred to as the UNESCO Convention. That treaty defines cultural property with greater specificity and more expansively than the 1954 Convention, and, like the 1954 Convention, defers to parties' respective views of cultural importance. See Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property, art. 1, Nov. 14 1970, 823 U.N.T.S. 231, http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=130 39&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html [https://perma.cc/D53M-BHZK].\n\n[53.1 misappropriation.⁵⁵ Likewise, belligerents are forbidden from directing reprisals toward cultural property and from requisitioning it.⁵⁶ The adoption of Additional Protocols I and II to the 1949 Geneva Conventions in 1977 bolstered the 1954 Hague Convention and provided additional protections for cultural heritage.⁵⁷ In both international and non-international armed conflicts, these protocols prohibit “acts of hostility directed against the historic monuments, works of art or places of worship which constitute the cultural or spiritual heritage of peoples.”⁵⁸ The Additional Protocols to the Geneva Convention refer to objects which “constitute the cultural or spiritual heritage of peoples.” This is different than the Hague Convention’s protections for property which apply when an object is “of great importance to the cultural heritage.” However, the International Committee of the Red Cross (“ICRC”) has clarified that “the basic idea is the same.” The Additional Protocols cover “objects whose value transcends geographical boundaries, and which are unique in character and are intimately associated with the history and culture of a people.”⁵⁹ In addition to the aforementioned treaties, customary international law also protects cultural property. The International Committee of the Red Cross lists respect for cultural property during armed conflict as part of customary international law.⁶⁰ Belligerents are prohibited from using cultural property for military purposes except when required by military\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\nThe current regime for protecting cultural property in war has had mixed success. While the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) successfully led several prosecutions for the destruction of cultural property,63 recent terrorist attacks have destroyed similarly irreplaceable works of cultural property. In 2001, the Taliban destroyed the Bamiyan Buddhas, 1,500-year-old statues over 100 feet tall—which were then the largest in the world.64 The looting of the National Museum of Iraq in the wake of Operation Iraqi Freedom was another shameful chapter, and stolen artifacts continue to flood illicit antiquities markets fifteen years later.65 Pointing to these contemptible episodes, some scholars have criticized the 1954 Hague Convention as ineffective at preventing the loss of these cultural treasures, even as the 1954 Convention's Second Additional Protocol clearly extended its protections to non-state actors.66 The Hague Convention, Additional Protocol II, and the 1970 World Heritage Convention have concededly not protected every piece of cultural property, but surely they have saved some.67 Yet, because of these treaties, not only does the destruction of cultural property often yield widespread international COLUMBIA HUMAN RIGHTS LAW REVIEW [53.1 condemnation, but international tribunals have also imposed criminal liability for attacks on cultural property. \n## II. Protecting Cultural Property in Cyberspace ## A. Defining Digital and Digitized Cultural Property ## 1. Digitized Cultural Property As with almost everything else, advances in computing, digital storage, and connectivity have revolutionized the field of cultural heritage. Owing to these recent technological advancements, digitized cultural property—whereby tangible or intangible cultural heritage is transformed into information—has exploded in recent years as a method of preserving cultural heritage, offering novel educational opportunities and increasing public access. Digitized cultural property can take several forms, such as scanned texts, audio-visual recordings of music, and 3D renderings. Take, for instance, CyArk, a non-profit established in 2003 after the Taliban's destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas to\"digitally record, archive and share the world's most significant cultural heritage...\"CyArk uses high-tech laser scanning tools to create 3D models of cultural heritage, which it then draws on to create an\"immersive virtual reality environment.\"To date,\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\nThis digitization push includes not only tangible but also intangible cultural property.78 For example, motion capture technology has allowed the digitization of traditional Japanese dances, allowing master performers to study their craft in a new way while also allowing for the archiving of cultural practices and events.79 Additionally, novel digital technologies offer a promising pathway for communities to preserve their cultural heritage, whether it be the oral narratives and song traditions of indigenous communities in Canada⁸⁰ or the collective memory and cultural knowledge of Pacific Island communities.⁸¹ These projects are inevitably converted to digital files, placed on storage devices, and often made publicly available through the internet.⁸² ## 2. Digital Cultural Property as It Exists Today Digital cultural property, while stored in the same medium as digitized cultural property, is created in a digital format and almost always remains digital.⁸³ The 2003 UNESCO Charter on the Preservation of Digital Heritage defines digital heritage as “cultural, educational, scientific and administrative resources, as well as technical, legal, medical and other kinds of information created digitally, or converted into digital form from existing analog resources.”⁸⁴ The Charter, much like the 1954 Hague Convention, states, “the disappearance of heritage in whatever form constitutes an impoverishment of the heritage of all nations” and that “[digital cultural heritage] should be protected and preserved for current and future generations.”⁸⁵ Also similar to the 1954 Hague Convention, the Charter delegates the decision of what items should and should not be protected to states.⁸⁶ Digital cultural heritage is defined by its ephemerality and its shifting format.⁸⁷ Common examples of digital cultural property include gifs,\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\nFor a good example of digital cultural heritage, take YouTube, the world's second most-visited website with two billion unique monthly users.90 Every minute, YouTube gains an additional 500 hours of content and hosts content in over eighty languages.91 Every day, YouTube gains on average four billion daily views.92 Google, YouTube's parent company, is secretive about how its storage system works; one estimate is that in 2013, Google had approximately ten exabytes of data, although it is unclear how much of that is YouTube videos.93 Google stores every video uploaded to the website in one of its twenty-three global Google data centers.94 Thus, YouTube hosts a wide range of traditional cultural property, such as COLUMBIA HUMAN RIGHTS LAW REVIEW [53.1 traditional Mongolian throat singing,95 traditional American Indian dance,96 and the Turkish Mevlevi Sema ceremony, in addition to born-digital cultural property.97 The website is similarly home to videos of substantial cultural importance to the internet as a whole.98 By virtue of its sheer size and popularity, YouTube's kaleidoscopic inventory carries substantial cultural importance. The Internet Archive, an American non-profit known for cataloging the internet through its Wayback Machine, provides a similar example.99 As of this writing, the website contains 475 billion webpages, 28 million books and texts, 14 million audio recordings, 3.5 million images, and 6 million videos, totaling over forty-five petabytes of server storage.100 ## 3. Cyberspace Today It is worth reflecting on the architecture of cyberspace and how cultural property fits into it. Cyberspace is\"[a] global domain within the information environment consisting of interdependent networks of information technology infrastructures and resident data, including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers.\"101 It is\"the sharedness of the virtual environment\"which forms the backbone of global telecommunications and media.102 The information age has produced an extraordinary amount of\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\nProtections for real-world cultural property from cyber-attacks are fairly straightforward. The 1907 Hague Regulations and the 1954 Hague Convention apply regardless of a parties' method of warfare.¹⁰⁷ Thus, it would be just as unlawful to use a cyberattack to cause a gas leak at an enemy's historic museum, thereby causing a fire to damage art, artifacts, and the building itself, as it would be to attack the museum with a cruise missile. The core principles animating the protection of cultural property persist NEUROMANCER 51 (1982) (\"Cyberspace. A consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators, in every nation, by children being taught mathematical concepts...A graphic representation of data abstracted from the banks of every computer in the human system...

Current Protections in LOAC for Cultural Property are Insufficient As unsettled as IHL is in cyberspace, it is even more unsettled with regards to digital cultural property. Exacerbating this, states are expanding their cyber arsenals as state-launched cyber-attacks become more common.¹⁰⁹ Military units dedicated to computer network operations have risen from five units in 2000 to sixty-three in 2017, a number which is only expected to grow.¹¹⁰ Quantifying the number of cyber operations is almost as difficult as determining their legality in international law. Despite this, the Council on Foreign Relations estimates that state actors perpetrated approximately 480 cyberattacks from 2005 to 2019.¹¹¹ Cyberattacks can have disastrous consequences. Russia’s hack of SolarWinds and its government clients in March 2020—a hack so massive that its scope is still unknown¹¹²—is merely the latest demonstration of states’ ample cyber arsenals.¹¹³ Other examples are the WannaCry ransomware attack, which\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\n## 1. The Extensive Use of Cyberspace for Cultural Property\nThere are numerous reasons why a state or non-state actor might target cultural property in cyberspace. States or non-state actors might conduct such attacks in \"campaigns of ethnic cleansing, identity-bound wars and iconoclastic actions.\"¹¹⁸ State and non-state actors might make cultural property part of their war aim, attack cultural property to gain tactical benefits or as a form of costly signaling, or seize cultural property for economic reasons.¹¹⁹ In 2014, North Korea allegedly hacked the U.S. film studio Sony Pictures, destroyed large quantities of data and exposed the personal information of Sony employees and management, showing the vulnerability of cultural data in cyberspace.¹²⁰ The attack was supposedly\n\nmotivated by Sony Pictures' release of a film deeply critical of North Korea which depicted the death of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.¹²¹ This is not to say that Seth Rogan and James Franco’s 2014 film *The Interview* is of such cultural importance as to warrant protection under international law,¹²² or that the 2014 Sony hack amounted to an armed attack or use of force,¹²³ but pictures-hack-explained/ (on file with the *Columbia Human Rights Law Review*); see also Tim McCormack, *The Sony and OPM Double Whammy: International Law and Cyber Attacks*, 18 SMU Sci. &amp; Tech.

Schmitt, *The Law of Cyber Warfare*, supra note 10 (“Over time, the reaction of states to cyber operations, as well as how they characterize their own cyber operations, will inform the process of interpretive maturation.”) It is unclear whether data deletion of non-culturally significant data would amount to a use of force.

STUD. 222, 237 (2018); Kubo Mačák, *Military Objectives 2.0: The Case for Interpreting Computer* 2021] Hard Drive Heritage Traditional cultural heritage institutions have also become increasingly digitized. In the past twenty years, virtual museums have exploded, with the development of both online-only museums and digitally augmented physical museums.¹²⁴ The Vatican offers 3D virtual tours, as do the Natural History Museum and National Gallery in London, the Dutch Rijksmuseum, the French Musée d'Orsay, and the American Getty Museum.¹²⁵ The American Smithsonian Natural History Museum offers virtual tours online and the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art boasts an impressive online digital collection.¹²⁶ Online-only virtual museums—such as the WebMuseum, the Swedish Internetmuseum, and the National Digital Repository for Museums of India—offer unique access to digital materials and challenge pre-existing notions of cultural heritage institutions.¹²⁷ The advent of immersive virtual and augmented reality provides a new form of access to cultural property, but also creates “a means to produce new forms of art.”¹²⁸ For example, the Petersen Automotive Museum uses virtual reality Data as Objects Under International Humanitarian Law, 48 ISRAELI L. REV. 55, 56 (2015) (“This article argues in favour of a broad understanding of the notion of ‘object’, bringing data within the scope of the rules on military objectives as codified in Additional Protocol I to the 1949 Geneva Conventions.”).\n\nCOLUMBIA HUMAN RIGHTS LAW REVIEW [53.1 and augmented reality to allow visitors to virtually view historic cars,¹²⁹ the National Museum of Finland uses virtual reality to allow visitors to step inside a painting,¹³⁰ and visitors to the British Museum can digitally handle Bronze Age artifacts through virtual reality technology.¹³¹ Virtual museums further the preservation of and access to cultural property and heritage, challenging notions of authenticity and transforming museums from silos of objects to interactive purveyors of information.¹³² Despite these significant changes in the preservation and presentation of cultural property, IHL has failed to adapt.\nRecognizing the threat of cyberattacks, states are already taking steps to back up their critical data. In 2017, Estonia announced that it was creating the world's first\"data embassy\"in Luxembourg, opening a high-security data center under Estonian control to ensure data continuity in the event of a cyber-attack, natural disaster, or conventional attack on Estonia.¹³³ Additionally, the Assistant Director-General of the National Archives of Australia published a report on the threat that cyber vulnerabilities pose to the nation's archives, galleries, and libraries, and thus Australia's national heritage.¹³⁴ These cultural institutions are so critical that one interesting\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\n## III. Interpreting International Law to Protect Cultural Property in Cyberspace\n## A. Digital and Digitized Cultural Property as Archives\nA new interpretation of international law is the most effective way to extend international law to cyberspace. Because belligerents are reluctant to acknowledge their actions in cyberspace—indeed, ostensible anonymity and difficulty attributing cyber operations to a state or non-state actor is part of the appeal of cyber operations—it is unlikely that customary international law will bring order to the cyber arena.¹³⁶ The ossification of customary international law requires open state practice driven by a sense of international obligation. This is unlikely to occur in cyberwarfare where states engage in highly classified cyber operations in relative anonymity.¹³⁷ Furthermore, without grievous cyberattacks affecting large numbers of states equally, international political will would likely be insufficient to produce a new treaty to regulate armed conflict in cyberspace, let alone clarify digital cultural property’s status in international humanitarian law. As a result, interpretations of existing legal instruments and principles will likely define the evolution of international law in cyberspace.¹³⁸ These interpretations may come through formal statements by states as to their legal position or their armed forces’ manuals on the laws of war.¹³⁹ Additionally, “[o]ver time, the reaction of states to cyber operations, as well as how they characterize their own cyber operations, will inform the process of interpretive maturation.”¹⁴⁰\n\nThis Note argues that digital and digitized cultural property are data of cultural importance 141 that fall under the 1954 Hague Convention's protections for culturally significant archives and records. An archive,\"a repository or collection especially of information,\"142 is a particularly apt description of digital information, which is normally stored either on a device's local hard drive or a server connected to the internet. While a 3D scan of a historic monument is not a historic monument itself, it is a reproduction of an important monument of architecture that is filed away alongside other 3D scans, like books on a shelf. Likewise, archived born-digital cultural property ought to be protected as\"moveable or immovable property of great importance to the cultural heritage of every people...\"143 The fact that digital cultural property exists to preserve cultural heritage, maintain cultural integrity, and provide access to societal memory only strengthens arguments for its protection, since a society implicitly preserves what it values. 144 This is not to say that every scrap of data ought to fall within the ambit of cultural property in IHL. However, data of sufficient cultural, scientific, or religious import, or which when aggregated take on sufficient importance, surely fall within the scope of the 1954 Hague Convention and customary international law. Born-digital cultural property is especially worthy of protection 145 since, unlike digitized cultural property, there is no physical backup if it is altered or destroyed.\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\nproperty, which holds immense societal value but happens to be digital rather than analog.\nOutside of international law, views of internet websites and digital repositories as archives are not new.¹⁵² One media studies scholar has termed YouTube “the world’s largest archive of moving images.”¹⁵³ Scholars have taken a broad view of an archive, defining it to include “inactive records of continuing value” or “a selection of digital records or digital surrogates of records made available as a curated online collection.”¹⁵⁴ While many websites, such as YouTube and Wikipedia, explicitly state that their mission is not preservation, these online platforms have become de facto democratic digital repositories of substantial cultural importance.¹⁵⁵ As a result, both the content hosted by these websites, as well as the websites themselves, ought to be protected by IHL, just as it already protects the documents contained within a physical archive.\nThis interpretation is consistent with articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.¹⁵⁶ According to the Vienna Convention, courts and parties should construe a treaty according to the text’s “ordinary meaning” taken “in the light of its object and purpose.”¹⁵⁷ The\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\nSubsequent practice by parties to the Hague Convention also supports protection for digital and digitized cultural property.¹⁶³ Several states have included digitized cultural data in their implementation reports filed consistent with the 1954 Hague Convention.¹⁶⁴ Belgium included its digitization of museum institutions,¹⁶⁵ Cyprus mentioned its use of GIS technologies to create an inventory of ancient monuments,¹⁶⁶ Greece with the Columbia Human Rights Law Review) (“[Treaties] are instruments for providing stability to their parties and to fulfil the purposes which they embody. They can therefore change over time, must adapt to new situations, evolve according to the social needs of the international community...”); Sergio Marchisio, Remarks at the 10th United Nations Workshop on Space Law, (Sept. 5–8, 2016).\n\nreferenced its “digitalization of the archive of monuments,”¹⁶⁷ and Australia noted its efforts at digitizing archives,¹⁶⁸ as did Turkey¹⁶⁹ and Estonia.¹⁷⁰ Azerbaijan considered its digitization of aged sound records to be a fulfillment of its peacetime treaty obligations under the 1954 Hague Convention,¹⁷¹ and Germany did the same with over two million archival documents from the Wossidlo ethnographic archive.¹⁷² Following suit, the Holy See has digitized over 400,000 pages of reproductions from its archives, “providing the minimum necessary redundancy to guarantee the conservation of high-quality copies in the event the originals are lost.”¹⁷³ Such efforts demonstrate that parties to the 1954 Hague Convention consider digital archives and records to be an essential means of cultural heritage preservation and lend credence to the treaty’s protection of digital and digitized cultural property.\n## B. Belligerents’ Obligations Towards Digital and Digitized Cultural Property Although digital cultural property should fall within the scope of the law of armed conflict, novel characteristics of the cyber domain alter what obligations belligerents have towards cultural property. In the current international legal regime, states have the following core obligations to cultural property: 1) states are prohibited from targeting cultural property or directing “acts of hostility [towards it]”;¹⁷⁴ 2) states are prohibited from using cultural property in a way that would imperil it; 3) states are prohibited from plundering or looting cultural property or from making reprisals against it; and 4) states are obliged to stop the theft, pillage, misappropriation, and vandalism of cultural property.¹⁷⁵ These obligations, rooted in the 1954 Hague Convention and customary international law, are core protections for cultural property and heritage.¹⁷⁶\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\nCOLUMBIA HUMAN RIGHTS LAW REVIEW [53.1 sinisterly, the BBC reported in 2019 on how the People's Republic of China was encouraging its citizens to edit Wikipedia entries on several sensitive topics, to\"reflect our voices and opinions in the entry, so as to objectively and truly reflect the influence of Chinese path and Chinese thoughts on other countries and history.\"185 Approximately 1,600 edits were made to Wikipedia pages for Hong Kong, Taiwan, the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, and nineteen other politically sensitive articles, although no coordinated cyber operation was uncovered.186 One way to determine when state activity in cyberspace impermissibly disrupts cultural property is a sliding scale analysis: how much of an effect does the military operation have on the digital cultural property? A group of soldiers stealing, defacing, or destroying one book or document from an archive likely has a de minimis effect on the entirety of the archive. Similarly, a proper analysis might be to what degree a cyber operation affects the entirety of a cultural data set. North Korea might decide to selectively edit the Wikipedia page of Kim Jong-un as part of an information operation, but that would be far less damaging than a broad cyber operation defacing or deleting large quantities of Wikipedia, or any other interactive cultural data set. It would be important to consider the ease of repair as well. For instance, digitized cultural data might be the sole remnant of lost cultural property, and thus critical for reconstruction, similar to how eighteen century art was essential to reconstructing Warsaw's Old Town after World War II.187 In the twenty-first century, cultural heritage experts are repairing the damage done by ISIS by using crowdsourced images of Mosul and historic sites in the Levant to 3D print lost artifacts and reproduce destroyed urban environments in virtual reality.188 Respect for these 3D prints and images during warfare is critical, as they are the last remnants of now-destroyed cultural property.\nStates' other obligations towards cultural property translate well into cyberspace. In peacetime, states must protect digital and digitized Microsoft allegedly offered to pay software engineers to edit certain Wikipedia pages so that they might be more favorable to Microsoft. Conflict of Interest Editing on Wikipedia, WIKIPEDIA (Nov. 9, 2021), https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-of-interest_editing_on_Wikipedia#Microsoft [https://perma.cc/MND8-PKXX].\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\nHowever, a DDOS attack might be considered an “act of hostility” within the meaning of the Additional Protocols to the Geneva Convention IV.¹⁹² Additional Protocol II does not protect archives or libraries, but instead protects “historic monuments, works of art, or places of worship which constitute the cultural or spiritual heritage of peoples.”¹⁹³ At the same time, the ICRC interprets the Additional Protocols to incorporate the 1954 Hague Convention’s definition of cultural heritage and property, which would extend protections for cultural property despite the Additional Protocols’ text not mentioning archives.¹⁹⁴ According to the ICRC, an “act of hostility” need not have a substantive effect on the cultural property itself, so long as it is “directed against” the cultural property.¹⁹⁵ Indeed, if a DDOS attack qualifies as an “act of hostility,” then Additional Protocols I and II and the 1954 Hague Convention would prohibit it.¹⁹⁶ Thus, it is conceivable that IHL would prohibit a DDOS attack on digital cultural property.¹⁹⁷ Another major issue in international legal obligations comes from how data challenges the territoriality of the 1954 Hague Convention.¹⁹⁸ While territorial location does not affect customary international legal obligation to refrain from damaging cultural property during armed conflict,¹⁹⁹ the Convention requires parties to “undertake to prepare in time of peace for the safeguarding of cultural property situated within their own territory against the foreseeable effects of an armed conflict...”²⁰⁰ Articles 12 and 13 of the Convention outline specific provisions for the safety of cultural property during transport.²⁰¹ However, data, unlike physical cultural property, rapidly crosses international boundaries along pre-determined paths and is often highly divisible.²⁰² A reasonable interpretation of states’ peacetime obligation might include replicating cultural data that resides in their territory for a substantial time or replicating cultural property of particular importance to the state’s own culture.\nThis shift in established notions of territoriality has additional implications. Traditionally, states would claim ownership over real-world cultural property within their borders. For example, the Taj Mahal is a UNESCO World Heritage Site²⁰³ that has special cultural importance to India, where it is located. Most nations seek to control their cultural property in the interest of its “retention, preservation, study, enjoyment, and exploitation.”²⁰⁴ This may be the case for digital cultural property as well,²⁰⁵ but others might be content with storing digital cultural property on a server in another country. International law’s focus on cultural internationalism simplifies this issue.²⁰⁶ Insofar as cultural property is the “cultural heritage of all mankind,”²⁰⁷ a state must protect digital cultural property within its territory regardless of its cultural origin. Museums across the world already do this; for example, the MET Digital Collection features scans of masks from\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\n## C. Protections for Replicas of Cultural Property in Cyberspace: Addressing Counter-Arguments\nA common question scholars pose is how digital technologies affect the authenticity of art.²¹¹ German philosopher Walter Benjamin argued that each work of art possesses a unique “aura” which mechanical reproduction erases, and thus, reproduction destroys the work’s authenticity.²¹² This is undeniably a motivation for protecting real-world cultural property and it is why reproductions often fail to stand in for stolen cultural property.²¹³ Humanity yearns for cultural objects because they are true and certain and possess some kind of uniqueness.²¹⁴ In addition to serving as surrogates,\n\n[53.1 digital objects are material in their own right, existing in space and time independently of that which they replicate.²¹⁵ For example, where once a photograph was seen as a simulacrum, “it has now attained a status of its own as a creative work as well as value as a historical document, along with its archival and interpretive roles. Photographs, according to Roland Barthes, radiate an aura, a distance, reference to a past and memory.”²¹⁶ However, authenticity is not the only reason why cultural property is considered worth preserving. Cultural property contains a society’s memories, brings substantial economic benefits through the antiquities trade or tourism, fosters a sense of community and identity, and by extension, has political value.²¹⁷ This is to say nothing of the value digitized reproductions have as a means of preservation and access, or how societies are capable of creating complex emotional relationships with replicas.²¹⁸ The strongest argument against interpreting LOAC to protect digital and digitized cultural property is that data is easily reproducible and disseminated, making its destruction exceedingly difficult and legal protections unnecessary. The Tallinn Manual 2.0, an influential academic publication outlining international law in cyberspace, incorporates this point; it argues that belligerents “must respect and protect cultural property that may be affected by cyber operations or that is located in cyberspace.”²¹⁹ However, the Manual continues, “[p]rotection only applies to digital copies or versions where the original is either inaccessible or has been destroyed,\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\nThe\"replication\"argument fails for several reasons. First, the fact that cultural property may be lodged on a hard drive somewhere else in the world does not mean that it is or will be. Even accepting the replication argument as valid fails to recognize the peacetime duty to preserve and protect cultural property, which is recognized under the Hague Convention.²²² Digital cultural property is easily duplicated and stored, but this does not eliminate the need for a legal duty to duplicate and store digital cultural property. There are numerous examples of digital cultural works being lost or nearly lost because of a failure to maintain proper backups.²²³ Even the existence of a backup is no guarantee if the data storage is centralized, as a conventional attack on a data center could destroy all existing copies of a culturally significant file.²²⁴ Such a conventional attack is not unlikely, as military and civilian internet infrastructure are largely interconnected.²²⁵ For example, Microsoft has contracted to store 80% of Department of Defense data and applications, making it difficult to distinguish between military and civilian targets.²²⁶ In addition to their peacetime duty to duplicate digital cultural property, belligerents during an armed conflict have to engage in a foreseeability analysis before conducting certain cyber operations to determine whether the digital cultural property they might jeopardize has in fact been duplicated, or even if it is endangered. Belligerents already use this test to determine the lawfulness of a target in the absence of notice of its cultural importance.²²⁷ Second, the texts of the Hague Convention and the Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions refute this argument. The Hague Convention explicitly protects “important collections of books or archives or of reproductions,” so copies of digital cultural property would likely warrant protection.²²⁸ During the Convention’s negotiations, the delegates from Switzerland and France insisted on the inclusion of protections for reproductions, “so that future generations would at least have the opportunity of seeing photographs of such works if the originals had been destroyed.”²²⁹ Additional Protocols I and II to the Geneva Convention outlaw “any acts of hostility directed against” cultural property.²³⁰ Applying this language, ICTY in Prosecutor v. Jokic, which concerned Yugoslav attacks on the Old Town of Dubrovnik, a UNESCO World Heritage site, concluded that Additional Protocols I and II prohibit attacks on cultural property “whether or not the attacks result in actual damage.”²³¹ Following this reasoning, LOAC\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\nThird, and most importantly, domestic copyright laws can impede the dissemination of cultural data, making it far more complicated than simply copying files.²³³ Copyright generally prohibits the reproduction of copyrighted work, whether for profit or not.²³⁴ For example, in the United States, archives and libraries are limited in their ability to reproduce copyrighted materials, and the number of copies they can make depends on the time remaining on the copyright, whether the material is unpublished, and whether the work is subject to “commercial exploitation.”²³⁵ This is further complicated by substantial differences in national intellectual property (“IP”) legal regimes, which may or may not inhibit the reproduction and preservation of cultural heritage, and to what extent copyright can cover cultural data.²³⁶ However, “[t]he traditional point of view of museums, no [https://perma.cc/G48W-79AW]. “For a violation of the article to take place it is therefore not necessary for there to be any damage.” Id.\n\nmatter where they are located, has been that IP, in particular copyright, has inhibited their ability to carry out their mission and mandate.”²³⁷ Domestic IP regimes undercut the assumption that cultural heritage institutions can replicate cultural data *ad infinitum* as a means of eliminating practical threats to digital and digitized cultural property. The intricacies of domestic IP laws cut against any presumption that digital cultural property, wherever located, will have backups, and thus counsels in favor of protecting digital cultural property in the event of an armed conflict.\n## 1. Copyright Law and the Problems It Presents for Digital Cultural Heritage Current cultural property law regimes impede the replication of digital cultural property. For instance, most digital cultural property is available in encrypted formats, which ties the digital goods to a specific account to prevent duplication; as a result, cultural heritage institutions are capable of licensing these digital goods, but they are unable to create archival copies until the expiration of the copyright.²³⁸ The Digital Millennium Copyright Act makes circumventing these technical measures against duplication a federal crime punishable by up to five years in prison.²³⁹ As a result, GLAMs must often wait ninety-five years after a work’s publication—or seventy years after the death of the author—to produce an archival copy,²⁴⁰ by which point the cultural property will likely have been lost to technological obsolescence, degraded hard drives, human error, or malicious attacks.²⁴¹ According to the Library of Congress, this has happened before. Because film studios lacked the resources, the foresight, or the commercial museums can make and the purposes for which museums can digitize culture property.

Edwards, *supra* note 238.\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage Copyright holders, as opposed to GLAMs, might produce backups of their work, but that is up to the copyright holder's discretion; a possessive copyright holder might actively hinder any reproductions. Take Star Wars, a film included in the Library of Congress's National Film Registry because of its historical and cultural significance.²⁴⁴ Since the theatrical release of A New Hope in 1977, George Lucas, and later Disney, made several alterations to the film, including introducing Computer Generated Imagery (\"CGI\"), adding entirely new scenes, altering the sound mixing and color palette, and including entirely new lines.²⁴⁵ George Lucas has publicly stated that he only wants his updated versions of the film to survive and Disney has continued that policy.²⁴⁶ As a result, the only digital versions of the original cut of A New Hope are fan-made and arguably constitute copyright infringement.²⁴⁷ In its current form, copyright places the preservation of cultural heritage at the whims of the copyright holder, making it difficult for belligerents in an armed conflict to presume that they can target digital cultural property haphazardly.\nA Library of Congress report on copyright laws from the United Kingdom, Australia, the Netherlands, and the United States concluded that “[a]lthough copyright and related laws are not the only obstacle to digital preservation activities, there is no question that those laws present significant challenges.”²⁴⁸ None of the jurisdictions surveyed have a uniform system for collecting digital materials, none of the exceptions to copyright laws for GLAMs were designed for digital preservation, and exceptions to copyright law for GLAMs are wildly inconsistent across jurisdictions.²⁴⁹ International copyright treaties are of little help in ensuring the preservation of cultural heritage. For example, the Berne Convention and the WIPO Copyright Treaty merely allow for states to permit reproduction “[p]rovided that such reproduction does not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work and does not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the author.”²⁵⁰ This labyrinth of copyright law makes it legally dubious to rely on random reproductions to protect digital and digitized cultural property.\nFinally, the rise in non-fungible tokens (“NFTs”) have made certain copies of digital art unique, and thus irreproducible, through blockchain technology.²⁵¹ NFTs thus make digital goods artificially scarce, causing a boom in digital art while also making some digital cultural property completely unique. In March 2021, Beeple, the online name of Charleston-based artist Mike Winkelmann, sold a digital painting called “Everydays–The\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\nFor the purposes of digital cultural property, NFTs ensure the authenticity of a piece of digital art. For example, the Mona Lisa is clearly protected cultural property under international law, but prints of da Vinci's masterpiece sold at the Louvre gift shop are not. NFTs offer an opportunity to authenticate certain works of digital cultural property and accord them protection under LOAC, while rendering non-NFT copies lawful targets. Because an NFT is an inherently unique entry on a blockchain ledger, it cannot be reproduced beyond the quantity specified by the NFT creator.²⁵⁸ As the primary means of ensuring authenticity in digital art, NFTs are likely the future of digital art, and thus ought to be protected under the laws of war.\n\nCOLUMBIA HUMAN RIGHTS LAW REVIEW [53.1 # D. How to Protect Digital Cultural Property in Practice The question remains of how to ensure the Hague Convention and its Additional Protocols, as well as the Geneva Convention and its Additional Protocols, carry weight. One idea might be technical solutions. Articles 16 and 17 of the 1954 Hague Convention establish a distinctive marking to identify physical cultural property and to provide notice to all parties of the property's protected status.²⁵⁹ This could easily be adapted into a number of technical solutions, including file naming conventions and coding schemes to tag cultural data.²⁶⁰ Militaries have already developed no-strike lists for culturally significant sites, which prevented the destruction of ancient monuments by Coalition Forces during the First Gulf War and the 2011 Libya Intervention.²⁶¹ Such no-strike lists might extend to certain servers, data centers, or IP addresses housing culturally significant data. Additionally, a published register of IP addresses, analogous to already-extant national or international registers of cultural property, would help provide notice and further remove cultural property from hostilities in cyberspace.²⁶² By segregating the civilian internet from the locus of military operations, states can better preserve digital cultural property in an armed conflict. At a minimum, states ought to ensure digital cultural data is preserved through at least some basic cybersecurity provisions as a means of fulfilling their peacetime obligations under Article 3 of the 1954 Hague Convention.²⁶³ International collaboration is also key to preserving digital cultural property. As part of their peacetime obligations under the 1954 Hague Convention, public cultural agencies and ministries could collaborate\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\nWhen responding to attacks on cultural property, states might also collaborate to overcome the difficulties of attribution in cyberspace. Because of technical advancements in recent years, successfully attributing major cyberattacks to individual perpetrators has gone from impossible to probable.²⁶⁸ By establishing an international evidentiary standard for cyberattack attribution, states can legitimately deter hostile states and ensure legal liability for law-breaking individuals.²⁶⁹ Additionally, states might share evidence with each other, or in collaboration with the private sector, as part of an international attribution mechanism.²⁷⁰ While such COLUMBIA HUMAN RIGHTS LAW REVIEW [53.1 proposals have largely focused on *jus ad bellum* concerns, attribution is equally critical to *jus in bello* issues, such as protecting cultural property.²⁷¹ The COVID-19 pandemic has made protections for digital cultural property all the more salient. In April 2020, 130 ministers of culture from around the world met virtually through Zoom to discuss the impact of the pandemic on the culture sector.²⁷² During the pandemic, “86% of countries... closed or partially closed their World Heritage Sites and 90% of museums... were closed.”²⁷³ Saudi Arabia, India, Colombia, Estonia, Greece, Albania, and Belize all emphasized the need to transition to digital cultural platforms and provide financial support for digital cultural production.²⁷⁴ “A large share of countries, including Kenya, Mexico and Lithuania, have made the digital transition one of the cornerstones of their cultural policy...”²⁷⁵ while other states, such as Serbia, Botswana, Cyprus, and Andorra questioned how this digital transformation would affect copyright protections.²⁷⁶ There was a general consensus among states that “[t]he digital transition must be the subject of global reflection and international regulation,”²⁷⁷ and that the digital cultural transition would certainly accelerate moving forward.²⁷⁸ ## CONCLUSION By framing digital and digitized cultural property as archives and records, existing international treaties can provide some degree of legal protection to this rapidly growing form of cultural heritage. This protection is particularly valuable, given the lack of an international effort to expand cultural heritage protections in the law of armed conflict. Because of the lack of a political will to create a new treaty for cultural property in cyberspace, states, international organizations, and scholars should further pursue novel interpretations to protect cultural heritage and adjust their policies\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\nThe emergence of digital cultural property raises further interesting questions surrounding international human rights law and its intersection with cultural heritage and cyberspace. To the extent that participation in cultural life creates a human right to cultural heritage,[279] and insofar as internet access is a human right,[280] protections for digital cultural property might also emerge from international human rights law, in addition to international humanitarian law. The use of an international human rights framework could bolster protections for digital cultural heritage in peacetime to a greater degree than international humanitarian law. Raising interesting questions surrounding privacy, sovereignty, intellectual property, and the freedom of expression, the use of a human rights [53.1 framework to protect digital cultural heritage and property is a promising subject for future research."

He spent his life as the Chief of Antiquities at the historic site of Palmyra in Syria, his hometown, where he protected one of the world's best-preserved archaeological sites—until ISIS seized his home and took him hostage.¹ After a month of torture, the terrorist group publicly beheaded Khaled al-Asaad for refusing to reveal the location of hidden antiquities.² Khaled al-Assad's sacrifice demonstrates the importance of cultural property to humanity: it is not only a record of humanity, but a fundamental pillar supporting it. Cultural property is so indispensable and so invaluable to humankind that the law must shield it from the bombs and bloodshed of war, just as Khaled al-Assad did. Yet, one hundred years from now, the artifacts worth dying for will not only be physical but also digital, made of code rather than stone or steel.³ This Note aims to address the fundamental question of how humanity will protect this new form of cultural property during armed conflicts.\nThere is widespread consensus that the law of armed conflict (\"LOAC\") applies to state and non-state actors in cyberspace, but there is far less consensus as to exactly how it applies.⁴ The application of settled principles of LOAC to cyber operations is a difficult one, as the cyber domain\n1.

This emergence also created a new form: digital cultural property, which is sometimes termed “born-digital cultural heritage.”¹³ Just as culture has become increasingly digital, so too has warfare, with large numbers of state and non-state actors fielding substantial cyber capabilities.¹⁴ This shift must prompt a reevaluation of the long-standing protections for cultural property in LOAC, which was made to protect columns and arches, not ones and zeroes.

This paper then contends that digital and digitized cultural property should be categorized as archives and\n¹⁵. The specialized terminology surrounding this topic deserves clarification. It is worth clarifying the terms \"cultural property\" and \"cultural heritage.\" The two terms are almost always used interchangeably in international treaties and scholarship. While cultural property is an older term, it has largely been superseded by cultural heritage, which is conceptually oriented around preservation for future generations rather than the rights and powers of the possessor. The term cultural heritage also encompasses practices that do not fall within any definition of tangible or intangible cultural heritage, making it a broader category than cultural property, although the terms are often synonymous. For example, the Great Wall of China is cultural property that forms part of China's cultural heritage. Yet the practice of Chinese calligraphy, an intangible cultural tradition, is not cultural property despite being part of China's cultural heritage. However, unlike cultural heritage, cultural property has a clear legal meaning, defined in the 1954 Hague Convention and 1970 UNESCO Convention.

Q. 61, 65(2000).\nDigitized cultural property is cultural property that has been copied or converted into digital format, yet which came from a real-world copy. Common examples of digitized cultural property include scanned books, audio recordings of music or culturally significant stories, and 3D renderings of monuments and artifacts.\nDigital cultural property is cultural property that has no original physical or real-world copy. Common examples of digital cultural property include digital artwork, blogs, vlogs, webcomics, e-books, certain audio recordings that are only digital downloads, some television shows and films, some journalism, and any other content that exists solely in digital form. The line between digital and digitized cultural property is not always clear. Take JSTOR, which is a digital repository for academic research similar to SSRN or PubMed. JSTOR hosts 12 million academic journal articles, books, and primary sources, yet only some lack any original physical version.

This would bring digital and digitized cultural property within treaty-based definitions of protected cultural property during times of armed conflict. As states increasingly turn to digitization to protect cultural property from the threats of climate change, terrorism, and physical degradation, and as human culture becomes increasingly digital, these protections will become increasingly important.¹⁷ Because LOAC's rules on cultural property and heritage do not vary substantially between international and non-international armed conflicts involving non-state actors,¹⁸ this paper's arguments extend to both. However, for simplicity's sake, this Note will focus on how to protect digital and digitized cultural property in international armed conflicts.¹⁹ Part I\n17. Alonzo C.

The differences in IHL between international and non-international armed conflicts are hotly debated and uncertain,\n254 COLUMBIA HUMAN RIGHTS LAW REVIEW [53.1\nbegins by exploring the history of protections for cultural property and heritage in times of war, with particular emphasis on the reasons for such protections. Part II discusses the development of digital and digitized cultural property and current threats to digital cultural heritage. Part III proposes a novel interpretation of digital and digitized cultural property as historically significant archives or documents and addresses what obligations belligerents ought to have towards cultural property in cyberspace.\n## I. Place of Cultural Property in the Law of Armed Conflict\n### A. Development of Protections for Cultural Property\nWith some exceptions, the wanton destruction of cultural property and heritage in ancient and medieval warfare was commonplace, governed by the maxim “to the victor go the spoils.”²⁰ Athenian historian Xenophon wrote, “It is an eternal law the wide world over, that when a city is taken in war, the citizens, their persons, and all their property fall into the hands of the conquerors.”²¹ The Roman Triumph prominently featured stolen art from defeated enemies,²² the Bible repeatedly references the plundering of art and treasures as spoils of war,²³ and when the Mongols sacked Baghdad in 1258 and destroyed the city’s great libraries, they threw so many books\nespecially in cyber space.

INT’L L. 643, 652 (2019); Michael Schmitt &amp; Sean Watts, *Beyond State-Centrism: International Law and Non-State Actors in Cyberspace*, 21 J. CONFLICT SEC. L. 595, 611 (2016) (“In many respects, the state-centric legal regime of public international law may seem ill-suited or even inadequate to address the challenges the super-empowered non-state actors of cyberspace present”). However, because state actors possess the most substantial capabilities in cyberspace and because IHL speaks with greater clarity on international armed conflicts, this paper focuses on international armed conflicts.\n²⁰. Or, as more eloquently phrased by Thucydides, “right, as the world goes, is only in question between equals in power, while the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must.” THUCYDIDES, *HISTORY OF THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 566–67* (Richard Crawley trans., *Floating Press* 2008) (Fourth century BCE).\n²¹.

Jeremiah 15:13 (King James) (“Thy substance and thy treasures will I give to the spoil without price, and that for all thy sins, even in all thy borders.”); 2 Chronicles 14:13-14 (“And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto Gerar . . . and they carried away very much spoil. And they smote all the cities round about Gerar . . . and they spoiled all the cities; for there was exceeding much spoil in them.”); see also Deuteronomy 20:10 (elaborating the practices of war and articulating divine endorsement of expropriating cultural property).\n2021]\nHard Drive Heritage\n255\ninto the Tigris that \"they formed a bridge that would support men on horseback\" and apocryphally turned the river black with ink.²⁴ During the sack of Constantinople in the Fourth Crusade, \"the palaces were burnt. The accumulated treasures of antiquity were recklessly looted and destroyed... The libraries containing the assembled literature of the classical and early Christian ages, went up in flames.\"²⁵ These are minor examples of the countless works of art, architecture, and literature that became casualties of war.²⁶\nYet some ancient thinkers and commanders took steps to exempt art, architecture, and houses of worship from the rampant destruction of civilian property. Greek historian Polybius wrote that while the destruction or taking of civilian property \"are necessary acts according to the laws and rights of war; to deface temples, statues, and such like erections in pure wantonness... must be regarded as an act of blind passion and insanity.\"²⁷ Cicero later used this line of reasoning to prosecute Gaius Verres in 70 BCE for expropriating artworks from temples and citizens during his governorship of Sicily.²⁸ To mitigate the damage of war to spiritual institutions, Frederick Barbarossa issued an edict in 1158 forbidding the pillaging of churches, although the ransacking of houses of worship remained ubiquitous in medieval warfare.²⁹ The Quran likewise prohibits fighting in sacred places, such as mosques and other houses of worship.³⁰\nThe Enlightenment marked a substantial shift in the treatment of cultural property and heritage in international legal thought.³¹ French jurist Emer de Vattel wrote that destroying cultural property renders a belligerent\n24.

[sic] is absolutely condemned, even by the voluntary law of nations, as never being conducive to the lawful object of war.”³² Reasoning that no party would gain from the destruction of cultural property, Vattel argued such destruction or expropriation was unlawful.³³ This protection complemented Vattel’s principle of moderation in warfare, especially regarding pillaging hostile territory. “All damage done to the enemy unnecessarily, every act of hostility which does not tend to procure victory and bring the war to a conclusion, is licentiousness condemned by the laws of nature.”³⁴ Drawing on Cicero and Polybius, influential Dutch jurist Hugo Grotius similarly argued for protecting cultural property under the laws of war. “Porticos, Temples, statues, and all other elegant works and monuments of art” are “of such a nature, as to contribute, no way, to the support and prolongation of war.”³⁵ As a result, Grotius thought belligerents ought to exercise moderation in their treatment of enemy civilian property generally and cultural property in particular.³⁶\nRegardless, it would take the arrival of industrialized warfare to transform legal theory into legal agreements. The nineteenth century saw further refinement of the laws of war and its provisions concerning cultural property. The 1863 Lieber Code, a set of instructions issued to Union soldiers during the American Civil War, provided that “[c]lassical works of art, libraries, scientific collections, or precious instruments, such as astronomical telescopes, as well as hospitals, must be secured against all avoidable injury, even when they are contained in fortified places whilst besieged or bombarded.”³⁷ But the Lieber Code’s protection for such cultural property was limited at best; it also allowed for the seizure of cultural property by an invading or occupying force if it could remove cultural property without injury, with the determination of ownership left to the final peace conference.³⁸ Although it was not intended as a legal agreement, the Lieber Code nevertheless had an immense influence on the development of the laws\n32.

Article 56 of the 1907 Hague Convention states that, during an occupation, “[t]he property of municipalities, that of institutions dedicated to religion, charity and education, the arts and sciences, even when State property, shall be treated as private property.”⁴³ The treaty further mandates that “[a]ll seizure of, destruction or wilful [sic] damage done to institutions of this character, historic monuments, works of art and science, is forbidden, and should be made the subject of legal proceedings.”⁴⁴ Article 27 also requires that “all necessary steps must be taken to spare, as far as possible, buildings dedicated to religion, art, science, or charitable purposes, [and] historic monuments” and states that belligerents have a duty to clearly demarcate protected buildings or property.⁴⁵ However, the 1907 treaty proved ineffective at protecting cultural property during the Second World War, as Axis forces blatantly disregarded it.⁴⁶ The extensive looting of cultural\n39.

Hague Convention, Additional Protocols, and the Evolution of Cultural Property Protections\nThe 1954 Hague Convention is a core treaty shielding cultural property in armed conflicts. It aims to prevent “damage to cultural property belonging to any people whatsoever…since each people makes its contribution to the culture of the world.”⁴⁸ The 1954 Convention, faced with “the developments in the technique of warfare” which exacerbated the dangers posed to cultural property, built on the 1907 framework by requiring states to secure cultural property during peacetime and prohibiting the destruction of cultural heritage witnessed in World War II.⁴⁹ The treaty defines cultural property as “movable or immovable property of great importance to the cultural heritage of every people.”⁵⁰ This includes,\nof Militarism in Postwar Japan, 33 JAPAN REV. 195. 195 (2019). However, the Nazi’s systematic campaign of looting and eradicating important cultural works was so extensive it resulted in charges at the Nuremberg Tribunal and led Allied forces to establish the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives Program (also referred to as the “Monuments Men”) to safeguard plundered cultural works.

The 1954 Hague Convention’s approach is highly internationalist in that it frames cultural property as being of great significance to humanity regardless of location or national jurisdiction. See John Merryman, Two Ways of Thinking About Cultural Property, 80 AM. J. INT’L L. 831, 836 (1986). The Convention’s preamble states “that damage to cultural property belonging to any people whatsoever means damage to the cultural heritage of all mankind, since each people makes its contribution to the culture of the world.” Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict pmbl., May 14, 1954, S.

As a result, the Convention protects the cultural property “of each respective people” rather than property “of all peoples jointly,” an interpretation which the parties’ implementation reports support. ROGER O’KEEFE, THE PROTECTION OF CULTURAL PROPERTY IN ARMED CONFLICT 104–05 (2006). This interpretation is significant as it expands the scope of the treaty beyond cultural property of global significance and protects each people’s distinct cultural heritage.\n49. 1954 Hague Convention, supra note 48, at pmbl.

The party in whose territory the property is situated determines its cultural importance, and thus whether it is legally protected—a determination which parties must make in good faith.53 Absent notice to opposing parties under Articles 3 and 6 of the Hague Convention—notice that is left up to the parties' discretion—belligerents must hazard an educated guess, weighed down with caution, as to any item's cultural importance.54 Belligerents must then \"respect cultural property\" by refraining from conduct that would expose it to destruction or damage and further have a duty to protect cultural property from vandalism, theft, or\n51.

While the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) successfully led several prosecutions for the destruction of cultural property,63 recent terrorist attacks have destroyed similarly irreplaceable works of cultural property. In 2001, the Taliban destroyed the Bamiyan Buddhas, 1,500-year-old statues over 100 feet tall—which were then the largest in the world.64 The looting of the National Museum of Iraq in the wake of Operation Iraqi Freedom was another shameful chapter, and stolen artifacts continue to flood illicit antiquities markets fifteen years later.65 Pointing to these contemptible episodes, some scholars have criticized the 1954 Hague Convention as ineffective at preventing the loss of these cultural treasures, even as the 1954 Convention's Second Additional Protocol clearly extended its protections to non-state actors.66 The Hague Convention, Additional Protocol II, and the 1970 World Heritage Convention have concededly not protected every piece of cultural property, but surely they have saved some.67 Yet, because of these treaties, not only does the destruction of cultural property often yield widespread international\n61.

Yet, cyberspace is also a means through which state and non-state actors can accomplish their goals. Cyberwarfare consists of using digital means to accomplish political objectives in an armed conflict and occurs in the same virtual environment that houses culturally significant data.¹⁰⁵ One often-cited example is the Stuxnet computer worm, which the United States and Israel used to damage Iranian uranium centrifuges by altering the centrifuges' rotational frequencies through an exploit in Windows and Siemens software.¹⁰⁶ Because digital and digitized cultural property is often stored on devices connected to cyberspace, it is vulnerable to both cyberattacks and conventional attacks.\nProtections for real-world cultural property from cyber-attacks are fairly straightforward. The 1907 Hague Regulations and the 1954 Hague Convention apply regardless of a parties' method of warfare.¹⁰⁷ Thus, it would be just as unlawful to use a cyberattack to cause a gas leak at an enemy's historic museum, thereby causing a fire to damage art, artifacts, and the building itself, as it would be to attack the museum with a cruise missile.

As mentioned previously, international law has no objective test for what is or is not protected as cultural property. See O’Keefe, supra note 48, at 110–11 (“[W]hile in principle the Convention leaves it to the Party in whose territory the relevant property is situated to determine whether or not that property is of great importance to its cultural heritage and is therefore protected by the Convention,” the practical effect of this is that “the opposing Party must hazard an assessment as to the cultural importance of the property in question to the territorial Party.”); see also 1954 Hague Convention, supra note 48 (broadly defining the scope of cultural property protected under the Convention without referencing an objective test). As a result, in cyberspace, belligerents must weigh the importance of targets and determine, reasonably and in compliance with the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, whether the target is legal.\n123. What amounts to an “attack” in cyberspace under international law is a fraught question beyond the scope of this paper. Regarding jus ad bellum, the key question is whether a cyberattack can amount to a “use of force” prohibited by Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter. U.N. Charter art. 2, ¶ 4. One common answer is to look at the effects of a cyber operation and determine whether it meets that threshold. See Matthew Waxman, *Cyber Attacks as “Force” Under UN Charter Article 2(4)*, 87 INT’L L. STUD. 43, 45–48 (2011) (stating that a cyber-attack that is sufficiently coercive might amount to a use of force, or that interference in another state’s internal matters might cross that threshold, and that the United States’ position tended towards an effects-based test); see also TALLINN MANUAL 2.0., supra note 4, at 330 (“A cyber operation constitutes a use of force when its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force”); Jeremy Wright, *Att’y Gen. of the U.K., Cyber and International Law in the 21st Century* (May 23, 2018) [check R17.2 on public speeches and addresses] (May 3, 2018), https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/cyber-and-international-law-in-the-21st-century (on file with the *Columbia Human Rights Law Review*) (“If a hostile state interferes with the operation of one of our nuclear reactors, resulting in widespread loss of life, the fact that the act is carried out by way of a cyber operation does not prevent it from being viewed as an unlawful use of force or an armed attack against us.”).\nHowever, the threshold for what constitutes a use of force is fluid and heavily influenced by state practice. Schmitt, *The Law of Cyber Warfare*, supra note 10 (“Over time, the reaction of states to cyber operations, as well as how they characterize their own cyber operations, will inform the process of interpretive maturation.”) It is unclear whether data deletion of non-culturally significant data would amount to a use of force. TALLINN MANUAL 2.0., supra note 4 (“The development of further State practice notwithstanding, network intrusions, the deletion or destruction of data (even on a large scale), computer network exploitation, and data theft do not amount to a non-international armed conflict.”); Tim McCormack, *International Humanitarian Law and the Targeting of Data*, 94 INT’L L.

Interpreting International Law to Protect Cultural Property in Cyberspace\n## A. Digital and Digitized Cultural Property as Archives\nA new interpretation of international law is the most effective way to extend international law to cyberspace. Because belligerents are reluctant to acknowledge their actions in cyberspace—indeed, ostensible anonymity and difficulty attributing cyber operations to a state or non-state actor is part of the appeal of cyber operations—it is unlikely that customary international law will bring order to the cyber arena.¹³⁶ The ossification of customary international law requires open state practice driven by a sense of international obligation. This is unlikely to occur in cyberwarfare where states engage in highly classified cyber operations in relative anonymity.¹³⁷ Furthermore, without grievous cyberattacks affecting large numbers of states equally, international political will would likely be insufficient to produce a new treaty to regulate armed conflict in cyberspace, let alone clarify digital cultural property’s status in international humanitarian law. As a result, interpretations of existing legal instruments and principles will likely define the evolution of international law in cyberspace.¹³⁸ These interpretations may come through formal statements by states as to their legal position or their armed forces’ manuals on the laws of war.¹³⁹ Additionally, “[o]ver time, the reaction of states to cyber operations, as well as how they characterize their own cyber operations, will inform the process of interpretive maturation.”¹⁴⁰\n135. *Id.*; see also Eliza Chapman, *Should Data Be Considered Critical Infrastructure?*, AUSTL.

An archive, \"a repository or collection especially of information,\" 142 is a particularly apt description of digital information, which is normally stored either on a device's local hard drive or a server connected to the internet. While a 3D scan of a historic monument is not a historic monument itself, it is a reproduction of an important monument of architecture that is filed away alongside other 3D scans, like books on a shelf. Likewise, archived born-digital cultural property ought to be protected as \"moveable or immovable property of great importance to the cultural heritage of every people . . .\" 143 The fact that digital cultural property exists to preserve cultural heritage, maintain cultural integrity, and provide access to societal memory only strengthens arguments for its protection, since a society implicitly preserves what it values. 144 This is not to say that every scrap of data ought to fall within the ambit of cultural property in IHL. However, data of sufficient cultural, scientific, or religious import, or which when aggregated take on sufficient importance, surely fall within the scope of the 1954 Hague Convention and customary international law. Born-digital cultural property is especially worthy of protection 145 since, unlike digitized cultural property, there is no physical backup if it is altered or destroyed.\n141.

Libraries and archives form the center of a society's collective memory: \"[t]he loss of archives is as serious as the loss of memory in a human being.\"¹⁴⁷ \"By their very nature archives are unique both as individual documents and as documents in context. Lost Archives are irreplaceable, any loss is final, reconstruction is impossible.\"¹⁴⁸ Likewise, though galleries, libraries, archives, and museums (\"GLAMs,\" which are sometimes also referred to as Cultural Heritage Institutions (\"CHIs\")) do not always hold unique documents, they are irreplaceable centers of cultural heritage and meaning, with this being especially true of national libraries.¹⁴⁹ Archives are \"a basic part of the cultural property of States\" and are \"universally recognized as an essential part of the heritage of every national community.\"¹⁵⁰ As a result, large collections of documents warrant substantial protection under IHL, subject to limited exceptions for military necessity.¹⁵¹ These protections should extend to digital and digitized cultural\n146.

Libraries, archives, and records, unlike other forms of cultural property, such as historic monuments, can be significant to military or intelligence operations. Generally speaking, belligerents have a right to seize documents during hostilities or occupation with some nexus to the conflict or some level of military importance. See 1907 Hague Convention, supra note 43, at art. 53 (\"An occupying army may generally take \"all movable property belonging to the State which may be used for military operations.\"); id. at art. 23(g) (noting that during hostilities, \"it is especially forbidden . . . [t]o destroy or seize the enemy's property, unless such destruction or seizure be imperatively demanded by the necessities of war . . .\"); 1954 Hague Convention, supra note 48, at art. 4 (outlining the duties of belligerents during hostilities and occupation to respect cultural property and refrain from uses which are likely to expose it to destruction, subject to a waiver of imperative military necessity). Because a great number of documents are likely to have little cultural significance and great intelligence or military relevance, military necessity opens the door to a substantial number of documents.

Belligerents’ Obligations Towards Digital and Digitized Cultural Property\nAlthough digital cultural property should fall within the scope of the law of armed conflict, novel characteristics of the cyber domain alter what obligations belligerents have towards cultural property. In the current international legal regime, states have the following core obligations to cultural property: 1) states are prohibited from targeting cultural property or directing “acts of hostility [towards it]”;¹⁷⁴ 2) states are prohibited from using cultural property in a way that would imperil it; 3) states are prohibited from plundering or looting cultural property or from making reprisals against it; and 4) states are obliged to stop the theft, pillage, misappropriation, and vandalism of cultural property.¹⁷⁵ These obligations, rooted in the 1954 Hague Convention and customary international law, are core protections for cultural property and heritage.¹⁷⁶\n167.

For example, Wikipedia has over six million articles in English,¹⁷⁷ articles in over 314 languages,¹⁷⁸ and, with two billion unique visitors per month,¹⁷⁹ is the thirteenth most-visited website in the world.¹⁸⁰ Wikipedia’s fifty-two million pages, along with its complete edit history, amounted to ten uncompressed terabytes in 2015, and Wikimedia Commons, which hosts all the media files on Wikipedia, totaled over twenty-three terabytes as of 2014.¹⁸¹ As the largest encyclopedia ever created,¹⁸² Wikipedia surely falls into the category of an archive under the 1954 Hague Convention and the 1907 Hague Regulations, as it is dedicated to “science, or charitable purposes.”¹⁸³ However, by its very nature, Wikipedia is constantly changing and growing, making destruction or vandalism by a state difficult to define. Wikipedia, like many online spaces, is a collaborative exchange between users. Acts of vandalism and the occasional deletion of articles by Wikipedia editors are not uncommon on the site. For example, vandals once changed the article on run-on sentences to be one long run-on sentence. They also posted the personal information of prominent Republican politicians during U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings.¹⁸⁴ More\n177.

Perhaps more humorously, in 2006 American comedian Stephen Colbert attempted to assist the endangered African elephant by encouraging his viewers to change the African elephant’s Wikipedia page to show elephant populations were skyrocketing. Similarly, in 2007,\nCOLUMBIA HUMAN RIGHTS LAW REVIEW\n[53.1\nsinisterly, the BBC reported in 2019 on how the People's Republic of China was encouraging its citizens to edit Wikipedia entries on several sensitive topics, to \"reflect our voices and opinions in the entry, so as to objectively and truly reflect the influence of Chinese path and Chinese thoughts on other countries and history.\" 185 Approximately 1,600 edits were made to Wikipedia pages for Hong Kong, Taiwan, the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, and nineteen other politically sensitive articles, although no coordinated cyber operation was uncovered.186\nOne way to determine when state activity in cyberspace impermissibly disrupts cultural property is a sliding scale analysis: how much of an effect does the military operation have on the digital cultural property? A group of soldiers stealing, defacing, or destroying one book or document from an archive likely has a de minimis effect on the entirety of the archive. Similarly, a proper analysis might be to what degree a cyber operation affects the entirety of a cultural data set. North Korea might decide to selectively edit the Wikipedia page of Kim Jong-un as part of an information operation, but that would be far less damaging than a broad cyber operation defacing or deleting large quantities of Wikipedia, or any other interactive cultural data set. It would be important to consider the ease of repair as well. For instance, digitized cultural data might be the sole remnant of lost cultural property, and thus critical for reconstruction, similar to how eighteen century art was essential to reconstructing Warsaw's Old Town after World War II.187 In the twenty-first century, cultural heritage experts are repairing the damage done by ISIS by using crowdsourced images of Mosul and historic sites in the Levant to 3D print lost artifacts and reproduce destroyed urban environments in virtual reality.188 Respect for these 3D prints and images during warfare is critical, as they are the last remnants of now-destroyed cultural property.\nStates' other obligations towards cultural property translate well into cyberspace.

For instance, a distributed denial of service (“DDOS”) attack, one of the most common forms of cyberattacks which takes down a network by flooding it with requests, on digital or digitized cultural property, would not necessarily violate international law.¹⁹¹\nHowever, a DDOS attack might be considered an “act of hostility” within the meaning of the Additional Protocols to the Geneva Convention IV.¹⁹² Additional Protocol II does not protect archives or libraries, but instead protects “historic monuments, works of art, or places of worship which constitute the cultural or spiritual heritage of peoples.”¹⁹³ At the same time, the ICRC interprets the Additional Protocols to incorporate the 1954 Hague Convention’s definition of cultural heritage and property, which would extend protections for cultural property despite the Additional Protocols’ text not mentioning archives.¹⁹⁴ According to the ICRC, an “act of hostility” need not have a substantive effect on the cultural property itself, so long as it is “directed against” the cultural property.¹⁹⁵ Indeed, if a DDOS attack qualifies as an “act of hostility,” then Additional Protocols I and II and the 1954 Hague Convention would prohibit it.¹⁹⁶ Thus, it is conceivable that IHL would prohibit a DDOS attack on digital cultural property.¹⁹⁷\n189. 1954 Hague Convention, supra note 48, at arts. 3, 7.\n190.

See Additional Protocol I, supra note 57, at art. 53. For example, if a belligerent decided to launch a DDOS attack on the Internet Archive—an American non-profit digital library with the mission of providing “Universal Access to All Knowledge,” then under the ICRC’s interpretation of Additional Protocols I and II—that attack may amount to an act of hostility and thus a violation of international law. See About the Internet Archive, supra note 89.\n282 COLUMBIA HUMAN RIGHTS LAW REVIEW [53.1\nAnother major issue in international legal obligations comes from how data challenges the territoriality of the 1954 Hague Convention.¹⁹⁸ While territorial location does not affect customary international legal obligation to refrain from damaging cultural property during armed conflict,¹⁹⁹ the Convention requires parties to “undertake to prepare in time of peace for the safeguarding of cultural property situated within their own territory against the foreseeable effects of an armed conflict . . .”²⁰⁰ Articles 12 and 13 of the Convention outline specific provisions for the safety of cultural property during transport.²⁰¹ However, data, unlike physical cultural property, rapidly crosses international boundaries along pre-determined paths and is often highly divisible.²⁰² A reasonable interpretation of states’ peacetime obligation might include replicating cultural data that resides in their territory for a substantial time or replicating cultural property of particular importance to the state’s own culture.\nThis shift in established notions of territoriality has additional implications. Traditionally, states would claim ownership over real-world cultural property within their borders. For example, the Taj Mahal is a UNESCO World Heritage Site²⁰³ that has special cultural importance to India, where it is located. Most nations seek to control their cultural property in the interest of its “retention, preservation, study, enjoyment, and exploitation.”²⁰⁴ This may be the case for digital cultural property as well,²⁰⁵ but others might be content with storing digital cultural property on a server in another country. International law’s focus on cultural internationalism simplifies this issue.²⁰⁶ Insofar as cultural property is the “cultural heritage of all mankind,”²⁰⁷ a state must protect digital cultural property within its territory regardless of its cultural origin. Museums across the world already do this; for example, the MET Digital Collection features scans of masks from\n198.

Protections for Replicas of Cultural Property in Cyberspace: Addressing Counter-Arguments\nA common question scholars pose is how digital technologies affect the authenticity of art.²¹¹ German philosopher Walter Benjamin argued that each work of art possesses a unique “aura” which mechanical reproduction erases, and thus, reproduction destroys the work’s authenticity.²¹² This is undeniably a motivation for protecting real-world cultural property and it is why reproductions often fail to stand in for stolen cultural property.²¹³ Humanity yearns for cultural objects because they are true and certain and possess some kind of uniqueness.²¹⁴ In addition to serving as surrogates,\n208.

Photographs, according to Roland Barthes, radiate an aura, a distance, reference to a past and memory.”²¹⁶ However, authenticity is not the only reason why cultural property is considered worth preserving. Cultural property contains a society’s memories, brings substantial economic benefits through the antiquities trade or tourism, fosters a sense of community and identity, and by extension, has political value.²¹⁷ This is to say nothing of the value digitized reproductions have as a means of preservation and access, or how societies are capable of creating complex emotional relationships with replicas.²¹⁸\nThe strongest argument against interpreting LOAC to protect digital and digitized cultural property is that data is easily reproducible and disseminated, making its destruction exceedingly difficult and legal protections unnecessary. The Tallinn Manual 2.0, an influential academic publication outlining international law in cyberspace, incorporates this point; it argues that belligerents “must respect and protect cultural property that may be affected by cyber operations or that is located in cyberspace.”²¹⁹ However, the Manual continues, “[p]rotection only applies to digital copies or versions where the original is either inaccessible or has been destroyed,\n215.

First, the fact that cultural property may be lodged on a hard drive somewhere else in the world does not mean that it is or will be. Even accepting the replication argument as valid fails to recognize the peacetime duty to preserve and protect cultural property, which is recognized under the Hague Convention.²²² Digital cultural property is easily duplicated and stored, but this does not eliminate the need for a legal duty to duplicate and store digital cultural property. There are numerous examples of digital cultural works being lost or nearly lost because of a failure to maintain proper backups.²²³ Even the existence of a backup is no guarantee if the data storage is centralized, as a conventional attack on a data center could destroy all existing copies of a culturally significant file.²²⁴ Such a conventional attack is not unlikely, as military and civilian internet infrastructure are largely\n220.

Belligerents already use this test to determine the lawfulness of a target in the absence of notice of its cultural importance.²²⁷\nSecond, the texts of the Hague Convention and the Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions refute this argument. The Hague Convention explicitly protects “important collections of books or archives or of reproductions,” so copies of digital cultural property would likely warrant protection.²²⁸ During the Convention’s negotiations, the delegates from Switzerland and France insisted on the inclusion of protections for reproductions, “so that future generations would at least have the opportunity of seeing photographs of such works if the originals had been destroyed.”²²⁹ Additional Protocols I and II to the Geneva Convention outlaw “any acts of hostility directed against” cultural property.²³⁰ Applying this language, ICTY in Prosecutor v.

The intricacies of domestic IP laws cut against any presumption that digital cultural property, wherever located, will have backups, and thus counsels in favor of protecting digital cultural property in the event of an armed conflict.\n## 1. Copyright Law and the Problems It Presents for Digital Cultural Heritage\nCurrent cultural property law regimes impede the replication of digital cultural property. For instance, most digital cultural property is available in encrypted formats, which ties the digital goods to a specific account to prevent duplication; as a result, cultural heritage institutions are capable of licensing these digital goods, but they are unable to create archival copies until the expiration of the copyright.²³⁸ The Digital Millennium Copyright Act makes circumventing these technical measures against duplication a federal crime punishable by up to five years in prison.²³⁹ As a result, GLAMs must often wait ninety-five years after a work’s publication—or seventy years after the death of the author—to produce an archival copy,²⁴⁰ by which point the cultural property will likely have been lost to technological obsolescence, degraded hard drives, human error, or malicious attacks.²⁴¹ According to the Library of Congress, this has happened before.

How to Protect Digital Cultural Property in Practice\nThe question remains of how to ensure the Hague Convention and its Additional Protocols, as well as the Geneva Convention and its Additional Protocols, carry weight. One idea might be technical solutions. Articles 16 and 17 of the 1954 Hague Convention establish a distinctive marking to identify physical cultural property and to provide notice to all parties of the property's protected status.²⁵⁹ This could easily be adapted into a number of technical solutions, including file naming conventions and coding schemes to tag cultural data.²⁶⁰ Militaries have already developed no-strike lists for culturally significant sites, which prevented the destruction of ancient monuments by Coalition Forces during the First Gulf War and the 2011 Libya Intervention.²⁶¹ Such no-strike lists might extend to certain servers, data centers, or IP addresses housing culturally significant data. Additionally, a published register of IP addresses, analogous to already-extant national or international registers of cultural property, would help provide notice and further remove cultural property from hostilities in cyberspace.²⁶² By segregating the civilian internet from the locus of military operations, states can better preserve digital cultural property in an armed conflict. At a minimum, states ought to ensure digital cultural data is preserved through at least some basic cybersecurity provisions as a means of fulfilling their peacetime obligations under Article 3 of the 1954 Hague Convention.²⁶³\nInternational collaboration is also key to preserving digital cultural property. As part of their peacetime obligations under the 1954 Hague Convention, public cultural agencies and ministries could collaborate\n259. 1954 Hague Convention, supra note 48, at arts. 16–17.\n260.

In April 2020, 130 ministers of culture from around the world met virtually through Zoom to discuss the impact of the pandemic on the culture sector.²⁷² During the pandemic, “86% of countries . . . closed or partially closed their World Heritage Sites and 90% of museums . . . were closed.”²⁷³ Saudi Arabia, India, Colombia, Estonia, Greece, Albania, and Belize all emphasized the need to transition to digital cultural platforms and provide financial support for digital cultural production.²⁷⁴ “A large share of countries, including Kenya, Mexico and Lithuania, have made the digital transition one of the cornerstones of their cultural policy . . .”²⁷⁵ while other states, such as Serbia, Botswana, Cyprus, and Andorra questioned how this digital transformation would affect copyright protections.²⁷⁶ There was a general consensus among states that “[t]he digital transition must be the subject of global reflection and international regulation,”²⁷⁷ and that the digital cultural transition would certainly accelerate moving forward.²⁷⁸\n## CONCLUSION\nBy framing digital and digitized cultural property as archives and records, existing international treaties can provide some degree of legal protection to this rapidly growing form of cultural heritage. This protection is particularly valuable, given the lack of an international effort to expand cultural heritage protections in the law of armed conflict. Because of the lack of a political will to create a new treaty for cultural property in cyberspace, states, international organizations, and scholars should further pursue novel interpretations to protect cultural heritage and adjust their policies\n271.

To the extent that participation in cultural life creates a human right to cultural heritage, and insofar as internet access is a human right, protections for digital cultural property might also emerge from international human rights law, in addition to international humanitarian law.

He spent his life as the Chief of Antiquities at the historic site of Palmyra in Syria, his hometown, where he protected one of the world's best-preserved archaeological sites—until ISIS seized his home and took him hostage.¹ After a month of torture, the terrorist group publicly beheaded Khaled al-Asaad for refusing to reveal the location of hidden antiquities.² Khaled al-Assad's sacrifice demonstrates the importance of cultural property to humanity: it is not only a record of humanity, but a fundamental pillar supporting it. Cultural property is so indispensable and so invaluable to humankind that the law must shield it from the bombs and bloodshed of war, just as Khaled al-Assad did. Yet, one hundred years from now, the artifacts worth dying for will not only be physical but also digital, made of code rather than stone or steel.³ This Note aims to address the fundamental question of how humanity will protect this new form of cultural property during armed conflicts.\nThere is widespread consensus that the law of armed conflict (\"LOAC\") applies to state and non-state actors in cyberspace, but there is far less consensus as to exactly how it applies.⁴ The application of settled principles of LOAC to cyber operations is a difficult one, as the cyber domain lacks the physical characteristics which have always marked battlefields.⁵ This has resulted in a great deal of literature discussing how the principles of proportionality,⁶ distinction,⁷ attribution,⁸ and neutrality⁹ can exist in cyberspace. The current intricacies of global politics have also complicated matters, as norms and interpretations of international law in cyberspace are continuously evolving to match shifting political and technical realities.¹⁰ This interpretive uncertainty has raised the question of how protection for cultural property under LOAC, a longstanding goal of international law, can extend to cyberspace.\nCultural property is protected under both treaty-based and customary international law. The destruction, degradation, theft, vandalism, or misappropriation of cultural property is a war crime.¹¹ International law\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\nmilitary objectives” a war crime). The Second Protocol to the Hague Convention of 1954, created in 1999, also requires states to conduct domestic prosecutions of serious violations of the 1954 Hague Convention.

This paper then contends that digital and digitized cultural property should be categorized as archives and ¹⁵. The specialized terminology surrounding this topic deserves clarification. It is worth clarifying the terms\"cultural property\"and\"cultural heritage.\"The two terms are almost always used interchangeably in international treaties and scholarship. While cultural property is an older term, it has largely been superseded by cultural heritage, which is conceptually oriented around preservation for future generations rather than the rights and powers of the possessor. The term cultural heritage also encompasses practices that do not fall within any definition of tangible or intangible cultural heritage, making it a broader category than cultural property, although the terms are often synonymous. For example, the Great Wall of China is cultural property that forms part of China's cultural heritage. Yet the practice of Chinese calligraphy, an intangible cultural tradition, is not cultural property despite being part of China's cultural heritage. However, unlike cultural heritage, cultural property has a clear legal meaning, defined in the 1954 Hague Convention and 1970 UNESCO Convention. See Lyndel Prott &amp; Patrick O'Keefe, 'Cultural Heritage' or 'Cultural Property'?, 1 INT'L J. CULTURAL PROPERTY 307, 309 (1992); Manlio Frigo, Cultural Property v.

Q. 61, 65(2000).\nDigitized cultural property is cultural property that has been copied or converted into digital format, yet which came from a real-world copy. Common examples of digitized cultural property include scanned books, audio recordings of music or culturally significant stories, and 3D renderings of monuments and artifacts.\nDigital cultural property is cultural property that has no original physical or real-world copy. Common examples of digital cultural property include digital artwork, blogs, vlogs, webcomics, e-books, certain audio recordings that are only digital downloads, some television shows and films, some journalism, and any other content that exists solely in digital form. The line between digital and digitized cultural property is not always clear. Take JSTOR, which is a digital repository for academic research similar to SSRN or PubMed. JSTOR hosts 12 million academic journal articles, books, and primary sources, yet only some lack any original physical version.

International humanitarian law (\"IHL\") is\"broadly speaking, that branch of public international law that seeks to moderate the conduct of armed conflict and to mitigate the suffering that it causes.\"Amanda Alexander, A Short History of International Humanitarian Law, 26 EUR. J. INT'L L. 109, 111 (2015). IHL, which is synonymous with the law of armed conflict, encompasses treaties on the rules of war, ius in bello, as well as international norms that have ossified into binding customary international law. Id.\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage begins by exploring the history of protections for cultural property and heritage in times of war, with particular emphasis on the reasons for such protections. Part II discusses the development of digital and digitized cultural property and current threats to digital cultural heritage. Part III proposes a novel interpretation of digital and digitized cultural property as historically significant archives or documents and addresses what obligations belligerents ought to have towards cultural property in cyberspace.\n## I. Place of Cultural Property in the Law of Armed Conflict ### A. Development of Protections for Cultural Property With some exceptions, the wanton destruction of cultural property and heritage in ancient and medieval warfare was commonplace, governed by the maxim “to the victor go the spoils.”²⁰ Athenian historian Xenophon wrote, “It is an eternal law the wide world over, that when a city is taken in war, the citizens, their persons, and all their property fall into the hands of the conquerors.”²¹ The Roman Triumph prominently featured stolen art from defeated enemies,²² the Bible repeatedly references the plundering of art and treasures as spoils of war,²³ and when the Mongols sacked Baghdad in 1258 and destroyed the city’s great libraries, they threw so many books especially in cyber space. David Wallace &amp; Christopher Jacobs, *Conflict Classification and Cyber Operations: Gaps, Ambiguities and Fault Lines*, 40 U. PA. J. INT’L L. 643, 652 (2019); Michael Schmitt &amp; Sean Watts, *Beyond State-Centrism: International Law and Non-State Actors in Cyberspace*, 21 J. CONFLICT SEC. L. 595, 611 (2016) (“In many respects, the state-centric legal regime of public international law may seem ill-suited or even inadequate to address the challenges the super-empowered non-state actors of cyberspace present”). However, because state actors possess the most substantial capabilities in cyberspace and because IHL speaks with greater clarity on international armed conflicts, this paper focuses on international armed conflicts.\n²⁰. Or, as more eloquently phrased by Thucydides, “right, as the world goes, is only in question between equals in power, while the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must.” THUCYDIDES, *HISTORY OF THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR 566–67* (Richard Crawley trans., *Floating Press* 2008) (Fourth century BCE).\n²¹.

Jeremiah 15:13 (King James) (“Thy substance and thy treasures will I give to the spoil without price, and that for all thy sins, even in all thy borders.”); 2 Chronicles 14:13-14 (“And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto Gerar... and they carried away very much spoil. And they smote all the cities round about Gerar... and they spoiled all the cities; for there was exceeding much spoil in them.”); see also Deuteronomy 20:10 (elaborating the practices of war and articulating divine endorsement of expropriating cultural property).\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage Yet some ancient thinkers and commanders took steps to exempt art, architecture, and houses of worship from the rampant destruction of civilian property. Greek historian Polybius wrote that while the destruction or taking of civilian property\"are necessary acts according to the laws and rights of war; to deface temples, statues, and such like erections in pure wantonness... must be regarded as an act of blind passion and insanity.\"²⁷ Cicero later used this line of reasoning to prosecute Gaius Verres in 70 BCE for expropriating artworks from temples and citizens during his governorship of Sicily.²⁸ To mitigate the damage of war to spiritual institutions, Frederick Barbarossa issued an edict in 1158 forbidding the pillaging of churches, although the ransacking of houses of worship remained ubiquitous in medieval warfare.²⁹ The Quran likewise prohibits fighting in sacred places, such as mosques and other houses of worship.³⁰ The Enlightenment marked a substantial shift in the treatment of cultural property and heritage in international legal thought.³¹ French jurist Emer de Vattel wrote that destroying cultural property renders a belligerent an enemy to all mankind and that “the wanton destruction of public monuments, temples, tombs, statues, paintings, &amp;c. [sic] is absolutely condemned, even by the voluntary law of nations, as never being conducive to the lawful object of war.”³² Reasoning that no party would gain from the destruction of cultural property, Vattel argued such destruction or expropriation was unlawful.³³ This protection complemented Vattel’s principle of moderation in warfare, especially regarding pillaging hostile territory. “All damage done to the enemy unnecessarily, every act of hostility which does not tend to procure victory and bring the war to a conclusion, is licentiousness condemned by the laws of nature.”³⁴ Drawing on Cicero and Polybius, influential Dutch jurist Hugo Grotius similarly argued for protecting cultural property under the laws of war. “Porticos, Temples, statues, and all other elegant works and monuments of art” are “of such a nature, as to contribute, no way, to the support and prolongation of war.”³⁵ As a result, Grotius thought belligerents ought to exercise moderation in their treatment of enemy civilian property generally and cultural property in particular.³⁶ Regardless, it would take the arrival of industrialized warfare to transform legal theory into legal agreements. The nineteenth century saw further refinement of the laws of war and its provisions concerning cultural property. The 1863 Lieber Code, a set of instructions issued to Union soldiers during the American Civil War, provided that “[c]lassical works of art, libraries, scientific collections, or precious instruments, such as astronomical telescopes, as well as hospitals, must be secured against all avoidable injury, even when they are contained in fortified places whilst besieged or bombarded.”³⁷ But the Lieber Code’s protection for such cultural property was limited at best; it also allowed for the seizure of cultural property by an invading or occupying force if it could remove cultural property without injury, with the determination of ownership left to the final peace conference.³⁸ Although it was not intended as a legal agreement, the Lieber Code nevertheless had an immense influence on the development of the laws\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\nBy the twentieth century, foundational international treaties on the laws of war began to give greater force to protections for cultural property. Article 56 of the 1907 Hague Convention states that, during an occupation, “[t]he property of municipalities, that of institutions dedicated to religion, charity and education, the arts and sciences, even when State property, shall be treated as private property.”⁴³ The treaty further mandates that “[a]ll seizure of, destruction or wilful [sic] damage done to institutions of this character, historic monuments, works of art and science, is forbidden, and should be made the subject of legal proceedings.”⁴⁴ Article 27 also requires that “all necessary steps must be taken to spare, as far as possible, buildings dedicated to religion, art, science, or charitable purposes, [and] historic monuments” and states that belligerents have a duty to clearly demarcate protected buildings or property.⁴⁵ However, the 1907 treaty proved ineffective at protecting cultural property during the Second World War, as Axis forces blatantly disregarded it.⁴⁶ The extensive looting of cultural treasures by the Nazi regime led to the creation of the 1954 Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict (“1954 Hague Convention”).⁴⁷ ## B. Hague Convention, Additional Protocols, and the Evolution of Cultural Property Protections The 1954 Hague Convention is a core treaty shielding cultural property in armed conflicts. It aims to prevent “damage to cultural property belonging to any people whatsoever…since each people makes its contribution to the culture of the world.”⁴⁸ The 1954 Convention, faced with “the developments in the technique of warfare” which exacerbated the dangers posed to cultural property, built on the 1907 framework by requiring states to secure cultural property during peacetime and prohibiting the destruction of cultural heritage witnessed in World War II.⁴⁹ The treaty defines cultural property as “movable or immovable property of great importance to the cultural heritage of every people.”⁵⁰ This includes, of Militarism in Postwar Japan, 33 JAPAN REV. 195. 195 (2019). However, the Nazi’s systematic campaign of looting and eradicating important cultural works was so extensive it resulted in charges at the Nuremberg Tribunal and led Allied forces to establish the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives Program (also referred to as the “Monuments Men”) to safeguard plundered cultural works. Sanja Zgonjanin, The Prosecution of War Crimes for the Destruction of Libraries and Archives During Times of Armed Conflict, 40 LIBR. &amp; CULTURE 128, 133–35 (2005); see generally ROBERT EDSEL &amp; BRETT WITTER, THE MONUMENTS MEN: ALLIED HEROES, NAZI THIEVES, AND THE GREATEST TREASURE HUNT IN HISTORY (2009).\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\nThe Convention clearly defines the scope of its protection, but there is no objective test for determining which monuments, buildings, or manuscripts IHL protects. The party in whose territory the property is situated determines its cultural importance, and thus whether it is legally protected—a determination which parties must make in good faith.53 Absent notice to opposing parties under Articles 3 and 6 of the Hague Convention—notice that is left up to the parties' discretion—belligerents must hazard an educated guess, weighed down with caution, as to any item's cultural importance.54 Belligerents must then\"respect cultural property\"by refraining from conduct that would expose it to destruction or damage and further have a duty to protect cultural property from vandalism, theft, or The other commonly used definition of cultural property in international law comes from the Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property of 1970, often referred to as the UNESCO Convention. That treaty defines cultural property with greater specificity and more expansively than the 1954 Convention, and, like the 1954 Convention, defers to parties' respective views of cultural importance. See Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property, art. 1, Nov. 14 1970, 823 U.N.T.S. 231, http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=130 39&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html [https://perma.cc/D53M-BHZK].\n\n[53.1 misappropriation.⁵⁵ Likewise, belligerents are forbidden from directing reprisals toward cultural property and from requisitioning it.⁵⁶ The adoption of Additional Protocols I and II to the 1949 Geneva Conventions in 1977 bolstered the 1954 Hague Convention and provided additional protections for cultural heritage.⁵⁷ In both international and non-international armed conflicts, these protocols prohibit “acts of hostility directed against the historic monuments, works of art or places of worship which constitute the cultural or spiritual heritage of peoples.”⁵⁸ The Additional Protocols to the Geneva Convention refer to objects which “constitute the cultural or spiritual heritage of peoples.” This is different than the Hague Convention’s protections for property which apply when an object is “of great importance to the cultural heritage.” However, the International Committee of the Red Cross (“ICRC”) has clarified that “the basic idea is the same.” The Additional Protocols cover “objects whose value transcends geographical boundaries, and which are unique in character and are intimately associated with the history and culture of a people.”⁵⁹ In addition to the aforementioned treaties, customary international law also protects cultural property. The International Committee of the Red Cross lists respect for cultural property during armed conflict as part of customary international law.⁶⁰ Belligerents are prohibited from using cultural property for military purposes except when required by military\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\nThe current regime for protecting cultural property in war has had mixed success. While the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) successfully led several prosecutions for the destruction of cultural property,63 recent terrorist attacks have destroyed similarly irreplaceable works of cultural property. In 2001, the Taliban destroyed the Bamiyan Buddhas, 1,500-year-old statues over 100 feet tall—which were then the largest in the world.64 The looting of the National Museum of Iraq in the wake of Operation Iraqi Freedom was another shameful chapter, and stolen artifacts continue to flood illicit antiquities markets fifteen years later.65 Pointing to these contemptible episodes, some scholars have criticized the 1954 Hague Convention as ineffective at preventing the loss of these cultural treasures, even as the 1954 Convention's Second Additional Protocol clearly extended its protections to non-state actors.66 The Hague Convention, Additional Protocol II, and the 1970 World Heritage Convention have concededly not protected every piece of cultural property, but surely they have saved some.67 Yet, because of these treaties, not only does the destruction of cultural property often yield widespread international COLUMBIA HUMAN RIGHTS LAW REVIEW [53.1 condemnation, but international tribunals have also imposed criminal liability for attacks on cultural property. \n## II. Protecting Cultural Property in Cyberspace ## A. Defining Digital and Digitized Cultural Property ## 1. Digitized Cultural Property As with almost everything else, advances in computing, digital storage, and connectivity have revolutionized the field of cultural heritage. Owing to these recent technological advancements, digitized cultural property—whereby tangible or intangible cultural heritage is transformed into information—has exploded in recent years as a method of preserving cultural heritage, offering novel educational opportunities and increasing public access. Digitized cultural property can take several forms, such as scanned texts, audio-visual recordings of music, and 3D renderings. Take, for instance, CyArk, a non-profit established in 2003 after the Taliban's destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas to\"digitally record, archive and share the world's most significant cultural heritage...\"CyArk uses high-tech laser scanning tools to create 3D models of cultural heritage, which it then draws on to create an\"immersive virtual reality environment.\"To date,\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\nThis digitization push includes not only tangible but also intangible cultural property.78 For example, motion capture technology has allowed the digitization of traditional Japanese dances, allowing master performers to study their craft in a new way while also allowing for the archiving of cultural practices and events.79 Additionally, novel digital technologies offer a promising pathway for communities to preserve their cultural heritage, whether it be the oral narratives and song traditions of indigenous communities in Canada⁸⁰ or the collective memory and cultural knowledge of Pacific Island communities.⁸¹ These projects are inevitably converted to digital files, placed on storage devices, and often made publicly available through the internet.⁸² ## 2. Digital Cultural Property as It Exists Today Digital cultural property, while stored in the same medium as digitized cultural property, is created in a digital format and almost always remains digital.⁸³ The 2003 UNESCO Charter on the Preservation of Digital Heritage defines digital heritage as “cultural, educational, scientific and administrative resources, as well as technical, legal, medical and other kinds of information created digitally, or converted into digital form from existing analog resources.”⁸⁴ The Charter, much like the 1954 Hague Convention, states, “the disappearance of heritage in whatever form constitutes an impoverishment of the heritage of all nations” and that “[digital cultural heritage] should be protected and preserved for current and future generations.”⁸⁵ Also similar to the 1954 Hague Convention, the Charter delegates the decision of what items should and should not be protected to states.⁸⁶ Digital cultural heritage is defined by its ephemerality and its shifting format.⁸⁷ Common examples of digital cultural property include gifs,\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\nFor a good example of digital cultural heritage, take YouTube, the world's second most-visited website with two billion unique monthly users.90 Every minute, YouTube gains an additional 500 hours of content and hosts content in over eighty languages.91 Every day, YouTube gains on average four billion daily views.92 Google, YouTube's parent company, is secretive about how its storage system works; one estimate is that in 2013, Google had approximately ten exabytes of data, although it is unclear how much of that is YouTube videos.93 Google stores every video uploaded to the website in one of its twenty-three global Google data centers.94 Thus, YouTube hosts a wide range of traditional cultural property, such as COLUMBIA HUMAN RIGHTS LAW REVIEW [53.1 traditional Mongolian throat singing,95 traditional American Indian dance,96 and the Turkish Mevlevi Sema ceremony, in addition to born-digital cultural property.97 The website is similarly home to videos of substantial cultural importance to the internet as a whole.98 By virtue of its sheer size and popularity, YouTube's kaleidoscopic inventory carries substantial cultural importance. The Internet Archive, an American non-profit known for cataloging the internet through its Wayback Machine, provides a similar example.99 As of this writing, the website contains 475 billion webpages, 28 million books and texts, 14 million audio recordings, 3.5 million images, and 6 million videos, totaling over forty-five petabytes of server storage.100 ## 3. Cyberspace Today It is worth reflecting on the architecture of cyberspace and how cultural property fits into it. Cyberspace is\"[a] global domain within the information environment consisting of interdependent networks of information technology infrastructures and resident data, including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers.\"101 It is\"the sharedness of the virtual environment\"which forms the backbone of global telecommunications and media.102 The information age has produced an extraordinary amount of\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\nProtections for real-world cultural property from cyber-attacks are fairly straightforward. The 1907 Hague Regulations and the 1954 Hague Convention apply regardless of a parties' method of warfare.¹⁰⁷ Thus, it would be just as unlawful to use a cyberattack to cause a gas leak at an enemy's historic museum, thereby causing a fire to damage art, artifacts, and the building itself, as it would be to attack the museum with a cruise missile. The core principles animating the protection of cultural property persist NEUROMANCER 51 (1982) (\"Cyberspace. A consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators, in every nation, by children being taught mathematical concepts...A graphic representation of data abstracted from the banks of every computer in the human system...

Current Protections in LOAC for Cultural Property are Insufficient As unsettled as IHL is in cyberspace, it is even more unsettled with regards to digital cultural property. Exacerbating this, states are expanding their cyber arsenals as state-launched cyber-attacks become more common.¹⁰⁹ Military units dedicated to computer network operations have risen from five units in 2000 to sixty-three in 2017, a number which is only expected to grow.¹¹⁰ Quantifying the number of cyber operations is almost as difficult as determining their legality in international law. Despite this, the Council on Foreign Relations estimates that state actors perpetrated approximately 480 cyberattacks from 2005 to 2019.¹¹¹ Cyberattacks can have disastrous consequences. Russia’s hack of SolarWinds and its government clients in March 2020—a hack so massive that its scope is still unknown¹¹²—is merely the latest demonstration of states’ ample cyber arsenals.¹¹³ Other examples are the WannaCry ransomware attack, which\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\n## 1. The Extensive Use of Cyberspace for Cultural Property\nThere are numerous reasons why a state or non-state actor might target cultural property in cyberspace. States or non-state actors might conduct such attacks in \"campaigns of ethnic cleansing, identity-bound wars and iconoclastic actions.\"¹¹⁸ State and non-state actors might make cultural property part of their war aim, attack cultural property to gain tactical benefits or as a form of costly signaling, or seize cultural property for economic reasons.¹¹⁹ In 2014, North Korea allegedly hacked the U.S. film studio Sony Pictures, destroyed large quantities of data and exposed the personal information of Sony employees and management, showing the vulnerability of cultural data in cyberspace.¹²⁰ The attack was supposedly\n\nmotivated by Sony Pictures' release of a film deeply critical of North Korea which depicted the death of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.¹²¹ This is not to say that Seth Rogan and James Franco’s 2014 film *The Interview* is of such cultural importance as to warrant protection under international law,¹²² or that the 2014 Sony hack amounted to an armed attack or use of force,¹²³ but pictures-hack-explained/ (on file with the *Columbia Human Rights Law Review*); see also Tim McCormack, *The Sony and OPM Double Whammy: International Law and Cyber Attacks*, 18 SMU Sci. &amp; Tech.

Schmitt, *The Law of Cyber Warfare*, supra note 10 (“Over time, the reaction of states to cyber operations, as well as how they characterize their own cyber operations, will inform the process of interpretive maturation.”) It is unclear whether data deletion of non-culturally significant data would amount to a use of force.

STUD. 222, 237 (2018); Kubo Mačák, *Military Objectives 2.0: The Case for Interpreting Computer* 2021] Hard Drive Heritage Traditional cultural heritage institutions have also become increasingly digitized. In the past twenty years, virtual museums have exploded, with the development of both online-only museums and digitally augmented physical museums.¹²⁴ The Vatican offers 3D virtual tours, as do the Natural History Museum and National Gallery in London, the Dutch Rijksmuseum, the French Musée d'Orsay, and the American Getty Museum.¹²⁵ The American Smithsonian Natural History Museum offers virtual tours online and the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art boasts an impressive online digital collection.¹²⁶ Online-only virtual museums—such as the WebMuseum, the Swedish Internetmuseum, and the National Digital Repository for Museums of India—offer unique access to digital materials and challenge pre-existing notions of cultural heritage institutions.¹²⁷ The advent of immersive virtual and augmented reality provides a new form of access to cultural property, but also creates “a means to produce new forms of art.”¹²⁸ For example, the Petersen Automotive Museum uses virtual reality Data as Objects Under International Humanitarian Law, 48 ISRAELI L. REV. 55, 56 (2015) (“This article argues in favour of a broad understanding of the notion of ‘object’, bringing data within the scope of the rules on military objectives as codified in Additional Protocol I to the 1949 Geneva Conventions.”).\n\nCOLUMBIA HUMAN RIGHTS LAW REVIEW [53.1 and augmented reality to allow visitors to virtually view historic cars,¹²⁹ the National Museum of Finland uses virtual reality to allow visitors to step inside a painting,¹³⁰ and visitors to the British Museum can digitally handle Bronze Age artifacts through virtual reality technology.¹³¹ Virtual museums further the preservation of and access to cultural property and heritage, challenging notions of authenticity and transforming museums from silos of objects to interactive purveyors of information.¹³² Despite these significant changes in the preservation and presentation of cultural property, IHL has failed to adapt.\nRecognizing the threat of cyberattacks, states are already taking steps to back up their critical data.

Interpreting International Law to Protect Cultural Property in Cyberspace\n## A. Digital and Digitized Cultural Property as Archives\nA new interpretation of international law is the most effective way to extend international law to cyberspace. Because belligerents are reluctant to acknowledge their actions in cyberspace—indeed, ostensible anonymity and difficulty attributing cyber operations to a state or non-state actor is part of the appeal of cyber operations—it is unlikely that customary international law will bring order to the cyber arena.¹³⁶ The ossification of customary international law requires open state practice driven by a sense of international obligation. This is unlikely to occur in cyberwarfare where states engage in highly classified cyber operations in relative anonymity.¹³⁷ Furthermore, without grievous cyberattacks affecting large numbers of states equally, international political will would likely be insufficient to produce a new treaty to regulate armed conflict in cyberspace, let alone clarify digital cultural property’s status in international humanitarian law. As a result, interpretations of existing legal instruments and principles will likely define the evolution of international law in cyberspace.¹³⁸ These interpretations may come through formal statements by states as to their legal position or their armed forces’ manuals on the laws of war.¹³⁹ Additionally, “[o]ver time, the reaction of states to cyber operations, as well as how they characterize their own cyber operations, will inform the process of interpretive maturation.”¹⁴⁰\n\nThis Note argues that digital and digitized cultural property are data of cultural importance 141 that fall under the 1954 Hague Convention's protections for culturally significant archives and records. An archive,\"a repository or collection especially of information,\"142 is a particularly apt description of digital information, which is normally stored either on a device's local hard drive or a server connected to the internet. While a 3D scan of a historic monument is not a historic monument itself, it is a reproduction of an important monument of architecture that is filed away alongside other 3D scans, like books on a shelf. Likewise, archived born-digital cultural property ought to be protected as\"moveable or immovable property of great importance to the cultural heritage of every people...\"143 The fact that digital cultural property exists to preserve cultural heritage, maintain cultural integrity, and provide access to societal memory only strengthens arguments for its protection, since a society implicitly preserves what it values. 144 This is not to say that every scrap of data ought to fall within the ambit of cultural property in IHL. However, data of sufficient cultural, scientific, or religious import, or which when aggregated take on sufficient importance, surely fall within the scope of the 1954 Hague Convention and customary international law. Born-digital cultural property is especially worthy of protection 145 since, unlike digitized cultural property, there is no physical backup if it is altered or destroyed.\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\nproperty, which holds immense societal value but happens to be digital rather than analog.\nOutside of international law, views of internet websites and digital repositories as archives are not new.¹⁵² One media studies scholar has termed YouTube “the world’s largest archive of moving images.”¹⁵³ Scholars have taken a broad view of an archive, defining it to include “inactive records of continuing value” or “a selection of digital records or digital surrogates of records made available as a curated online collection.”¹⁵⁴ While many websites, such as YouTube and Wikipedia, explicitly state that their mission is not preservation, these online platforms have become de facto democratic digital repositories of substantial cultural importance.¹⁵⁵ As a result, both the content hosted by these websites, as well as the websites themselves, ought to be protected by IHL, just as it already protects the documents contained within a physical archive.\nThis interpretation is consistent with articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.¹⁵⁶ According to the Vienna Convention, courts and parties should construe a treaty according to the text’s “ordinary meaning” taken “in the light of its object and purpose.”¹⁵⁷ The\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\nSubsequent practice by parties to the Hague Convention also supports protection for digital and digitized cultural property.¹⁶³ Several states have included digitized cultural data in their implementation reports filed consistent with the 1954 Hague Convention.¹⁶⁴ Belgium included its digitization of museum institutions,¹⁶⁵ Cyprus mentioned its use of GIS technologies to create an inventory of ancient monuments,¹⁶⁶ Greece with the Columbia Human Rights Law Review) (“[Treaties] are instruments for providing stability to their parties and to fulfil the purposes which they embody. They can therefore change over time, must adapt to new situations, evolve according to the social needs of the international community...”); Sergio Marchisio, Remarks at the 10th United Nations Workshop on Space Law, (Sept. 5–8, 2016).\n\nreferenced its “digitalization of the archive of monuments,”¹⁶⁷ and Australia noted its efforts at digitizing archives,¹⁶⁸ as did Turkey¹⁶⁹ and Estonia.¹⁷⁰ Azerbaijan considered its digitization of aged sound records to be a fulfillment of its peacetime treaty obligations under the 1954 Hague Convention,¹⁷¹ and Germany did the same with over two million archival documents from the Wossidlo ethnographic archive.¹⁷² Following suit, the Holy See has digitized over 400,000 pages of reproductions from its archives, “providing the minimum necessary redundancy to guarantee the conservation of high-quality copies in the event the originals are lost.”¹⁷³ Such efforts demonstrate that parties to the 1954 Hague Convention consider digital archives and records to be an essential means of cultural heritage preservation and lend credence to the treaty’s protection of digital and digitized cultural property.\n## B. Belligerents’ Obligations Towards Digital and Digitized Cultural Property Although digital cultural property should fall within the scope of the law of armed conflict, novel characteristics of the cyber domain alter what obligations belligerents have towards cultural property. In the current international legal regime, states have the following core obligations to cultural property: 1) states are prohibited from targeting cultural property or directing “acts of hostility [towards it]”;¹⁷⁴ 2) states are prohibited from using cultural property in a way that would imperil it; 3) states are prohibited from plundering or looting cultural property or from making reprisals against it; and 4) states are obliged to stop the theft, pillage, misappropriation, and vandalism of cultural property.¹⁷⁵ These obligations, rooted in the 1954 Hague Convention and customary international law, are core protections for cultural property and heritage.¹⁷⁶\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\nCOLUMBIA HUMAN RIGHTS LAW REVIEW [53.1 sinisterly, the BBC reported in 2019 on how the People's Republic of China was encouraging its citizens to edit Wikipedia entries on several sensitive topics, to\"reflect our voices and opinions in the entry, so as to objectively and truly reflect the influence of Chinese path and Chinese thoughts on other countries and history.\"185 Approximately 1,600 edits were made to Wikipedia pages for Hong Kong, Taiwan, the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, and nineteen other politically sensitive articles, although no coordinated cyber operation was uncovered.186 One way to determine when state activity in cyberspace impermissibly disrupts cultural property is a sliding scale analysis: how much of an effect does the military operation have on the digital cultural property? A group of soldiers stealing, defacing, or destroying one book or document from an archive likely has a de minimis effect on the entirety of the archive. Similarly, a proper analysis might be to what degree a cyber operation affects the entirety of a cultural data set. North Korea might decide to selectively edit the Wikipedia page of Kim Jong-un as part of an information operation, but that would be far less damaging than a broad cyber operation defacing or deleting large quantities of Wikipedia, or any other interactive cultural data set. It would be important to consider the ease of repair as well. For instance, digitized cultural data might be the sole remnant of lost cultural property, and thus critical for reconstruction, similar to how eighteen century art was essential to reconstructing Warsaw's Old Town after World War II.187 In the twenty-first century, cultural heritage experts are repairing the damage done by ISIS by using crowdsourced images of Mosul and historic sites in the Levant to 3D print lost artifacts and reproduce destroyed urban environments in virtual reality.188 Respect for these 3D prints and images during warfare is critical, as they are the last remnants of now-destroyed cultural property.\nStates' other obligations towards cultural property translate well into cyberspace. In peacetime, states must protect digital and digitized Microsoft allegedly offered to pay software engineers to edit certain Wikipedia pages so that they might be more favorable to Microsoft. Conflict of Interest Editing on Wikipedia, WIKIPEDIA (Nov. 9, 2021), https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-of-interest_editing_on_Wikipedia#Microsoft [https://perma.cc/MND8-PKXX].\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\nHowever, a DDOS attack might be considered an “act of hostility” within the meaning of the Additional Protocols to the Geneva Convention IV.¹⁹² Additional Protocol II does not protect archives or libraries, but instead protects “historic monuments, works of art, or places of worship which constitute the cultural or spiritual heritage of peoples.”¹⁹³ At the same time, the ICRC interprets the Additional Protocols to incorporate the 1954 Hague Convention’s definition of cultural heritage and property, which would extend protections for cultural property despite the Additional Protocols’ text not mentioning archives.¹⁹⁴ According to the ICRC, an “act of hostility” need not have a substantive effect on the cultural property itself, so long as it is “directed against” the cultural property.¹⁹⁵ Indeed, if a DDOS attack qualifies as an “act of hostility,” then Additional Protocols I and II and the 1954 Hague Convention would prohibit it.¹⁹⁶ Thus, it is conceivable that IHL would prohibit a DDOS attack on digital cultural property.¹⁹⁷ Another major issue in international legal obligations comes from how data challenges the territoriality of the 1954 Hague Convention.¹⁹⁸ While territorial location does not affect customary international legal obligation to refrain from damaging cultural property during armed conflict,¹⁹⁹ the Convention requires parties to “undertake to prepare in time of peace for the safeguarding of cultural property situated within their own territory against the foreseeable effects of an armed conflict...”²⁰⁰ Articles 12 and 13 of the Convention outline specific provisions for the safety of cultural property during transport.²⁰¹ However, data, unlike physical cultural property, rapidly crosses international boundaries along pre-determined paths and is often highly divisible.²⁰² A reasonable interpretation of states’ peacetime obligation might include replicating cultural data that resides in their territory for a substantial time or replicating cultural property of particular importance to the state’s own culture.\nThis shift in established notions of territoriality has additional implications. Traditionally, states would claim ownership over real-world cultural property within their borders. For example, the Taj Mahal is a UNESCO World Heritage Site²⁰³ that has special cultural importance to India, where it is located. Most nations seek to control their cultural property in the interest of its “retention, preservation, study, enjoyment, and exploitation.”²⁰⁴ This may be the case for digital cultural property as well,²⁰⁵ but others might be content with storing digital cultural property on a server in another country. International law’s focus on cultural internationalism simplifies this issue.²⁰⁶ Insofar as cultural property is the “cultural heritage of all mankind,”²⁰⁷ a state must protect digital cultural property within its territory regardless of its cultural origin. Museums across the world already do this; for example, the MET Digital Collection features scans of masks from\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\n## C. Protections for Replicas of Cultural Property in Cyberspace: Addressing Counter-Arguments\nA common question scholars pose is how digital technologies affect the authenticity of art.²¹¹ German philosopher Walter Benjamin argued that each work of art possesses a unique “aura” which mechanical reproduction erases, and thus, reproduction destroys the work’s authenticity.²¹² This is undeniably a motivation for protecting real-world cultural property and it is why reproductions often fail to stand in for stolen cultural property.²¹³ Humanity yearns for cultural objects because they are true and certain and possess some kind of uniqueness.²¹⁴ In addition to serving as surrogates,\n\n[53.1 digital objects are material in their own right, existing in space and time independently of that which they replicate.²¹⁵ For example, where once a photograph was seen as a simulacrum, “it has now attained a status of its own as a creative work as well as value as a historical document, along with its archival and interpretive roles. Photographs, according to Roland Barthes, radiate an aura, a distance, reference to a past and memory.”²¹⁶ However, authenticity is not the only reason why cultural property is considered worth preserving. Cultural property contains a society’s memories, brings substantial economic benefits through the antiquities trade or tourism, fosters a sense of community and identity, and by extension, has political value.²¹⁷ This is to say nothing of the value digitized reproductions have as a means of preservation and access, or how societies are capable of creating complex emotional relationships with replicas.²¹⁸ The strongest argument against interpreting LOAC to protect digital and digitized cultural property is that data is easily reproducible and disseminated, making its destruction exceedingly difficult and legal protections unnecessary. The Tallinn Manual 2.0, an influential academic publication outlining international law in cyberspace, incorporates this point; it argues that belligerents “must respect and protect cultural property that may be affected by cyber operations or that is located in cyberspace.”²¹⁹ However, the Manual continues, “[p]rotection only applies to digital copies or versions where the original is either inaccessible or has been destroyed,\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\nThe\"replication\"argument fails for several reasons. First, the fact that cultural property may be lodged on a hard drive somewhere else in the world does not mean that it is or will be. Even accepting the replication argument as valid fails to recognize the peacetime duty to preserve and protect cultural property, which is recognized under the Hague Convention.²²² Digital cultural property is easily duplicated and stored, but this does not eliminate the need for a legal duty to duplicate and store digital cultural property. There are numerous examples of digital cultural works being lost or nearly lost because of a failure to maintain proper backups.²²³ Even the existence of a backup is no guarantee if the data storage is centralized, as a conventional attack on a data center could destroy all existing copies of a culturally significant file.²²⁴ Such a conventional attack is not unlikely, as military and civilian internet infrastructure are largely interconnected.²²⁵ For example, Microsoft has contracted to store 80% of Department of Defense data and applications, making it difficult to distinguish between military and civilian targets.²²⁶ In addition to their peacetime duty to duplicate digital cultural property, belligerents during an armed conflict have to engage in a foreseeability analysis before conducting certain cyber operations to determine whether the digital cultural property they might jeopardize has in fact been duplicated, or even if it is endangered. Belligerents already use this test to determine the lawfulness of a target in the absence of notice of its cultural importance.²²⁷ Second, the texts of the Hague Convention and the Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions refute this argument. The Hague Convention explicitly protects “important collections of books or archives or of reproductions,” so copies of digital cultural property would likely warrant protection.²²⁸ During the Convention’s negotiations, the delegates from Switzerland and France insisted on the inclusion of protections for reproductions, “so that future generations would at least have the opportunity of seeing photographs of such works if the originals had been destroyed.”²²⁹ Additional Protocols I and II to the Geneva Convention outlaw “any acts of hostility directed against” cultural property.²³⁰ Applying this language, ICTY in Prosecutor v. Jokic, which concerned Yugoslav attacks on the Old Town of Dubrovnik, a UNESCO World Heritage site, concluded that Additional Protocols I and II prohibit attacks on cultural property “whether or not the attacks result in actual damage.”²³¹ Following this reasoning, LOAC\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\nThird, and most importantly, domestic copyright laws can impede the dissemination of cultural data, making it far more complicated than simply copying files.²³³ Copyright generally prohibits the reproduction of copyrighted work, whether for profit or not.²³⁴ For example, in the United States, archives and libraries are limited in their ability to reproduce copyrighted materials, and the number of copies they can make depends on the time remaining on the copyright, whether the material is unpublished, and whether the work is subject to “commercial exploitation.”²³⁵ This is further complicated by substantial differences in national intellectual property (“IP”) legal regimes, which may or may not inhibit the reproduction and preservation of cultural heritage, and to what extent copyright can cover cultural data.²³⁶ However, “[t]he traditional point of view of museums, no [https://perma.cc/G48W-79AW]. “For a violation of the article to take place it is therefore not necessary for there to be any damage.” Id.\n\nmatter where they are located, has been that IP, in particular copyright, has inhibited their ability to carry out their mission and mandate.”²³⁷ Domestic IP regimes undercut the assumption that cultural heritage institutions can replicate cultural data *ad infinitum* as a means of eliminating practical threats to digital and digitized cultural property. The intricacies of domestic IP laws cut against any presumption that digital cultural property, wherever located, will have backups, and thus counsels in favor of protecting digital cultural property in the event of an armed conflict.\n## 1. Copyright Law and the Problems It Presents for Digital Cultural Heritage Current cultural property law regimes impede the replication of digital cultural property. For instance, most digital cultural property is available in encrypted formats, which ties the digital goods to a specific account to prevent duplication; as a result, cultural heritage institutions are capable of licensing these digital goods, but they are unable to create archival copies until the expiration of the copyright.²³⁸ The Digital Millennium Copyright Act makes circumventing these technical measures against duplication a federal crime punishable by up to five years in prison.²³⁹ As a result, GLAMs must often wait ninety-five years after a work’s publication—or seventy years after the death of the author—to produce an archival copy,²⁴⁰ by which point the cultural property will likely have been lost to technological obsolescence, degraded hard drives, human error, or malicious attacks.²⁴¹ According to the Library of Congress, this has happened before. Because film studios lacked the resources, the foresight, or the commercial museums can make and the purposes for which museums can digitize culture property.

Edwards, *supra* note 238.\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage Copyright holders, as opposed to GLAMs, might produce backups of their work, but that is up to the copyright holder's discretion; a possessive copyright holder might actively hinder any reproductions. Take Star Wars, a film included in the Library of Congress's National Film Registry because of its historical and cultural significance.²⁴⁴ Since the theatrical release of A New Hope in 1977, George Lucas, and later Disney, made several alterations to the film, including introducing Computer Generated Imagery (\"CGI\"), adding entirely new scenes, altering the sound mixing and color palette, and including entirely new lines.²⁴⁵ George Lucas has publicly stated that he only wants his updated versions of the film to survive and Disney has continued that policy.²⁴⁶ As a result, the only digital versions of the original cut of A New Hope are fan-made and arguably constitute copyright infringement.²⁴⁷ In its current form, copyright places the preservation of cultural heritage at the whims of the copyright holder, making it difficult for belligerents in an armed conflict to presume that they can target digital cultural property haphazardly.\nA Library of Congress report on copyright laws from the United Kingdom, Australia, the Netherlands, and the United States concluded that “[a]lthough copyright and related laws are not the only obstacle to digital preservation activities, there is no question that those laws present significant challenges.”²⁴⁸ None of the jurisdictions surveyed have a uniform system for collecting digital materials, none of the exceptions to copyright laws for GLAMs were designed for digital preservation, and exceptions to copyright law for GLAMs are wildly inconsistent across jurisdictions.²⁴⁹ International copyright treaties are of little help in ensuring the preservation of cultural heritage. For example, the Berne Convention and the WIPO Copyright Treaty merely allow for states to permit reproduction “[p]rovided that such reproduction does not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work and does not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the author.”²⁵⁰ This labyrinth of copyright law makes it legally dubious to rely on random reproductions to protect digital and digitized cultural property.\nFinally, the rise in non-fungible tokens (“NFTs”) have made certain copies of digital art unique, and thus irreproducible, through blockchain technology.²⁵¹ NFTs thus make digital goods artificially scarce, causing a boom in digital art while also making some digital cultural property completely unique. In March 2021, Beeple, the online name of Charleston-based artist Mike Winkelmann, sold a digital painting called “Everydays–The\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\nFor the purposes of digital cultural property, NFTs ensure the authenticity of a piece of digital art. For example, the Mona Lisa is clearly protected cultural property under international law, but prints of da Vinci's masterpiece sold at the Louvre gift shop are not. NFTs offer an opportunity to authenticate certain works of digital cultural property and accord them protection under LOAC, while rendering non-NFT copies lawful targets. Because an NFT is an inherently unique entry on a blockchain ledger, it cannot be reproduced beyond the quantity specified by the NFT creator.²⁵⁸ As the primary means of ensuring authenticity in digital art, NFTs are likely the future of digital art, and thus ought to be protected under the laws of war.\n\nCOLUMBIA HUMAN RIGHTS LAW REVIEW [53.1 # D. How to Protect Digital Cultural Property in Practice The question remains of how to ensure the Hague Convention and its Additional Protocols, as well as the Geneva Convention and its Additional Protocols, carry weight. One idea might be technical solutions. Articles 16 and 17 of the 1954 Hague Convention establish a distinctive marking to identify physical cultural property and to provide notice to all parties of the property's protected status.²⁵⁹ This could easily be adapted into a number of technical solutions, including file naming conventions and coding schemes to tag cultural data.²⁶⁰ Militaries have already developed no-strike lists for culturally significant sites, which prevented the destruction of ancient monuments by Coalition Forces during the First Gulf War and the 2011 Libya Intervention.²⁶¹ Such no-strike lists might extend to certain servers, data centers, or IP addresses housing culturally significant data. Additionally, a published register of IP addresses, analogous to already-extant national or international registers of cultural property, would help provide notice and further remove cultural property from hostilities in cyberspace.²⁶² By segregating the civilian internet from the locus of military operations, states can better preserve digital cultural property in an armed conflict. At a minimum, states ought to ensure digital cultural data is preserved through at least some basic cybersecurity provisions as a means of fulfilling their peacetime obligations under Article 3 of the 1954 Hague Convention.²⁶³ International collaboration is also key to preserving digital cultural property. As part of their peacetime obligations under the 1954 Hague Convention, public cultural agencies and ministries could collaborate\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\nWhen responding to attacks on cultural property, states might also collaborate to overcome the difficulties of attribution in cyberspace. Because of technical advancements in recent years, successfully attributing major cyberattacks to individual perpetrators has gone from impossible to probable.²⁶⁸ By establishing an international evidentiary standard for cyberattack attribution, states can legitimately deter hostile states and ensure legal liability for law-breaking individuals.²⁶⁹ Additionally, states might share evidence with each other, or in collaboration with the private sector, as part of an international attribution mechanism.²⁷⁰ While such COLUMBIA HUMAN RIGHTS LAW REVIEW [53.1 proposals have largely focused on *jus ad bellum* concerns, attribution is equally critical to *jus in bello* issues, such as protecting cultural property.²⁷¹ The COVID-19 pandemic has made protections for digital cultural property all the more salient. In April 2020, 130 ministers of culture from around the world met virtually through Zoom to discuss the impact of the pandemic on the culture sector.²⁷² During the pandemic, “86% of countries... closed or partially closed their World Heritage Sites and 90% of museums... were closed.”²⁷³ Saudi Arabia, India, Colombia, Estonia, Greece, Albania, and Belize all emphasized the need to transition to digital cultural platforms and provide financial support for digital cultural production.²⁷⁴ “A large share of countries, including Kenya, Mexico and Lithuania, have made the digital transition one of the cornerstones of their cultural policy...”²⁷⁵ while other states, such as Serbia, Botswana, Cyprus, and Andorra questioned how this digital transformation would affect copyright protections.²⁷⁶ There was a general consensus among states that “[t]he digital transition must be the subject of global reflection and international regulation,”²⁷⁷ and that the digital cultural transition would certainly accelerate moving forward.²⁷⁸ ## CONCLUSION By framing digital and digitized cultural property as archives and records, existing international treaties can provide some degree of legal protection to this rapidly growing form of cultural heritage. This protection is particularly valuable, given the lack of an international effort to expand cultural heritage protections in the law of armed conflict. Because of the lack of a political will to create a new treaty for cultural property in cyberspace, states, international organizations, and scholars should further pursue novel interpretations to protect cultural heritage and adjust their policies\n\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n\nThe emergence of digital cultural property raises further interesting questions surrounding international human rights law and its intersection with cultural heritage and cyberspace. To the extent that participation in cultural life creates a human right to cultural heritage,[279] and insofar as internet access is a human right,[280] protections for digital cultural property might also emerge from international human rights law, in addition to international humanitarian law. The use of an international human rights framework could bolster protections for digital cultural heritage in peacetime to a greater degree than international humanitarian law. Raising interesting questions surrounding privacy, sovereignty, intellectual property, and the freedom of expression, the use of a human rights [53.1 framework to protect digital cultural heritage and property is a promising subject for future research."

He spent his life as the Chief of Antiquities at the historic site of Palmyra in Syria, his hometown, where he protected one of the world's best-preserved archaeological sites—until ISIS seized his home and took him hostage.¹ After a month of torture, the terrorist group publicly beheaded Khaled al-Asaad for refusing to reveal the location of hidden antiquities.² Khaled al-Assad's sacrifice demonstrates the importance of cultural property to humanity: it is not only a record of humanity, but a fundamental pillar supporting it. Cultural property is so indispensable and so invaluable to humankind that the law must shield it from the bombs and bloodshed of war, just as Khaled al-Assad did. Yet, one hundred years from now, the artifacts worth dying for will not only be physical but also digital, made of code rather than stone or steel.³ This Note aims to address the fundamental question of how humanity will protect this new form of cultural property during armed conflicts.\nThere is widespread consensus that the law of armed conflict (\"LOAC\") applies to state and non-state actors in cyberspace, but there is far less consensus as to exactly how it applies.⁴ The application of settled principles of LOAC to cyber operations is a difficult one, as the cyber domain lacks the physical characteristics which have always marked battlefields.⁵ This has resulted in a great deal of literature discussing how the principles of proportionality,⁶ distinction,⁷ attribution,⁸ and neutrality⁹ can exist in cyberspace. The current intricacies of global politics have also complicated matters, as norms and interpretations of international law in cyberspace are continuously evolving to match shifting political and technical realities.¹⁰ This interpretive uncertainty has raised the question of how protection for cultural property under LOAC, a longstanding goal of international law, can extend to cyberspace.\nCultural property is protected under both treaty-based and customary international law.

This paper then contends that digital and digitized cultural property should be categorized as archives and ¹⁵. The specialized terminology surrounding this topic deserves clarification. It is worth clarifying the terms\"cultural property\"and\"cultural heritage.\"The two terms are almost always used interchangeably in international treaties and scholarship. While cultural property is an older term, it has largely been superseded by cultural heritage, which is conceptually oriented around preservation for future generations rather than the rights and powers of the possessor. The term cultural heritage also encompasses practices that do not fall within any definition of tangible or intangible cultural heritage, making it a broader category than cultural property, although the terms are often synonymous. For example, the Great Wall of China is cultural property that forms part of China's cultural heritage. Yet the practice of Chinese calligraphy, an intangible cultural tradition, is not cultural property despite being part of China's cultural heritage. However, unlike cultural heritage, cultural property has a clear legal meaning, defined in the 1954 Hague Convention and 1970 UNESCO Convention.

Common examples of digitized cultural property include scanned books, audio recordings of music or culturally significant stories, and 3D renderings of monuments and artifacts.\nDigital cultural property is cultural property that has no original physical or real-world copy. Common examples of digital cultural property include digital artwork, blogs, vlogs, webcomics, e-books, certain audio recordings that are only digital downloads, some television shows and films, some journalism, and any other content that exists solely in digital form. The line between digital and digitized cultural property is not always clear. Take JSTOR, which is a digital repository for academic research similar to SSRN or PubMed.

International humanitarian law (\"IHL\") is\"broadly speaking, that branch of public international law that seeks to moderate the conduct of armed conflict and to mitigate the suffering that it causes.\"Amanda Alexander, A Short History of International Humanitarian Law, 26 EUR. J. INT'L L. 109, 111 (2015). IHL, which is synonymous with the law of armed conflict, encompasses treaties on the rules of war, ius in bello, as well as international norms that have ossified into binding customary international law. Id.\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage begins by exploring the history of protections for cultural property and heritage in times of war, with particular emphasis on the reasons for such protections. Part II discusses the development of digital and digitized cultural property and current threats to digital cultural heritage. Part III proposes a novel interpretation of digital and digitized cultural property as historically significant archives or documents and addresses what obligations belligerents ought to have towards cultural property in cyberspace.\n\n---\n\n## __postscript__\n\nA new interpretation of international law is the most effective way to extend international law to cyberspace. Because belligerents are reluctant to acknowledge their actions in cyberspace—indeed, ostensible anonymity and difficulty attributing cyber operations to a state or non-state actor is part of the appeal of cyber operations—it is unlikely that customary international law will bring order to the cyber arena.¹³⁶ The ossification of customary international law requires open state practice driven by a sense of international obligation. This is unlikely to occur in cyberwarfare where states engage in highly classified cyber operations in relative anonymity.¹³⁷ Furthermore, without grievous cyberattacks affecting large numbers of states equally, international political will would likely be insufficient to produce a new treaty to regulate armed conflict in cyberspace, let alone clarify digital cultural property’s status in international humanitarian law. As a result, interpretations of existing legal instruments and principles will likely define the evolution of international law in cyberspace.¹³⁸ These interpretations may come through formal statements by states as to their legal position or their armed forces’ manuals on the laws of war.¹³⁹ Additionally, “[o]ver time, the reaction of states to cyber operations, as well as how they characterize their own cyber operations, will inform the process of interpretive maturation.”¹⁴⁰\nThis Note argues that digital and digitized cultural property are data of cultural importance 141 that fall under the 1954 Hague Convention's protections for culturally significant archives and records. An archive,\"a repository or collection especially of information,\"142 is a particularly apt description of digital information, which is normally stored either on a device's local hard drive or a server connected to the internet. While a 3D scan of a historic monument is not a historic monument itself, it is a reproduction of an important monument of architecture that is filed away alongside other 3D scans, like books on a shelf. Likewise, archived born-digital cultural property ought to be protected as\"moveable or immovable property of great importance to the cultural heritage of every people...\"143 The fact that digital cultural property exists to preserve cultural heritage, maintain cultural integrity, and provide access to societal memory only strengthens arguments for its protection, since a society implicitly preserves what it values. 144 This is not to say that every scrap of data ought to fall within the ambit of cultural property in IHL. However, data of sufficient cultural, scientific, or religious import, or which when aggregated take on sufficient importance, surely fall within the scope of the 1954 Hague Convention and customary international law. Born-digital cultural property is especially worthy of protection 145 since, unlike digitized cultural property, there is no physical backup if it is altered or destroyed.\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\nproperty, which holds immense societal value but happens to be digital rather than analog.\nOutside of international law, views of internet websites and digital repositories as archives are not new.¹⁵² One media studies scholar has termed YouTube “the world’s largest archive of moving images.”¹⁵³ Scholars have taken a broad view of an archive, defining it to include “inactive records of continuing value” or “a selection of digital records or digital surrogates of records made available as a curated online collection.”¹⁵⁴ While many websites, such as YouTube and Wikipedia, explicitly state that their mission is not preservation, these online platforms have become de facto democratic digital repositories of substantial cultural importance.¹⁵⁵ As a result, both the content hosted by these websites, as well as the websites themselves, ought to be protected by IHL, just as it already protects the documents contained within a physical archive.\nThis interpretation is consistent with articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.¹⁵⁶ According to the Vienna Convention, courts and parties should construe a treaty according to the text’s “ordinary meaning” taken “in the light of its object and purpose.”¹⁵⁷ The\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\nSubsequent practice by parties to the Hague Convention also supports protection for digital and digitized cultural property.¹⁶³ Several states have included digitized cultural data in their implementation reports filed consistent with the 1954 Hague Convention.¹⁶⁴ Belgium included its digitization of museum institutions,¹⁶⁵ Cyprus mentioned its use of GIS technologies to create an inventory of ancient monuments,¹⁶⁶ Greece with the Columbia Human Rights Law Review) (“[Treaties] are instruments for providing stability to their parties and to fulfil the purposes which they embody. They can therefore change over time, must adapt to new situations, evolve according to the social needs of the international community...”); Sergio Marchisio, Remarks at the 10th United Nations Workshop on Space Law, (Sept. 5–8, 2016).\nreferenced its “digitalization of the archive of monuments,”¹⁶⁷ and Australia noted its efforts at digitizing archives,¹⁶⁸ as did Turkey¹⁶⁹ and Estonia.¹⁷⁰ Azerbaijan considered its digitization of aged sound records to be a fulfillment of its peacetime treaty obligations under the 1954 Hague Convention,¹⁷¹ and Germany did the same with over two million archival documents from the Wossidlo ethnographic archive.¹⁷² Following suit, the Holy See has digitized over 400,000 pages of reproductions from its archives, “providing the minimum necessary redundancy to guarantee the conservation of high-quality copies in the event the originals are lost.”¹⁷³ Such efforts demonstrate that parties to the 1954 Hague Convention consider digital archives and records to be an essential means of cultural heritage preservation and lend credence to the treaty’s protection of digital and digitized cultural property.\n## B. Belligerents’ Obligations Towards Digital and Digitized Cultural Property Although digital cultural property should fall within the scope of the law of armed conflict, novel characteristics of the cyber domain alter what obligations belligerents have towards cultural property. In the current international legal regime, states have the following core obligations to cultural property: 1) states are prohibited from targeting cultural property or directing “acts of hostility [towards it]”;¹⁷⁴ 2) states are prohibited from using cultural property in a way that would imperil it; 3) states are prohibited from plundering or looting cultural property or from making reprisals against it; and 4) states are obliged to stop the theft, pillage, misappropriation, and vandalism of cultural property.¹⁷⁵ These obligations, rooted in the 1954 Hague Convention and customary international law, are core protections for cultural property and heritage.¹⁷⁶\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\nCOLUMBIA HUMAN RIGHTS LAW REVIEW [53.1 sinisterly, the BBC reported in 2019 on how the People's Republic of China was encouraging its citizens to edit Wikipedia entries on several sensitive topics, to\"reflect our voices and opinions in the entry, so as to objectively and truly reflect the influence of Chinese path and Chinese thoughts on other countries and history.\"185 Approximately 1,600 edits were made to Wikipedia pages for Hong Kong, Taiwan, the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, and nineteen other politically sensitive articles, although no coordinated cyber operation was uncovered.186 One way to determine when state activity in cyberspace impermissibly disrupts cultural property is a sliding scale analysis: how much of an effect does the military operation have on the digital cultural property? A group of soldiers stealing, defacing, or destroying one book or document from an archive likely has a de minimis effect on the entirety of the archive. Similarly, a proper analysis might be to what degree a cyber operation affects the entirety of a cultural data set. North Korea might decide to selectively edit the Wikipedia page of Kim Jong-un as part of an information operation, but that would be far less damaging than a broad cyber operation defacing or deleting large quantities of Wikipedia, or any other interactive cultural data set. It would be important to consider the ease of repair as well. For instance, digitized cultural data might be the sole remnant of lost cultural property, and thus critical for reconstruction, similar to how eighteen century art was essential to reconstructing Warsaw's Old Town after World War II.187 In the twenty-first century, cultural heritage experts are repairing the damage done by ISIS by using crowdsourced images of Mosul and historic sites in the Levant to 3D print lost artifacts and reproduce destroyed urban environments in virtual reality.188 Respect for these 3D prints and images during warfare is critical, as they are the last remnants of now-destroyed cultural property.\nStates' other obligations towards cultural property translate well into cyberspace. In peacetime, states must protect digital and digitized Microsoft allegedly offered to pay software engineers to edit certain Wikipedia pages so that they might be more favorable to Microsoft. Conflict of Interest Editing on Wikipedia, WIKIPEDIA (Nov. 9, 2021), https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-of-interest_editing_on_Wikipedia#Microsoft [https://perma.cc/MND8-PKXX].\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\nHowever, a DDOS attack might be considered an “act of hostility” within the meaning of the Additional Protocols to the Geneva Convention IV.¹⁹² Additional Protocol II does not protect archives or libraries, but instead protects “historic monuments, works of art, or places of worship which constitute the cultural or spiritual heritage of peoples.”¹⁹³ At the same time, the ICRC interprets the Additional Protocols to incorporate the 1954 Hague Convention’s definition of cultural heritage and property, which would extend protections for cultural property despite the Additional Protocols’ text not mentioning archives.¹⁹⁴ According to the ICRC, an “act of hostility” need not have a substantive effect on the cultural property itself, so long as it is “directed against” the cultural property.¹⁹⁵ Indeed, if a DDOS attack qualifies as an “act of hostility,” then Additional Protocols I and II and the 1954 Hague Convention would prohibit it.¹⁹⁶ Thus, it is conceivable that IHL would prohibit a DDOS attack on digital cultural property.¹⁹⁷ Another major issue in international legal obligations comes from how data challenges the territoriality of the 1954 Hague Convention.¹⁹⁸ While territorial location does not affect customary international legal obligation to refrain from damaging cultural property during armed conflict,¹⁹⁹ the Convention requires parties to “undertake to prepare in time of peace for the safeguarding of cultural property situated within their own territory against the foreseeable effects of an armed conflict...”²⁰⁰ Articles 12 and 13 of the Convention outline specific provisions for the safety of cultural property during transport.²⁰¹ However, data, unlike physical cultural property, rapidly crosses international boundaries along pre-determined paths and is often highly divisible.²⁰² A reasonable interpretation of states’ peacetime obligation might include replicating cultural data that resides in their territory for a substantial time or replicating cultural property of particular importance to the state’s own culture.\nThis shift in established notions of territoriality has additional implications. Traditionally, states would claim ownership over real-world cultural property within their borders. For example, the Taj Mahal is a UNESCO World Heritage Site²⁰³ that has special cultural importance to India, where it is located. Most nations seek to control their cultural property in the interest of its “retention, preservation, study, enjoyment, and exploitation.”²⁰⁴ This may be the case for digital cultural property as well,²⁰⁵ but others might be content with storing digital cultural property on a server in another country. International law’s focus on cultural internationalism simplifies this issue.²⁰⁶ Insofar as cultural property is the “cultural heritage of all mankind,”²⁰⁷ a state must protect digital cultural property within its territory regardless of its cultural origin. Museums across the world already do this; for example, the MET Digital Collection features scans of masks from\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\n## C. Protections for Replicas of Cultural Property in Cyberspace: Addressing Counter-Arguments\nA common question scholars pose is how digital technologies affect the authenticity of art.²¹¹ German philosopher Walter Benjamin argued that each work of art possesses a unique “aura” which mechanical reproduction erases, and thus, reproduction destroys the work’s authenticity.²¹² This is undeniably a motivation for protecting real-world cultural property and it is why reproductions often fail to stand in for stolen cultural property.²¹³ Humanity yearns for cultural objects because they are true and certain and possess some kind of uniqueness.²¹⁴ In addition to serving as surrogates,\n[53.1 digital objects are material in their own right, existing in space and time independently of that which they replicate.²¹⁵ For example, where once a photograph was seen as a simulacrum, “it has now attained a status of its own as a creative work as well as value as a historical document, along with its archival and interpretive roles. Photographs, according to Roland Barthes, radiate an aura, a distance, reference to a past and memory.”²¹⁶ However, authenticity is not the only reason why cultural property is considered worth preserving. Cultural property contains a society’s memories, brings substantial economic benefits through the antiquities trade or tourism, fosters a sense of community and identity, and by extension, has political value.²¹⁷ This is to say nothing of the value digitized reproductions have as a means of preservation and access, or how societies are capable of creating complex emotional relationships with replicas.²¹⁸ The strongest argument against interpreting LOAC to protect digital and digitized cultural property is that data is easily reproducible and disseminated, making its destruction exceedingly difficult and legal protections unnecessary. The Tallinn Manual 2.0, an influential academic publication outlining international law in cyberspace, incorporates this point; it argues that belligerents “must respect and protect cultural property that may be affected by cyber operations or that is located in cyberspace.”²¹⁹ However, the Manual continues, “[p]rotection only applies to digital copies or versions where the original is either inaccessible or has been destroyed,\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\nThe\"replication\"argument fails for several reasons. First, the fact that cultural property may be lodged on a hard drive somewhere else in the world does not mean that it is or will be. Even accepting the replication argument as valid fails to recognize the peacetime duty to preserve and protect cultural property, which is recognized under the Hague Convention.²²² Digital cultural property is easily duplicated and stored, but this does not eliminate the need for a legal duty to duplicate and store digital cultural property. There are numerous examples of digital cultural works being lost or nearly lost because of a failure to maintain proper backups.²²³ Even the existence of a backup is no guarantee if the data storage is centralized, as a conventional attack on a data center could destroy all existing copies of a culturally significant file.²²⁴ Such a conventional attack is not unlikely, as military and civilian internet infrastructure are largely interconnected.²²⁵ For example, Microsoft has contracted to store 80% of Department of Defense data and applications, making it difficult to distinguish between military and civilian targets.²²⁶ In addition to their peacetime duty to duplicate digital cultural property, belligerents during an armed conflict have to engage in a foreseeability analysis before conducting certain cyber operations to determine whether the digital cultural property they might jeopardize has in fact been duplicated, or even if it is endangered. Belligerents already use this test to determine the lawfulness of a target in the absence of notice of its cultural importance.²²⁷ Second, the texts of the Hague Convention and the Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions refute this argument. The Hague Convention explicitly protects “important collections of books or archives or of reproductions,” so copies of digital cultural property would likely warrant protection.²²⁸ During the Convention’s negotiations, the delegates from Switzerland and France insisted on the inclusion of protections for reproductions, “so that future generations would at least have the opportunity of seeing photographs of such works if the originals had been destroyed.”²²⁹ Additional Protocols I and II to the Geneva Convention outlaw “any acts of hostility directed against” cultural property.²³⁰ Applying this language, ICTY in Prosecutor v. Jokic, which concerned Yugoslav attacks on the Old Town of Dubrovnik, a UNESCO World Heritage site, concluded that Additional Protocols I and II prohibit attacks on cultural property “whether or not the attacks result in actual damage.”²³¹ Following this reasoning, LOAC\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\nThird, and most importantly, domestic copyright laws can impede the dissemination of cultural data, making it far more complicated than simply copying files.²³³ Copyright generally prohibits the reproduction of copyrighted work, whether for profit or not.²³⁴ For example, in the United States, archives and libraries are limited in their ability to reproduce copyrighted materials, and the number of copies they can make depends on the time remaining on the copyright, whether the material is unpublished, and whether the work is subject to “commercial exploitation.”²³⁵ This is further complicated by substantial differences in national intellectual property (“IP”) legal regimes, which may or may not inhibit the reproduction and preservation of cultural heritage, and to what extent copyright can cover cultural data.²³⁶ However, “[t]he traditional point of view of museums, no [https://perma.cc/G48W-79AW]. “For a violation of the article to take place it is therefore not necessary for there to be any damage.” Id.\nmatter where they are located, has been that IP, in particular copyright, has inhibited their ability to carry out their mission and mandate.”²³⁷ Domestic IP regimes undercut the assumption that cultural heritage institutions can replicate cultural data *ad infinitum* as a means of eliminating practical threats to digital and digitized cultural property. The intricacies of domestic IP laws cut against any presumption that digital cultural property, wherever located, will have backups, and thus counsels in favor of protecting digital cultural property in the event of an armed conflict.\n## 1. Copyright Law and the Problems It Presents for Digital Cultural Heritage Current cultural property law regimes impede the replication of digital cultural property. For instance, most digital cultural property is available in encrypted formats, which ties the digital goods to a specific account to prevent duplication; as a result, cultural heritage institutions are capable of licensing these digital goods, but they are unable to create archival copies until the expiration of the copyright.²³⁸ The Digital Millennium Copyright Act makes circumventing these technical measures against duplication a federal crime punishable by up to five years in prison.²³⁹ As a result, GLAMs must often wait ninety-five years after a work’s publication—or seventy years after the death of the author—to produce an archival copy,²⁴⁰ by which point the cultural property will likely have been lost to technological obsolescence, degraded hard drives, human error, or malicious attacks.²⁴¹ According to the Library of Congress, this has happened before. Because film studios lacked the resources, the foresight, or the commercial museums can make and the purposes for which museums can digitize culture property.

Edwards, *supra* note 238.\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage Copyright holders, as opposed to GLAMs, might produce backups of their work, but that is up to the copyright holder's discretion; a possessive copyright holder might actively hinder any reproductions. Take Star Wars, a film included in the Library of Congress's National Film Registry because of its historical and cultural significance.²⁴⁴ Since the theatrical release of A New Hope in 1977, George Lucas, and later Disney, made several alterations to the film, including introducing Computer Generated Imagery (\"CGI\"), adding entirely new scenes, altering the sound mixing and color palette, and including entirely new lines.²⁴⁵ George Lucas has publicly stated that he only wants his updated versions of the film to survive and Disney has continued that policy.²⁴⁶ As a result, the only digital versions of the original cut of A New Hope are fan-made and arguably constitute copyright infringement.²⁴⁷ In its current form, copyright places the preservation of cultural heritage at the whims of the copyright holder, making it difficult for belligerents in an armed conflict to presume that they can target digital cultural property haphazardly.\nA Library of Congress report on copyright laws from the United Kingdom, Australia, the Netherlands, and the United States concluded that “[a]lthough copyright and related laws are not the only obstacle to digital preservation activities, there is no question that those laws present significant challenges.”²⁴⁸ None of the jurisdictions surveyed have a uniform system for collecting digital materials, none of the exceptions to copyright laws for GLAMs were designed for digital preservation, and exceptions to copyright law for GLAMs are wildly inconsistent across jurisdictions.²⁴⁹ International copyright treaties are of little help in ensuring the preservation of cultural heritage. For example, the Berne Convention and the WIPO Copyright Treaty merely allow for states to permit reproduction “[p]rovided that such reproduction does not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work and does not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the author.”²⁵⁰ This labyrinth of copyright law makes it legally dubious to rely on random reproductions to protect digital and digitized cultural property.\nFinally, the rise in non-fungible tokens (“NFTs”) have made certain copies of digital art unique, and thus irreproducible, through blockchain technology.²⁵¹ NFTs thus make digital goods artificially scarce, causing a boom in digital art while also making some digital cultural property completely unique. In March 2021, Beeple, the online name of Charleston-based artist Mike Winkelmann, sold a digital painting called “Everydays–The\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\nFor the purposes of digital cultural property, NFTs ensure the authenticity of a piece of digital art. For example, the Mona Lisa is clearly protected cultural property under international law, but prints of da Vinci's masterpiece sold at the Louvre gift shop are not. NFTs offer an opportunity to authenticate certain works of digital cultural property and accord them protection under LOAC, while rendering non-NFT copies lawful targets. Because an NFT is an inherently unique entry on a blockchain ledger, it cannot be reproduced beyond the quantity specified by the NFT creator.²⁵⁸ As the primary means of ensuring authenticity in digital art, NFTs are likely the future of digital art, and thus ought to be protected under the laws of war.\nCOLUMBIA HUMAN RIGHTS LAW REVIEW [53.1 # D. How to Protect Digital Cultural Property in Practice The question remains of how to ensure the Hague Convention and its Additional Protocols, as well as the Geneva Convention and its Additional Protocols, carry weight. One idea might be technical solutions. Articles 16 and 17 of the 1954 Hague Convention establish a distinctive marking to identify physical cultural property and to provide notice to all parties of the property's protected status.²⁵⁹ This could easily be adapted into a number of technical solutions, including file naming conventions and coding schemes to tag cultural data.²⁶⁰ Militaries have already developed no-strike lists for culturally significant sites, which prevented the destruction of ancient monuments by Coalition Forces during the First Gulf War and the 2011 Libya Intervention.²⁶¹ Such no-strike lists might extend to certain servers, data centers, or IP addresses housing culturally significant data. Additionally, a published register of IP addresses, analogous to already-extant national or international registers of cultural property, would help provide notice and further remove cultural property from hostilities in cyberspace.²⁶² By segregating the civilian internet from the locus of military operations, states can better preserve digital cultural property in an armed conflict. At a minimum, states ought to ensure digital cultural data is preserved through at least some basic cybersecurity provisions as a means of fulfilling their peacetime obligations under Article 3 of the 1954 Hague Convention.²⁶³ International collaboration is also key to preserving digital cultural property. As part of their peacetime obligations under the 1954 Hague Convention, public cultural agencies and ministries could collaborate\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\nWhen responding to attacks on cultural property, states might also collaborate to overcome the difficulties of attribution in cyberspace. Because of technical advancements in recent years, successfully attributing major cyberattacks to individual perpetrators has gone from impossible to probable.²⁶⁸ By establishing an international evidentiary standard for cyberattack attribution, states can legitimately deter hostile states and ensure legal liability for law-breaking individuals.²⁶⁹ Additionally, states might share evidence with each other, or in collaboration with the private sector, as part of an international attribution mechanism.²⁷⁰ While such COLUMBIA HUMAN RIGHTS LAW REVIEW [53.1 proposals have largely focused on *jus ad bellum* concerns, attribution is equally critical to *jus in bello* issues, such as protecting cultural property.²⁷¹ The COVID-19 pandemic has made protections for digital cultural property all the more salient. In April 2020, 130 ministers of culture from around the world met virtually through Zoom to discuss the impact of the pandemic on the culture sector.²⁷² During the pandemic, “86% of countries... closed or partially closed their World Heritage Sites and 90% of museums... were closed.”²⁷³ Saudi Arabia, India, Colombia, Estonia, Greece, Albania, and Belize all emphasized the need to transition to digital cultural platforms and provide financial support for digital cultural production.²⁷⁴ “A large share of countries, including Kenya, Mexico and Lithuania, have made the digital transition one of the cornerstones of their cultural policy...”²⁷⁵ while other states, such as Serbia, Botswana, Cyprus, and Andorra questioned how this digital transformation would affect copyright protections.²⁷⁶ There was a general consensus among states that “[t]he digital transition must be the subject of global reflection and international regulation,”²⁷⁷ and that the digital cultural transition would certainly accelerate moving forward.²⁷⁸ ## CONCLUSION By framing digital and digitized cultural property as archives and records, existing international treaties can provide some degree of legal protection to this rapidly growing form of cultural heritage. This protection is particularly valuable, given the lack of an international effort to expand cultural heritage protections in the law of armed conflict. Because of the lack of a political will to create a new treaty for cultural property in cyberspace, states, international organizations, and scholars should further pursue novel interpretations to protect cultural heritage and adjust their policies\n2021] Hard Drive Heritage\nThe emergence of digital cultural property raises further interesting questions surrounding international human rights law and its intersection with cultural heritage and cyberspace. To the extent that participation in cultural life creates a human right to cultural heritage,[279] and insofar as internet access is a human right,[280] protections for digital cultural property might also emerge from international human rights law, in addition to international humanitarian law. The use of an international human rights framework could bolster protections for digital cultural heritage in peacetime to a greater degree than international humanitarian law. Raising interesting questions surrounding privacy, sovereignty, intellectual property, and the freedom of expression, the use of a human rights [53.1 framework to protect digital cultural heritage and property is a promising subject for future research.",

    "abstract": "This Note considers the question of how to protect cultural property in an era of rising cyberwarfare. The Note argues that the law of armed conflict (LOAC)—also referred to as international humanitarian law (IHL)—should apply to protect the three categories of cultural property which cyberwarfare could affect: real-word cultural property, digitized cultural property (cultural property which has been converted into digital form), and digital cultural property (cultural property which has always existed in digital form). Lastly, this Note argues for a novel interpretation of the 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection for Cultural Property that would encompass digital and digitized cultural property.
