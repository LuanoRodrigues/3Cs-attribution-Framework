This culture combines a strong national pride and historical consciousness with values centered on resisting external influences. Ultimately, strategic culture has influenced the country’s cyber capabilities, which have significantly evolved since 2003, largely due to state investment and the establishment of the Supreme Council of Cyberspace in 2012. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and the Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS) lead offensive cyber operations, making Iran’s cyber posture more aligned with larger state powers than typical small states. Leaked documents from the Iranian opposition disclosed that Iran has actively developed a comprehensive cyber defense framework over the past decade to protect its critical infrastructure, quell opposition, and control presumed harmful content to maintain regime stability. Despite these efforts, leaks from dissident groups have exposed persistent weaknesses in Iran’s cyber defense, highlighting challenges in infrastructure, threat monitoring, and organizational discipline. Moreover, these leaks reveal Iran’s strategic focus on self-reliance and resistance to foreign influence.\nDr. Grigorij Serscikov is an Independent Researcher and Consultant with over fifteen years of experience in offering strategic advice and analysis to companies within the energy and financial sectors. He earned his master’s degree in Crisis and Security Management from Leiden University and a Ph.D. from the University of Dundee. Several of his articles were published in this journal.

However, the credibility of the leaked documents—that is, the context in which the documents were produced and the intentions of the authors who wrote them4—although it invites certain skepticism, does not currently challenge its validity. Similarly, the representativeness of the papers is established through the sheer volume of the leaked materials on the various topics of Iranian internal and external policies. Therefore, while the authenticity of the documents may be subject to debate, their credibility and representativeness are well established, providing a solid foundation for the research.\nAmong the wealth of primary sources made available to the public, there were several related to Iran's cyber defense strategies, providing researchers with insights into the country's cybersecurity programs. One key document is titled, “The Program Proposed by the Minister of Intelligence Hojjat al-Islam wal-Muslimeen Seyyed Ismail Khatib for the 13th government Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, 23 July 2021”5—the newly appointed head of the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence (MOIS).6 In it, Khatib outlined his vision for the evolution of the MOIS over the next four years, addressing inter alia issues related to Iranian cybersecurity. Other documents that will be examined in this study are: “The Ninety-Fourth Session of the Supreme Council of the Country's Cyber Space of 16 August 2023,”7 “The Ninety-Second Meeting of the Supreme Council of Cyberspace of June 27, 2023,”8 “Parts One and Two of the Strategic Document of the Islamic Republic of Iran on Cyber Space of July 14, 2021,”9 “Requirements and Measures Related to the Use of Satellite Systems in Cyberspace of 30 August 2022,”10 “Opinion Regarding the Promotion of the Cyber Space of 9 April 2023,”11 and “The Letter of the Advisor to the Speaker of the Parliament in the Field of Communication and Information Technology, Security and Cyber Defense of 16 January 2024.”12\nFurthermore, Persian-language academic journals published in Iran, such as The Quarterly Journal of Multidisciplinary Studies for Strategic Knowledge,\nStrategic Studies Quarterly, and The Quarterly of Political Strategic Studies have been tackling the themes related to cybersecurity for almost a decade. Rarely quoted in the West, these publications, whose authors are often affiliated with the country's intelligence and military community, provide an outside-in perspective on the topic and, as will be shown, significantly complement primary sources.\nIranian cyber defense will be examined within the framework of a case study approach—a reliable and often-used methodology to explore the case's “why” and/or “how” questions in situations of complex causality where the researcher has limited control.13 This approach will be further strengthened through a detailed and systematic analysis of the leaked documents, which will play a central role in the research. By integrating the insights derived from the documents, the case study method enables the researcher to achieve high levels of “conceptual validity”—the identification of the most representative features within the specific context of Iranian cyber defense.14\nThe concept of strategic culture will be applied as a theoretical avenue for the analysis. First appearing in the late 1970s,15 the idea has experienced several waves of scholarly attention since then.16 Johnson and Larsen define strategic culture as “[a] set of shared beliefs, assumptions, and modes of behavior, derived from common experiences and accepted narratives (both oral and written), that shape collective identity and relationships to other groups, and which determine appropriate ends and means for achieving security objectives.”17 A country's strategic culture is not randomly chosen or influenced by intellectual trends. It is shaped by the character and context of its society and becomes, in the views of Jeremy Black, a “cultural assumption” that fits the nation's strategic needs and influences its strategic behavior.18 Strategic culture, which is rooted in historical experiences, can evolve but cannot be easily discarded. It is a crucial factor in a country's strategic effectiveness, but it is not infinitely adaptable. Radical changes in culture only occur as a result of significant political, social, or military shocks. Strategic cultures borrow and adapt from one another, but this process has its limits.\nThe concept of strategic culture is highly suitable for the analysis of cybersecurity and cyberwarfare. For instance, the study prepared for the U.S. Cyber Command applied the notion of strategic culture as a theoretical foundation to build four case studies, one of them Iran.19 The author believes that the concept offers an additional advantage for this research, as it allows for deriving further insights and drawing implications from the primary and secondary sources as well as tracing the development of Iran's strategies to cybersecurity in general and cyber defense in particular during a specific period.20\nROLE OF STRATEGIC CULTURE IN IRAN'S CYBER DEFENSE POLICY\n# IRANIAN STRATEGIC CULTURE\nStrategic culture faces the challenge of not having a clear collection of principles or a well-established theoretical framework. The common ground for strategic culture generally involves acknowledging culture as an epiphenomenal factor in the examination of foreign policy and security choices.[21] However, this can be complicated by the fact that strategic culture is not a one-size-fits-all concept. Every actor possesses its own operational code, history, assumptions, and strategic culture. To develop a more streamlined research model, it is necessary to narrow national culture variables to those that consistently impact the actor's policy and hold significant value for that specific culture. For this study, a four-variable model suggested by Jeannie Johnson will be adopted, offering valuable insights for the analysis of Iranian strategic culture. The four variables are:\n1. Identity: This refers to a nation's self-perception regarding its character, role in regional and global interactions, and beliefs about its ultimate destiny.\n2. Values: These are the material and nonmaterial goods a society holds in high regard, prioritizing them over other aspects.\n3. Norms: These are the accepted and anticipated modes of behavior within a society, encompassing the concepts of right versus wrong and good versus evil. Some norms stem from deeply ingrained beliefs held by most members of society, while others are the result of political socialization.\n4. Perceptive lens: A set of beliefs and experiences, whether true or misinformed, shapes a nation's perspective of the world. Factors such as historical interpretations, self-image, the views of others, leadership capabilities, national resources, and other security-related concepts all play a crucial role in shaping what each regime considers to be rational foreign policy.[22]\n# Identity\nIranian identity is a complex and multifaceted concept influenced by various factors, such as political values, historical experiences, religion, and geographical location. The Islamic Republic of Iran (IRI) has an identity that is defined by the elements of \"nationality\" and \"religion,\" with the weight and importance of these elements fluctuating over time.[23] The distinctive Persian identity has thrived despite many invasions, with the Iranians adopting some of the invaders' ways but adapting them to be more Persian than not.[24] This sense of identity and pride stems from the cultural continuity that has been maintained over time. At the same time, they also manifest themselves in a sense of superiority and exceptionalism over neighboring countries and peoples.[25] Iran's geography has played a crucial role in its history as a land that has been home to various nomads, invaders, and settlers from surrounding areas. Settled within confines between the Caspian Sea in the north and the Persian Gulf in the south, and enclosed by the\nAND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE VOLUME 38, NUMBER 2\nmountains of Zagros and Alborz, these groups were able to live in relative isolation for extended periods, leading to the emergence of numerous ethnic, religious, tribal, and other groupings that often found reasons to be in conflict with one another.26 According to Pollack, “Because of the discrete separation of so much of the population, Iran became a patchwork of ethnic, religious, tribal, and other groupings, all of whom seemed to find constant reasons for conflict with their neighbors.”27\nThe Islamic Revolution enhanced Iran's sense of exceptionalism and created a potent mixture of religious ideology and deep-seated nationalism.28 Willis Stanley underscores that:“[t]he current Iranian leadership appears to have recognizable goals derived from its unique political ideology, which makes use of Shia Islam's gradual consolidation of a clerical caste and historical Iran's concerns about sovereignty and acceptance of an absolute ruler. In this ideology, Iran and Shia Islam are viewed as the same, indivisible.29”\nThe pride in Iran's pre-Islamic history shared by the majority of Iranians is reframed within an Islamist context and integrated into the overarching narrative. The IRI's perception of its own unique centrality is informed by its awareness of the country's role as one of the region's historical powers, today challenged by the alluring influence of the West as an alternative to the righteous path of the Iranian model.\n### Values\nAnthony Cain quotes Vakili-Zad who notes that the ideology of the Islamic Revolution was shaped by:“those who carried the heavy burden of often bloody confrontations with government troops, [and] were, in general, religiously oriented and linked to traditional values from the rural past ... . [T]he blueprint for future society was the Islamic Republic modeled on the one created by the Prophet Muhammad more than 1,400 years earlier.30”\nSeven years before the revolution, Ali Shariati, a leading Iranian sociologist and revolutionary, in his first public lecture on Islamology, insisted that a reassembly of past cultural values would underpin an overturning of the existing order.31 Such a remodeling of values, with an ultimate goal of creating a just society, cannot be achieved without a perennial struggle against the forces of evil. Ayatollah Khomeini believed that the world is perpetually embroiled in a struggle between good and evil, where the forces of virtue must resist domination and fight against oppression and injustice.32 Most importantly, the threats posed by rival cultures that have different sets of\nvalues from which Iranian society must be cleansed. If these values were to reemerge, it would signify the failure of the revolution's primary objective.33 As a result, the IRI's efforts to maintain the ethos of resistance and jihad against presumed or real adversaries are rooted in the moral and spiritual values of the Islamic Revolution. They are essential mechanisms created to insulate Iranian society against subversive foreign cultural influences and project Iran's power to confront its adversaries abroad. In this context, the concept of moqavamat (resistance) plays an important role. Initially originated as a slogan in the Palestinian national movement in the 1960s, it evolved into a quasi-religious doctrine of armed struggle by Palestinian Hamas and Lebanese Hizballah in the 1980s. It was later adopted by Iran. Although the doctrine of resistance has foreign origins, it resonates deeply with those who embrace the Shi'ite martyrdom narrative of Imam Hussein, who chose resistance and martyrdom at Karbala over surrender to the unjust seventh-century Caliph Yazid.34 Iranian scholars Hossein Salimi and Amin Hejazi, while explicitly highlighting the defensive nature of Iranian jihad, mention resistance against oppression and defense of the oppressed, negation of Western dominance, independence, and self-sufficiency as core values of the IRI.35\nTo sum up, the values that emerged after the Islamic Revolution in Iran, shaped by its religiously oriented and traditionally minded founders, are deeply rooted in a Manichean and one-dimensional worldview that pits good against evil, with the West representing the forces of evil threatening Iranian society. These values serve to protect Iran from foreign cultural influences and uphold principles of resistance.\n### Norms\nPierre Pahlavi and Eric Ouellet observe that Iran has often seen itself as isolated and threatened by neighboring countries due to its unique status as the only Persian-speaking, Shia nation in a predominantly Turkish--Arabic, Sunni region. This perception is exacerbated by the country's size, which makes it significant on the global stage but vulnerable to external threats. To cope with these challenges, Iran has historically pursued two strategic goals: protecting “fortress Iran” by maintaining economic autonomy and territorial integrity and expanding its regional influence as a buffer. While these objectives may seem contradictory, they are complementary and can be achieved through both offensive and detente strategies, transcending internal ideological differences.36 Such an ambiguous environment requires a specific set of norms and a distinct strategic culture that would govern the country's modus operandi.\nIndeed, according to some experts, IRI's strategic culture, influenced by the norms derived from both Persian culture and Shia Islam, includes the use\nof strategic ambiguity and deception, avoidance of frontal attacks, and soft power. When the country's interests are at stake, the strict tenets of Islamic jurisprudence can be abrogated under the concept of maslaha, or acting in the public interest.37 In addition, Kayhan Barzegar and Abdolrasool Divsallar speak about strategic patience, use of low-cost engagements, and diminishing rivals' margin to maneuver as the instruments that the current Iranian regime has masterfully applied for decades. Strategic patience is a deliberate postponement of decisions on critical national security issues, allowing Iran to buy time and conserve resources. This approach is particularly useful in situations where strategic limits exist and available resources are insufficient to counter them. Iranians, who lived under constant insecurity, practiced strategic patience as a means of avoiding emotional, reactionary decisions in the face of harsh conditions. Low-cost engagements, such as hybrid warfare and the use of proxies, are other aspects of norms that influence IRI's strategic culture. In countries like Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen, Iran has created a network of foreign fighters, military advisers, and local regime irregulars under Iranian advisory commands. Additionally, Iran employs a defensive strategy aimed at reducing its rivals' margin to maneuver by blocking their actions and limiting their choices. Called, since 2005, “mosaic defense doctrine,” this strategy includes the concept of “all-around defense,” which brings together all state, nonstate, and private actors to confront threats, and “strategic depth,” which involves creating security buffer zones to reduce the risk of direct attacks on Iranian territory. Anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) capabilities, which encompass military, informational, economic, and political measures, are used by Iran to disrupt adversaries' interests and reduce their choices, thereby raising the cost of any potential hostilities.38 Central to “mosaic doctrine” is the mobilization of a vast and dispersed militia force designed to engage invading forces in protracted, attritional warfare, thereby exhausting their resources and resolve.39\n### Perceptive Lens\nThe title of Graham Fuller's 1991 RAND Corporation study, The Center of the Universe, mirrors the perspective of the IRI's elites, who believe that Iran holds a natural, indispensable, and leading role in the Middle East and potentially the entire Muslim world.40 Such an inflated view of centrality and historic role of Iran is underlined by a deep-seated Iranian identity and a broadly shared historical awareness of Iran's power status in the region. Consequently, the occurrences that contradict these self-centered views may cause cognitive dissonance among Iranians. During his captivity as a hostage in the U.S. embassy in Tehran, following its takeover by Iranian “students” in November 1979, William Daugherty, then the Central Intelligence Agency\n(CIA) Chief of Station, noted that his captors struggled to comprehend and were personally offended by his inability to communicate in Persian, the language of what they considered such an important country as Iran.41 Experiences of victimization, insecurity, and feelings of inferiority have contributed to shaping Iran's sense of pride and significance. Initially, Iran was a nation of conquerors, but over time, it was invaded, conquered, and humbled by various powers, such as the Greeks, Arabs, Mongols, and Turks. The most recent manifestation of this victimization complex is linked to the British and Russian quasi-colonial domination of Iran from the nineteenth to the mid-twentieth centuries and the perceived American influence over Iran after World War II.42\nThe centuries of foreign domination had caused an acute sensitivity among Iranians about the role of foreigners in their culture and politics. Iranians believe, as Marvin Zonis emphasizes, that “[t]he rest of the world is somehow so taken with Iran's significance that it cannot let it go.”43 A siege mentality is fortified by real or presumed threats posed by both nearby and distant enemies. As a result, a pervasive culture of conspiracy thinking has emerged within Iranian society, with many viewing external forces as manipulating or undermining their nation's interests. This phenomenon bears a notable resemblance to the dynamics often attributed to the so-called Arab street. According to Fuller, “Rarely are events to be taken at face value, for to assume them as such is (a) to indicate ignorance of the superior forces around oneself or one's nation and (b) to demonstrate the stupidity, naivete, or insensitivity not to perceive the hidden motives of others.”44 Based on this logic, unanticipated events are not merely isolated incidents but rather the result of powerful external forces that dominate or control the situation. The most complex explanation of political events is usually preferred as the most likely, particularly when foreign powers are involved. While specific interpretations may differ based on individual ideological outlooks, the consensus is that it is naive to assume that a series of developments might be unrelated, particularly when a powerful foreign entity is involved.45\nOther cultural characteristics that have their roots in the prolonged periods of insecurity and foreign rule are a general wariness toward those outside one's intimate circle, particularly authority figures and foreigners, as well as a tendency toward cunning or astuteness. As life is perceived as an unpredictable game of chance, where both favorable and unfavorable opportunities arise and vanish without warning, people outside the inner cycle are considered as inherently malevolent, power-hungry, and irrational. There is a lack of trust in interpersonal relationships and altruistic motives are often looked at with suspicion.46 The mistrust leads to the necessity for manipulation in the struggle for survival, “empty and meaningless adulation,” and consequently, an expectation that others will also attempt to manipulate.47 Consequently, the\nfigure of the clever dissimulator, or zeræng, emerges. As described by William Beeman, zeræng is “[a]n operation on the part of an adroit operator that involves thwarting direct interpretation of his own actions or deliberately leading others to erroneous interpretation of those actions while being able to successfully interpret the actions of others.”48 Albeit being an inherently negative trait, it is, nevertheless, highly admired by Iranians as they see cleverness and wiliness as essential strategies for navigating and overcoming stronger forces.49 However, the reliance on zeræng, combined with the ingrained insecurity and anxiety about being deceived by strangers, can sometimes result in Iranian actors overplaying their hand in diplomacy, business dealings, and military activities.\nIn conclusion, the analysis of Iranian strategic culture based on four variables—identity, values, norms, and perceptive lens—demonstrates that Iran's identity is a fusion of nationality and religion, with a strong sense of exceptionalism and historical continuity. The values that emerged after the Islamic Revolution are deeply rooted in a Manichean worldview, pitting good against evil, with the West representing the forces of evil. The perceptive lens of Iran's elites is inflated, believing that Iran's indispensable and leading role in the Middle East and potentially the entire Muslim world would somehow compensate for technological deficiencies.\n## Building the Digital Wall: Iran's Cybersecurity Architecture\n### The Cyber Posture of Small States\nCyberspace is a complex and multifaceted concept, encompassing various subconcepts and nuanced definitions. Rain Ottis and Peeter Lorents describe cyberspace as “a time-dependent set of interconnected information systems and the human users that interact with these systems,” stressing a dynamic nature of cyberspace, where significant changes can occur rapidly, in a shorter time frame than other time-dependent systems.50\nCyberspace is widely considered offense-dominant, inferring that it is easier to execute attacks than to defend against them. Offensive dominance in cyberspace is due to varied and rapidly evolving attack vectors, which defenders struggle to keep up with. Such an asymmetry is in favor of an attacker, as offensive cyber capabilities are perceived to be resource-efficient compared to defensive measures, which are costly and often lag behind technological advancements.51 In parallel, traditional deterrence models face challenges in cyberspace due to difficulties in attribution and the covert nature of cyber capabilities. The anonymity and rapid execution of cyberattacks undermine the effectiveness of deterrence, which relies on the threat of assured retaliation. A key challenge in implementing cyber deterrence is the need for a strong system of protection as the first step, but\nmany countries prioritize offensive operations over defense, neglecting defense and resilience, instead focusing on offensive methods to deter adversaries.52 The system-wide framework analysis that focuses on the broadest dynamics and the systemic cyber risks inherent to the internet may be worth considering. It addresses both top-down factors, such as insecure technical standards, and bottom-up, emergent effects, like the spread of insecure Internet of Things (IoT) devices. This framework encompasses the full spectrum of attacks, including nation-state disruptions, espionage, cybercrime, and even hacking driven by curiosity or entertainment. Within this context, the tools, methods, and activities of offensive and defensive operations are relatively distinct.53\nHowever, the true destructive potential of cyber operations remains uncertain and a subject of ongoing speculation and debate within the cybersecurity community. As Torbjørn Pedersen notes,54 the initial anticipation of a “modern Pearl Harbor” or upcoming global cyberwars has given way to a more nuanced understanding of the limitations of cyber operations expressed in the article by Thomas Rid, “Cyber War Will Not Take Place.”55 According to Lennart Maschmeyer, cyber operations face an operational trilemma, where the three variables of speed, intensity of effect, and control are negatively correlated. This means that, in most cases, cyber operations will be either too slow, too low in intensity, or too unreliable to provide significant strategic utility.56 Overall, however, both opponents and proponents of cyberwar agree that cyberspace offers new methods of undermining national power by achieving strategic impact through ongoing campaigns of covert, less violent cyber operations with cumulative effects.57\nThe cyber capabilities of small states, defined by limited resources and smaller populations, are primarily focused on defensive measures. This is due to constraints in funding, a lack of specialized expertise and intelligence resources, and the high costs involved in developing advanced offensive tools. The notion that cyber capabilities provide an asymmetric advantage to weaker states is contested, as evidence suggests that powerful states with advanced resources are better positioned to exploit cyber operations.58 Jon Lindsay cites the Stuxnet operation of 2009--2010 as a prime example, when a malicious code penetrated the Iranian nuclear facility in Natanz, wiping out around 1,000 centrifuges. Although specific details about the Stuxnet operation's time frame and effects still remain obscure, Lindsay argues that this incident demonstrates that cyber capabilities do not automatically grant an advantage to weaker states. He emphasizes that small states encounter significant challenges in weaponizing cyber capabilities to inflict substantial damage.59 All these challenge the notion of asymmetric advantage of weaker adversaries in the cyberdomain proposed by some, suggesting instead that cyber capabilities tend to favor powerful states.60\nSmall states often adopt a technology-oriented strategic culture and focus on enhancing their defensive measures to protect their critical infrastructure and maintain national security. The effectiveness of cyber strategies varies among states, with some successfully integrating them into their national security frameworks, while others struggle to recognize the opportunities and threats associated with increased cyber engagement. However, small states often adopt several common strategies to compensate for their limited resources and cyber capabilities. These strategies may include:61 Cyber hygiene programs: Investing in national cyber hygiene programs to educate citizens and businesses about basic cybersecurity practices. This involves developing cybersecurity curricula in educational institutions, conducting regular training programs for government and private sector employees, and fostering a culture of cyber awareness. In Iran's case, this approach took the form of creating a “halal net,” a locally controlled version of the internet designed to limit public access to information. Incident response teams: Establishing national Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) or Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) to handle and coordinate responses to cyber incidents. Legislation and policy frameworks: Setting up robust legislative and policy frameworks. These frameworks set out the roles and responsibilities of various stakeholders and establish protocols for incident response and information sharing. Investment in technology: Despite resource limitations, small states are increasingly investing in advanced cyber defense technologies, such as intrusion detection systems, encryption, and secure communication platforms to protect critical infrastructure. Public--private partnerships often play a key role in supporting national cybersecurity strategies, provided there is a skilled workforce and organizational infrastructure to effectively utilize these technologies. Additionally, the absence of economic and technological sanctions mechanisms is crucial, as it allows these states to acquire the necessary technologies without significant barriers.Cyber defense alliances, collaboration, and information sharing with other states, international organizations, and private sector partners to enhance cyber defense capabilities.\nPutting the cyber capabilities of small states in the context of strategic culture, Francis Domingo introduced the concept of “technology-oriented” strategic culture, which refers to small states' inclination to rely on technology as a strategy to overcome limited resources, military capabilities, and strategic depth.62 In this context, technology serves as an enabler for states to pursue foreign policy objectives in a more deliberate and strategic manner. A technology-oriented strategic culture can be identified by examining three key implications for small states: High network readiness: Small states with a technology-oriented strategic culture prioritize the development and maintenance of advanced communication\nnetworks, data systems, and digital infrastructure to enhance their overall connectivity and readiness. Technology-driven military force: These states invest in technology-driven military capabilities, such as advanced weapon systems, unmanned aerial vehicles, and cyberwarfare tools, to augment their military power and strategic reach. Relevance of cybersecurity: Cybersecurity becomes a critical concern for small states with a technology-oriented strategic culture, as they recognize the potential risks and vulnerabilities associated with their reliance on technology. As a result, they prioritize the protection of their digital infrastructure and critical data to ensure their national security and maintain their strategic advantages.63\nIran offers an intriguing case study, as its strategic culture, characterized by its identity, values, norms, and perceptual lens, aligns closely with the defensive cybersecurity posture of many small states. The emphasis on resistance, strategic patience, ambiguity, and low-cost engagements constitutes Iran's approach to cyberspace, reflecting broader trends seen in the cyber strategies of small states. However, over the past decade, Iran has significantly stepped up its offensive cyber capabilities, elevating itself, according to some estimates, to the top of the second tier of global cyberpowers, with aspirations to join the leaders.64\n### Iranian Cyber Capabilities\nIran's initial steps to build its defensive cyber capabilities can be traced back to 2003, when units specializing in cybersecurity were set up within several ministries.65 A 2010 wake-up call occurred with the Stuxnet operation, followed by the “Wiper” and “Flame” malicious code attacks, solidifying the regime's understanding that Iran's adversaries possess a distinct qualitative advantage in offensive cyber activities. By 2016, Iran's cyber capabilities budget was reportedly over USD 1 billion (vs. USD 76 million in 2011), compared to the USD 2 billion budget of the United Kingdom, one of the world's leading cyberpowers. According to Iranian data, the country's cyber budget experienced a twelvefold increase between 2013 and 2021. By the late 2010s, approximately 18% of Iranian university students were studying computer science. Additionally, compulsory military service was utilized to direct technologically skilled graduates toward the state security apparatus, including the MOIS and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC),66 while the topic of cyber defense entered the high school textbook Preparation for Defense.67\nIn March 2012, the Supreme Council of Cyberspace, under the direction of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, was established. The Council is headed by the Iranian President and includes 25 senior government representatives and other key figures, such as the senior commander of the\nIRGC; the head of the Majlis; the Ministers of Science, Communications and Culture; the chief of police; and the president of the Islamic Propaganda Organization. The Council has the power to establish national cyber policy, and its decisions are mandatory for all Iranian institutions operating in the field.68 The National Center for Cyberspace, which is the main division of the Council, is responsible for comprehensive domestic and international surveillance, enforcing the enactments of the council, and preventing Iranians from accessing virtual private networks (VPNs) and internet proxies, which are used to bypass Iran's internet controls.69\nVarious organizations monitor and protect Iran's cyberspace infrastructure. All of them are affiliated with different government institutions and operate in different fields. A key defensive organization within this structure is the Cyberspace Defense Command, which functions under the Passive Defense Organization of the general staff of the armed forces. This organization is made up of both military personnel and representatives from the Communications, Defense, Intelligence, and Industry ministries. Its primary goal is to establish a comprehensive defensive strategy for safeguarding state institutions and infrastructures from potential cyber threats. The Cyberspace Defense Command is primarily focused on defense and does not appear to be engaged in offensive cyber activities. Another defensive entity within Iran's cyberspace structure is the Center for Information Security, also known as MAHER. This center is established and operated under the Communications and Information Technologies Ministry and is primarily responsible for activating computer security incident response teams during emergencies and cyberattacks. Furthermore, MAHER trains skilled manpower, develops response mechanisms for cyber crises, and stores and disseminates data security know-how. The center is responsible for defending all government websites, as well as those of private companies that are officially registered with the Communications Ministry.70 The Committee for Identifying Unauthorized Sites and FATA (an acronym for the Police for the Sphere of the Production and Exchange of Information) act as Iran's cyber police, overseeing internet usage for both domestic suppression and countering cybercrime.71 The IRGC runs its cyber operations, both defensive and offensive, through the IRGC Cyber-Electronic Command (IRGC-CEC), which is headquartered at the Ammar Cyberspace Base.72\nRegarding Iran's offensive cyber capabilities, the IRGC and MOIS are responsible for conducting both independent and joint offensive operations against perceived and real threats to Iranian national security. Among these two entities, the IRGC undoubtedly takes the lead. Its Electronic Warfare and Cyber Defense Organization offers training courses in cyber defense, restricts access to online content, and censors digital communications in Iranian cyberspace73 and “bears primary responsibility for offensive cyber\noperations.”74 By 2009, the IRGC started enlisting professionals for its internal cyberforce, as well as the closely associated military unit known as the Iranian Cyber Army (ICA). That same year, the Basij Cyber Council, another cyber entity overseen by the IRGC, revealed that it had trained 1,500 cybersecurity specialists. These professionals were prepared to join the IRGC's expanding offensive operations and espionage division. In 2010, the Basij cyber unit's leaders publicly declared their intention to launch digital attacks targeted at the actions of the “Zionist Entity,” Israel.75 The IRGC trains, equips, and provides operational support in the cyberdomain to Iranian proxies such as Hezbollah. For instance, in 2021, the IRGC helped establish a cybersecurity unit within Hezbollah's counterintelligence service. In parallel, a cybertraining facility disguised as a branch of Tehran's Sharif University was opened in Dahiye, in the southern suburbs of Beirut.76\nIran's cyberspace development is mainly driven by universities and technological institutes, with a focus on information technology (IT), computer engineering, and communications. Key institutions include Amirkabir University of Technology, Imam Hossein University, Shahid Beheshti University, and Sharif University of Technology. The Iranian government supports IT and computer communications companies through direct and indirect investments, with key government bodies being the Science Ministry, the Information and Communications Ministry, the Technology Cooperation Office, and hi-tech greenhouses like the Pardis Technology Park and Guilan Science and Technology Park.77 Furthermore, the universities play a crucial role in subcontracting cyber operations to front companies and individuals. Over the years, a tiered approach to cyber operations has developed within the Iranian intelligence landscape. At its core is a trusted network of middle managers—often university employees—who are ideologically aligned with the Iranian government and who translate intelligence priorities into segmented cyber tasks. These tasks are then bid out to multiple contractors, where about 50 organizations compete for regime-sponsored projects. The authorities compartmentalize tasks, often requiring different contractors for various parts of a project, such as creating exploits and establishing unauthorized access. Payments are only made upon the completion of the task, as competition is fierce and contractors are pitted against each other. Characteristic in this context is the case of Monica Witt—a former U.S. Air Force intelligence specialist who served in the Air Force from 1997 through 2008 and then with a defense contractor until 2010. Defecting to Iran in 2013, Witt leaked top-secret information to the Iranians, including the identities of U.S. intelligence agents and highly classified intelligence collection programs.78 In 2015, four Iranian hackers, coopted by the IRCG, targeted U.S. intelligence and military personnel in an unsophisticated and poorly executed cyber operation that ultimately failed.79\nAlthough Iran boasts a large network of IT professionals, the Islamic regime's inherent paranoia creates unique challenges. Those with the greatest offensive cyber skills and those demonstrating adherence to the government's ideology are usually mutually exclusive.80 Furthermore, the country is facing a significant brain drain, as many cybersecurity experts are leaving Iran at an alarming pace.\nCooperation with foreign actors, particularly China, North Korea, and Russia, has significantly contributed to Iran's cyber capabilities. In 2015, Russia and Iran signed the first cyber cooperation agreement, recognizing common threats in the cyberdomain. In 2017, a memorandum of understanding for cooperation on information and communication technology (ICT)--related issues, including “internet governance, network security,” and “international internet connection” was signed. In 2021, Russia and Iran concluded the agreement on information security aimed to coordinate activities in response to the growing importance of cyber issues in international relations and ICT-related crimes, as well as the creation of an Iranian “sovereign internet.”81 Since the beginning of the Ukraine conflict in 2022, Russia has supplied Iran with communication-surveillance capabilities, eavesdropping devices, advanced photography equipment, and lie detectors, and reportedly also shared more advanced software with Iran, enabling it to hack phones and systems of dissidents and adversaries. Protei Ltd. a Russian company specializing in communication monitoring tools, has started providing internet censorship software to the Iranian mobile services provider Ariantel. The Protei tools are believed to be part of a developing mobile phone system that would allow Iranian state authorities to directly monitor, intercept, redirect, degrade, or deny mobile communications.82 In 2021, Iranian cybersecurity company Lotus Gostar Arya (or Cysec) opened a branch in Kazan to foster cooperation and exchange of know-how between Iran and Russia.83\nOn 17 January 2025, Russia and Iran further solidified their partnership by signing the “Treaty on Comprehensive Strategic Partnership.” Article 4 of the treaty explicitly stipulates that the intelligence and security services of both nations “shall exchange information and experience and enhance the level of their cooperation.” This agreement is expected to further deepen collaboration in the cyber domain.84\nIn December 2010, the Chinese telecommunications firm ZTE Corp. sold a surveillance system to Iran's Telecommunication Co. of Iran (TCI) as part of a USD 130.6 million networking equipment contract. The surveillance system can monitor landline, mobile, and internet communications. TCI, which had at that time a near monopoly on Iran's landline telephone services, managed a significant portion of Iran's internet traffic.85 In 2019, China and Iran agreed to establish a joint workgroup to tackle cyber threats, emphasizing cooperation in IT, addressing cyber threats, and “counter[ing] U.S.\nunilateralism.”86 In 2009, a significant intelligence failure committed by the CIA occurred when a faulty web-based covert communications system used by the CIA in Iran was exposed, resulting in the arrest and execution of numerous CIA informants. The Iran events coincided with a similar setback in China in 2011 and 2012, where around 30 agents were apprehended and executed. Some officials suspected that the two nations might have collaborated, with Iran offering China technical information about the exposed communications system in exchange for equipment and expertise.87\nIn September 2012, Iran and North Korea signed a technology cooperation agreement, which allegedly included the cyberdomain.88 Iran potentially could have provided information on Stuxnet to North Korea, which ultimately prevented the Stuxnet-similar attack on the North Korean nuclear facility. A tightly controlled network and the inability of physical penetration of the facility to install the worm into the command systems might have also contributed to the failure.89\nTo conclude, Iran shares some defensive strategies with small states, such as resource constraints and the high costs associated with developing sophisticated offensive tools. Iran's investment in education and the development of technological expertise is consistent with the technology-oriented strategic culture described by Domingo. In a similar vein, the country's emphasis on training and harnessing its human capital shows how smaller states leverage technology to compensate for limited resources. The programs focusing on cyber hygiene, incident response teams, and legislative frameworks also mirror the defensive strategies typically adopted by small states.\nHowever, unlike many small states that focus primarily on defense, Iran has developed substantial offensive cyber capabilities. Organizations like the IRGC-CEC and ICA actively engage in offensive operations, targeting both regional adversaries and global entities. This level of offensive capability is more characteristic of larger, more powerful states. The integration of foreign expertise and technology, such as surveillance systems and cybersecurity tools, underscores Iran's ability to leverage international partnerships to bolster its cyber posture. The extent and sophistication of Iran's offensive operations, including cyberespionage and attacks, distinguish it from the typical small-state cyber posture, which often lacks the resources to develop such capabilities. Iran's cyber budget and institutional support structures, including the Supreme Cyberspace Council, are substantial compared to those of typical small states. The scale of investment and the comprehensive nature of its cyber governance framework indicate a level of state commitment that exceeds what is usually seen in smaller states with limited resources.\nSuch a combination of defensive focus, substantial offensive capacity, extensive foreign partnerships, and significant state investment makes Iran a unique player in the cyber landscape of small states.\nLEAKED INSIGHTS: IRAN'S CYBERDFENSE LANDSCAPE AND STRATEGIC CULTURE\nOver the last decade, Iran has been actively building a multifaceted cyber defense system to safeguard its critical infrastructure, suppress opposition groups, and block perceived harmful content, all aimed at maintaining the regime's stability. Guided by the Supreme Council of Cyberspace, Iran's numerous governmental agencies have been at the forefront of the implementation of this strategy. Despite such a concerted effort, the Iranian state organizations, including the MOIS, have been regularly experiencing high-impact leaks. For instance, since 2017 and into 2019, self-declared Iranian dissident groups—such as Lab Dookhtegan, Green Leakers, Black Box, and Hidden Reality—have emerged as “mystery groups” with unclear origins and affiliations.90 Over time, these groups have built reputations as reliable sources of information, exposing Iranian intelligence and military operations both within Iran and across the Middle East.91\nThe agencies tasked with cyber defense, although numerous and mature, are, as it seems, still lacking capabilities and know-how to fully prevent high-impact breaches. The researchers inside Iran have pointed out a number of weak points in the Iranian cyber defense. Hassan Monfared, writing about the cyberwarfare of the Iranian armed forces, finds that they lack a comprehensive view of cyber defense and highlights the need for a systematic approach to stabilize and improve cyber combat readiness across the army ranks.92 Shafiee et al. from Passive Defense Organization see the need to improve management of public opinion through cyberspace and identify several psychological operations techniques aimed at improving the image of the army and countering adversaries' psychological operations.93 Similarly, Mohammad Tabatabaei and Ehsan Movahedian in their study of the U.S cyber influence operations against Iran's internet users stress a gap in Iran's ability to counter foreign cyber influence effectively.94 Abolfazl and Mahdi Rohani stress cyberspace's dual nature as both a threat and opportunity and propose a catalog of measures to effectively managing and mitigating cyber threats. Interestingly enough, the measures proposed by the researchers are strikingly similar to those revealed in the leaked documents discussed below. They include strengthening the Supreme Council of Cyberspace and the National Cyber Space Center's role as the country's cyber focal point; enhancing capabilities of organizations such as the ICA; developing a local internet industry and broadband ecosystem; strengthening local entrepreneurs active in cyberdomain; and more active utilization of cyberspace for conflict, war, competition, and information operations against adversaries.95 Very insightful in this context is the confidential letter produced by Ali Asghar Qaimi, the advisor in the field of communication and IT, security, and cyber defense, to the speaker of the Iranian parliament,\nMohammad Bagher Ghalibaf.96 In it, Qaimi lists sixteen “challenges” faced by the Iranian cyber defense as of January 2024. Among them are: big differences in the quality of online infrastructure in various government bodies; existence of uncovered vulnerabilities and planted backdoors; lack of proper monitoring and action plans to locate and fix vulnerabilities; widespread attempts to cover up problems, incidents, and cyberattacks; lack of organizational discipline within the agencies responsible for vital and sensitive infrastructure; shortage of skilled personnel in the fields of security and cyber defense; utilization of unsuitable external cyber defense products in the vital infrastructure; the multiplicity of decisionmaking authorities and their interference, leading to the adoption of often contradictory decisions; brain drain of cybersecurity experts; and the long and exhausting process of obtaining security licenses and qualifications for individuals and private security companies.97 Qaimi concludes that, because many organizations in Iran fail to meet minimum security requirements, one should expect further cyberattacks, disclosure of information, and disruption of services in the future.98 To sum up, the challenges faced by Iran's cyber defense system, as outlined by Iranian researchers, highlight significant gaps in infrastructure, personnel, and overall preparedness, painting a troubling picture of the country's vulnerability to cyber threats. These weaknesses are also mirrored in a letter by Qaimi that lists several critical deficiencies, providing a realistic view on the current situation with cyber defense.\nThe analysis of the leaked documents begins with the four-year plan, classified as “secret,” laid down on 23 July 2021, by new Minister of Intelligence Hojjat al-Islam Seyyed Ismail Khatib. Although the document tackles the challenges and priorities related to cybersecurity, it does not explicitly describe the current state of cybersecurity in the country. Nevertheless, it highlights the significance of modernizing intelligence infrastructure to address cyber threats effectively, including monitoring, prevention, and capacity building in cyber.99 It also emphasizes the importance of protecting critical infrastructure, combating cyberespionage, and enhancing cooperation with international partners in cybersecurity efforts. The document refers to “the concrete operational plans” that need to be put in place based on the resolutions by the Supreme Council of Cyberspace.100\nIn addition to the four-year plan that due to its programmatic nature tackles the topic of cyber without sufficient depth, six other documents, all of which explicitly focus on various aspects of cybersecurity, will be analyzed using a framework of seven interconnected themes. These themes, which have been consistently addressed in all documents, provide a comprehensive understanding of Iran's approach to cybersecurity:Governance and regulatory framework,National Information Network,\n.International engagement and cyber diplomacy,Control over information flows and protection of Islamic-Iranian identity,Economic and technological integration within the cyberdomain,Human resources and workforce development, andCybersecurity infrastructure and cyber protective mechanisms.\n### Governance and Regulatory Framework\nThe importance of the Supreme Council of Cyberspace as the main body responsible for Iran's cyberdomain has been stressed in all documents. The decisions of the Council must be considered binding and be implemented by all organizations, including the office of the prosecutor and the courts.101 The Council also plays a crucial role in determining the budgetary spending on cybersecurity and monitoring measures to protect Iran's critical infrastructure.102 It is interesting to note in this context that the performance of the National Center for Cyberspace, which is controlled by the Council, is regularly assessed based on the principles of good governance (salamat-e edari).103\n### National Information Network\nEstablishing a “reliable, safe, stable, integrated, and extensive infrastructure throughout the country based on the National Information Network”104 that would enable the regime to “[r]educe as much as possible access to unauthorized foreign platforms”105 is seen as one of the most important priorities monitored by the Council. The Ministry of Communications and Information Technology was entrusted with the responsibility of connecting at least 80% of the country's households and businesses to the National Information Network by the end of 2023.106 In the foreseeable future, Iran's satellite infrastructure and the National Information Network should be integrated, further solidifying the country's digital autonomy and enhancing its cybersecurity capabilities.107\n### International Engagement and Cyber Diplomacy\nIn the international arena, Iran pursues two goals in the cyberdomain: first, to expand cooperation with allied and friendly nations, especially Islamic countries,108 as well as to “[a]chieve an active, strong, and purposeful presence in regional and international assemblies and institutions.”109 Second, Iran seeks to strengthen its position as a formidable cyberpower, leveraging international bodies as deterrent mechanisms in its cyberspace.110 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs plays a major role in setting up a “cyber space diplomacy system,” as well as assisting other state agencies in dealing with international organizations.111\n###\nControl over Information Flows and Protection of Islamic--Iranian Identity\nProtecting the Islamic--Iranian identity and lifestyle is a crucial aspect of cyber defense in Iran. Consequently, the country regulates social media presence in accordance with its laws and values. The Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance plays a significant role in this regard, responsible for registering official accounts, closing fake accounts, and blocking unauthorized advertisements of foreign social networks.112 As a countermeasure to potential threats in the digital space, content providers in Iran are required to promote the “discourse of the Islamic Revolution” and contribute to the creation of a “new Islamic civilization in cyberspace.”113 Government employees are forbidden from being present on “unauthorized social media platforms” without permission and required to follow guidelines and regulations if they are present on “approved” platforms.114\n### Economic and Technological Integration within the Cyberdomain\nIn the field of economic and technological integration within the cyberdomain, Iran pursues a twofold strategy—increasing the share of domestic products and services in cybersecurity, and supporting local providers. Thus, the need to double the local content of products and services has been emphasized time and again in different strategic documents.115 In parallel, the share of the digital segment in the Iranian economy is planned to reach 10% by 2031,116 while some suggest that the same share should be set at 20% of the Gross Domestic Product.117 Support of the local providers of products and services is considered vital. Several authors recommend that authorities make “[m]aximum usage of private cyber security contractors”118 and “support companies, particularly in the fields of security systems, locally-built browsers, and national messengers.”119\n### Human Resources and Workforce Development\nIn addition, it is considered crucial to address the need to establish criteria for recruiting, retaining, and protecting experts in the cybersecurity domain, as such plans require careful design and implementation.120 The salaries of cybersecurity specialists should be increased and the issue of brain drain requires urgent attention.121 Furthermore, the cybersecurity literacy among government employees needs to be addressed through internal training and specialized courses.122 The number of student admissions in cybersecurity-related fields also needs to be expanded.123 The goal is to create a reservoir of skilled and efficient cybersecurity experts, thereby gaining a strategic advantage for Iran in this area.124\nCybersecurity Infrastructure and Cyber Protective Mechanisms\nIran's cyber defense strategy has, over the decade, evolved as a multifaceted approach that includes regular assessments, clear role assignments, and a catalogue of proactive measures. The establishment and continuous development of cybersecurity measures within all state institutions are considered critical in safeguarding national security. The institutions are obliged to create and implement comprehensive cyberspace security plans to prevent, combat, and manage cyber incidents,125 including cyber drills.126 Additionally, regular evaluations and situational reports mandated to assess the fulfillment of cybersecurity tasks must be submitted to the Supreme Council of Cyberspace.127 Nongovernmental institutions are also urged to organize and enhance their cybersecurity capabilities.128\nAccording to the top-secret document of April 2023, the task of guarding Iran's cyber borders was at that time the responsibility of the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology. However, the document complains that this mission is not logically aligned with the Ministry's posture in protecting Iran's communication and information infrastructure. As a result, the role of the armed forces and the country's intelligence agencies in this area has been overlooked. Hence, it was necessary to reevaluate the legal framework for cyber border protection and consider assigning this important task to an organization that is better equipped to handle it. In addition, a plethora of organizations responsible for cyber defense, including the Passive Defense Organization, the Center for Information Security, and the cyber police (FATA), have overlapping responsibilities. This requires a clear definition of their roles and duties, particularly in their relations to the armed forces, the IRGC, and the Ministry of Intelligence.129 Furthermore, the general staff of the armed forces was “[t]asked to prepare a national program to prevent and address defense-security threats posed by unauthorized satellite systems for Iranian cyber space.”130\nThe insights gained from the documents examined in this section underline the key premises of strategic culture defined earlier. The overall structure of Iran's cyber governance is heavily centralized, reflecting Iran's historical preference for a strong, centralized leadership, which is seen as necessary to maintain order and control in a complex and multifaceted society. The country's commitment to reducing foreign dependence and fostering a self-reliant digital economy aligns with the drive toward self-sufficiency and autonomy as seen through historical experience of invasions and influence from foreign powers. In the eternal struggle between virtue and evil, a dwindling human capital in the cyberdomain needs to be exploited and protected to advance the country's strategic interests, as the entire society should remain resilient, in line with the values of vigilance and resistance against external threats. Internationally, Iran considers itself a leader of the\nIslamic world that stays firm in the face of Western influence. By leveraging international bodies as deterrent mechanisms, the regime attempts to project power and protect its interests in cyberspace. Iran's dual strategy of enhancing domestic cybersecurity capabilities while also striving for technological independence and integration into the global cyberdomain mirrors its cultural emphasis on adaptability to secure the country's position in a complex and competitive international environment. The role of cultural and media institutions in cyberspace is critical for the regime, as their task is to promote the dual elements of Iranian identity—nationality and religion. Such an emphasis on aligning cyber content with Islamic principles demonstrates the intertwining of religious ideology with national identity, as it reinforces the regime's narrative and counters foreign cultural influence.\nFinally, while concrete data are lacking, it is reasonable to infer that the multidecade economic and technological sanctions imposed on Iran have significantly affected its cyber defense capabilities, influencing both its strategy and the evolution of its cyber infrastructure. These sanctions have severely limited Iran's ability to acquire advanced cyber defense technologies, as restrictions on access to key software, hardware, and encryption technologies hinder the country's efforts to build a sophisticated cybersecurity infrastructure. A comprehensive analysis examining the impact of sanctions on Iran's cyber defense capabilities would be a fascinating subject for further study, shedding light on the consequences of such restrictions and their potential long-term effects on a nation's ability to protect itself in the cyber realm.\n## CONCLUSION\nA strategic culture that shaped Iranian perceptions, values, and norms has its roots in Persian culture and Shia Islam. Iran's historical experiences of conquest and foreign domination have led to a siege mentality, conspiracy thinking, and the admiration of cunning and manipulation. Besides, a unique blend of historical experiences and geostrategic positions have shaped Iran's sense of identity and its perception of exceptionalism and superiority. Some Iranian authors even advance the notion of “geopolitical superiority,” arguing that Iran's strategic positioning and its “geographical gravity” can somehow compensate for its technological deficiencies—a belief that underestimates the role of and need for technological advancement in the face of modern threats and evolving security dynamics.131\nConsequently, these specific operational codes, histories, and assumptions of strategic culture have a significant influence on the country's cyber defense posture, characterized by heightened sensitivity to cyberattacks by hostile actors. The Stuxnet attack was probably a pivotal moment that revealed Iran's vulnerabilities to advanced cyber threats from hostile actors and solidified the Manichean worldview of ruling elites about perceived external\nthreats, especially those emanating from the West. Over the last decade, Iran adopted a multifaceted approach to safeguarding infrastructure, suppressing opposition, and countering foreign influence. Iran has achieved a unique position in the cyber landscape that is characterized by a mix of defensive focus, offensive capabilities, partnerships with allied states, and significant state investment. The country's comprehensive cyber strategy and governance framework position it as a formidable player, blending characteristics of both small and larger states.\nOver the last few years, Iranian-affiliated cyber threat actors have demonstrated the ability to execute sustained, complex, and disruptive operations across multiple sectors outside of Iran. These groups frequently utilize advanced tactics, techniques, and procedures, continuously refining their strategies to avoid detection and maintain access to compromised networks. The coordination among these actors and their shared use of resources and tools demonstrate a unified effort to support Iran's geopolitical aims. Their ongoing use of destructive malware, ransomware, and espionage operations underscores the threat they pose, particularly in the context of regional tensions and global political events. Thus, Iran was one of the most assertive foreign actors attempting to create discord ahead of the 2024 U.S. presidential elections. Iranian operatives have launched influence operations targeting U.S. audiences, potentially aiming to sway the outcome of the elections. This cyber-enabled influence campaign is being driven by a mix of actors conducting preliminary cyber reconnaissance and inserting online personas and websites into the information ecosystem. In June 2024, hackers linked to the IRGC successfully infiltrated the Trump campaign, stealing internal documents and leaking them to media outlets.132\nIn the cyber defensive domain, the leaked documents mostly confirm the conclusions derived from the sources available in the public domain. The materials show that Iran has developed a multifaceted cyber defense system aimed at protecting its critical infrastructure, controlling information, and maintaining regime stability. The Supreme Council of Cyberspace oversees this strategy, coordinating efforts across various governmental agencies. Highly centralized cyber governance aims at strengthening the country's self-reliance and reducing foreign dependence, aligning with Iran's strategic culture of resistance to external influences. Internationally, Iran's posture is marked by adaptability and resilience to secure its position in the global cyberdomain. However, despite the extensive cyber defense measures, Iran still faces significant challenges, such as weaknesses in comprehensive defense strategies, management of public opinion, and countering foreign influence operations. Numerous high-impact leaks experienced by Iranian state organizations revealed persistent issues with infrastructure quality, cyber threat monitoring, and organizational discipline.\nROLE OF STRATEGIC CULTURE IN IRAN'S CYBER DEFENSE POLICY\n681\n# DISCLOSURE STATEMENT\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author.",

This culture combines a strong national pride and historical consciousness with values centered on resisting external influences. Ultimately, strategic culture has influenced the country’s cyber capabilities, which have significantly evolved since 2003, largely due to state investment and the establishment of the Supreme Council of Cyberspace in 2012. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and the Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS) lead offensive cyber operations, making Iran’s cyber posture more aligned with larger state powers than typical small states. Leaked documents from the Iranian opposition disclosed that Iran has actively developed a comprehensive cyber defense framework over the past decade to protect its critical infrastructure, quell opposition, and control presumed harmful content to maintain regime stability. Despite these efforts, leaks from dissident groups have exposed persistent weaknesses in Iran’s cyber defense, highlighting challenges in infrastructure, threat monitoring, and organizational discipline. Moreover, these leaks reveal Iran’s strategic focus on self-reliance and resistance to foreign influence.\nDr. Grigorij Serscikov is an Independent Researcher and Consultant with over fifteen years of experience in offering strategic advice and analysis to companies within the energy and financial sectors.

However, the credibility of the leaked documents—that is, the context in which the documents were produced and the intentions of the authors who wrote them4—although it invites certain skepticism, does not currently challenge its validity. Similarly, the representativeness of the papers is established through the sheer volume of the leaked materials on the various topics of Iranian internal and external policies. Therefore, while the authenticity of the documents may be subject to debate, their credibility and representativeness are well established, providing a solid foundation for the research.\nAmong the wealth of primary sources made available to the public, there were several related to Iran's cyber defense strategies, providing researchers with insights into the country's cybersecurity programs. One key document is titled, “The Program Proposed by the Minister of Intelligence Hojjat al-Islam wal-Muslimeen Seyyed Ismail Khatib for the 13th government Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, 23 July 2021”5—the newly appointed head of the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence (MOIS).6 In it, Khatib outlined his vision for the evolution of the MOIS over the next four years, addressing inter alia issues related to Iranian cybersecurity. Other documents that will be examined in this study are: “The Ninety-Fourth Session of the Supreme Council of the Country's Cyber Space of 16 August 2023,”7 “The Ninety-Second Meeting of the Supreme Council of Cyberspace of June 27, 2023,”8 “Parts One and Two of the Strategic Document of the Islamic Republic of Iran on Cyber Space of July 14, 2021,”9 “Requirements and Measures Related to the Use of Satellite Systems in Cyberspace of 30 August 2022,”10 “Opinion Regarding the Promotion of the Cyber Space of 9 April 2023,”11 and “The Letter of the Advisor to the Speaker of the Parliament in the Field of Communication and Information Technology, Security and Cyber Defense of 16 January 2024.”12 Furthermore, Persian-language academic journals published in Iran, such as The Quarterly Journal of Multidisciplinary Studies for Strategic Knowledge, Strategic Studies Quarterly, and The Quarterly of Political Strategic Studies have been tackling the themes related to cybersecurity for almost a decade. Rarely quoted in the West, these publications, whose authors are often affiliated with the country's intelligence and military community, provide an outside-in perspective on the topic and, as will be shown, significantly complement primary sources.\nIranian cyber defense will be examined within the framework of a case study approach—a reliable and often-used methodology to explore the case's “why” and/or “how” questions in situations of complex causality where the researcher has limited control.13 This approach will be further strengthened through a detailed and systematic analysis of the leaked documents, which will play a central role in the research. By integrating the insights derived from the documents, the case study method enables the researcher to achieve high levels of “conceptual validity”—the identification of the most representative features within the specific context of Iranian cyber defense.14 The concept of strategic culture will be applied as a theoretical avenue for the analysis. First appearing in the late 1970s,15 the idea has experienced several waves of scholarly attention since then.16 Johnson and Larsen define strategic culture as “[a] set of shared beliefs, assumptions, and modes of behavior, derived from common experiences and accepted narratives (both oral and written), that shape collective identity and relationships to other groups, and which determine appropriate ends and means for achieving security objectives.”17 A country's strategic culture is not randomly chosen or influenced by intellectual trends. It is shaped by the character and context of its society and becomes, in the views of Jeremy Black, a “cultural assumption” that fits the nation's strategic needs and influences its strategic behavior.18 Strategic culture, which is rooted in historical experiences, can evolve but cannot be easily discarded. It is a crucial factor in a country's strategic effectiveness, but it is not infinitely adaptable. Radical changes in culture only occur as a result of significant political, social, or military shocks. Strategic cultures borrow and adapt from one another, but this process has its limits.\nThe concept of strategic culture is highly suitable for the analysis of cybersecurity and cyberwarfare. For instance, the study prepared for the U.S. Cyber Command applied the notion of strategic culture as a theoretical foundation to build four case studies, one of them Iran.19 The author believes that the concept offers an additional advantage for this research, as it allows for deriving further insights and drawing implications from the primary and secondary sources as well as tracing the development of Iran's strategies to cybersecurity in general and cyber defense in particular during a specific period.20 ROLE OF STRATEGIC CULTURE IN IRAN'S CYBER DEFENSE POLICY # IRANIAN STRATEGIC CULTURE Strategic culture faces the challenge of not having a clear collection of principles or a well-established theoretical framework. The common ground for strategic culture generally involves acknowledging culture as an epiphenomenal factor in the examination of foreign policy and security choices.[21] However, this can be complicated by the fact that strategic culture is not a one-size-fits-all concept. Every actor possesses its own operational code, history, assumptions, and strategic culture. To develop a more streamlined research model, it is necessary to narrow national culture variables to those that consistently impact the actor's policy and hold significant value for that specific culture. For this study, a four-variable model suggested by Jeannie Johnson will be adopted, offering valuable insights for the analysis of Iranian strategic culture. The four variables are:\n\n# Identity\nIranian identity is a complex and multifaceted concept influenced by various factors, such as political values, historical experiences, religion, and geographical location. The Islamic Republic of Iran (IRI) has an identity that is defined by the elements of \"nationality\" and \"religion,\" with the weight and importance of these elements fluctuating over time.[23] The distinctive Persian identity has thrived despite many invasions, with the Iranians adopting some of the invaders' ways but adapting them to be more Persian than not.[24] This sense of identity and pride stems from the cultural continuity that has been maintained over time. At the same time, they also manifest themselves in a sense of superiority and exceptionalism over neighboring countries and peoples.[25] Iran's geography has played a crucial role in its history as a land that has been home to various nomads, invaders, and settlers from surrounding areas. Settled within confines between the Caspian Sea in the north and the Persian Gulf in the south, and enclosed by the\nAND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE VOLUME 38, NUMBER 2\nmountains of Zagros and Alborz, these groups were able to live in relative isolation for extended periods, leading to the emergence of numerous ethnic, religious, tribal, and other groupings that often found reasons to be in conflict with one another.26 According to Pollack, “Because of the discrete separation of so much of the population, Iran became a patchwork of ethnic, religious, tribal, and other groupings, all of whom seemed to find constant reasons for conflict with their neighbors.”27\nThe Islamic Revolution enhanced Iran's sense of exceptionalism and created a potent mixture of religious ideology and deep-seated nationalism.28 Willis Stanley underscores that:“[t]he current Iranian leadership appears to have recognizable goals derived from its unique political ideology, which makes use of Shia Islam's gradual consolidation of a clerical caste and historical Iran's concerns about sovereignty and acceptance of an absolute ruler. In this ideology, Iran and Shia Islam are viewed as the same, indivisible.29”\nThe pride in Iran's pre-Islamic history shared by the majority of Iranians is reframed within an Islamist context and integrated into the overarching narrative. The IRI's perception of its own unique centrality is informed by its awareness of the country's role as one of the region's historical powers, today challenged by the alluring influence of the West as an alternative to the righteous path of the Iranian model.\n### Values\nAnthony Cain quotes Vakili-Zad who notes that the ideology of the Islamic Revolution was shaped by:“those who carried the heavy burden of often bloody confrontations with government troops, [and] were, in general, religiously oriented and linked to traditional values from the rural past ... . [T]he blueprint for future society was the Islamic Republic modeled on the one created by the Prophet Muhammad more than 1,400 years earlier.30”\nSeven years before the revolution, Ali Shariati, a leading Iranian sociologist and revolutionary, in his first public lecture on Islamology, insisted that a reassembly of past cultural values would underpin an overturning of the existing order.31 Such a remodeling of values, with an ultimate goal of creating a just society, cannot be achieved without a perennial struggle against the forces of evil. Ayatollah Khomeini believed that the world is perpetually embroiled in a struggle between good and evil, where the forces of virtue must resist domination and fight against oppression and injustice.32 Most importantly, the threats posed by rival cultures that have different sets of\nvalues from which Iranian society must be cleansed. If these values were to reemerge, it would signify the failure of the revolution's primary objective.33 As a result, the IRI's efforts to maintain the ethos of resistance and jihad against presumed or real adversaries are rooted in the moral and spiritual values of the Islamic Revolution. They are essential mechanisms created to insulate Iranian society against subversive foreign cultural influences and project Iran's power to confront its adversaries abroad. In this context, the concept of moqavamat (resistance) plays an important role. Initially originated as a slogan in the Palestinian national movement in the 1960s, it evolved into a quasi-religious doctrine of armed struggle by Palestinian Hamas and Lebanese Hizballah in the 1980s. It was later adopted by Iran. Although the doctrine of resistance has foreign origins, it resonates deeply with those who embrace the Shi'ite martyrdom narrative of Imam Hussein, who chose resistance and martyrdom at Karbala over surrender to the unjust seventh-century Caliph Yazid.34 Iranian scholars Hossein Salimi and Amin Hejazi, while explicitly highlighting the defensive nature of Iranian jihad, mention resistance against oppression and defense of the oppressed, negation of Western dominance, independence, and self-sufficiency as core values of the IRI.35\nTo sum up, the values that emerged after the Islamic Revolution in Iran, shaped by its religiously oriented and traditionally minded founders, are deeply rooted in a Manichean and one-dimensional worldview that pits good against evil, with the West representing the forces of evil threatening Iranian society. These values serve to protect Iran from foreign cultural influences and uphold principles of resistance.\n### Norms\nPierre Pahlavi and Eric Ouellet observe that Iran has often seen itself as isolated and threatened by neighboring countries due to its unique status as the only Persian-speaking, Shia nation in a predominantly Turkish--Arabic, Sunni region. This perception is exacerbated by the country's size, which makes it significant on the global stage but vulnerable to external threats. To cope with these challenges, Iran has historically pursued two strategic goals: protecting “fortress Iran” by maintaining economic autonomy and territorial integrity and expanding its regional influence as a buffer. While these objectives may seem contradictory, they are complementary and can be achieved through both offensive and detente strategies, transcending internal ideological differences.36 Such an ambiguous environment requires a specific set of norms and a distinct strategic culture that would govern the country's modus operandi.\nIndeed, according to some experts, IRI's strategic culture, influenced by the norms derived from both Persian culture and Shia Islam, includes the use\nof strategic ambiguity and deception, avoidance of frontal attacks, and soft power. When the country's interests are at stake, the strict tenets of Islamic jurisprudence can be abrogated under the concept of maslaha, or acting in the public interest.37 In addition, Kayhan Barzegar and Abdolrasool Divsallar speak about strategic patience, use of low-cost engagements, and diminishing rivals' margin to maneuver as the instruments that the current Iranian regime has masterfully applied for decades. Strategic patience is a deliberate postponement of decisions on critical national security issues, allowing Iran to buy time and conserve resources. This approach is particularly useful in situations where strategic limits exist and available resources are insufficient to counter them. Iranians, who lived under constant insecurity, practiced strategic patience as a means of avoiding emotional, reactionary decisions in the face of harsh conditions. Low-cost engagements, such as hybrid warfare and the use of proxies, are other aspects of norms that influence IRI's strategic culture. In countries like Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen, Iran has created a network of foreign fighters, military advisers, and local regime irregulars under Iranian advisory commands. Additionally, Iran employs a defensive strategy aimed at reducing its rivals' margin to maneuver by blocking their actions and limiting their choices. Called, since 2005, “mosaic defense doctrine,” this strategy includes the concept of “all-around defense,” which brings together all state, nonstate, and private actors to confront threats, and “strategic depth,” which involves creating security buffer zones to reduce the risk of direct attacks on Iranian territory. Anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) capabilities, which encompass military, informational, economic, and political measures, are used by Iran to disrupt adversaries' interests and reduce their choices, thereby raising the cost of any potential hostilities.38 Central to “mosaic doctrine” is the mobilization of a vast and dispersed militia force designed to engage invading forces in protracted, attritional warfare, thereby exhausting their resources and resolve.39\n### Perceptive Lens\nThe title of Graham Fuller's 1991 RAND Corporation study, The Center of the Universe, mirrors the perspective of the IRI's elites, who believe that Iran holds a natural, indispensable, and leading role in the Middle East and potentially the entire Muslim world.40 Such an inflated view of centrality and historic role of Iran is underlined by a deep-seated Iranian identity and a broadly shared historical awareness of Iran's power status in the region. Consequently, the occurrences that contradict these self-centered views may cause cognitive dissonance among Iranians. During his captivity as a hostage in the U.S. embassy in Tehran, following its takeover by Iranian “students” in November 1979, William Daugherty, then the Central Intelligence Agency\n(CIA) Chief of Station, noted that his captors struggled to comprehend and were personally offended by his inability to communicate in Persian, the language of what they considered such an important country as Iran.41 Experiences of victimization, insecurity, and feelings of inferiority have contributed to shaping Iran's sense of pride and significance. Initially, Iran was a nation of conquerors, but over time, it was invaded, conquered, and humbled by various powers, such as the Greeks, Arabs, Mongols, and Turks. The most recent manifestation of this victimization complex is linked to the British and Russian quasi-colonial domination of Iran from the nineteenth to the mid-twentieth centuries and the perceived American influence over Iran after World War II.42\nThe centuries of foreign domination had caused an acute sensitivity among Iranians about the role of foreigners in their culture and politics. Iranians believe, as Marvin Zonis emphasizes, that “[t]he rest of the world is somehow so taken with Iran's significance that it cannot let it go.”43 A siege mentality is fortified by real or presumed threats posed by both nearby and distant enemies. As a result, a pervasive culture of conspiracy thinking has emerged within Iranian society, with many viewing external forces as manipulating or undermining their nation's interests. This phenomenon bears a notable resemblance to the dynamics often attributed to the so-called Arab street. According to Fuller, “Rarely are events to be taken at face value, for to assume them as such is (a) to indicate ignorance of the superior forces around oneself or one's nation and (b) to demonstrate the stupidity, naivete, or insensitivity not to perceive the hidden motives of others.”44 Based on this logic, unanticipated events are not merely isolated incidents but rather the result of powerful external forces that dominate or control the situation. The most complex explanation of political events is usually preferred as the most likely, particularly when foreign powers are involved. While specific interpretations may differ based on individual ideological outlooks, the consensus is that it is naive to assume that a series of developments might be unrelated, particularly when a powerful foreign entity is involved.45\nOther cultural characteristics that have their roots in the prolonged periods of insecurity and foreign rule are a general wariness toward those outside one's intimate circle, particularly authority figures and foreigners, as well as a tendency toward cunning or astuteness. As life is perceived as an unpredictable game of chance, where both favorable and unfavorable opportunities arise and vanish without warning, people outside the inner cycle are considered as inherently malevolent, power-hungry, and irrational. There is a lack of trust in interpersonal relationships and altruistic motives are often looked at with suspicion.46 The mistrust leads to the necessity for manipulation in the struggle for survival, “empty and meaningless adulation,” and consequently, an expectation that others will also attempt to manipulate.47 Consequently, the\nfigure of the clever dissimulator, or zeræng, emerges. As described by William Beeman, zeræng is “[a]n operation on the part of an adroit operator that involves thwarting direct interpretation of his own actions or deliberately leading others to erroneous interpretation of those actions while being able to successfully interpret the actions of others.”48 Albeit being an inherently negative trait, it is, nevertheless, highly admired by Iranians as they see cleverness and wiliness as essential strategies for navigating and overcoming stronger forces.49 However, the reliance on zeræng, combined with the ingrained insecurity and anxiety about being deceived by strangers, can sometimes result in Iranian actors overplaying their hand in diplomacy, business dealings, and military activities.\nIn conclusion, the analysis of Iranian strategic culture based on four variables—identity, values, norms, and perceptive lens—demonstrates that Iran's identity is a fusion of nationality and religion, with a strong sense of exceptionalism and historical continuity. The values that emerged after the Islamic Revolution are deeply rooted in a Manichean worldview, pitting good against evil, with the West representing the forces of evil. The perceptive lens of Iran's elites is inflated, believing that Iran's indispensable and leading role in the Middle East and potentially the entire Muslim world would somehow compensate for technological deficiencies.\n## Building the Digital Wall: Iran's Cybersecurity Architecture\n### The Cyber Posture of Small States\nCyberspace is a complex and multifaceted concept, encompassing various subconcepts and nuanced definitions. Rain Ottis and Peeter Lorents describe cyberspace as “a time-dependent set of interconnected information systems and the human users that interact with these systems,” stressing a dynamic nature of cyberspace, where significant changes can occur rapidly, in a shorter time frame than other time-dependent systems.50\nCyberspace is widely considered offense-dominant, inferring that it is easier to execute attacks than to defend against them. Offensive dominance in cyberspace is due to varied and rapidly evolving attack vectors, which defenders struggle to keep up with. Such an asymmetry is in favor of an attacker, as offensive cyber capabilities are perceived to be resource-efficient compared to defensive measures, which are costly and often lag behind technological advancements.51 In parallel, traditional deterrence models face challenges in cyberspace due to difficulties in attribution and the covert nature of cyber capabilities. The anonymity and rapid execution of cyberattacks undermine the effectiveness of deterrence, which relies on the threat of assured retaliation. A key challenge in implementing cyber deterrence is the need for a strong system of protection as the first step, but\nmany countries prioritize offensive operations over defense, neglecting defense and resilience, instead focusing on offensive methods to deter adversaries.52 The system-wide framework analysis that focuses on the broadest dynamics and the systemic cyber risks inherent to the internet may be worth considering. It addresses both top-down factors, such as insecure technical standards, and bottom-up, emergent effects, like the spread of insecure Internet of Things (IoT) devices. This framework encompasses the full spectrum of attacks, including nation-state disruptions, espionage, cybercrime, and even hacking driven by curiosity or entertainment. Within this context, the tools, methods, and activities of offensive and defensive operations are relatively distinct.53\nHowever, the true destructive potential of cyber operations remains uncertain and a subject of ongoing speculation and debate within the cybersecurity community. As Torbjørn Pedersen notes,54 the initial anticipation of a “modern Pearl Harbor” or upcoming global cyberwars has given way to a more nuanced understanding of the limitations of cyber operations expressed in the article by Thomas Rid, “Cyber War Will Not Take Place.”55 According to Lennart Maschmeyer, cyber operations face an operational trilemma, where the three variables of speed, intensity of effect, and control are negatively correlated. This means that, in most cases, cyber operations will be either too slow, too low in intensity, or too unreliable to provide significant strategic utility.56 Overall, however, both opponents and proponents of cyberwar agree that cyberspace offers new methods of undermining national power by achieving strategic impact through ongoing campaigns of covert, less violent cyber operations with cumulative effects.57\nThe cyber capabilities of small states, defined by limited resources and smaller populations, are primarily focused on defensive measures. This is due to constraints in funding, a lack of specialized expertise and intelligence resources, and the high costs involved in developing advanced offensive tools. The notion that cyber capabilities provide an asymmetric advantage to weaker states is contested, as evidence suggests that powerful states with advanced resources are better positioned to exploit cyber operations.58 Jon Lindsay cites the Stuxnet operation of 2009--2010 as a prime example, when a malicious code penetrated the Iranian nuclear facility in Natanz, wiping out around 1,000 centrifuges. Although specific details about the Stuxnet operation's time frame and effects still remain obscure, Lindsay argues that this incident demonstrates that cyber capabilities do not automatically grant an advantage to weaker states. He emphasizes that small states encounter significant challenges in weaponizing cyber capabilities to inflict substantial damage.59 All these challenge the notion of asymmetric advantage of weaker adversaries in the cyberdomain proposed by some, suggesting instead that cyber capabilities tend to favor powerful states.60\nSmall states often adopt a technology-oriented strategic culture and focus on enhancing their defensive measures to protect their critical infrastructure and maintain national security. The effectiveness of cyber strategies varies among states, with some successfully integrating them into their national security frameworks, while others struggle to recognize the opportunities and threats associated with increased cyber engagement. However, small states often adopt several common strategies to compensate for their limited resources and cyber capabilities. These strategies may include:61 Cyber hygiene programs: Investing in national cyber hygiene programs to educate citizens and businesses about basic cybersecurity practices. This involves developing cybersecurity curricula in educational institutions, conducting regular training programs for government and private sector employees, and fostering a culture of cyber awareness. In Iran's case, this approach took the form of creating a “halal net,” a locally controlled version of the internet designed to limit public access to information. Incident response teams: Establishing national Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) or Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) to handle and coordinate responses to cyber incidents. Legislation and policy frameworks: Setting up robust legislative and policy frameworks. These frameworks set out the roles and responsibilities of various stakeholders and establish protocols for incident response and information sharing. Investment in technology: Despite resource limitations, small states are increasingly investing in advanced cyber defense technologies, such as intrusion detection systems, encryption, and secure communication platforms to protect critical infrastructure. Public--private partnerships often play a key role in supporting national cybersecurity strategies, provided there is a skilled workforce and organizational infrastructure to effectively utilize these technologies. Additionally, the absence of economic and technological sanctions mechanisms is crucial, as it allows these states to acquire the necessary technologies without significant barriers.Cyber defense alliances, collaboration, and information sharing with other states, international organizations, and private sector partners to enhance cyber defense capabilities.\nPutting the cyber capabilities of small states in the context of strategic culture, Francis Domingo introduced the concept of “technology-oriented” strategic culture, which refers to small states' inclination to rely on technology as a strategy to overcome limited resources, military capabilities, and strategic depth.62 In this context, technology serves as an enabler for states to pursue foreign policy objectives in a more deliberate and strategic manner. A technology-oriented strategic culture can be identified by examining three key implications for small states: High network readiness: Small states with a technology-oriented strategic culture prioritize the development and maintenance of advanced communication\nnetworks, data systems, and digital infrastructure to enhance their overall connectivity and readiness. Technology-driven military force: These states invest in technology-driven military capabilities, such as advanced weapon systems, unmanned aerial vehicles, and cyberwarfare tools, to augment their military power and strategic reach. Relevance of cybersecurity: Cybersecurity becomes a critical concern for small states with a technology-oriented strategic culture, as they recognize the potential risks and vulnerabilities associated with their reliance on technology. As a result, they prioritize the protection of their digital infrastructure and critical data to ensure their national security and maintain their strategic advantages.63\nIran offers an intriguing case study, as its strategic culture, characterized by its identity, values, norms, and perceptual lens, aligns closely with the defensive cybersecurity posture of many small states. The emphasis on resistance, strategic patience, ambiguity, and low-cost engagements constitutes Iran's approach to cyberspace, reflecting broader trends seen in the cyber strategies of small states. However, over the past decade, Iran has significantly stepped up its offensive cyber capabilities, elevating itself, according to some estimates, to the top of the second tier of global cyberpowers, with aspirations to join the leaders.64\n### Iranian Cyber Capabilities\nIran's initial steps to build its defensive cyber capabilities can be traced back to 2003, when units specializing in cybersecurity were set up within several ministries.65 A 2010 wake-up call occurred with the Stuxnet operation, followed by the “Wiper” and “Flame” malicious code attacks, solidifying the regime's understanding that Iran's adversaries possess a distinct qualitative advantage in offensive cyber activities. By 2016, Iran's cyber capabilities budget was reportedly over USD 1 billion (vs. USD 76 million in 2011), compared to the USD 2 billion budget of the United Kingdom, one of the world's leading cyberpowers. According to Iranian data, the country's cyber budget experienced a twelvefold increase between 2013 and 2021. By the late 2010s, approximately 18% of Iranian university students were studying computer science. Additionally, compulsory military service was utilized to direct technologically skilled graduates toward the state security apparatus, including the MOIS and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC),66 while the topic of cyber defense entered the high school textbook Preparation for Defense.67\nIn March 2012, the Supreme Council of Cyberspace, under the direction of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, was established. The Council is headed by the Iranian President and includes 25 senior government representatives and other key figures, such as the senior commander of the\nIRGC; the head of the Majlis; the Ministers of Science, Communications and Culture; the chief of police; and the president of the Islamic Propaganda Organization. The Council has the power to establish national cyber policy, and its decisions are mandatory for all Iranian institutions operating in the field.68 The National Center for Cyberspace, which is the main division of the Council, is responsible for comprehensive domestic and international surveillance, enforcing the enactments of the council, and preventing Iranians from accessing virtual private networks (VPNs) and internet proxies, which are used to bypass Iran's internet controls.69\nVarious organizations monitor and protect Iran's cyberspace infrastructure. All of them are affiliated with different government institutions and operate in different fields. A key defensive organization within this structure is the Cyberspace Defense Command, which functions under the Passive Defense Organization of the general staff of the armed forces. This organization is made up of both military personnel and representatives from the Communications, Defense, Intelligence, and Industry ministries. Its primary goal is to establish a comprehensive defensive strategy for safeguarding state institutions and infrastructures from potential cyber threats. The Cyberspace Defense Command is primarily focused on defense and does not appear to be engaged in offensive cyber activities. Another defensive entity within Iran's cyberspace structure is the Center for Information Security, also known as MAHER. This center is established and operated under the Communications and Information Technologies Ministry and is primarily responsible for activating computer security incident response teams during emergencies and cyberattacks. Furthermore, MAHER trains skilled manpower, develops response mechanisms for cyber crises, and stores and disseminates data security know-how. The center is responsible for defending all government websites, as well as those of private companies that are officially registered with the Communications Ministry.70 The Committee for Identifying Unauthorized Sites and FATA (an acronym for the Police for the Sphere of the Production and Exchange of Information) act as Iran's cyber police, overseeing internet usage for both domestic suppression and countering cybercrime.71 The IRGC runs its cyber operations, both defensive and offensive, through the IRGC Cyber-Electronic Command (IRGC-CEC), which is headquartered at the Ammar Cyberspace Base.72\nRegarding Iran's offensive cyber capabilities, the IRGC and MOIS are responsible for conducting both independent and joint offensive operations against perceived and real threats to Iranian national security. Among these two entities, the IRGC undoubtedly takes the lead. Its Electronic Warfare and Cyber Defense Organization offers training courses in cyber defense, restricts access to online content, and censors digital communications in Iranian cyberspace73 and “bears primary responsibility for offensive cyber\noperations.”74 By 2009, the IRGC started enlisting professionals for its internal cyberforce, as well as the closely associated military unit known as the Iranian Cyber Army (ICA). That same year, the Basij Cyber Council, another cyber entity overseen by the IRGC, revealed that it had trained 1,500 cybersecurity specialists. These professionals were prepared to join the IRGC's expanding offensive operations and espionage division. In 2010, the Basij cyber unit's leaders publicly declared their intention to launch digital attacks targeted at the actions of the “Zionist Entity,” Israel.75 The IRGC trains, equips, and provides operational support in the cyberdomain to Iranian proxies such as Hezbollah. For instance, in 2021, the IRGC helped establish a cybersecurity unit within Hezbollah's counterintelligence service. In parallel, a cybertraining facility disguised as a branch of Tehran's Sharif University was opened in Dahiye, in the southern suburbs of Beirut.76\nIran's cyberspace development is mainly driven by universities and technological institutes, with a focus on information technology (IT), computer engineering, and communications. Key institutions include Amirkabir University of Technology, Imam Hossein University, Shahid Beheshti University, and Sharif University of Technology. The Iranian government supports IT and computer communications companies through direct and indirect investments, with key government bodies being the Science Ministry, the Information and Communications Ministry, the Technology Cooperation Office, and hi-tech greenhouses like the Pardis Technology Park and Guilan Science and Technology Park.77 Furthermore, the universities play a crucial role in subcontracting cyber operations to front companies and individuals. Over the years, a tiered approach to cyber operations has developed within the Iranian intelligence landscape. At its core is a trusted network of middle managers—often university employees—who are ideologically aligned with the Iranian government and who translate intelligence priorities into segmented cyber tasks. These tasks are then bid out to multiple contractors, where about 50 organizations compete for regime-sponsored projects. The authorities compartmentalize tasks, often requiring different contractors for various parts of a project, such as creating exploits and establishing unauthorized access. Payments are only made upon the completion of the task, as competition is fierce and contractors are pitted against each other. Characteristic in this context is the case of Monica Witt—a former U.S. Air Force intelligence specialist who served in the Air Force from 1997 through 2008 and then with a defense contractor until 2010. Defecting to Iran in 2013, Witt leaked top-secret information to the Iranians, including the identities of U.S. intelligence agents and highly classified intelligence collection programs.78 In 2015, four Iranian hackers, coopted by the IRCG, targeted U.S. intelligence and military personnel in an unsophisticated and poorly executed cyber operation that ultimately failed.79\nAlthough Iran boasts a large network of IT professionals, the Islamic regime's inherent paranoia creates unique challenges. Those with the greatest offensive cyber skills and those demonstrating adherence to the government's ideology are usually mutually exclusive.80 Furthermore, the country is facing a significant brain drain, as many cybersecurity experts are leaving Iran at an alarming pace.\nCooperation with foreign actors, particularly China, North Korea, and Russia, has significantly contributed to Iran's cyber capabilities. In 2015, Russia and Iran signed the first cyber cooperation agreement, recognizing common threats in the cyberdomain. In 2017, a memorandum of understanding for cooperation on information and communication technology (ICT)--related issues, including “internet governance, network security,” and “international internet connection” was signed. In 2021, Russia and Iran concluded the agreement on information security aimed to coordinate activities in response to the growing importance of cyber issues in international relations and ICT-related crimes, as well as the creation of an Iranian “sovereign internet.”81 Since the beginning of the Ukraine conflict in 2022, Russia has supplied Iran with communication-surveillance capabilities, eavesdropping devices, advanced photography equipment, and lie detectors, and reportedly also shared more advanced software with Iran, enabling it to hack phones and systems of dissidents and adversaries. Protei Ltd. a Russian company specializing in communication monitoring tools, has started providing internet censorship software to the Iranian mobile services provider Ariantel. The Protei tools are believed to be part of a developing mobile phone system that would allow Iranian state authorities to directly monitor, intercept, redirect, degrade, or deny mobile communications.82 In 2021, Iranian cybersecurity company Lotus Gostar Arya (or Cysec) opened a branch in Kazan to foster cooperation and exchange of know-how between Iran and Russia.83\nOn 17 January 2025, Russia and Iran further solidified their partnership by signing the “Treaty on Comprehensive Strategic Partnership.” Article 4 of the treaty explicitly stipulates that the intelligence and security services of both nations “shall exchange information and experience and enhance the level of their cooperation.” This agreement is expected to further deepen collaboration in the cyber domain.84\nIn December 2010, the Chinese telecommunications firm ZTE Corp. sold a surveillance system to Iran's Telecommunication Co. of Iran (TCI) as part of a USD 130.6 million networking equipment contract. The surveillance system can monitor landline, mobile, and internet communications. TCI, which had at that time a near monopoly on Iran's landline telephone services, managed a significant portion of Iran's internet traffic.85 In 2019, China and Iran agreed to establish a joint workgroup to tackle cyber threats, emphasizing cooperation in IT, addressing cyber threats, and “counter[ing] U.S.\nunilateralism.”86 In 2009, a significant intelligence failure committed by the CIA occurred when a faulty web-based covert communications system used by the CIA in Iran was exposed, resulting in the arrest and execution of numerous CIA informants. The Iran events coincided with a similar setback in China in 2011 and 2012, where around 30 agents were apprehended and executed. Some officials suspected that the two nations might have collaborated, with Iran offering China technical information about the exposed communications system in exchange for equipment and expertise.87\nIn September 2012, Iran and North Korea signed a technology cooperation agreement, which allegedly included the cyberdomain.88 Iran potentially could have provided information on Stuxnet to North Korea, which ultimately prevented the Stuxnet-similar attack on the North Korean nuclear facility. A tightly controlled network and the inability of physical penetration of the facility to install the worm into the command systems might have also contributed to the failure.89\nTo conclude, Iran shares some defensive strategies with small states, such as resource constraints and the high costs associated with developing sophisticated offensive tools. Iran's investment in education and the development of technological expertise is consistent with the technology-oriented strategic culture described by Domingo. In a similar vein, the country's emphasis on training and harnessing its human capital shows how smaller states leverage technology to compensate for limited resources. The programs focusing on cyber hygiene, incident response teams, and legislative frameworks also mirror the defensive strategies typically adopted by small states.\nHowever, unlike many small states that focus primarily on defense, Iran has developed substantial offensive cyber capabilities. Organizations like the IRGC-CEC and ICA actively engage in offensive operations, targeting both regional adversaries and global entities. This level of offensive capability is more characteristic of larger, more powerful states. The integration of foreign expertise and technology, such as surveillance systems and cybersecurity tools, underscores Iran's ability to leverage international partnerships to bolster its cyber posture. The extent and sophistication of Iran's offensive operations, including cyberespionage and attacks, distinguish it from the typical small-state cyber posture, which often lacks the resources to develop such capabilities. Iran's cyber budget and institutional support structures, including the Supreme Cyberspace Council, are substantial compared to those of typical small states. The scale of investment and the comprehensive nature of its cyber governance framework indicate a level of state commitment that exceeds what is usually seen in smaller states with limited resources.\nSuch a combination of defensive focus, substantial offensive capacity, extensive foreign partnerships, and significant state investment makes Iran a unique player in the cyber landscape of small states.\nLEAKED INSIGHTS: IRAN'S CYBERDFENSE LANDSCAPE AND STRATEGIC CULTURE\nOver the last decade, Iran has been actively building a multifaceted cyber defense system to safeguard its critical infrastructure, suppress opposition groups, and block perceived harmful content, all aimed at maintaining the regime's stability. Guided by the Supreme Council of Cyberspace, Iran's numerous governmental agencies have been at the forefront of the implementation of this strategy. Despite such a concerted effort, the Iranian state organizations, including the MOIS, have been regularly experiencing high-impact leaks. For instance, since 2017 and into 2019, self-declared Iranian dissident groups—such as Lab Dookhtegan, Green Leakers, Black Box, and Hidden Reality—have emerged as “mystery groups” with unclear origins and affiliations.90 Over time, these groups have built reputations as reliable sources of information, exposing Iranian intelligence and military operations both within Iran and across the Middle East.91\nThe agencies tasked with cyber defense, although numerous and mature, are, as it seems, still lacking capabilities and know-how to fully prevent high-impact breaches. The researchers inside Iran have pointed out a number of weak points in the Iranian cyber defense. Hassan Monfared, writing about the cyberwarfare of the Iranian armed forces, finds that they lack a comprehensive view of cyber defense and highlights the need for a systematic approach to stabilize and improve cyber combat readiness across the army ranks.92 Shafiee et al. from Passive Defense Organization see the need to improve management of public opinion through cyberspace and identify several psychological operations techniques aimed at improving the image of the army and countering adversaries' psychological operations.93 Similarly, Mohammad Tabatabaei and Ehsan Movahedian in their study of the U.S cyber influence operations against Iran's internet users stress a gap in Iran's ability to counter foreign cyber influence effectively.94 Abolfazl and Mahdi Rohani stress cyberspace's dual nature as both a threat and opportunity and propose a catalog of measures to effectively managing and mitigating cyber threats. Interestingly enough, the measures proposed by the researchers are strikingly similar to those revealed in the leaked documents discussed below. They include strengthening the Supreme Council of Cyberspace and the National Cyber Space Center's role as the country's cyber focal point; enhancing capabilities of organizations such as the ICA; developing a local internet industry and broadband ecosystem; strengthening local entrepreneurs active in cyberdomain; and more active utilization of cyberspace for conflict, war, competition, and information operations against adversaries.95 Very insightful in this context is the confidential letter produced by Ali Asghar Qaimi, the advisor in the field of communication and IT, security, and cyber defense, to the speaker of the Iranian parliament,\nMohammad Bagher Ghalibaf.96 In it, Qaimi lists sixteen “challenges” faced by the Iranian cyber defense as of January 2024. Among them are: big differences in the quality of online infrastructure in various government bodies; existence of uncovered vulnerabilities and planted backdoors; lack of proper monitoring and action plans to locate and fix vulnerabilities; widespread attempts to cover up problems, incidents, and cyberattacks; lack of organizational discipline within the agencies responsible for vital and sensitive infrastructure; shortage of skilled personnel in the fields of security and cyber defense; utilization of unsuitable external cyber defense products in the vital infrastructure; the multiplicity of decisionmaking authorities and their interference, leading to the adoption of often contradictory decisions; brain drain of cybersecurity experts; and the long and exhausting process of obtaining security licenses and qualifications for individuals and private security companies.97 Qaimi concludes that, because many organizations in Iran fail to meet minimum security requirements, one should expect further cyberattacks, disclosure of information, and disruption of services in the future.98 To sum up, the challenges faced by Iran's cyber defense system, as outlined by Iranian researchers, highlight significant gaps in infrastructure, personnel, and overall preparedness, painting a troubling picture of the country's vulnerability to cyber threats. These weaknesses are also mirrored in a letter by Qaimi that lists several critical deficiencies, providing a realistic view on the current situation with cyber defense.\nThe analysis of the leaked documents begins with the four-year plan, classified as “secret,” laid down on 23 July 2021, by new Minister of Intelligence Hojjat al-Islam Seyyed Ismail Khatib. Although the document tackles the challenges and priorities related to cybersecurity, it does not explicitly describe the current state of cybersecurity in the country. Nevertheless, it highlights the significance of modernizing intelligence infrastructure to address cyber threats effectively, including monitoring, prevention, and capacity building in cyber.99 It also emphasizes the importance of protecting critical infrastructure, combating cyberespionage, and enhancing cooperation with international partners in cybersecurity efforts. The document refers to “the concrete operational plans” that need to be put in place based on the resolutions by the Supreme Council of Cyberspace.100\nIn addition to the four-year plan that due to its programmatic nature tackles the topic of cyber without sufficient depth, six other documents, all of which explicitly focus on various aspects of cybersecurity, will be analyzed using a framework of seven interconnected themes. These themes, which have been consistently addressed in all documents, provide a comprehensive understanding of Iran's approach to cybersecurity:Governance and regulatory framework,National Information Network,\n.International engagement and cyber diplomacy,Control over information flows and protection of Islamic-Iranian identity,Economic and technological integration within the cyberdomain,Human resources and workforce development, andCybersecurity infrastructure and cyber protective mechanisms.\n### Governance and Regulatory Framework\nThe importance of the Supreme Council of Cyberspace as the main body responsible for Iran's cyberdomain has been stressed in all documents. The decisions of the Council must be considered binding and be implemented by all organizations, including the office of the prosecutor and the courts.101 The Council also plays a crucial role in determining the budgetary spending on cybersecurity and monitoring measures to protect Iran's critical infrastructure.102 It is interesting to note in this context that the performance of the National Center for Cyberspace, which is controlled by the Council, is regularly assessed based on the principles of good governance (salamat-e edari).103\n### National Information Network\nEstablishing a “reliable, safe, stable, integrated, and extensive infrastructure throughout the country based on the National Information Network”104 that would enable the regime to “[r]educe as much as possible access to unauthorized foreign platforms”105 is seen as one of the most important priorities monitored by the Council. The Ministry of Communications and Information Technology was entrusted with the responsibility of connecting at least 80% of the country's households and businesses to the National Information Network by the end of 2023.106 In the foreseeable future, Iran's satellite infrastructure and the National Information Network should be integrated, further solidifying the country's digital autonomy and enhancing its cybersecurity capabilities.107\n### International Engagement and Cyber Diplomacy\nIn the international arena, Iran pursues two goals in the cyberdomain: first, to expand cooperation with allied and friendly nations, especially Islamic countries,108 as well as to “[a]chieve an active, strong, and purposeful presence in regional and international assemblies and institutions.”109 Second, Iran seeks to strengthen its position as a formidable cyberpower, leveraging international bodies as deterrent mechanisms in its cyberspace.110 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs plays a major role in setting up a “cyber space diplomacy system,” as well as assisting other state agencies in dealing with international organizations.111\n###\nControl over Information Flows and Protection of Islamic--Iranian Identity\nProtecting the Islamic--Iranian identity and lifestyle is a crucial aspect of cyber defense in Iran. Consequently, the country regulates social media presence in accordance with its laws and values. The Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance plays a significant role in this regard, responsible for registering official accounts, closing fake accounts, and blocking unauthorized advertisements of foreign social networks.112 As a countermeasure to potential threats in the digital space, content providers in Iran are required to promote the “discourse of the Islamic Revolution” and contribute to the creation of a “new Islamic civilization in cyberspace.”113 Government employees are forbidden from being present on “unauthorized social media platforms” without permission and required to follow guidelines and regulations if they are present on “approved” platforms.114\n### Economic and Technological Integration within the Cyberdomain\nIn the field of economic and technological integration within the cyberdomain, Iran pursues a twofold strategy—increasing the share of domestic products and services in cybersecurity, and supporting local providers. Thus, the need to double the local content of products and services has been emphasized time and again in different strategic documents.115 In parallel, the share of the digital segment in the Iranian economy is planned to reach 10% by 2031,116 while some suggest that the same share should be set at 20% of the Gross Domestic Product.117 Support of the local providers of products and services is considered vital. Several authors recommend that authorities make “[m]aximum usage of private cyber security contractors”118 and “support companies, particularly in the fields of security systems, locally-built browsers, and national messengers.”119\n### Human Resources and Workforce Development\nIn addition, it is considered crucial to address the need to establish criteria for recruiting, retaining, and protecting experts in the cybersecurity domain, as such plans require careful design and implementation.120 The salaries of cybersecurity specialists should be increased and the issue of brain drain requires urgent attention.121 Furthermore, the cybersecurity literacy among government employees needs to be addressed through internal training and specialized courses.122 The number of student admissions in cybersecurity-related fields also needs to be expanded.123 The goal is to create a reservoir of skilled and efficient cybersecurity experts, thereby gaining a strategic advantage for Iran in this area.124\nCybersecurity Infrastructure and Cyber Protective Mechanisms\nIran's cyber defense strategy has, over the decade, evolved as a multifaceted approach that includes regular assessments, clear role assignments, and a catalogue of proactive measures. The establishment and continuous development of cybersecurity measures within all state institutions are considered critical in safeguarding national security. The institutions are obliged to create and implement comprehensive cyberspace security plans to prevent, combat, and manage cyber incidents,125 including cyber drills.126 Additionally, regular evaluations and situational reports mandated to assess the fulfillment of cybersecurity tasks must be submitted to the Supreme Council of Cyberspace.127 Nongovernmental institutions are also urged to organize and enhance their cybersecurity capabilities.128\nAccording to the top-secret document of April 2023, the task of guarding Iran's cyber borders was at that time the responsibility of the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology. However, the document complains that this mission is not logically aligned with the Ministry's posture in protecting Iran's communication and information infrastructure. As a result, the role of the armed forces and the country's intelligence agencies in this area has been overlooked. Hence, it was necessary to reevaluate the legal framework for cyber border protection and consider assigning this important task to an organization that is better equipped to handle it. In addition, a plethora of organizations responsible for cyber defense, including the Passive Defense Organization, the Center for Information Security, and the cyber police (FATA), have overlapping responsibilities. This requires a clear definition of their roles and duties, particularly in their relations to the armed forces, the IRGC, and the Ministry of Intelligence.129 Furthermore, the general staff of the armed forces was “[t]asked to prepare a national program to prevent and address defense-security threats posed by unauthorized satellite systems for Iranian cyber space.”130\nThe insights gained from the documents examined in this section underline the key premises of strategic culture defined earlier. The overall structure of Iran's cyber governance is heavily centralized, reflecting Iran's historical preference for a strong, centralized leadership, which is seen as necessary to maintain order and control in a complex and multifaceted society. The country's commitment to reducing foreign dependence and fostering a self-reliant digital economy aligns with the drive toward self-sufficiency and autonomy as seen through historical experience of invasions and influence from foreign powers. In the eternal struggle between virtue and evil, a dwindling human capital in the cyberdomain needs to be exploited and protected to advance the country's strategic interests, as the entire society should remain resilient, in line with the values of vigilance and resistance against external threats. Internationally, Iran considers itself a leader of the\nIslamic world that stays firm in the face of Western influence. By leveraging international bodies as deterrent mechanisms, the regime attempts to project power and protect its interests in cyberspace. Iran's dual strategy of enhancing domestic cybersecurity capabilities while also striving for technological independence and integration into the global cyberdomain mirrors its cultural emphasis on adaptability to secure the country's position in a complex and competitive international environment. The role of cultural and media institutions in cyberspace is critical for the regime, as their task is to promote the dual elements of Iranian identity—nationality and religion. Such an emphasis on aligning cyber content with Islamic principles demonstrates the intertwining of religious ideology with national identity, as it reinforces the regime's narrative and counters foreign cultural influence.\nFinally, while concrete data are lacking, it is reasonable to infer that the multidecade economic and technological sanctions imposed on Iran have significantly affected its cyber defense capabilities, influencing both its strategy and the evolution of its cyber infrastructure. These sanctions have severely limited Iran's ability to acquire advanced cyber defense technologies, as restrictions on access to key software, hardware, and encryption technologies hinder the country's efforts to build a sophisticated cybersecurity infrastructure. A comprehensive analysis examining the impact of sanctions on Iran's cyber defense capabilities would be a fascinating subject for further study, shedding light on the consequences of such restrictions and their potential long-term effects on a nation's ability to protect itself in the cyber realm.\n## CONCLUSION\nA strategic culture that shaped Iranian perceptions, values, and norms has its roots in Persian culture and Shia Islam. Iran's historical experiences of conquest and foreign domination have led to a siege mentality, conspiracy thinking, and the admiration of cunning and manipulation. Besides, a unique blend of historical experiences and geostrategic positions have shaped Iran's sense of identity and its perception of exceptionalism and superiority. Some Iranian authors even advance the notion of “geopolitical superiority,” arguing that Iran's strategic positioning and its “geographical gravity” can somehow compensate for its technological deficiencies—a belief that underestimates the role of and need for technological advancement in the face of modern threats and evolving security dynamics.131\nConsequently, these specific operational codes, histories, and assumptions of strategic culture have a significant influence on the country's cyber defense posture, characterized by heightened sensitivity to cyberattacks by hostile actors. The Stuxnet attack was probably a pivotal moment that revealed Iran's vulnerabilities to advanced cyber threats from hostile actors and solidified the Manichean worldview of ruling elites about perceived external\nthreats, especially those emanating from the West. Over the last decade, Iran adopted a multifaceted approach to safeguarding infrastructure, suppressing opposition, and countering foreign influence. Iran has achieved a unique position in the cyber landscape that is characterized by a mix of defensive focus, offensive capabilities, partnerships with allied states, and significant state investment. The country's comprehensive cyber strategy and governance framework position it as a formidable player, blending characteristics of both small and larger states.\nOver the last few years, Iranian-affiliated cyber threat actors have demonstrated the ability to execute sustained, complex, and disruptive operations across multiple sectors outside of Iran. These groups frequently utilize advanced tactics, techniques, and procedures, continuously refining their strategies to avoid detection and maintain access to compromised networks. The coordination among these actors and their shared use of resources and tools demonstrate a unified effort to support Iran's geopolitical aims. Their ongoing use of destructive malware, ransomware, and espionage operations underscores the threat they pose, particularly in the context of regional tensions and global political events. Thus, Iran was one of the most assertive foreign actors attempting to create discord ahead of the 2024 U.S. presidential elections. Iranian operatives have launched influence operations targeting U.S. audiences, potentially aiming to sway the outcome of the elections. This cyber-enabled influence campaign is being driven by a mix of actors conducting preliminary cyber reconnaissance and inserting online personas and websites into the information ecosystem. In June 2024, hackers linked to the IRGC successfully infiltrated the Trump campaign, stealing internal documents and leaking them to media outlets.132\nIn the cyber defensive domain, the leaked documents mostly confirm the conclusions derived from the sources available in the public domain. The materials show that Iran has developed a multifaceted cyber defense system aimed at protecting its critical infrastructure, controlling information, and maintaining regime stability. The Supreme Council of Cyberspace oversees this strategy, coordinating efforts across various governmental agencies. Highly centralized cyber governance aims at strengthening the country's self-reliance and reducing foreign dependence, aligning with Iran's strategic culture of resistance to external influences. Internationally, Iran's posture is marked by adaptability and resilience to secure its position in the global cyberdomain. However, despite the extensive cyber defense measures, Iran still faces significant challenges, such as weaknesses in comprehensive defense strategies, management of public opinion, and countering foreign influence operations. Numerous high-impact leaks experienced by Iranian state organizations revealed persistent issues with infrastructure quality, cyber threat monitoring, and organizational discipline.\nROLE OF STRATEGIC CULTURE IN IRAN'S CYBER DEFENSE POLICY\n\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author.",

This culture combines a strong national pride and historical consciousness with values centered on resisting external influences. Ultimately, strategic culture has influenced the country’s cyber capabilities, which have significantly evolved since 2003, largely due to state investment and the establishment of the Supreme Council of Cyberspace in 2012. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and the Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS) lead offensive cyber operations, making Iran’s cyber posture more aligned with larger state powers than typical small states. Leaked documents from the Iranian opposition disclosed that Iran has actively developed a comprehensive cyber defense framework over the past decade to protect its critical infrastructure, quell opposition, and control presumed harmful content to maintain regime stability. Despite these efforts, leaks from dissident groups have exposed persistent weaknesses in Iran’s cyber defense, highlighting challenges in infrastructure, threat monitoring, and organizational discipline. Moreover, these leaks reveal Iran’s strategic focus on self-reliance and resistance to foreign influence.\nDr. Grigorij Serscikov is an Independent Researcher and Consultant with over fifteen years of experience in offering strategic advice and analysis to companies within the energy and financial sectors. He earned his master’s degree in Crisis and Security Management from Leiden University and a Ph.D. from the University of Dundee. Several of his articles were published in this journal. The author can be contacted at greg.serscikov@gmail.com.\n© 2025 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC AND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE VOLUME 38, NUMBER 2 On 26 January 2022, a Persian-speaking group called “GhyamSarnegouni,” which translates as “Rebellion to Overthrow,” established a Telegram account and began leaking internal documents, including many classified as “secret” or “top secret.”1 The group with alleged ties to the leading Iranian opposition movement Mojahedin-e Khalq (MEK), currently based in Albania, claimed that it gained access to 120 servers connected to late President Ebrahim Raisi's internal network and central databases, encompassing more than 1,300 computers.2 As of this publication, the group continues to release internal documents.\nWhile the Iranian authorities called the hack “fake,” experts have confirmed its legitimacy.3 The author is aware that the authenticity of the trove could always be questioned due to the sensitivity of the topic for national security and the lack of comparable materials in the public domain. However, the credibility of the leaked documents—that is, the context in which the documents were produced and the intentions of the authors who wrote them4—although it invites certain skepticism, does not currently challenge its validity. Similarly, the representativeness of the papers is established through the sheer volume of the leaked materials on the various topics of Iranian internal and external policies. Therefore, while the authenticity of the documents may be subject to debate, their credibility and representativeness are well established, providing a solid foundation for the research.\nAmong the wealth of primary sources made available to the public, there were several related to Iran's cyber defense strategies, providing researchers with insights into the country's cybersecurity programs. One key document is titled, “The Program Proposed by the Minister of Intelligence Hojjat al-Islam wal-Muslimeen Seyyed Ismail Khatib for the 13th government Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, 23 July 2021”5—the newly appointed head of the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence (MOIS).6 In it, Khatib outlined his vision for the evolution of the MOIS over the next four years, addressing inter alia issues related to Iranian cybersecurity. Other documents that will be examined in this study are: “The Ninety-Fourth Session of the Supreme Council of the Country's Cyber Space of 16 August 2023,”7 “The Ninety-Second Meeting of the Supreme Council of Cyberspace of June 27, 2023,”8 “Parts One and Two of the Strategic Document of the Islamic Republic of Iran on Cyber Space of July 14, 2021,”9 “Requirements and Measures Related to the Use of Satellite Systems in Cyberspace of 30 August 2022,”10 “Opinion Regarding the Promotion of the Cyber Space of 9 April 2023,”11 and “The Letter of the Advisor to the Speaker of the Parliament in the Field of Communication and Information Technology, Security and Cyber Defense of 16 January 2024.”12 Furthermore, Persian-language academic journals published in Iran, such as The Quarterly Journal of Multidisciplinary Studies for Strategic Knowledge, Strategic Studies Quarterly, and The Quarterly of Political Strategic Studies have been tackling the themes related to cybersecurity for almost a decade. Rarely quoted in the West, these publications, whose authors are often affiliated with the country's intelligence and military community, provide an outside-in perspective on the topic and, as will be shown, significantly complement primary sources.\nIranian cyber defense will be examined within the framework of a case study approach—a reliable and often-used methodology to explore the case's “why” and/or “how” questions in situations of complex causality where the researcher has limited control.13 This approach will be further strengthened through a detailed and systematic analysis of the leaked documents, which will play a central role in the research. By integrating the insights derived from the documents, the case study method enables the researcher to achieve high levels of “conceptual validity”—the identification of the most representative features within the specific context of Iranian cyber defense.14 The concept of strategic culture will be applied as a theoretical avenue for the analysis. First appearing in the late 1970s,15 the idea has experienced several waves of scholarly attention since then.16 Johnson and Larsen define strategic culture as “[a] set of shared beliefs, assumptions, and modes of behavior, derived from common experiences and accepted narratives (both oral and written), that shape collective identity and relationships to other groups, and which determine appropriate ends and means for achieving security objectives.”17 A country's strategic culture is not randomly chosen or influenced by intellectual trends. It is shaped by the character and context of its society and becomes, in the views of Jeremy Black, a “cultural assumption” that fits the nation's strategic needs and influences its strategic behavior.18 Strategic culture, which is rooted in historical experiences, can evolve but cannot be easily discarded. It is a crucial factor in a country's strategic effectiveness, but it is not infinitely adaptable. Radical changes in culture only occur as a result of significant political, social, or military shocks. Strategic cultures borrow and adapt from one another, but this process has its limits.\nThe concept of strategic culture is highly suitable for the analysis of cybersecurity and cyberwarfare. For instance, the study prepared for the U.S. Cyber Command applied the notion of strategic culture as a theoretical foundation to build four case studies, one of them Iran.19 The author believes that the concept offers an additional advantage for this research, as it allows for deriving further insights and drawing implications from the primary and secondary sources as well as tracing the development of Iran's strategies to cybersecurity in general and cyber defense in particular during a specific period.20 ROLE OF STRATEGIC CULTURE IN IRAN'S CYBER DEFENSE POLICY # IRANIAN STRATEGIC CULTURE Strategic culture faces the challenge of not having a clear collection of principles or a well-established theoretical framework. The common ground for strategic culture generally involves acknowledging culture as an epiphenomenal factor in the examination of foreign policy and security choices.[21] However, this can be complicated by the fact that strategic culture is not a one-size-fits-all concept. Every actor possesses its own operational code, history, assumptions, and strategic culture. To develop a more streamlined research model, it is necessary to narrow national culture variables to those that consistently impact the actor's policy and hold significant value for that specific culture. For this study, a four-variable model suggested by Jeannie Johnson will be adopted, offering valuable insights for the analysis of Iranian strategic culture. The four variables are:",
    "# Identity": "Iranian identity is a complex and multifaceted concept influenced by various factors, such as political values, historical experiences, religion, and geographical location. The Islamic Republic of Iran (IRI) has an identity that is defined by the elements of \"nationality\" and \"religion,\" with the weight and importance of these elements fluctuating over time.[23] The distinctive Persian identity has thrived despite many invasions, with the Iranians adopting some of the invaders' ways but adapting them to be more Persian than not.[24] This sense of identity and pride stems from the cultural continuity that has been maintained over time. At the same time, they also manifest themselves in a sense of superiority and exceptionalism over neighboring countries and peoples.[25] Iran's geography has played a crucial role in its history as a land that has been home to various nomads, invaders, and settlers from surrounding areas. Settled within confines between the Caspian Sea in the north and the Persian Gulf in the south, and enclosed by the\nAND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE VOLUME 38, NUMBER 2\nmountains of Zagros and Alborz, these groups were able to live in relative isolation for extended periods, leading to the emergence of numerous ethnic, religious, tribal, and other groupings that often found reasons to be in conflict with one another.26 According to Pollack, “Because of the discrete separation of so much of the population, Iran became a patchwork of ethnic, religious, tribal, and other groupings, all of whom seemed to find constant reasons for conflict with their neighbors.”27\nThe Islamic Revolution enhanced Iran's sense of exceptionalism and created a potent mixture of religious ideology and deep-seated nationalism.28 Willis Stanley underscores that:“[t]he current Iranian leadership appears to have recognizable goals derived from its unique political ideology, which makes use of Shia Islam's gradual consolidation of a clerical caste and historical Iran's concerns about sovereignty and acceptance of an absolute ruler. In this ideology, Iran and Shia Islam are viewed as the same, indivisible.29”\nThe pride in Iran's pre-Islamic history shared by the majority of Iranians is reframed within an Islamist context and integrated into the overarching narrative. The IRI's perception of its own unique centrality is informed by its awareness of the country's role as one of the region's historical powers, today challenged by the alluring influence of the West as an alternative to the righteous path of the Iranian model.",
    "### Values": "Anthony Cain quotes Vakili-Zad who notes that the ideology of the Islamic Revolution was shaped by:“those who carried the heavy burden of often bloody confrontations with government troops, [and] were, in general, religiously oriented and linked to traditional values from the rural past ... . [T]he blueprint for future society was the Islamic Republic modeled on the one created by the Prophet Muhammad more than 1,400 years earlier.30”\nSeven years before the revolution, Ali Shariati, a leading Iranian sociologist and revolutionary, in his first public lecture on Islamology, insisted that a reassembly of past cultural values would underpin an overturning of the existing order.31 Such a remodeling of values, with an ultimate goal of creating a just society, cannot be achieved without a perennial struggle against the forces of evil. Ayatollah Khomeini believed that the world is perpetually embroiled in a struggle between good and evil, where the forces of virtue must resist domination and fight against oppression and injustice.32 Most importantly, the threats posed by rival cultures that have different sets of\nvalues from which Iranian society must be cleansed. If these values were to reemerge, it would signify the failure of the revolution's primary objective.33 As a result, the IRI's efforts to maintain the ethos of resistance and jihad against presumed or real adversaries are rooted in the moral and spiritual values of the Islamic Revolution. They are essential mechanisms created to insulate Iranian society against subversive foreign cultural influences and project Iran's power to confront its adversaries abroad. In this context, the concept of moqavamat (resistance) plays an important role. Initially originated as a slogan in the Palestinian national movement in the 1960s, it evolved into a quasi-religious doctrine of armed struggle by Palestinian Hamas and Lebanese Hizballah in the 1980s. It was later adopted by Iran. Although the doctrine of resistance has foreign origins, it resonates deeply with those who embrace the Shi'ite martyrdom narrative of Imam Hussein, who chose resistance and martyrdom at Karbala over surrender to the unjust seventh-century Caliph Yazid.34 Iranian scholars Hossein Salimi and Amin Hejazi, while explicitly highlighting the defensive nature of Iranian jihad, mention resistance against oppression and defense of the oppressed, negation of Western dominance, independence, and self-sufficiency as core values of the IRI.35\nTo sum up, the values that emerged after the Islamic Revolution in Iran, shaped by its religiously oriented and traditionally minded founders, are deeply rooted in a Manichean and one-dimensional worldview that pits good against evil, with the West representing the forces of evil threatening Iranian society. These values serve to protect Iran from foreign cultural influences and uphold principles of resistance.",
    "### Norms": "Pierre Pahlavi and Eric Ouellet observe that Iran has often seen itself as isolated and threatened by neighboring countries due to its unique status as the only Persian-speaking, Shia nation in a predominantly Turkish--Arabic, Sunni region. This perception is exacerbated by the country's size, which makes it significant on the global stage but vulnerable to external threats. To cope with these challenges, Iran has historically pursued two strategic goals: protecting “fortress Iran” by maintaining economic autonomy and territorial integrity and expanding its regional influence as a buffer. While these objectives may seem contradictory, they are complementary and can be achieved through both offensive and detente strategies, transcending internal ideological differences.36 Such an ambiguous environment requires a specific set of norms and a distinct strategic culture that would govern the country's modus operandi.\nIndeed, according to some experts, IRI's strategic culture, influenced by the norms derived from both Persian culture and Shia Islam, includes the use\nof strategic ambiguity and deception, avoidance of frontal attacks, and soft power. When the country's interests are at stake, the strict tenets of Islamic jurisprudence can be abrogated under the concept of maslaha, or acting in the public interest.37 In addition, Kayhan Barzegar and Abdolrasool Divsallar speak about strategic patience, use of low-cost engagements, and diminishing rivals' margin to maneuver as the instruments that the current Iranian regime has masterfully applied for decades. Strategic patience is a deliberate postponement of decisions on critical national security issues, allowing Iran to buy time and conserve resources. This approach is particularly useful in situations where strategic limits exist and available resources are insufficient to counter them. Iranians, who lived under constant insecurity, practiced strategic patience as a means of avoiding emotional, reactionary decisions in the face of harsh conditions. Low-cost engagements, such as hybrid warfare and the use of proxies, are other aspects of norms that influence IRI's strategic culture. In countries like Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen, Iran has created a network of foreign fighters, military advisers, and local regime irregulars under Iranian advisory commands. Additionally, Iran employs a defensive strategy aimed at reducing its rivals' margin to maneuver by blocking their actions and limiting their choices. Called, since 2005, “mosaic defense doctrine,” this strategy includes the concept of “all-around defense,” which brings together all state, nonstate, and private actors to confront threats, and “strategic depth,” which involves creating security buffer zones to reduce the risk of direct attacks on Iranian territory. Anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) capabilities, which encompass military, informational, economic, and political measures, are used by Iran to disrupt adversaries' interests and reduce their choices, thereby raising the cost of any potential hostilities.38 Central to “mosaic doctrine” is the mobilization of a vast and dispersed militia force designed to engage invading forces in protracted, attritional warfare, thereby exhausting their resources and resolve.39",
    "### Perceptive Lens": "The title of Graham Fuller's 1991 RAND Corporation study, The Center of the Universe, mirrors the perspective of the IRI's elites, who believe that Iran holds a natural, indispensable, and leading role in the Middle East and potentially the entire Muslim world.40 Such an inflated view of centrality and historic role of Iran is underlined by a deep-seated Iranian identity and a broadly shared historical awareness of Iran's power status in the region. Consequently, the occurrences that contradict these self-centered views may cause cognitive dissonance among Iranians. During his captivity as a hostage in the U.S. embassy in Tehran, following its takeover by Iranian “students” in November 1979, William Daugherty, then the Central Intelligence Agency\n(CIA) Chief of Station, noted that his captors struggled to comprehend and were personally offended by his inability to communicate in Persian, the language of what they considered such an important country as Iran.41 Experiences of victimization, insecurity, and feelings of inferiority have contributed to shaping Iran's sense of pride and significance. Initially, Iran was a nation of conquerors, but over time, it was invaded, conquered, and humbled by various powers, such as the Greeks, Arabs, Mongols, and Turks. The most recent manifestation of this victimization complex is linked to the British and Russian quasi-colonial domination of Iran from the nineteenth to the mid-twentieth centuries and the perceived American influence over Iran after World War II.42\nThe centuries of foreign domination had caused an acute sensitivity among Iranians about the role of foreigners in their culture and politics. Iranians believe, as Marvin Zonis emphasizes, that “[t]he rest of the world is somehow so taken with Iran's significance that it cannot let it go.”43 A siege mentality is fortified by real or presumed threats posed by both nearby and distant enemies. As a result, a pervasive culture of conspiracy thinking has emerged within Iranian society, with many viewing external forces as manipulating or undermining their nation's interests. This phenomenon bears a notable resemblance to the dynamics often attributed to the so-called Arab street. According to Fuller, “Rarely are events to be taken at face value, for to assume them as such is (a) to indicate ignorance of the superior forces around oneself or one's nation and (b) to demonstrate the stupidity, naivete, or insensitivity not to perceive the hidden motives of others.”44 Based on this logic, unanticipated events are not merely isolated incidents but rather the result of powerful external forces that dominate or control the situation. The most complex explanation of political events is usually preferred as the most likely, particularly when foreign powers are involved. While specific interpretations may differ based on individual ideological outlooks, the consensus is that it is naive to assume that a series of developments might be unrelated, particularly when a powerful foreign entity is involved.45\nOther cultural characteristics that have their roots in the prolonged periods of insecurity and foreign rule are a general wariness toward those outside one's intimate circle, particularly authority figures and foreigners, as well as a tendency toward cunning or astuteness. As life is perceived as an unpredictable game of chance, where both favorable and unfavorable opportunities arise and vanish without warning, people outside the inner cycle are considered as inherently malevolent, power-hungry, and irrational. There is a lack of trust in interpersonal relationships and altruistic motives are often looked at with suspicion.46 The mistrust leads to the necessity for manipulation in the struggle for survival, “empty and meaningless adulation,” and consequently, an expectation that others will also attempt to manipulate.47 Consequently, the\nfigure of the clever dissimulator, or zeræng, emerges. As described by William Beeman, zeræng is “[a]n operation on the part of an adroit operator that involves thwarting direct interpretation of his own actions or deliberately leading others to erroneous interpretation of those actions while being able to successfully interpret the actions of others.”48 Albeit being an inherently negative trait, it is, nevertheless, highly admired by Iranians as they see cleverness and wiliness as essential strategies for navigating and overcoming stronger forces.49 However, the reliance on zeræng, combined with the ingrained insecurity and anxiety about being deceived by strangers, can sometimes result in Iranian actors overplaying their hand in diplomacy, business dealings, and military activities.\nIn conclusion, the analysis of Iranian strategic culture based on four variables—identity, values, norms, and perceptive lens—demonstrates that Iran's identity is a fusion of nationality and religion, with a strong sense of exceptionalism and historical continuity. The values that emerged after the Islamic Revolution are deeply rooted in a Manichean worldview, pitting good against evil, with the West representing the forces of evil. The perceptive lens of Iran's elites is inflated, believing that Iran's indispensable and leading role in the Middle East and potentially the entire Muslim world would somehow compensate for technological deficiencies.",

    "### The Cyber Posture of Small States": "Cyberspace is a complex and multifaceted concept, encompassing various subconcepts and nuanced definitions. Rain Ottis and Peeter Lorents describe cyberspace as “a time-dependent set of interconnected information systems and the human users that interact with these systems,” stressing a dynamic nature of cyberspace, where significant changes can occur rapidly, in a shorter time frame than other time-dependent systems.50\nCyberspace is widely considered offense-dominant, inferring that it is easier to execute attacks than to defend against them. Offensive dominance in cyberspace is due to varied and rapidly evolving attack vectors, which defenders struggle to keep up with. Such an asymmetry is in favor of an attacker, as offensive cyber capabilities are perceived to be resource-efficient compared to defensive measures, which are costly and often lag behind technological advancements.51 In parallel, traditional deterrence models face challenges in cyberspace due to difficulties in attribution and the covert nature of cyber capabilities. The anonymity and rapid execution of cyberattacks undermine the effectiveness of deterrence, which relies on the threat of assured retaliation. A key challenge in implementing cyber deterrence is the need for a strong system of protection as the first step, but\nmany countries prioritize offensive operations over defense, neglecting defense and resilience, instead focusing on offensive methods to deter adversaries.52 The system-wide framework analysis that focuses on the broadest dynamics and the systemic cyber risks inherent to the internet may be worth considering. It addresses both top-down factors, such as insecure technical standards, and bottom-up, emergent effects, like the spread of insecure Internet of Things (IoT) devices. This framework encompasses the full spectrum of attacks, including nation-state disruptions, espionage, cybercrime, and even hacking driven by curiosity or entertainment. Within this context, the tools, methods, and activities of offensive and defensive operations are relatively distinct.53\nHowever, the true destructive potential of cyber operations remains uncertain and a subject of ongoing speculation and debate within the cybersecurity community. As Torbjørn Pedersen notes,54 the initial anticipation of a “modern Pearl Harbor” or upcoming global cyberwars has given way to a more nuanced understanding of the limitations of cyber operations expressed in the article by Thomas Rid, “Cyber War Will Not Take Place.”55 According to Lennart Maschmeyer, cyber operations face an operational trilemma, where the three variables of speed, intensity of effect, and control are negatively correlated. This means that, in most cases, cyber operations will be either too slow, too low in intensity, or too unreliable to provide significant strategic utility.56 Overall, however, both opponents and proponents of cyberwar agree that cyberspace offers new methods of undermining national power by achieving strategic impact through ongoing campaigns of covert, less violent cyber operations with cumulative effects.57\nThe cyber capabilities of small states, defined by limited resources and smaller populations, are primarily focused on defensive measures. This is due to constraints in funding, a lack of specialized expertise and intelligence resources, and the high costs involved in developing advanced offensive tools. The notion that cyber capabilities provide an asymmetric advantage to weaker states is contested, as evidence suggests that powerful states with advanced resources are better positioned to exploit cyber operations.58 Jon Lindsay cites the Stuxnet operation of 2009--2010 as a prime example, when a malicious code penetrated the Iranian nuclear facility in Natanz, wiping out around 1,000 centrifuges. Although specific details about the Stuxnet operation's time frame and effects still remain obscure, Lindsay argues that this incident demonstrates that cyber capabilities do not automatically grant an advantage to weaker states. He emphasizes that small states encounter significant challenges in weaponizing cyber capabilities to inflict substantial damage.59 All these challenge the notion of asymmetric advantage of weaker adversaries in the cyberdomain proposed by some, suggesting instead that cyber capabilities tend to favor powerful states.60\nSmall states often adopt a technology-oriented strategic culture and focus on enhancing their defensive measures to protect their critical infrastructure and maintain national security. The effectiveness of cyber strategies varies among states, with some successfully integrating them into their national security frameworks, while others struggle to recognize the opportunities and threats associated with increased cyber engagement. However, small states often adopt several common strategies to compensate for their limited resources and cyber capabilities. These strategies may include:61 Cyber hygiene programs: Investing in national cyber hygiene programs to educate citizens and businesses about basic cybersecurity practices. This involves developing cybersecurity curricula in educational institutions, conducting regular training programs for government and private sector employees, and fostering a culture of cyber awareness. In Iran's case, this approach took the form of creating a “halal net,” a locally controlled version of the internet designed to limit public access to information. Incident response teams: Establishing national Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) or Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) to handle and coordinate responses to cyber incidents. Legislation and policy frameworks: Setting up robust legislative and policy frameworks. These frameworks set out the roles and responsibilities of various stakeholders and establish protocols for incident response and information sharing. Investment in technology: Despite resource limitations, small states are increasingly investing in advanced cyber defense technologies, such as intrusion detection systems, encryption, and secure communication platforms to protect critical infrastructure. Public--private partnerships often play a key role in supporting national cybersecurity strategies, provided there is a skilled workforce and organizational infrastructure to effectively utilize these technologies. Additionally, the absence of economic and technological sanctions mechanisms is crucial, as it allows these states to acquire the necessary technologies without significant barriers.Cyber defense alliances, collaboration, and information sharing with other states, international organizations, and private sector partners to enhance cyber defense capabilities.\nPutting the cyber capabilities of small states in the context of strategic culture, Francis Domingo introduced the concept of “technology-oriented” strategic culture, which refers to small states' inclination to rely on technology as a strategy to overcome limited resources, military capabilities, and strategic depth.62 In this context, technology serves as an enabler for states to pursue foreign policy objectives in a more deliberate and strategic manner. A technology-oriented strategic culture can be identified by examining three key implications for small states: High network readiness: Small states with a technology-oriented strategic culture prioritize the development and maintenance of advanced communication\nnetworks, data systems, and digital infrastructure to enhance their overall connectivity and readiness. Technology-driven military force: These states invest in technology-driven military capabilities, such as advanced weapon systems, unmanned aerial vehicles, and cyberwarfare tools, to augment their military power and strategic reach. Relevance of cybersecurity: Cybersecurity becomes a critical concern for small states with a technology-oriented strategic culture, as they recognize the potential risks and vulnerabilities associated with their reliance on technology. As a result, they prioritize the protection of their digital infrastructure and critical data to ensure their national security and maintain their strategic advantages.63\nIran offers an intriguing case study, as its strategic culture, characterized by its identity, values, norms, and perceptual lens, aligns closely with the defensive cybersecurity posture of many small states. The emphasis on resistance, strategic patience, ambiguity, and low-cost engagements constitutes Iran's approach to cyberspace, reflecting broader trends seen in the cyber strategies of small states. However, over the past decade, Iran has significantly stepped up its offensive cyber capabilities, elevating itself, according to some estimates, to the top of the second tier of global cyberpowers, with aspirations to join the leaders.64",
    "### Iranian Cyber Capabilities": "Iran's initial steps to build its defensive cyber capabilities can be traced back to 2003, when units specializing in cybersecurity were set up within several ministries.65 A 2010 wake-up call occurred with the Stuxnet operation, followed by the “Wiper” and “Flame” malicious code attacks, solidifying the regime's understanding that Iran's adversaries possess a distinct qualitative advantage in offensive cyber activities. By 2016, Iran's cyber capabilities budget was reportedly over USD 1 billion (vs. USD 76 million in 2011), compared to the USD 2 billion budget of the United Kingdom, one of the world's leading cyberpowers. According to Iranian data, the country's cyber budget experienced a twelvefold increase between 2013 and 2021. By the late 2010s, approximately 18% of Iranian university students were studying computer science. Additionally, compulsory military service was utilized to direct technologically skilled graduates toward the state security apparatus, including the MOIS and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC),66 while the topic of cyber defense entered the high school textbook Preparation for Defense.67\nIn March 2012, the Supreme Council of Cyberspace, under the direction of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, was established. The Council is headed by the Iranian President and includes 25 senior government representatives and other key figures, such as the senior commander of the\nIRGC; the head of the Majlis; the Ministers of Science, Communications and Culture; the chief of police; and the president of the Islamic Propaganda Organization. The Council has the power to establish national cyber policy, and its decisions are mandatory for all Iranian institutions operating in the field.68 The National Center for Cyberspace, which is the main division of the Council, is responsible for comprehensive domestic and international surveillance, enforcing the enactments of the council, and preventing Iranians from accessing virtual private networks (VPNs) and internet proxies, which are used to bypass Iran's internet controls.69\nVarious organizations monitor and protect Iran's cyberspace infrastructure. All of them are affiliated with different government institutions and operate in different fields. A key defensive organization within this structure is the Cyberspace Defense Command, which functions under the Passive Defense Organization of the general staff of the armed forces. This organization is made up of both military personnel and representatives from the Communications, Defense, Intelligence, and Industry ministries. Its primary goal is to establish a comprehensive defensive strategy for safeguarding state institutions and infrastructures from potential cyber threats. The Cyberspace Defense Command is primarily focused on defense and does not appear to be engaged in offensive cyber activities. Another defensive entity within Iran's cyberspace structure is the Center for Information Security, also known as MAHER. This center is established and operated under the Communications and Information Technologies Ministry and is primarily responsible for activating computer security incident response teams during emergencies and cyberattacks. Furthermore, MAHER trains skilled manpower, develops response mechanisms for cyber crises, and stores and disseminates data security know-how. The center is responsible for defending all government websites, as well as those of private companies that are officially registered with the Communications Ministry.70 The Committee for Identifying Unauthorized Sites and FATA (an acronym for the Police for the Sphere of the Production and Exchange of Information) act as Iran's cyber police, overseeing internet usage for both domestic suppression and countering cybercrime.71 The IRGC runs its cyber operations, both defensive and offensive, through the IRGC Cyber-Electronic Command (IRGC-CEC), which is headquartered at the Ammar Cyberspace Base.72\nRegarding Iran's offensive cyber capabilities, the IRGC and MOIS are responsible for conducting both independent and joint offensive operations against perceived and real threats to Iranian national security. Among these two entities, the IRGC undoubtedly takes the lead. Its Electronic Warfare and Cyber Defense Organization offers training courses in cyber defense, restricts access to online content, and censors digital communications in Iranian cyberspace73 and “bears primary responsibility for offensive cyber\noperations.”74 By 2009, the IRGC started enlisting professionals for its internal cyberforce, as well as the closely associated military unit known as the Iranian Cyber Army (ICA). That same year, the Basij Cyber Council, another cyber entity overseen by the IRGC, revealed that it had trained 1,500 cybersecurity specialists. These professionals were prepared to join the IRGC's expanding offensive operations and espionage division. In 2010, the Basij cyber unit's leaders publicly declared their intention to launch digital attacks targeted at the actions of the “Zionist Entity,” Israel.75 The IRGC trains, equips, and provides operational support in the cyberdomain to Iranian proxies such as Hezbollah. For instance, in 2021, the IRGC helped establish a cybersecurity unit within Hezbollah's counterintelligence service. In parallel, a cybertraining facility disguised as a branch of Tehran's Sharif University was opened in Dahiye, in the southern suburbs of Beirut.76\nIran's cyberspace development is mainly driven by universities and technological institutes, with a focus on information technology (IT), computer engineering, and communications. Key institutions include Amirkabir University of Technology, Imam Hossein University, Shahid Beheshti University, and Sharif University of Technology. The Iranian government supports IT and computer communications companies through direct and indirect investments, with key government bodies being the Science Ministry, the Information and Communications Ministry, the Technology Cooperation Office, and hi-tech greenhouses like the Pardis Technology Park and Guilan Science and Technology Park.77 Furthermore, the universities play a crucial role in subcontracting cyber operations to front companies and individuals. Over the years, a tiered approach to cyber operations has developed within the Iranian intelligence landscape. At its core is a trusted network of middle managers—often university employees—who are ideologically aligned with the Iranian government and who translate intelligence priorities into segmented cyber tasks. These tasks are then bid out to multiple contractors, where about 50 organizations compete for regime-sponsored projects. The authorities compartmentalize tasks, often requiring different contractors for various parts of a project, such as creating exploits and establishing unauthorized access. Payments are only made upon the completion of the task, as competition is fierce and contractors are pitted against each other. Characteristic in this context is the case of Monica Witt—a former U.S. Air Force intelligence specialist who served in the Air Force from 1997 through 2008 and then with a defense contractor until 2010. Defecting to Iran in 2013, Witt leaked top-secret information to the Iranians, including the identities of U.S. intelligence agents and highly classified intelligence collection programs.78 In 2015, four Iranian hackers, coopted by the IRCG, targeted U.S. intelligence and military personnel in an unsophisticated and poorly executed cyber operation that ultimately failed.79\nAlthough Iran boasts a large network of IT professionals, the Islamic regime's inherent paranoia creates unique challenges. Those with the greatest offensive cyber skills and those demonstrating adherence to the government's ideology are usually mutually exclusive.80 Furthermore, the country is facing a significant brain drain, as many cybersecurity experts are leaving Iran at an alarming pace.\nCooperation with foreign actors, particularly China, North Korea, and Russia, has significantly contributed to Iran's cyber capabilities. In 2015, Russia and Iran signed the first cyber cooperation agreement, recognizing common threats in the cyberdomain. In 2017, a memorandum of understanding for cooperation on information and communication technology (ICT)--related issues, including “internet governance, network security,” and “international internet connection” was signed. In 2021, Russia and Iran concluded the agreement on information security aimed to coordinate activities in response to the growing importance of cyber issues in international relations and ICT-related crimes, as well as the creation of an Iranian “sovereign internet.”81 Since the beginning of the Ukraine conflict in 2022, Russia has supplied Iran with communication-surveillance capabilities, eavesdropping devices, advanced photography equipment, and lie detectors, and reportedly also shared more advanced software with Iran, enabling it to hack phones and systems of dissidents and adversaries. Protei Ltd. a Russian company specializing in communication monitoring tools, has started providing internet censorship software to the Iranian mobile services provider Ariantel. The Protei tools are believed to be part of a developing mobile phone system that would allow Iranian state authorities to directly monitor, intercept, redirect, degrade, or deny mobile communications.82 In 2021, Iranian cybersecurity company Lotus Gostar Arya (or Cysec) opened a branch in Kazan to foster cooperation and exchange of know-how between Iran and Russia.83\nOn 17 January 2025, Russia and Iran further solidified their partnership by signing the “Treaty on Comprehensive Strategic Partnership.” Article 4 of the treaty explicitly stipulates that the intelligence and security services of both nations “shall exchange information and experience and enhance the level of their cooperation.” This agreement is expected to further deepen collaboration in the cyber domain.84\nIn December 2010, the Chinese telecommunications firm ZTE Corp. sold a surveillance system to Iran's Telecommunication Co. of Iran (TCI) as part of a USD 130.6 million networking equipment contract. The surveillance system can monitor landline, mobile, and internet communications. TCI, which had at that time a near monopoly on Iran's landline telephone services, managed a significant portion of Iran's internet traffic.85 In 2019, China and Iran agreed to establish a joint workgroup to tackle cyber threats, emphasizing cooperation in IT, addressing cyber threats, and “counter[ing] U.S.\nunilateralism.”86 In 2009, a significant intelligence failure committed by the CIA occurred when a faulty web-based covert communications system used by the CIA in Iran was exposed, resulting in the arrest and execution of numerous CIA informants. The Iran events coincided with a similar setback in China in 2011 and 2012, where around 30 agents were apprehended and executed. Some officials suspected that the two nations might have collaborated, with Iran offering China technical information about the exposed communications system in exchange for equipment and expertise.87\nIn September 2012, Iran and North Korea signed a technology cooperation agreement, which allegedly included the cyberdomain.88 Iran potentially could have provided information on Stuxnet to North Korea, which ultimately prevented the Stuxnet-similar attack on the North Korean nuclear facility. A tightly controlled network and the inability of physical penetration of the facility to install the worm into the command systems might have also contributed to the failure.89\nTo conclude, Iran shares some defensive strategies with small states, such as resource constraints and the high costs associated with developing sophisticated offensive tools. Iran's investment in education and the development of technological expertise is consistent with the technology-oriented strategic culture described by Domingo. In a similar vein, the country's emphasis on training and harnessing its human capital shows how smaller states leverage technology to compensate for limited resources. The programs focusing on cyber hygiene, incident response teams, and legislative frameworks also mirror the defensive strategies typically adopted by small states.\nHowever, unlike many small states that focus primarily on defense, Iran has developed substantial offensive cyber capabilities. Organizations like the IRGC-CEC and ICA actively engage in offensive operations, targeting both regional adversaries and global entities. This level of offensive capability is more characteristic of larger, more powerful states. The integration of foreign expertise and technology, such as surveillance systems and cybersecurity tools, underscores Iran's ability to leverage international partnerships to bolster its cyber posture. The extent and sophistication of Iran's offensive operations, including cyberespionage and attacks, distinguish it from the typical small-state cyber posture, which often lacks the resources to develop such capabilities. Iran's cyber budget and institutional support structures, including the Supreme Cyberspace Council, are substantial compared to those of typical small states. The scale of investment and the comprehensive nature of its cyber governance framework indicate a level of state commitment that exceeds what is usually seen in smaller states with limited resources.\nSuch a combination of defensive focus, substantial offensive capacity, extensive foreign partnerships, and significant state investment makes Iran a unique player in the cyber landscape of small states.\nLEAKED INSIGHTS: IRAN'S CYBERDFENSE LANDSCAPE AND STRATEGIC CULTURE\nOver the last decade, Iran has been actively building a multifaceted cyber defense system to safeguard its critical infrastructure, suppress opposition groups, and block perceived harmful content, all aimed at maintaining the regime's stability. Guided by the Supreme Council of Cyberspace, Iran's numerous governmental agencies have been at the forefront of the implementation of this strategy. Despite such a concerted effort, the Iranian state organizations, including the MOIS, have been regularly experiencing high-impact leaks. For instance, since 2017 and into 2019, self-declared Iranian dissident groups—such as Lab Dookhtegan, Green Leakers, Black Box, and Hidden Reality—have emerged as “mystery groups” with unclear origins and affiliations.90 Over time, these groups have built reputations as reliable sources of information, exposing Iranian intelligence and military operations both within Iran and across the Middle East.91\nThe agencies tasked with cyber defense, although numerous and mature, are, as it seems, still lacking capabilities and know-how to fully prevent high-impact breaches. The researchers inside Iran have pointed out a number of weak points in the Iranian cyber defense. Hassan Monfared, writing about the cyberwarfare of the Iranian armed forces, finds that they lack a comprehensive view of cyber defense and highlights the need for a systematic approach to stabilize and improve cyber combat readiness across the army ranks.92 Shafiee et al. from Passive Defense Organization see the need to improve management of public opinion through cyberspace and identify several psychological operations techniques aimed at improving the image of the army and countering adversaries' psychological operations.93 Similarly, Mohammad Tabatabaei and Ehsan Movahedian in their study of the U.S cyber influence operations against Iran's internet users stress a gap in Iran's ability to counter foreign cyber influence effectively.94 Abolfazl and Mahdi Rohani stress cyberspace's dual nature as both a threat and opportunity and propose a catalog of measures to effectively managing and mitigating cyber threats. Interestingly enough, the measures proposed by the researchers are strikingly similar to those revealed in the leaked documents discussed below. They include strengthening the Supreme Council of Cyberspace and the National Cyber Space Center's role as the country's cyber focal point; enhancing capabilities of organizations such as the ICA; developing a local internet industry and broadband ecosystem; strengthening local entrepreneurs active in cyberdomain; and more active utilization of cyberspace for conflict, war, competition, and information operations against adversaries.95 Very insightful in this context is the confidential letter produced by Ali Asghar Qaimi, the advisor in the field of communication and IT, security, and cyber defense, to the speaker of the Iranian parliament,\nMohammad Bagher Ghalibaf.96 In it, Qaimi lists sixteen “challenges” faced by the Iranian cyber defense as of January 2024. Among them are: big differences in the quality of online infrastructure in various government bodies; existence of uncovered vulnerabilities and planted backdoors; lack of proper monitoring and action plans to locate and fix vulnerabilities; widespread attempts to cover up problems, incidents, and cyberattacks; lack of organizational discipline within the agencies responsible for vital and sensitive infrastructure; shortage of skilled personnel in the fields of security and cyber defense; utilization of unsuitable external cyber defense products in the vital infrastructure; the multiplicity of decisionmaking authorities and their interference, leading to the adoption of often contradictory decisions; brain drain of cybersecurity experts; and the long and exhausting process of obtaining security licenses and qualifications for individuals and private security companies.97 Qaimi concludes that, because many organizations in Iran fail to meet minimum security requirements, one should expect further cyberattacks, disclosure of information, and disruption of services in the future.98 To sum up, the challenges faced by Iran's cyber defense system, as outlined by Iranian researchers, highlight significant gaps in infrastructure, personnel, and overall preparedness, painting a troubling picture of the country's vulnerability to cyber threats. These weaknesses are also mirrored in a letter by Qaimi that lists several critical deficiencies, providing a realistic view on the current situation with cyber defense.\nThe analysis of the leaked documents begins with the four-year plan, classified as “secret,” laid down on 23 July 2021, by new Minister of Intelligence Hojjat al-Islam Seyyed Ismail Khatib. Although the document tackles the challenges and priorities related to cybersecurity, it does not explicitly describe the current state of cybersecurity in the country. Nevertheless, it highlights the significance of modernizing intelligence infrastructure to address cyber threats effectively, including monitoring, prevention, and capacity building in cyber.99 It also emphasizes the importance of protecting critical infrastructure, combating cyberespionage, and enhancing cooperation with international partners in cybersecurity efforts. The document refers to “the concrete operational plans” that need to be put in place based on the resolutions by the Supreme Council of Cyberspace.100\nIn addition to the four-year plan that due to its programmatic nature tackles the topic of cyber without sufficient depth, six other documents, all of which explicitly focus on various aspects of cybersecurity, will be analyzed using a framework of seven interconnected themes. These themes, which have been consistently addressed in all documents, provide a comprehensive understanding of Iran's approach to cybersecurity:Governance and regulatory framework,National Information Network,\n.International engagement and cyber diplomacy,Control over information flows and protection of Islamic-Iranian identity,Economic and technological integration within the cyberdomain,Human resources and workforce development, andCybersecurity infrastructure and cyber protective mechanisms.",
    "### Governance and Regulatory Framework": "The importance of the Supreme Council of Cyberspace as the main body responsible for Iran's cyberdomain has been stressed in all documents. The decisions of the Council must be considered binding and be implemented by all organizations, including the office of the prosecutor and the courts.101 The Council also plays a crucial role in determining the budgetary spending on cybersecurity and monitoring measures to protect Iran's critical infrastructure.102 It is interesting to note in this context that the performance of the National Center for Cyberspace, which is controlled by the Council, is regularly assessed based on the principles of good governance (salamat-e edari).103",
    "### National Information Network": "Establishing a “reliable, safe, stable, integrated, and extensive infrastructure throughout the country based on the National Information Network”104 that would enable the regime to “[r]educe as much as possible access to unauthorized foreign platforms”105 is seen as one of the most important priorities monitored by the Council. The Ministry of Communications and Information Technology was entrusted with the responsibility of connecting at least 80% of the country's households and businesses to the National Information Network by the end of 2023.106 In the foreseeable future, Iran's satellite infrastructure and the National Information Network should be integrated, further solidifying the country's digital autonomy and enhancing its cybersecurity capabilities.107",
    "### International Engagement and Cyber Diplomacy": "In the international arena, Iran pursues two goals in the cyberdomain: first, to expand cooperation with allied and friendly nations, especially Islamic countries,108 as well as to “[a]chieve an active, strong, and purposeful presence in regional and international assemblies and institutions.”109 Second, Iran seeks to strengthen its position as a formidable cyberpower, leveraging international bodies as deterrent mechanisms in its cyberspace.110 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs plays a major role in setting up a “cyber space diplomacy system,” as well as assisting other state agencies in dealing with international organizations.111\n###\nControl over Information Flows and Protection of Islamic--Iranian Identity\nProtecting the Islamic--Iranian identity and lifestyle is a crucial aspect of cyber defense in Iran. Consequently, the country regulates social media presence in accordance with its laws and values. The Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance plays a significant role in this regard, responsible for registering official accounts, closing fake accounts, and blocking unauthorized advertisements of foreign social networks.112 As a countermeasure to potential threats in the digital space, content providers in Iran are required to promote the “discourse of the Islamic Revolution” and contribute to the creation of a “new Islamic civilization in cyberspace.”113 Government employees are forbidden from being present on “unauthorized social media platforms” without permission and required to follow guidelines and regulations if they are present on “approved” platforms.114",
    "### Economic and Technological Integration within the Cyberdomain": "In the field of economic and technological integration within the cyberdomain, Iran pursues a twofold strategy—increasing the share of domestic products and services in cybersecurity, and supporting local providers. Thus, the need to double the local content of products and services has been emphasized time and again in different strategic documents.115 In parallel, the share of the digital segment in the Iranian economy is planned to reach 10% by 2031,116 while some suggest that the same share should be set at 20% of the Gross Domestic Product.117 Support of the local providers of products and services is considered vital. Several authors recommend that authorities make “[m]aximum usage of private cyber security contractors”118 and “support companies, particularly in the fields of security systems, locally-built browsers, and national messengers.”119",
    "### Human Resources and Workforce Development": "In addition, it is considered crucial to address the need to establish criteria for recruiting, retaining, and protecting experts in the cybersecurity domain, as such plans require careful design and implementation.120 The salaries of cybersecurity specialists should be increased and the issue of brain drain requires urgent attention.121 Furthermore, the cybersecurity literacy among government employees needs to be addressed through internal training and specialized courses.122 The number of student admissions in cybersecurity-related fields also needs to be expanded.123 The goal is to create a reservoir of skilled and efficient cybersecurity experts, thereby gaining a strategic advantage for Iran in this area.124\nCybersecurity Infrastructure and Cyber Protective Mechanisms\nIran's cyber defense strategy has, over the decade, evolved as a multifaceted approach that includes regular assessments, clear role assignments, and a catalogue of proactive measures. The establishment and continuous development of cybersecurity measures within all state institutions are considered critical in safeguarding national security. The institutions are obliged to create and implement comprehensive cyberspace security plans to prevent, combat, and manage cyber incidents,125 including cyber drills.126 Additionally, regular evaluations and situational reports mandated to assess the fulfillment of cybersecurity tasks must be submitted to the Supreme Council of Cyberspace.127 Nongovernmental institutions are also urged to organize and enhance their cybersecurity capabilities.128\nAccording to the top-secret document of April 2023, the task of guarding Iran's cyber borders was at that time the responsibility of the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology. However, the document complains that this mission is not logically aligned with the Ministry's posture in protecting Iran's communication and information infrastructure. As a result, the role of the armed forces and the country's intelligence agencies in this area has been overlooked. Hence, it was necessary to reevaluate the legal framework for cyber border protection and consider assigning this important task to an organization that is better equipped to handle it. In addition, a plethora of organizations responsible for cyber defense, including the Passive Defense Organization, the Center for Information Security, and the cyber police (FATA), have overlapping responsibilities. This requires a clear definition of their roles and duties, particularly in their relations to the armed forces, the IRGC, and the Ministry of Intelligence.129 Furthermore, the general staff of the armed forces was “[t]asked to prepare a national program to prevent and address defense-security threats posed by unauthorized satellite systems for Iranian cyber space.”130\nThe insights gained from the documents examined in this section underline the key premises of strategic culture defined earlier. The overall structure of Iran's cyber governance is heavily centralized, reflecting Iran's historical preference for a strong, centralized leadership, which is seen as necessary to maintain order and control in a complex and multifaceted society. The country's commitment to reducing foreign dependence and fostering a self-reliant digital economy aligns with the drive toward self-sufficiency and autonomy as seen through historical experience of invasions and influence from foreign powers. In the eternal struggle between virtue and evil, a dwindling human capital in the cyberdomain needs to be exploited and protected to advance the country's strategic interests, as the entire society should remain resilient, in line with the values of vigilance and resistance against external threats. Internationally, Iran considers itself a leader of the\nIslamic world that stays firm in the face of Western influence. By leveraging international bodies as deterrent mechanisms, the regime attempts to project power and protect its interests in cyberspace. Iran's dual strategy of enhancing domestic cybersecurity capabilities while also striving for technological independence and integration into the global cyberdomain mirrors its cultural emphasis on adaptability to secure the country's position in a complex and competitive international environment. The role of cultural and media institutions in cyberspace is critical for the regime, as their task is to promote the dual elements of Iranian identity—nationality and religion. Such an emphasis on aligning cyber content with Islamic principles demonstrates the intertwining of religious ideology with national identity, as it reinforces the regime's narrative and counters foreign cultural influence.\nFinally, while concrete data are lacking, it is reasonable to infer that the multidecade economic and technological sanctions imposed on Iran have significantly affected its cyber defense capabilities, influencing both its strategy and the evolution of its cyber infrastructure. These sanctions have severely limited Iran's ability to acquire advanced cyber defense technologies, as restrictions on access to key software, hardware, and encryption technologies hinder the country's efforts to build a sophisticated cybersecurity infrastructure. A comprehensive analysis examining the impact of sanctions on Iran's cyber defense capabilities would be a fascinating subject for further study, shedding light on the consequences of such restrictions and their potential long-term effects on a nation's ability to protect itself in the cyber realm.",
    "## CONCLUSION": "A strategic culture that shaped Iranian perceptions, values, and norms has its roots in Persian culture and Shia Islam. Iran's historical experiences of conquest and foreign domination have led to a siege mentality, conspiracy thinking, and the admiration of cunning and manipulation. Besides, a unique blend of historical experiences and geostrategic positions have shaped Iran's sense of identity and its perception of exceptionalism and superiority. Some Iranian authors even advance the notion of “geopolitical superiority,” arguing that Iran's strategic positioning and its “geographical gravity” can somehow compensate for its technological deficiencies—a belief that underestimates the role of and need for technological advancement in the face of modern threats and evolving security dynamics.131\nConsequently, these specific operational codes, histories, and assumptions of strategic culture have a significant influence on the country's cyber defense posture, characterized by heightened sensitivity to cyberattacks by hostile actors. The Stuxnet attack was probably a pivotal moment that revealed Iran's vulnerabilities to advanced cyber threats from hostile actors and solidified the Manichean worldview of ruling elites about perceived external\nthreats, especially those emanating from the West. Over the last decade, Iran adopted a multifaceted approach to safeguarding infrastructure, suppressing opposition, and countering foreign influence. Iran has achieved a unique position in the cyber landscape that is characterized by a mix of defensive focus, offensive capabilities, partnerships with allied states, and significant state investment. The country's comprehensive cyber strategy and governance framework position it as a formidable player, blending characteristics of both small and larger states.\nOver the last few years, Iranian-affiliated cyber threat actors have demonstrated the ability to execute sustained, complex, and disruptive operations across multiple sectors outside of Iran. These groups frequently utilize advanced tactics, techniques, and procedures, continuously refining their strategies to avoid detection and maintain access to compromised networks. The coordination among these actors and their shared use of resources and tools demonstrate a unified effort to support Iran's geopolitical aims. Their ongoing use of destructive malware, ransomware, and espionage operations underscores the threat they pose, particularly in the context of regional tensions and global political events. Thus, Iran was one of the most assertive foreign actors attempting to create discord ahead of the 2024 U.S. presidential elections. Iranian operatives have launched influence operations targeting U.S. audiences, potentially aiming to sway the outcome of the elections. This cyber-enabled influence campaign is being driven by a mix of actors conducting preliminary cyber reconnaissance and inserting online personas and websites into the information ecosystem. In June 2024, hackers linked to the IRGC successfully infiltrated the Trump campaign, stealing internal documents and leaking them to media outlets.132\nIn the cyber defensive domain, the leaked documents mostly confirm the conclusions derived from the sources available in the public domain. The materials show that Iran has developed a multifaceted cyber defense system aimed at protecting its critical infrastructure, controlling information, and maintaining regime stability. The Supreme Council of Cyberspace oversees this strategy, coordinating efforts across various governmental agencies. Highly centralized cyber governance aims at strengthening the country's self-reliance and reducing foreign dependence, aligning with Iran's strategic culture of resistance to external influences. Internationally, Iran's posture is marked by adaptability and resilience to secure its position in the global cyberdomain. However, despite the extensive cyber defense measures, Iran still faces significant challenges, such as weaknesses in comprehensive defense strategies, management of public opinion, and countering foreign influence operations. Numerous high-impact leaks experienced by Iranian state organizations revealed persistent issues with infrastructure quality, cyber threat monitoring, and organizational discipline.\nROLE OF STRATEGIC CULTURE IN IRAN'S CYBER DEFENSE POLICY\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author."

This culture combines a strong national pride and historical consciousness with values centered on resisting external influences. Ultimately, strategic culture has influenced the country’s cyber capabilities, which have significantly evolved since 2003, largely due to state investment and the establishment of the Supreme Council of Cyberspace in 2012. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and the Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS) lead offensive cyber operations, making Iran’s cyber posture more aligned with larger state powers than typical small states. Leaked documents from the Iranian opposition disclosed that Iran has actively developed a comprehensive cyber defense framework over the past decade to protect its critical infrastructure, quell opposition, and control presumed harmful content to maintain regime stability. Despite these efforts, leaks from dissident groups have exposed persistent weaknesses in Iran’s cyber defense, highlighting challenges in infrastructure, threat monitoring, and organizational discipline. Moreover, these leaks reveal Iran’s strategic focus on self-reliance and resistance to foreign influence.\nDr. Grigorij Serscikov is an Independent Researcher and Consultant with over fifteen years of experience in offering strategic advice and analysis to companies within the energy and financial sectors.

However, the credibility of the leaked documents—that is, the context in which the documents were produced and the intentions of the authors who wrote them4—although it invites certain skepticism, does not currently challenge its validity. Similarly, the representativeness of the papers is established through the sheer volume of the leaked materials on the various topics of Iranian internal and external policies. Therefore, while the authenticity of the documents may be subject to debate, their credibility and representativeness are well established, providing a solid foundation for the research.\nAmong the wealth of primary sources made available to the public, there were several related to Iran's cyber defense strategies, providing researchers with insights into the country's cybersecurity programs. One key document is titled, “The Program Proposed by the Minister of Intelligence Hojjat al-Islam wal-Muslimeen Seyyed Ismail Khatib for the 13th government Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, 23 July 2021”5—the newly appointed head of the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence (MOIS).6 In it, Khatib outlined his vision for the evolution of the MOIS over the next four years, addressing inter alia issues related to Iranian cybersecurity. Other documents that will be examined in this study are: “The Ninety-Fourth Session of the Supreme Council of the Country's Cyber Space of 16 August 2023,”7 “The Ninety-Second Meeting of the Supreme Council of Cyberspace of June 27, 2023,”8 “Parts One and Two of the Strategic Document of the Islamic Republic of Iran on Cyber Space of July 14, 2021,”9 “Requirements and Measures Related to the Use of Satellite Systems in Cyberspace of 30 August 2022,”10 “Opinion Regarding the Promotion of the Cyber Space of 9 April 2023,”11 and “The Letter of the Advisor to the Speaker of the Parliament in the Field of Communication and Information Technology, Security and Cyber Defense of 16 January 2024.”12 Furthermore, Persian-language academic journals published in Iran, such as The Quarterly Journal of Multidisciplinary Studies for Strategic Knowledge, Strategic Studies Quarterly, and The Quarterly of Political Strategic Studies have been tackling the themes related to cybersecurity for almost a decade. Rarely quoted in the West, these publications, whose authors are often affiliated with the country's intelligence and military community, provide an outside-in perspective on the topic and, as will be shown, significantly complement primary sources.\nIranian cyber defense will be examined within the framework of a case study approach—a reliable and often-used methodology to explore the case's “why” and/or “how” questions in situations of complex causality where the researcher has limited control.13 This approach will be further strengthened through a detailed and systematic analysis of the leaked documents, which will play a central role in the research. By integrating the insights derived from the documents, the case study method enables the researcher to achieve high levels of “conceptual validity”—the identification of the most representative features within the specific context of Iranian cyber defense.14 The concept of strategic culture will be applied as a theoretical avenue for the analysis. First appearing in the late 1970s,15 the idea has experienced several waves of scholarly attention since then.16 Johnson and Larsen define strategic culture as “[a] set of shared beliefs, assumptions, and modes of behavior, derived from common experiences and accepted narratives (both oral and written), that shape collective identity and relationships to other groups, and which determine appropriate ends and means for achieving security objectives.”17 A country's strategic culture is not randomly chosen or influenced by intellectual trends. It is shaped by the character and context of its society and becomes, in the views of Jeremy Black, a “cultural assumption” that fits the nation's strategic needs and influences its strategic behavior.18 Strategic culture, which is rooted in historical experiences, can evolve but cannot be easily discarded. It is a crucial factor in a country's strategic effectiveness, but it is not infinitely adaptable. Radical changes in culture only occur as a result of significant political, social, or military shocks. Strategic cultures borrow and adapt from one another, but this process has its limits.\nThe concept of strategic culture is highly suitable for the analysis of cybersecurity and cyberwarfare. For instance, the study prepared for the U.S. Cyber Command applied the notion of strategic culture as a theoretical foundation to build four case studies, one of them Iran.19 The author believes that the concept offers an additional advantage for this research, as it allows for deriving further insights and drawing implications from the primary and secondary sources as well as tracing the development of Iran's strategies to cybersecurity in general and cyber defense in particular during a specific period.20 ROLE OF STRATEGIC CULTURE IN IRAN'S CYBER DEFENSE POLICY # IRANIAN STRATEGIC CULTURE Strategic culture faces the challenge of not having a clear collection of principles or a well-established theoretical framework. The common ground for strategic culture generally involves acknowledging culture as an epiphenomenal factor in the examination of foreign policy and security choices.[21] However, this can be complicated by the fact that strategic culture is not a one-size-fits-all concept. Every actor possesses its own operational code, history, assumptions, and strategic culture. To develop a more streamlined research model, it is necessary to narrow national culture variables to those that consistently impact the actor's policy and hold significant value for that specific culture. For this study, a four-variable model suggested by Jeannie Johnson will be adopted, offering valuable insights for the analysis of Iranian strategic culture. The four variables are:\n\n# Identity\nIranian identity is a complex and multifaceted concept influenced by various factors, such as political values, historical experiences, religion, and geographical location. The Islamic Republic of Iran (IRI) has an identity that is defined by the elements of \"nationality\" and \"religion,\" with the weight and importance of these elements fluctuating over time.[23] The distinctive Persian identity has thrived despite many invasions, with the Iranians adopting some of the invaders' ways but adapting them to be more Persian than not.[24] This sense of identity and pride stems from the cultural continuity that has been maintained over time. At the same time, they also manifest themselves in a sense of superiority and exceptionalism over neighboring countries and peoples.[25] Iran's geography has played a crucial role in its history as a land that has been home to various nomads, invaders, and settlers from surrounding areas. Settled within confines between the Caspian Sea in the north and the Persian Gulf in the south, and enclosed by the\nAND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE VOLUME 38, NUMBER 2\nmountains of Zagros and Alborz, these groups were able to live in relative isolation for extended periods, leading to the emergence of numerous ethnic, religious, tribal, and other groupings that often found reasons to be in conflict with one another.26 According to Pollack, “Because of the discrete separation of so much of the population, Iran became a patchwork of ethnic, religious, tribal, and other groupings, all of whom seemed to find constant reasons for conflict with their neighbors.”27\nThe Islamic Revolution enhanced Iran's sense of exceptionalism and created a potent mixture of religious ideology and deep-seated nationalism.28 Willis Stanley underscores that:“[t]he current Iranian leadership appears to have recognizable goals derived from its unique political ideology, which makes use of Shia Islam's gradual consolidation of a clerical caste and historical Iran's concerns about sovereignty and acceptance of an absolute ruler. In this ideology, Iran and Shia Islam are viewed as the same, indivisible.29”\nThe pride in Iran's pre-Islamic history shared by the majority of Iranians is reframed within an Islamist context and integrated into the overarching narrative. The IRI's perception of its own unique centrality is informed by its awareness of the country's role as one of the region's historical powers, today challenged by the alluring influence of the West as an alternative to the righteous path of the Iranian model.\n### Values\nAnthony Cain quotes Vakili-Zad who notes that the ideology of the Islamic Revolution was shaped by:“those who carried the heavy burden of often bloody confrontations with government troops, [and] were, in general, religiously oriented and linked to traditional values from the rural past ... . [T]he blueprint for future society was the Islamic Republic modeled on the one created by the Prophet Muhammad more than 1,400 years earlier.30”\nSeven years before the revolution, Ali Shariati, a leading Iranian sociologist and revolutionary, in his first public lecture on Islamology, insisted that a reassembly of past cultural values would underpin an overturning of the existing order.31 Such a remodeling of values, with an ultimate goal of creating a just society, cannot be achieved without a perennial struggle against the forces of evil. Ayatollah Khomeini believed that the world is perpetually embroiled in a struggle between good and evil, where the forces of virtue must resist domination and fight against oppression and injustice.32 Most importantly, the threats posed by rival cultures that have different sets of\nvalues from which Iranian society must be cleansed. If these values were to reemerge, it would signify the failure of the revolution's primary objective.33 As a result, the IRI's efforts to maintain the ethos of resistance and jihad against presumed or real adversaries are rooted in the moral and spiritual values of the Islamic Revolution. They are essential mechanisms created to insulate Iranian society against subversive foreign cultural influences and project Iran's power to confront its adversaries abroad. In this context, the concept of moqavamat (resistance) plays an important role. Initially originated as a slogan in the Palestinian national movement in the 1960s, it evolved into a quasi-religious doctrine of armed struggle by Palestinian Hamas and Lebanese Hizballah in the 1980s. It was later adopted by Iran. Although the doctrine of resistance has foreign origins, it resonates deeply with those who embrace the Shi'ite martyrdom narrative of Imam Hussein, who chose resistance and martyrdom at Karbala over surrender to the unjust seventh-century Caliph Yazid.34 Iranian scholars Hossein Salimi and Amin Hejazi, while explicitly highlighting the defensive nature of Iranian jihad, mention resistance against oppression and defense of the oppressed, negation of Western dominance, independence, and self-sufficiency as core values of the IRI.35\nTo sum up, the values that emerged after the Islamic Revolution in Iran, shaped by its religiously oriented and traditionally minded founders, are deeply rooted in a Manichean and one-dimensional worldview that pits good against evil, with the West representing the forces of evil threatening Iranian society. These values serve to protect Iran from foreign cultural influences and uphold principles of resistance.\n### Norms\nPierre Pahlavi and Eric Ouellet observe that Iran has often seen itself as isolated and threatened by neighboring countries due to its unique status as the only Persian-speaking, Shia nation in a predominantly Turkish--Arabic, Sunni region. This perception is exacerbated by the country's size, which makes it significant on the global stage but vulnerable to external threats. To cope with these challenges, Iran has historically pursued two strategic goals: protecting “fortress Iran” by maintaining economic autonomy and territorial integrity and expanding its regional influence as a buffer. While these objectives may seem contradictory, they are complementary and can be achieved through both offensive and detente strategies, transcending internal ideological differences.36 Such an ambiguous environment requires a specific set of norms and a distinct strategic culture that would govern the country's modus operandi.\nIndeed, according to some experts, IRI's strategic culture, influenced by the norms derived from both Persian culture and Shia Islam, includes the use\nof strategic ambiguity and deception, avoidance of frontal attacks, and soft power. When the country's interests are at stake, the strict tenets of Islamic jurisprudence can be abrogated under the concept of maslaha, or acting in the public interest.37 In addition, Kayhan Barzegar and Abdolrasool Divsallar speak about strategic patience, use of low-cost engagements, and diminishing rivals' margin to maneuver as the instruments that the current Iranian regime has masterfully applied for decades. Strategic patience is a deliberate postponement of decisions on critical national security issues, allowing Iran to buy time and conserve resources. This approach is particularly useful in situations where strategic limits exist and available resources are insufficient to counter them. Iranians, who lived under constant insecurity, practiced strategic patience as a means of avoiding emotional, reactionary decisions in the face of harsh conditions. Low-cost engagements, such as hybrid warfare and the use of proxies, are other aspects of norms that influence IRI's strategic culture. In countries like Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen, Iran has created a network of foreign fighters, military advisers, and local regime irregulars under Iranian advisory commands. Additionally, Iran employs a defensive strategy aimed at reducing its rivals' margin to maneuver by blocking their actions and limiting their choices. Called, since 2005, “mosaic defense doctrine,” this strategy includes the concept of “all-around defense,” which brings together all state, nonstate, and private actors to confront threats, and “strategic depth,” which involves creating security buffer zones to reduce the risk of direct attacks on Iranian territory. Anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) capabilities, which encompass military, informational, economic, and political measures, are used by Iran to disrupt adversaries' interests and reduce their choices, thereby raising the cost of any potential hostilities.38 Central to “mosaic doctrine” is the mobilization of a vast and dispersed militia force designed to engage invading forces in protracted, attritional warfare, thereby exhausting their resources and resolve.39\n### Perceptive Lens\nThe title of Graham Fuller's 1991 RAND Corporation study, The Center of the Universe, mirrors the perspective of the IRI's elites, who believe that Iran holds a natural, indispensable, and leading role in the Middle East and potentially the entire Muslim world.40 Such an inflated view of centrality and historic role of Iran is underlined by a deep-seated Iranian identity and a broadly shared historical awareness of Iran's power status in the region. Consequently, the occurrences that contradict these self-centered views may cause cognitive dissonance among Iranians. During his captivity as a hostage in the U.S. embassy in Tehran, following its takeover by Iranian “students” in November 1979, William Daugherty, then the Central Intelligence Agency\n(CIA) Chief of Station, noted that his captors struggled to comprehend and were personally offended by his inability to communicate in Persian, the language of what they considered such an important country as Iran.41 Experiences of victimization, insecurity, and feelings of inferiority have contributed to shaping Iran's sense of pride and significance. Initially, Iran was a nation of conquerors, but over time, it was invaded, conquered, and humbled by various powers, such as the Greeks, Arabs, Mongols, and Turks. The most recent manifestation of this victimization complex is linked to the British and Russian quasi-colonial domination of Iran from the nineteenth to the mid-twentieth centuries and the perceived American influence over Iran after World War II.42\nThe centuries of foreign domination had caused an acute sensitivity among Iranians about the role of foreigners in their culture and politics. Iranians believe, as Marvin Zonis emphasizes, that “[t]he rest of the world is somehow so taken with Iran's significance that it cannot let it go.”43 A siege mentality is fortified by real or presumed threats posed by both nearby and distant enemies. As a result, a pervasive culture of conspiracy thinking has emerged within Iranian society, with many viewing external forces as manipulating or undermining their nation's interests. This phenomenon bears a notable resemblance to the dynamics often attributed to the so-called Arab street. According to Fuller, “Rarely are events to be taken at face value, for to assume them as such is (a) to indicate ignorance of the superior forces around oneself or one's nation and (b) to demonstrate the stupidity, naivete, or insensitivity not to perceive the hidden motives of others.”44 Based on this logic, unanticipated events are not merely isolated incidents but rather the result of powerful external forces that dominate or control the situation. The most complex explanation of political events is usually preferred as the most likely, particularly when foreign powers are involved. While specific interpretations may differ based on individual ideological outlooks, the consensus is that it is naive to assume that a series of developments might be unrelated, particularly when a powerful foreign entity is involved.45\nOther cultural characteristics that have their roots in the prolonged periods of insecurity and foreign rule are a general wariness toward those outside one's intimate circle, particularly authority figures and foreigners, as well as a tendency toward cunning or astuteness. As life is perceived as an unpredictable game of chance, where both favorable and unfavorable opportunities arise and vanish without warning, people outside the inner cycle are considered as inherently malevolent, power-hungry, and irrational. There is a lack of trust in interpersonal relationships and altruistic motives are often looked at with suspicion.46 The mistrust leads to the necessity for manipulation in the struggle for survival, “empty and meaningless adulation,” and consequently, an expectation that others will also attempt to manipulate.47 Consequently, the\nfigure of the clever dissimulator, or zeræng, emerges. As described by William Beeman, zeræng is “[a]n operation on the part of an adroit operator that involves thwarting direct interpretation of his own actions or deliberately leading others to erroneous interpretation of those actions while being able to successfully interpret the actions of others.”48 Albeit being an inherently negative trait, it is, nevertheless, highly admired by Iranians as they see cleverness and wiliness as essential strategies for navigating and overcoming stronger forces.49 However, the reliance on zeræng, combined with the ingrained insecurity and anxiety about being deceived by strangers, can sometimes result in Iranian actors overplaying their hand in diplomacy, business dealings, and military activities.\nIn conclusion, the analysis of Iranian strategic culture based on four variables—identity, values, norms, and perceptive lens—demonstrates that Iran's identity is a fusion of nationality and religion, with a strong sense of exceptionalism and historical continuity. The values that emerged after the Islamic Revolution are deeply rooted in a Manichean worldview, pitting good against evil, with the West representing the forces of evil. The perceptive lens of Iran's elites is inflated, believing that Iran's indispensable and leading role in the Middle East and potentially the entire Muslim world would somehow compensate for technological deficiencies.\n## Building the Digital Wall: Iran's Cybersecurity Architecture\n### The Cyber Posture of Small States\nCyberspace is a complex and multifaceted concept, encompassing various subconcepts and nuanced definitions. Rain Ottis and Peeter Lorents describe cyberspace as “a time-dependent set of interconnected information systems and the human users that interact with these systems,” stressing a dynamic nature of cyberspace, where significant changes can occur rapidly, in a shorter time frame than other time-dependent systems.50\nCyberspace is widely considered offense-dominant, inferring that it is easier to execute attacks than to defend against them. Offensive dominance in cyberspace is due to varied and rapidly evolving attack vectors, which defenders struggle to keep up with. Such an asymmetry is in favor of an attacker, as offensive cyber capabilities are perceived to be resource-efficient compared to defensive measures, which are costly and often lag behind technological advancements.51 In parallel, traditional deterrence models face challenges in cyberspace due to difficulties in attribution and the covert nature of cyber capabilities. The anonymity and rapid execution of cyberattacks undermine the effectiveness of deterrence, which relies on the threat of assured retaliation. A key challenge in implementing cyber deterrence is the need for a strong system of protection as the first step, but\nmany countries prioritize offensive operations over defense, neglecting defense and resilience, instead focusing on offensive methods to deter adversaries.52 The system-wide framework analysis that focuses on the broadest dynamics and the systemic cyber risks inherent to the internet may be worth considering. It addresses both top-down factors, such as insecure technical standards, and bottom-up, emergent effects, like the spread of insecure Internet of Things (IoT) devices. This framework encompasses the full spectrum of attacks, including nation-state disruptions, espionage, cybercrime, and even hacking driven by curiosity or entertainment. Within this context, the tools, methods, and activities of offensive and defensive operations are relatively distinct.53\nHowever, the true destructive potential of cyber operations remains uncertain and a subject of ongoing speculation and debate within the cybersecurity community. As Torbjørn Pedersen notes,54 the initial anticipation of a “modern Pearl Harbor” or upcoming global cyberwars has given way to a more nuanced understanding of the limitations of cyber operations expressed in the article by Thomas Rid, “Cyber War Will Not Take Place.”55 According to Lennart Maschmeyer, cyber operations face an operational trilemma, where the three variables of speed, intensity of effect, and control are negatively correlated. This means that, in most cases, cyber operations will be either too slow, too low in intensity, or too unreliable to provide significant strategic utility.56 Overall, however, both opponents and proponents of cyberwar agree that cyberspace offers new methods of undermining national power by achieving strategic impact through ongoing campaigns of covert, less violent cyber operations with cumulative effects.57\nThe cyber capabilities of small states, defined by limited resources and smaller populations, are primarily focused on defensive measures. This is due to constraints in funding, a lack of specialized expertise and intelligence resources, and the high costs involved in developing advanced offensive tools. The notion that cyber capabilities provide an asymmetric advantage to weaker states is contested, as evidence suggests that powerful states with advanced resources are better positioned to exploit cyber operations.58 Jon Lindsay cites the Stuxnet operation of 2009--2010 as a prime example, when a malicious code penetrated the Iranian nuclear facility in Natanz, wiping out around 1,000 centrifuges. Although specific details about the Stuxnet operation's time frame and effects still remain obscure, Lindsay argues that this incident demonstrates that cyber capabilities do not automatically grant an advantage to weaker states. He emphasizes that small states encounter significant challenges in weaponizing cyber capabilities to inflict substantial damage.59 All these challenge the notion of asymmetric advantage of weaker adversaries in the cyberdomain proposed by some, suggesting instead that cyber capabilities tend to favor powerful states.60\nSmall states often adopt a technology-oriented strategic culture and focus on enhancing their defensive measures to protect their critical infrastructure and maintain national security. The effectiveness of cyber strategies varies among states, with some successfully integrating them into their national security frameworks, while others struggle to recognize the opportunities and threats associated with increased cyber engagement. However, small states often adopt several common strategies to compensate for their limited resources and cyber capabilities. These strategies may include:61 Cyber hygiene programs: Investing in national cyber hygiene programs to educate citizens and businesses about basic cybersecurity practices. This involves developing cybersecurity curricula in educational institutions, conducting regular training programs for government and private sector employees, and fostering a culture of cyber awareness. In Iran's case, this approach took the form of creating a “halal net,” a locally controlled version of the internet designed to limit public access to information. Incident response teams: Establishing national Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) or Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) to handle and coordinate responses to cyber incidents. Legislation and policy frameworks: Setting up robust legislative and policy frameworks. These frameworks set out the roles and responsibilities of various stakeholders and establish protocols for incident response and information sharing. Investment in technology: Despite resource limitations, small states are increasingly investing in advanced cyber defense technologies, such as intrusion detection systems, encryption, and secure communication platforms to protect critical infrastructure. Public--private partnerships often play a key role in supporting national cybersecurity strategies, provided there is a skilled workforce and organizational infrastructure to effectively utilize these technologies. Additionally, the absence of economic and technological sanctions mechanisms is crucial, as it allows these states to acquire the necessary technologies without significant barriers.Cyber defense alliances, collaboration, and information sharing with other states, international organizations, and private sector partners to enhance cyber defense capabilities.\nPutting the cyber capabilities of small states in the context of strategic culture, Francis Domingo introduced the concept of “technology-oriented” strategic culture, which refers to small states' inclination to rely on technology as a strategy to overcome limited resources, military capabilities, and strategic depth.62 In this context, technology serves as an enabler for states to pursue foreign policy objectives in a more deliberate and strategic manner. A technology-oriented strategic culture can be identified by examining three key implications for small states: High network readiness: Small states with a technology-oriented strategic culture prioritize the development and maintenance of advanced communication\nnetworks, data systems, and digital infrastructure to enhance their overall connectivity and readiness. Technology-driven military force: These states invest in technology-driven military capabilities, such as advanced weapon systems, unmanned aerial vehicles, and cyberwarfare tools, to augment their military power and strategic reach. Relevance of cybersecurity: Cybersecurity becomes a critical concern for small states with a technology-oriented strategic culture, as they recognize the potential risks and vulnerabilities associated with their reliance on technology. As a result, they prioritize the protection of their digital infrastructure and critical data to ensure their national security and maintain their strategic advantages.63\nIran offers an intriguing case study, as its strategic culture, characterized by its identity, values, norms, and perceptual lens, aligns closely with the defensive cybersecurity posture of many small states. The emphasis on resistance, strategic patience, ambiguity, and low-cost engagements constitutes Iran's approach to cyberspace, reflecting broader trends seen in the cyber strategies of small states. However, over the past decade, Iran has significantly stepped up its offensive cyber capabilities, elevating itself, according to some estimates, to the top of the second tier of global cyberpowers, with aspirations to join the leaders.64\n### Iranian Cyber Capabilities\nIran's initial steps to build its defensive cyber capabilities can be traced back to 2003, when units specializing in cybersecurity were set up within several ministries.65 A 2010 wake-up call occurred with the Stuxnet operation, followed by the “Wiper” and “Flame” malicious code attacks, solidifying the regime's understanding that Iran's adversaries possess a distinct qualitative advantage in offensive cyber activities. By 2016, Iran's cyber capabilities budget was reportedly over USD 1 billion (vs. USD 76 million in 2011), compared to the USD 2 billion budget of the United Kingdom, one of the world's leading cyberpowers. According to Iranian data, the country's cyber budget experienced a twelvefold increase between 2013 and 2021. By the late 2010s, approximately 18% of Iranian university students were studying computer science. Additionally, compulsory military service was utilized to direct technologically skilled graduates toward the state security apparatus, including the MOIS and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC),66 while the topic of cyber defense entered the high school textbook Preparation for Defense.67\nIn March 2012, the Supreme Council of Cyberspace, under the direction of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, was established. The Council is headed by the Iranian President and includes 25 senior government representatives and other key figures, such as the senior commander of the\nIRGC; the head of the Majlis; the Ministers of Science, Communications and Culture; the chief of police; and the president of the Islamic Propaganda Organization. The Council has the power to establish national cyber policy, and its decisions are mandatory for all Iranian institutions operating in the field.68 The National Center for Cyberspace, which is the main division of the Council, is responsible for comprehensive domestic and international surveillance, enforcing the enactments of the council, and preventing Iranians from accessing virtual private networks (VPNs) and internet proxies, which are used to bypass Iran's internet controls.69\nVarious organizations monitor and protect Iran's cyberspace infrastructure. All of them are affiliated with different government institutions and operate in different fields. A key defensive organization within this structure is the Cyberspace Defense Command, which functions under the Passive Defense Organization of the general staff of the armed forces. This organization is made up of both military personnel and representatives from the Communications, Defense, Intelligence, and Industry ministries. Its primary goal is to establish a comprehensive defensive strategy for safeguarding state institutions and infrastructures from potential cyber threats. The Cyberspace Defense Command is primarily focused on defense and does not appear to be engaged in offensive cyber activities. Another defensive entity within Iran's cyberspace structure is the Center for Information Security, also known as MAHER. This center is established and operated under the Communications and Information Technologies Ministry and is primarily responsible for activating computer security incident response teams during emergencies and cyberattacks. Furthermore, MAHER trains skilled manpower, develops response mechanisms for cyber crises, and stores and disseminates data security know-how. The center is responsible for defending all government websites, as well as those of private companies that are officially registered with the Communications Ministry.70 The Committee for Identifying Unauthorized Sites and FATA (an acronym for the Police for the Sphere of the Production and Exchange of Information) act as Iran's cyber police, overseeing internet usage for both domestic suppression and countering cybercrime.71 The IRGC runs its cyber operations, both defensive and offensive, through the IRGC Cyber-Electronic Command (IRGC-CEC), which is headquartered at the Ammar Cyberspace Base.72\nRegarding Iran's offensive cyber capabilities, the IRGC and MOIS are responsible for conducting both independent and joint offensive operations against perceived and real threats to Iranian national security. Among these two entities, the IRGC undoubtedly takes the lead. Its Electronic Warfare and Cyber Defense Organization offers training courses in cyber defense, restricts access to online content, and censors digital communications in Iranian cyberspace73 and “bears primary responsibility for offensive cyber\noperations.”74 By 2009, the IRGC started enlisting professionals for its internal cyberforce, as well as the closely associated military unit known as the Iranian Cyber Army (ICA). That same year, the Basij Cyber Council, another cyber entity overseen by the IRGC, revealed that it had trained 1,500 cybersecurity specialists. These professionals were prepared to join the IRGC's expanding offensive operations and espionage division. In 2010, the Basij cyber unit's leaders publicly declared their intention to launch digital attacks targeted at the actions of the “Zionist Entity,” Israel.75 The IRGC trains, equips, and provides operational support in the cyberdomain to Iranian proxies such as Hezbollah. For instance, in 2021, the IRGC helped establish a cybersecurity unit within Hezbollah's counterintelligence service. In parallel, a cybertraining facility disguised as a branch of Tehran's Sharif University was opened in Dahiye, in the southern suburbs of Beirut.76\nIran's cyberspace development is mainly driven by universities and technological institutes, with a focus on information technology (IT), computer engineering, and communications. Key institutions include Amirkabir University of Technology, Imam Hossein University, Shahid Beheshti University, and Sharif University of Technology. The Iranian government supports IT and computer communications companies through direct and indirect investments, with key government bodies being the Science Ministry, the Information and Communications Ministry, the Technology Cooperation Office, and hi-tech greenhouses like the Pardis Technology Park and Guilan Science and Technology Park.77 Furthermore, the universities play a crucial role in subcontracting cyber operations to front companies and individuals. Over the years, a tiered approach to cyber operations has developed within the Iranian intelligence landscape. At its core is a trusted network of middle managers—often university employees—who are ideologically aligned with the Iranian government and who translate intelligence priorities into segmented cyber tasks. These tasks are then bid out to multiple contractors, where about 50 organizations compete for regime-sponsored projects. The authorities compartmentalize tasks, often requiring different contractors for various parts of a project, such as creating exploits and establishing unauthorized access. Payments are only made upon the completion of the task, as competition is fierce and contractors are pitted against each other. Characteristic in this context is the case of Monica Witt—a former U.S. Air Force intelligence specialist who served in the Air Force from 1997 through 2008 and then with a defense contractor until 2010. Defecting to Iran in 2013, Witt leaked top-secret information to the Iranians, including the identities of U.S. intelligence agents and highly classified intelligence collection programs.78 In 2015, four Iranian hackers, coopted by the IRCG, targeted U.S. intelligence and military personnel in an unsophisticated and poorly executed cyber operation that ultimately failed.79\nAlthough Iran boasts a large network of IT professionals, the Islamic regime's inherent paranoia creates unique challenges. Those with the greatest offensive cyber skills and those demonstrating adherence to the government's ideology are usually mutually exclusive.80 Furthermore, the country is facing a significant brain drain, as many cybersecurity experts are leaving Iran at an alarming pace.\nCooperation with foreign actors, particularly China, North Korea, and Russia, has significantly contributed to Iran's cyber capabilities. In 2015, Russia and Iran signed the first cyber cooperation agreement, recognizing common threats in the cyberdomain. In 2017, a memorandum of understanding for cooperation on information and communication technology (ICT)--related issues, including “internet governance, network security,” and “international internet connection” was signed. In 2021, Russia and Iran concluded the agreement on information security aimed to coordinate activities in response to the growing importance of cyber issues in international relations and ICT-related crimes, as well as the creation of an Iranian “sovereign internet.”81 Since the beginning of the Ukraine conflict in 2022, Russia has supplied Iran with communication-surveillance capabilities, eavesdropping devices, advanced photography equipment, and lie detectors, and reportedly also shared more advanced software with Iran, enabling it to hack phones and systems of dissidents and adversaries. Protei Ltd. a Russian company specializing in communication monitoring tools, has started providing internet censorship software to the Iranian mobile services provider Ariantel. The Protei tools are believed to be part of a developing mobile phone system that would allow Iranian state authorities to directly monitor, intercept, redirect, degrade, or deny mobile communications.82 In 2021, Iranian cybersecurity company Lotus Gostar Arya (or Cysec) opened a branch in Kazan to foster cooperation and exchange of know-how between Iran and Russia.83\nOn 17 January 2025, Russia and Iran further solidified their partnership by signing the “Treaty on Comprehensive Strategic Partnership.” Article 4 of the treaty explicitly stipulates that the intelligence and security services of both nations “shall exchange information and experience and enhance the level of their cooperation.” This agreement is expected to further deepen collaboration in the cyber domain.84\nIn December 2010, the Chinese telecommunications firm ZTE Corp. sold a surveillance system to Iran's Telecommunication Co. of Iran (TCI) as part of a USD 130.6 million networking equipment contract. The surveillance system can monitor landline, mobile, and internet communications. TCI, which had at that time a near monopoly on Iran's landline telephone services, managed a significant portion of Iran's internet traffic.85 In 2019, China and Iran agreed to establish a joint workgroup to tackle cyber threats, emphasizing cooperation in IT, addressing cyber threats, and “counter[ing] U.S.\nunilateralism.”86 In 2009, a significant intelligence failure committed by the CIA occurred when a faulty web-based covert communications system used by the CIA in Iran was exposed, resulting in the arrest and execution of numerous CIA informants. The Iran events coincided with a similar setback in China in 2011 and 2012, where around 30 agents were apprehended and executed. Some officials suspected that the two nations might have collaborated, with Iran offering China technical information about the exposed communications system in exchange for equipment and expertise.87\nIn September 2012, Iran and North Korea signed a technology cooperation agreement, which allegedly included the cyberdomain.88 Iran potentially could have provided information on Stuxnet to North Korea, which ultimately prevented the Stuxnet-similar attack on the North Korean nuclear facility. A tightly controlled network and the inability of physical penetration of the facility to install the worm into the command systems might have also contributed to the failure.89\nTo conclude, Iran shares some defensive strategies with small states, such as resource constraints and the high costs associated with developing sophisticated offensive tools. Iran's investment in education and the development of technological expertise is consistent with the technology-oriented strategic culture described by Domingo. In a similar vein, the country's emphasis on training and harnessing its human capital shows how smaller states leverage technology to compensate for limited resources. The programs focusing on cyber hygiene, incident response teams, and legislative frameworks also mirror the defensive strategies typically adopted by small states.\nHowever, unlike many small states that focus primarily on defense, Iran has developed substantial offensive cyber capabilities. Organizations like the IRGC-CEC and ICA actively engage in offensive operations, targeting both regional adversaries and global entities. This level of offensive capability is more characteristic of larger, more powerful states. The integration of foreign expertise and technology, such as surveillance systems and cybersecurity tools, underscores Iran's ability to leverage international partnerships to bolster its cyber posture. The extent and sophistication of Iran's offensive operations, including cyberespionage and attacks, distinguish it from the typical small-state cyber posture, which often lacks the resources to develop such capabilities. Iran's cyber budget and institutional support structures, including the Supreme Cyberspace Council, are substantial compared to those of typical small states. The scale of investment and the comprehensive nature of its cyber governance framework indicate a level of state commitment that exceeds what is usually seen in smaller states with limited resources.\nSuch a combination of defensive focus, substantial offensive capacity, extensive foreign partnerships, and significant state investment makes Iran a unique player in the cyber landscape of small states.\nLEAKED INSIGHTS: IRAN'S CYBERDFENSE LANDSCAPE AND STRATEGIC CULTURE\nOver the last decade, Iran has been actively building a multifaceted cyber defense system to safeguard its critical infrastructure, suppress opposition groups, and block perceived harmful content, all aimed at maintaining the regime's stability. Guided by the Supreme Council of Cyberspace, Iran's numerous governmental agencies have been at the forefront of the implementation of this strategy. Despite such a concerted effort, the Iranian state organizations, including the MOIS, have been regularly experiencing high-impact leaks. For instance, since 2017 and into 2019, self-declared Iranian dissident groups—such as Lab Dookhtegan, Green Leakers, Black Box, and Hidden Reality—have emerged as “mystery groups” with unclear origins and affiliations.90 Over time, these groups have built reputations as reliable sources of information, exposing Iranian intelligence and military operations both within Iran and across the Middle East.91\nThe agencies tasked with cyber defense, although numerous and mature, are, as it seems, still lacking capabilities and know-how to fully prevent high-impact breaches. The researchers inside Iran have pointed out a number of weak points in the Iranian cyber defense. Hassan Monfared, writing about the cyberwarfare of the Iranian armed forces, finds that they lack a comprehensive view of cyber defense and highlights the need for a systematic approach to stabilize and improve cyber combat readiness across the army ranks.92 Shafiee et al. from Passive Defense Organization see the need to improve management of public opinion through cyberspace and identify several psychological operations techniques aimed at improving the image of the army and countering adversaries' psychological operations.93 Similarly, Mohammad Tabatabaei and Ehsan Movahedian in their study of the U.S cyber influence operations against Iran's internet users stress a gap in Iran's ability to counter foreign cyber influence effectively.94 Abolfazl and Mahdi Rohani stress cyberspace's dual nature as both a threat and opportunity and propose a catalog of measures to effectively managing and mitigating cyber threats. Interestingly enough, the measures proposed by the researchers are strikingly similar to those revealed in the leaked documents discussed below. They include strengthening the Supreme Council of Cyberspace and the National Cyber Space Center's role as the country's cyber focal point; enhancing capabilities of organizations such as the ICA; developing a local internet industry and broadband ecosystem; strengthening local entrepreneurs active in cyberdomain; and more active utilization of cyberspace for conflict, war, competition, and information operations against adversaries.95 Very insightful in this context is the confidential letter produced by Ali Asghar Qaimi, the advisor in the field of communication and IT, security, and cyber defense, to the speaker of the Iranian parliament,\nMohammad Bagher Ghalibaf.96 In it, Qaimi lists sixteen “challenges” faced by the Iranian cyber defense as of January 2024. Among them are: big differences in the quality of online infrastructure in various government bodies; existence of uncovered vulnerabilities and planted backdoors; lack of proper monitoring and action plans to locate and fix vulnerabilities; widespread attempts to cover up problems, incidents, and cyberattacks; lack of organizational discipline within the agencies responsible for vital and sensitive infrastructure; shortage of skilled personnel in the fields of security and cyber defense; utilization of unsuitable external cyber defense products in the vital infrastructure; the multiplicity of decisionmaking authorities and their interference, leading to the adoption of often contradictory decisions; brain drain of cybersecurity experts; and the long and exhausting process of obtaining security licenses and qualifications for individuals and private security companies.97 Qaimi concludes that, because many organizations in Iran fail to meet minimum security requirements, one should expect further cyberattacks, disclosure of information, and disruption of services in the future.98 To sum up, the challenges faced by Iran's cyber defense system, as outlined by Iranian researchers, highlight significant gaps in infrastructure, personnel, and overall preparedness, painting a troubling picture of the country's vulnerability to cyber threats. These weaknesses are also mirrored in a letter by Qaimi that lists several critical deficiencies, providing a realistic view on the current situation with cyber defense.\nThe analysis of the leaked documents begins with the four-year plan, classified as “secret,” laid down on 23 July 2021, by new Minister of Intelligence Hojjat al-Islam Seyyed Ismail Khatib. Although the document tackles the challenges and priorities related to cybersecurity, it does not explicitly describe the current state of cybersecurity in the country. Nevertheless, it highlights the significance of modernizing intelligence infrastructure to address cyber threats effectively, including monitoring, prevention, and capacity building in cyber.99 It also emphasizes the importance of protecting critical infrastructure, combating cyberespionage, and enhancing cooperation with international partners in cybersecurity efforts. The document refers to “the concrete operational plans” that need to be put in place based on the resolutions by the Supreme Council of Cyberspace.100\nIn addition to the four-year plan that due to its programmatic nature tackles the topic of cyber without sufficient depth, six other documents, all of which explicitly focus on various aspects of cybersecurity, will be analyzed using a framework of seven interconnected themes. These themes, which have been consistently addressed in all documents, provide a comprehensive understanding of Iran's approach to cybersecurity:Governance and regulatory framework,National Information Network,\n.International engagement and cyber diplomacy,Control over information flows and protection of Islamic-Iranian identity,Economic and technological integration within the cyberdomain,Human resources and workforce development, andCybersecurity infrastructure and cyber protective mechanisms.\n### Governance and Regulatory Framework\nThe importance of the Supreme Council of Cyberspace as the main body responsible for Iran's cyberdomain has been stressed in all documents. The decisions of the Council must be considered binding and be implemented by all organizations, including the office of the prosecutor and the courts.101 The Council also plays a crucial role in determining the budgetary spending on cybersecurity and monitoring measures to protect Iran's critical infrastructure.102 It is interesting to note in this context that the performance of the National Center for Cyberspace, which is controlled by the Council, is regularly assessed based on the principles of good governance (salamat-e edari).103\n### National Information Network\nEstablishing a “reliable, safe, stable, integrated, and extensive infrastructure throughout the country based on the National Information Network”104 that would enable the regime to “[r]educe as much as possible access to unauthorized foreign platforms”105 is seen as one of the most important priorities monitored by the Council. The Ministry of Communications and Information Technology was entrusted with the responsibility of connecting at least 80% of the country's households and businesses to the National Information Network by the end of 2023.106 In the foreseeable future, Iran's satellite infrastructure and the National Information Network should be integrated, further solidifying the country's digital autonomy and enhancing its cybersecurity capabilities.107\n### International Engagement and Cyber Diplomacy\nIn the international arena, Iran pursues two goals in the cyberdomain: first, to expand cooperation with allied and friendly nations, especially Islamic countries,108 as well as to “[a]chieve an active, strong, and purposeful presence in regional and international assemblies and institutions.”109 Second, Iran seeks to strengthen its position as a formidable cyberpower, leveraging international bodies as deterrent mechanisms in its cyberspace.110 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs plays a major role in setting up a “cyber space diplomacy system,” as well as assisting other state agencies in dealing with international organizations.111\n###\nControl over Information Flows and Protection of Islamic--Iranian Identity\nProtecting the Islamic--Iranian identity and lifestyle is a crucial aspect of cyber defense in Iran. Consequently, the country regulates social media presence in accordance with its laws and values. The Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance plays a significant role in this regard, responsible for registering official accounts, closing fake accounts, and blocking unauthorized advertisements of foreign social networks.112 As a countermeasure to potential threats in the digital space, content providers in Iran are required to promote the “discourse of the Islamic Revolution” and contribute to the creation of a “new Islamic civilization in cyberspace.”113 Government employees are forbidden from being present on “unauthorized social media platforms” without permission and required to follow guidelines and regulations if they are present on “approved” platforms.114\n### Economic and Technological Integration within the Cyberdomain\nIn the field of economic and technological integration within the cyberdomain, Iran pursues a twofold strategy—increasing the share of domestic products and services in cybersecurity, and supporting local providers. Thus, the need to double the local content of products and services has been emphasized time and again in different strategic documents.115 In parallel, the share of the digital segment in the Iranian economy is planned to reach 10% by 2031,116 while some suggest that the same share should be set at 20% of the Gross Domestic Product.117 Support of the local providers of products and services is considered vital. Several authors recommend that authorities make “[m]aximum usage of private cyber security contractors”118 and “support companies, particularly in the fields of security systems, locally-built browsers, and national messengers.”119\n### Human Resources and Workforce Development\nIn addition, it is considered crucial to address the need to establish criteria for recruiting, retaining, and protecting experts in the cybersecurity domain, as such plans require careful design and implementation.120 The salaries of cybersecurity specialists should be increased and the issue of brain drain requires urgent attention.121 Furthermore, the cybersecurity literacy among government employees needs to be addressed through internal training and specialized courses.122 The number of student admissions in cybersecurity-related fields also needs to be expanded.123 The goal is to create a reservoir of skilled and efficient cybersecurity experts, thereby gaining a strategic advantage for Iran in this area.124\nCybersecurity Infrastructure and Cyber Protective Mechanisms\nIran's cyber defense strategy has, over the decade, evolved as a multifaceted approach that includes regular assessments, clear role assignments, and a catalogue of proactive measures. The establishment and continuous development of cybersecurity measures within all state institutions are considered critical in safeguarding national security. The institutions are obliged to create and implement comprehensive cyberspace security plans to prevent, combat, and manage cyber incidents,125 including cyber drills.126 Additionally, regular evaluations and situational reports mandated to assess the fulfillment of cybersecurity tasks must be submitted to the Supreme Council of Cyberspace.127 Nongovernmental institutions are also urged to organize and enhance their cybersecurity capabilities.128\nAccording to the top-secret document of April 2023, the task of guarding Iran's cyber borders was at that time the responsibility of the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology. However, the document complains that this mission is not logically aligned with the Ministry's posture in protecting Iran's communication and information infrastructure. As a result, the role of the armed forces and the country's intelligence agencies in this area has been overlooked. Hence, it was necessary to reevaluate the legal framework for cyber border protection and consider assigning this important task to an organization that is better equipped to handle it. In addition, a plethora of organizations responsible for cyber defense, including the Passive Defense Organization, the Center for Information Security, and the cyber police (FATA), have overlapping responsibilities. This requires a clear definition of their roles and duties, particularly in their relations to the armed forces, the IRGC, and the Ministry of Intelligence.129 Furthermore, the general staff of the armed forces was “[t]asked to prepare a national program to prevent and address defense-security threats posed by unauthorized satellite systems for Iranian cyber space.”130\nThe insights gained from the documents examined in this section underline the key premises of strategic culture defined earlier. The overall structure of Iran's cyber governance is heavily centralized, reflecting Iran's historical preference for a strong, centralized leadership, which is seen as necessary to maintain order and control in a complex and multifaceted society. The country's commitment to reducing foreign dependence and fostering a self-reliant digital economy aligns with the drive toward self-sufficiency and autonomy as seen through historical experience of invasions and influence from foreign powers. In the eternal struggle between virtue and evil, a dwindling human capital in the cyberdomain needs to be exploited and protected to advance the country's strategic interests, as the entire society should remain resilient, in line with the values of vigilance and resistance against external threats. Internationally, Iran considers itself a leader of the\nIslamic world that stays firm in the face of Western influence. By leveraging international bodies as deterrent mechanisms, the regime attempts to project power and protect its interests in cyberspace. Iran's dual strategy of enhancing domestic cybersecurity capabilities while also striving for technological independence and integration into the global cyberdomain mirrors its cultural emphasis on adaptability to secure the country's position in a complex and competitive international environment. The role of cultural and media institutions in cyberspace is critical for the regime, as their task is to promote the dual elements of Iranian identity—nationality and religion. Such an emphasis on aligning cyber content with Islamic principles demonstrates the intertwining of religious ideology with national identity, as it reinforces the regime's narrative and counters foreign cultural influence.\nFinally, while concrete data are lacking, it is reasonable to infer that the multidecade economic and technological sanctions imposed on Iran have significantly affected its cyber defense capabilities, influencing both its strategy and the evolution of its cyber infrastructure. These sanctions have severely limited Iran's ability to acquire advanced cyber defense technologies, as restrictions on access to key software, hardware, and encryption technologies hinder the country's efforts to build a sophisticated cybersecurity infrastructure. A comprehensive analysis examining the impact of sanctions on Iran's cyber defense capabilities would be a fascinating subject for further study, shedding light on the consequences of such restrictions and their potential long-term effects on a nation's ability to protect itself in the cyber realm.\n## CONCLUSION\nA strategic culture that shaped Iranian perceptions, values, and norms has its roots in Persian culture and Shia Islam. Iran's historical experiences of conquest and foreign domination have led to a siege mentality, conspiracy thinking, and the admiration of cunning and manipulation. Besides, a unique blend of historical experiences and geostrategic positions have shaped Iran's sense of identity and its perception of exceptionalism and superiority. Some Iranian authors even advance the notion of “geopolitical superiority,” arguing that Iran's strategic positioning and its “geographical gravity” can somehow compensate for its technological deficiencies—a belief that underestimates the role of and need for technological advancement in the face of modern threats and evolving security dynamics.131\nConsequently, these specific operational codes, histories, and assumptions of strategic culture have a significant influence on the country's cyber defense posture, characterized by heightened sensitivity to cyberattacks by hostile actors. The Stuxnet attack was probably a pivotal moment that revealed Iran's vulnerabilities to advanced cyber threats from hostile actors and solidified the Manichean worldview of ruling elites about perceived external\nthreats, especially those emanating from the West. Over the last decade, Iran adopted a multifaceted approach to safeguarding infrastructure, suppressing opposition, and countering foreign influence. Iran has achieved a unique position in the cyber landscape that is characterized by a mix of defensive focus, offensive capabilities, partnerships with allied states, and significant state investment. The country's comprehensive cyber strategy and governance framework position it as a formidable player, blending characteristics of both small and larger states.\nOver the last few years, Iranian-affiliated cyber threat actors have demonstrated the ability to execute sustained, complex, and disruptive operations across multiple sectors outside of Iran. These groups frequently utilize advanced tactics, techniques, and procedures, continuously refining their strategies to avoid detection and maintain access to compromised networks. The coordination among these actors and their shared use of resources and tools demonstrate a unified effort to support Iran's geopolitical aims. Their ongoing use of destructive malware, ransomware, and espionage operations underscores the threat they pose, particularly in the context of regional tensions and global political events. Thus, Iran was one of the most assertive foreign actors attempting to create discord ahead of the 2024 U.S. presidential elections. Iranian operatives have launched influence operations targeting U.S. audiences, potentially aiming to sway the outcome of the elections. This cyber-enabled influence campaign is being driven by a mix of actors conducting preliminary cyber reconnaissance and inserting online personas and websites into the information ecosystem. In June 2024, hackers linked to the IRGC successfully infiltrated the Trump campaign, stealing internal documents and leaking them to media outlets.132\nIn the cyber defensive domain, the leaked documents mostly confirm the conclusions derived from the sources available in the public domain. The materials show that Iran has developed a multifaceted cyber defense system aimed at protecting its critical infrastructure, controlling information, and maintaining regime stability. The Supreme Council of Cyberspace oversees this strategy, coordinating efforts across various governmental agencies. Highly centralized cyber governance aims at strengthening the country's self-reliance and reducing foreign dependence, aligning with Iran's strategic culture of resistance to external influences. Internationally, Iran's posture is marked by adaptability and resilience to secure its position in the global cyberdomain. However, despite the extensive cyber defense measures, Iran still faces significant challenges, such as weaknesses in comprehensive defense strategies, management of public opinion, and countering foreign influence operations. Numerous high-impact leaks experienced by Iranian state organizations revealed persistent issues with infrastructure quality, cyber threat monitoring, and organizational discipline.\nROLE OF STRATEGIC CULTURE IN IRAN'S CYBER DEFENSE POLICY\n\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author.",

This culture combines a strong national pride and historical consciousness with values centered on resisting external influences. Ultimately, strategic culture has influenced the country’s cyber capabilities, which have significantly evolved since 2003, largely due to state investment and the establishment of the Supreme Council of Cyberspace in 2012. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and the Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS) lead offensive cyber operations, making Iran’s cyber posture more aligned with larger state powers than typical small states. Leaked documents from the Iranian opposition disclosed that Iran has actively developed a comprehensive cyber defense framework over the past decade to protect its critical infrastructure, quell opposition, and control presumed harmful content to maintain regime stability. Despite these efforts, leaks from dissident groups have exposed persistent weaknesses in Iran’s cyber defense, highlighting challenges in infrastructure, threat monitoring, and organizational discipline. Moreover, these leaks reveal Iran’s strategic focus on self-reliance and resistance to foreign influence.\nDr. Grigorij Serscikov is an Independent Researcher and Consultant with over fifteen years of experience in offering strategic advice and analysis to companies within the energy and financial sectors. He earned his master’s degree in Crisis and Security Management from Leiden University and a Ph.D. from the University of Dundee. Several of his articles were published in this journal. The author can be contacted at greg.serscikov@gmail.com.\n© 2025 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC AND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE VOLUME 38, NUMBER 2 On 26 January 2022, a Persian-speaking group called “GhyamSarnegouni,” which translates as “Rebellion to Overthrow,” established a Telegram account and began leaking internal documents, including many classified as “secret” or “top secret.”1 The group with alleged ties to the leading Iranian opposition movement Mojahedin-e Khalq (MEK), currently based in Albania, claimed that it gained access to 120 servers connected to late President Ebrahim Raisi's internal network and central databases, encompassing more than 1,300 computers.2 As of this publication, the group continues to release internal documents.\nWhile the Iranian authorities called the hack “fake,” experts have confirmed its legitimacy.3 The author is aware that the authenticity of the trove could always be questioned due to the sensitivity of the topic for national security and the lack of comparable materials in the public domain. However, the credibility of the leaked documents—that is, the context in which the documents were produced and the intentions of the authors who wrote them4—although it invites certain skepticism, does not currently challenge its validity. Similarly, the representativeness of the papers is established through the sheer volume of the leaked materials on the various topics of Iranian internal and external policies. Therefore, while the authenticity of the documents may be subject to debate, their credibility and representativeness are well established, providing a solid foundation for the research.\nAmong the wealth of primary sources made available to the public, there were several related to Iran's cyber defense strategies, providing researchers with insights into the country's cybersecurity programs. One key document is titled, “The Program Proposed by the Minister of Intelligence Hojjat al-Islam wal-Muslimeen Seyyed Ismail Khatib for the 13th government Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, 23 July 2021”5—the newly appointed head of the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence (MOIS).6 In it, Khatib outlined his vision for the evolution of the MOIS over the next four years, addressing inter alia issues related to Iranian cybersecurity. Other documents that will be examined in this study are: “The Ninety-Fourth Session of the Supreme Council of the Country's Cyber Space of 16 August 2023,”7 “The Ninety-Second Meeting of the Supreme Council of Cyberspace of June 27, 2023,”8 “Parts One and Two of the Strategic Document of the Islamic Republic of Iran on Cyber Space of July 14, 2021,”9 “Requirements and Measures Related to the Use of Satellite Systems in Cyberspace of 30 August 2022,”10 “Opinion Regarding the Promotion of the Cyber Space of 9 April 2023,”11 and “The Letter of the Advisor to the Speaker of the Parliament in the Field of Communication and Information Technology, Security and Cyber Defense of 16 January 2024.”12 Furthermore, Persian-language academic journals published in Iran, such as The Quarterly Journal of Multidisciplinary Studies for Strategic Knowledge, Strategic Studies Quarterly, and The Quarterly of Political Strategic Studies have been tackling the themes related to cybersecurity for almost a decade. Rarely quoted in the West, these publications, whose authors are often affiliated with the country's intelligence and military community, provide an outside-in perspective on the topic and, as will be shown, significantly complement primary sources.\nIranian cyber defense will be examined within the framework of a case study approach—a reliable and often-used methodology to explore the case's “why” and/or “how” questions in situations of complex causality where the researcher has limited control.13 This approach will be further strengthened through a detailed and systematic analysis of the leaked documents, which will play a central role in the research. By integrating the insights derived from the documents, the case study method enables the researcher to achieve high levels of “conceptual validity”—the identification of the most representative features within the specific context of Iranian cyber defense.14 The concept of strategic culture will be applied as a theoretical avenue for the analysis. First appearing in the late 1970s,15 the idea has experienced several waves of scholarly attention since then.16 Johnson and Larsen define strategic culture as “[a] set of shared beliefs, assumptions, and modes of behavior, derived from common experiences and accepted narratives (both oral and written), that shape collective identity and relationships to other groups, and which determine appropriate ends and means for achieving security objectives.”17 A country's strategic culture is not randomly chosen or influenced by intellectual trends. It is shaped by the character and context of its society and becomes, in the views of Jeremy Black, a “cultural assumption” that fits the nation's strategic needs and influences its strategic behavior.18 Strategic culture, which is rooted in historical experiences, can evolve but cannot be easily discarded. It is a crucial factor in a country's strategic effectiveness, but it is not infinitely adaptable. Radical changes in culture only occur as a result of significant political, social, or military shocks. Strategic cultures borrow and adapt from one another, but this process has its limits.\nThe concept of strategic culture is highly suitable for the analysis of cybersecurity and cyberwarfare. For instance, the study prepared for the U.S. Cyber Command applied the notion of strategic culture as a theoretical foundation to build four case studies, one of them Iran.19 The author believes that the concept offers an additional advantage for this research, as it allows for deriving further insights and drawing implications from the primary and secondary sources as well as tracing the development of Iran's strategies to cybersecurity in general and cyber defense in particular during a specific period.20 ROLE OF STRATEGIC CULTURE IN IRAN'S CYBER DEFENSE POLICY # IRANIAN STRATEGIC CULTURE Strategic culture faces the challenge of not having a clear collection of principles or a well-established theoretical framework. The common ground for strategic culture generally involves acknowledging culture as an epiphenomenal factor in the examination of foreign policy and security choices.[21] However, this can be complicated by the fact that strategic culture is not a one-size-fits-all concept. Every actor possesses its own operational code, history, assumptions, and strategic culture. To develop a more streamlined research model, it is necessary to narrow national culture variables to those that consistently impact the actor's policy and hold significant value for that specific culture. For this study, a four-variable model suggested by Jeannie Johnson will be adopted, offering valuable insights for the analysis of Iranian strategic culture. The four variables are:\n\n# Identity\nIranian identity is a complex and multifaceted concept influenced by various factors, such as political values, historical experiences, religion, and geographical location. The Islamic Republic of Iran (IRI) has an identity that is defined by the elements of \"nationality\" and \"religion,\" with the weight and importance of these elements fluctuating over time.[23] The distinctive Persian identity has thrived despite many invasions, with the Iranians adopting some of the invaders' ways but adapting them to be more Persian than not.[24] This sense of identity and pride stems from the cultural continuity that has been maintained over time. At the same time, they also manifest themselves in a sense of superiority and exceptionalism over neighboring countries and peoples.[25] Iran's geography has played a crucial role in its history as a land that has been home to various nomads, invaders, and settlers from surrounding areas. Settled within confines between the Caspian Sea in the north and the Persian Gulf in the south, and enclosed by the\nAND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE VOLUME 38, NUMBER 2\nmountains of Zagros and Alborz, these groups were able to live in relative isolation for extended periods, leading to the emergence of numerous ethnic, religious, tribal, and other groupings that often found reasons to be in conflict with one another.26 According to Pollack, “Because of the discrete separation of so much of the population, Iran became a patchwork of ethnic, religious, tribal, and other groupings, all of whom seemed to find constant reasons for conflict with their neighbors.”27\nThe Islamic Revolution enhanced Iran's sense of exceptionalism and created a potent mixture of religious ideology and deep-seated nationalism.28 Willis Stanley underscores that:“[t]he current Iranian leadership appears to have recognizable goals derived from its unique political ideology, which makes use of Shia Islam's gradual consolidation of a clerical caste and historical Iran's concerns about sovereignty and acceptance of an absolute ruler. In this ideology, Iran and Shia Islam are viewed as the same, indivisible.29”\nThe pride in Iran's pre-Islamic history shared by the majority of Iranians is reframed within an Islamist context and integrated into the overarching narrative. The IRI's perception of its own unique centrality is informed by its awareness of the country's role as one of the region's historical powers, today challenged by the alluring influence of the West as an alternative to the righteous path of the Iranian model.\n### Values\nAnthony Cain quotes Vakili-Zad who notes that the ideology of the Islamic Revolution was shaped by:“those who carried the heavy burden of often bloody confrontations with government troops, [and] were, in general, religiously oriented and linked to traditional values from the rural past ... . [T]he blueprint for future society was the Islamic Republic modeled on the one created by the Prophet Muhammad more than 1,400 years earlier.30”\nSeven years before the revolution, Ali Shariati, a leading Iranian sociologist and revolutionary, in his first public lecture on Islamology, insisted that a reassembly of past cultural values would underpin an overturning of the existing order.31 Such a remodeling of values, with an ultimate goal of creating a just society, cannot be achieved without a perennial struggle against the forces of evil. Ayatollah Khomeini believed that the world is perpetually embroiled in a struggle between good and evil, where the forces of virtue must resist domination and fight against oppression and injustice.32 Most importantly, the threats posed by rival cultures that have different sets of\nvalues from which Iranian society must be cleansed. If these values were to reemerge, it would signify the failure of the revolution's primary objective.33 As a result, the IRI's efforts to maintain the ethos of resistance and jihad against presumed or real adversaries are rooted in the moral and spiritual values of the Islamic Revolution. They are essential mechanisms created to insulate Iranian society against subversive foreign cultural influences and project Iran's power to confront its adversaries abroad. In this context, the concept of moqavamat (resistance) plays an important role. Initially originated as a slogan in the Palestinian national movement in the 1960s, it evolved into a quasi-religious doctrine of armed struggle by Palestinian Hamas and Lebanese Hizballah in the 1980s. It was later adopted by Iran. Although the doctrine of resistance has foreign origins, it resonates deeply with those who embrace the Shi'ite martyrdom narrative of Imam Hussein, who chose resistance and martyrdom at Karbala over surrender to the unjust seventh-century Caliph Yazid.34 Iranian scholars Hossein Salimi and Amin Hejazi, while explicitly highlighting the defensive nature of Iranian jihad, mention resistance against oppression and defense of the oppressed, negation of Western dominance, independence, and self-sufficiency as core values of the IRI.35\nTo sum up, the values that emerged after the Islamic Revolution in Iran, shaped by its religiously oriented and traditionally minded founders, are deeply rooted in a Manichean and one-dimensional worldview that pits good against evil, with the West representing the forces of evil threatening Iranian society. These values serve to protect Iran from foreign cultural influences and uphold principles of resistance.\n### Norms\nPierre Pahlavi and Eric Ouellet observe that Iran has often seen itself as isolated and threatened by neighboring countries due to its unique status as the only Persian-speaking, Shia nation in a predominantly Turkish--Arabic, Sunni region. This perception is exacerbated by the country's size, which makes it significant on the global stage but vulnerable to external threats. To cope with these challenges, Iran has historically pursued two strategic goals: protecting “fortress Iran” by maintaining economic autonomy and territorial integrity and expanding its regional influence as a buffer. While these objectives may seem contradictory, they are complementary and can be achieved through both offensive and detente strategies, transcending internal ideological differences.36 Such an ambiguous environment requires a specific set of norms and a distinct strategic culture that would govern the country's modus operandi.\nIndeed, according to some experts, IRI's strategic culture, influenced by the norms derived from both Persian culture and Shia Islam, includes the use\nof strategic ambiguity and deception, avoidance of frontal attacks, and soft power. When the country's interests are at stake, the strict tenets of Islamic jurisprudence can be abrogated under the concept of maslaha, or acting in the public interest.37 In addition, Kayhan Barzegar and Abdolrasool Divsallar speak about strategic patience, use of low-cost engagements, and diminishing rivals' margin to maneuver as the instruments that the current Iranian regime has masterfully applied for decades. Strategic patience is a deliberate postponement of decisions on critical national security issues, allowing Iran to buy time and conserve resources. This approach is particularly useful in situations where strategic limits exist and available resources are insufficient to counter them. Iranians, who lived under constant insecurity, practiced strategic patience as a means of avoiding emotional, reactionary decisions in the face of harsh conditions. Low-cost engagements, such as hybrid warfare and the use of proxies, are other aspects of norms that influence IRI's strategic culture. In countries like Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen, Iran has created a network of foreign fighters, military advisers, and local regime irregulars under Iranian advisory commands. Additionally, Iran employs a defensive strategy aimed at reducing its rivals' margin to maneuver by blocking their actions and limiting their choices. Called, since 2005, “mosaic defense doctrine,” this strategy includes the concept of “all-around defense,” which brings together all state, nonstate, and private actors to confront threats, and “strategic depth,” which involves creating security buffer zones to reduce the risk of direct attacks on Iranian territory. Anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) capabilities, which encompass military, informational, economic, and political measures, are used by Iran to disrupt adversaries' interests and reduce their choices, thereby raising the cost of any potential hostilities.38 Central to “mosaic doctrine” is the mobilization of a vast and dispersed militia force designed to engage invading forces in protracted, attritional warfare, thereby exhausting their resources and resolve.39\n### Perceptive Lens\nThe title of Graham Fuller's 1991 RAND Corporation study, The Center of the Universe, mirrors the perspective of the IRI's elites, who believe that Iran holds a natural, indispensable, and leading role in the Middle East and potentially the entire Muslim world.40 Such an inflated view of centrality and historic role of Iran is underlined by a deep-seated Iranian identity and a broadly shared historical awareness of Iran's power status in the region. Consequently, the occurrences that contradict these self-centered views may cause cognitive dissonance among Iranians. During his captivity as a hostage in the U.S. embassy in Tehran, following its takeover by Iranian “students” in November 1979, William Daugherty, then the Central Intelligence Agency\n(CIA) Chief of Station, noted that his captors struggled to comprehend and were personally offended by his inability to communicate in Persian, the language of what they considered such an important country as Iran.41 Experiences of victimization, insecurity, and feelings of inferiority have contributed to shaping Iran's sense of pride and significance. Initially, Iran was a nation of conquerors, but over time, it was invaded, conquered, and humbled by various powers, such as the Greeks, Arabs, Mongols, and Turks. The most recent manifestation of this victimization complex is linked to the British and Russian quasi-colonial domination of Iran from the nineteenth to the mid-twentieth centuries and the perceived American influence over Iran after World War II.42\nThe centuries of foreign domination had caused an acute sensitivity among Iranians about the role of foreigners in their culture and politics. Iranians believe, as Marvin Zonis emphasizes, that “[t]he rest of the world is somehow so taken with Iran's significance that it cannot let it go.”43 A siege mentality is fortified by real or presumed threats posed by both nearby and distant enemies. As a result, a pervasive culture of conspiracy thinking has emerged within Iranian society, with many viewing external forces as manipulating or undermining their nation's interests. This phenomenon bears a notable resemblance to the dynamics often attributed to the so-called Arab street. According to Fuller, “Rarely are events to be taken at face value, for to assume them as such is (a) to indicate ignorance of the superior forces around oneself or one's nation and (b) to demonstrate the stupidity, naivete, or insensitivity not to perceive the hidden motives of others.”44 Based on this logic, unanticipated events are not merely isolated incidents but rather the result of powerful external forces that dominate or control the situation. The most complex explanation of political events is usually preferred as the most likely, particularly when foreign powers are involved. While specific interpretations may differ based on individual ideological outlooks, the consensus is that it is naive to assume that a series of developments might be unrelated, particularly when a powerful foreign entity is involved.45\nOther cultural characteristics that have their roots in the prolonged periods of insecurity and foreign rule are a general wariness toward those outside one's intimate circle, particularly authority figures and foreigners, as well as a tendency toward cunning or astuteness. As life is perceived as an unpredictable game of chance, where both favorable and unfavorable opportunities arise and vanish without warning, people outside the inner cycle are considered as inherently malevolent, power-hungry, and irrational. There is a lack of trust in interpersonal relationships and altruistic motives are often looked at with suspicion.46 The mistrust leads to the necessity for manipulation in the struggle for survival, “empty and meaningless adulation,” and consequently, an expectation that others will also attempt to manipulate.47 Consequently, the\nfigure of the clever dissimulator, or zeræng, emerges. As described by William Beeman, zeræng is “[a]n operation on the part of an adroit operator that involves thwarting direct interpretation of his own actions or deliberately leading others to erroneous interpretation of those actions while being able to successfully interpret the actions of others.”48 Albeit being an inherently negative trait, it is, nevertheless, highly admired by Iranians as they see cleverness and wiliness as essential strategies for navigating and overcoming stronger forces.49 However, the reliance on zeræng, combined with the ingrained insecurity and anxiety about being deceived by strangers, can sometimes result in Iranian actors overplaying their hand in diplomacy, business dealings, and military activities.\nIn conclusion, the analysis of Iranian strategic culture based on four variables—identity, values, norms, and perceptive lens—demonstrates that Iran's identity is a fusion of nationality and religion, with a strong sense of exceptionalism and historical continuity. The values that emerged after the Islamic Revolution are deeply rooted in a Manichean worldview, pitting good against evil, with the West representing the forces of evil. The perceptive lens of Iran's elites is inflated, believing that Iran's indispensable and leading role in the Middle East and potentially the entire Muslim world would somehow compensate for technological deficiencies.\n## Building the Digital Wall: Iran's Cybersecurity Architecture\n### The Cyber Posture of Small States\nCyberspace is a complex and multifaceted concept, encompassing various subconcepts and nuanced definitions. Rain Ottis and Peeter Lorents describe cyberspace as “a time-dependent set of interconnected information systems and the human users that interact with these systems,” stressing a dynamic nature of cyberspace, where significant changes can occur rapidly, in a shorter time frame than other time-dependent systems.50\nCyberspace is widely considered offense-dominant, inferring that it is easier to execute attacks than to defend against them. Offensive dominance in cyberspace is due to varied and rapidly evolving attack vectors, which defenders struggle to keep up with. Such an asymmetry is in favor of an attacker, as offensive cyber capabilities are perceived to be resource-efficient compared to defensive measures, which are costly and often lag behind technological advancements.51 In parallel, traditional deterrence models face challenges in cyberspace due to difficulties in attribution and the covert nature of cyber capabilities. The anonymity and rapid execution of cyberattacks undermine the effectiveness of deterrence, which relies on the threat of assured retaliation. A key challenge in implementing cyber deterrence is the need for a strong system of protection as the first step, but\nmany countries prioritize offensive operations over defense, neglecting defense and resilience, instead focusing on offensive methods to deter adversaries.52 The system-wide framework analysis that focuses on the broadest dynamics and the systemic cyber risks inherent to the internet may be worth considering. It addresses both top-down factors, such as insecure technical standards, and bottom-up, emergent effects, like the spread of insecure Internet of Things (IoT) devices. This framework encompasses the full spectrum of attacks, including nation-state disruptions, espionage, cybercrime, and even hacking driven by curiosity or entertainment. Within this context, the tools, methods, and activities of offensive and defensive operations are relatively distinct.53\nHowever, the true destructive potential of cyber operations remains uncertain and a subject of ongoing speculation and debate within the cybersecurity community. As Torbjørn Pedersen notes,54 the initial anticipation of a “modern Pearl Harbor” or upcoming global cyberwars has given way to a more nuanced understanding of the limitations of cyber operations expressed in the article by Thomas Rid, “Cyber War Will Not Take Place.”55 According to Lennart Maschmeyer, cyber operations face an operational trilemma, where the three variables of speed, intensity of effect, and control are negatively correlated. This means that, in most cases, cyber operations will be either too slow, too low in intensity, or too unreliable to provide significant strategic utility.56 Overall, however, both opponents and proponents of cyberwar agree that cyberspace offers new methods of undermining national power by achieving strategic impact through ongoing campaigns of covert, less violent cyber operations with cumulative effects.57\nThe cyber capabilities of small states, defined by limited resources and smaller populations, are primarily focused on defensive measures. This is due to constraints in funding, a lack of specialized expertise and intelligence resources, and the high costs involved in developing advanced offensive tools. The notion that cyber capabilities provide an asymmetric advantage to weaker states is contested, as evidence suggests that powerful states with advanced resources are better positioned to exploit cyber operations.58 Jon Lindsay cites the Stuxnet operation of 2009--2010 as a prime example, when a malicious code penetrated the Iranian nuclear facility in Natanz, wiping out around 1,000 centrifuges. Although specific details about the Stuxnet operation's time frame and effects still remain obscure, Lindsay argues that this incident demonstrates that cyber capabilities do not automatically grant an advantage to weaker states. He emphasizes that small states encounter significant challenges in weaponizing cyber capabilities to inflict substantial damage.59 All these challenge the notion of asymmetric advantage of weaker adversaries in the cyberdomain proposed by some, suggesting instead that cyber capabilities tend to favor powerful states.60\nSmall states often adopt a technology-oriented strategic culture and focus on enhancing their defensive measures to protect their critical infrastructure and maintain national security. The effectiveness of cyber strategies varies among states, with some successfully integrating them into their national security frameworks, while others struggle to recognize the opportunities and threats associated with increased cyber engagement. However, small states often adopt several common strategies to compensate for their limited resources and cyber capabilities. These strategies may include:61 Cyber hygiene programs: Investing in national cyber hygiene programs to educate citizens and businesses about basic cybersecurity practices. This involves developing cybersecurity curricula in educational institutions, conducting regular training programs for government and private sector employees, and fostering a culture of cyber awareness. In Iran's case, this approach took the form of creating a “halal net,” a locally controlled version of the internet designed to limit public access to information. Incident response teams: Establishing national Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) or Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) to handle and coordinate responses to cyber incidents. Legislation and policy frameworks: Setting up robust legislative and policy frameworks. These frameworks set out the roles and responsibilities of various stakeholders and establish protocols for incident response and information sharing. Investment in technology: Despite resource limitations, small states are increasingly investing in advanced cyber defense technologies, such as intrusion detection systems, encryption, and secure communication platforms to protect critical infrastructure. Public--private partnerships often play a key role in supporting national cybersecurity strategies, provided there is a skilled workforce and organizational infrastructure to effectively utilize these technologies. Additionally, the absence of economic and technological sanctions mechanisms is crucial, as it allows these states to acquire the necessary technologies without significant barriers.Cyber defense alliances, collaboration, and information sharing with other states, international organizations, and private sector partners to enhance cyber defense capabilities.\nPutting the cyber capabilities of small states in the context of strategic culture, Francis Domingo introduced the concept of “technology-oriented” strategic culture, which refers to small states' inclination to rely on technology as a strategy to overcome limited resources, military capabilities, and strategic depth.62 In this context, technology serves as an enabler for states to pursue foreign policy objectives in a more deliberate and strategic manner. A technology-oriented strategic culture can be identified by examining three key implications for small states: High network readiness: Small states with a technology-oriented strategic culture prioritize the development and maintenance of advanced communication\nnetworks, data systems, and digital infrastructure to enhance their overall connectivity and readiness. Technology-driven military force: These states invest in technology-driven military capabilities, such as advanced weapon systems, unmanned aerial vehicles, and cyberwarfare tools, to augment their military power and strategic reach. Relevance of cybersecurity: Cybersecurity becomes a critical concern for small states with a technology-oriented strategic culture, as they recognize the potential risks and vulnerabilities associated with their reliance on technology. As a result, they prioritize the protection of their digital infrastructure and critical data to ensure their national security and maintain their strategic advantages.63\nIran offers an intriguing case study, as its strategic culture, characterized by its identity, values, norms, and perceptual lens, aligns closely with the defensive cybersecurity posture of many small states. The emphasis on resistance, strategic patience, ambiguity, and low-cost engagements constitutes Iran's approach to cyberspace, reflecting broader trends seen in the cyber strategies of small states. However, over the past decade, Iran has significantly stepped up its offensive cyber capabilities, elevating itself, according to some estimates, to the top of the second tier of global cyberpowers, with aspirations to join the leaders.64\n### Iranian Cyber Capabilities\nIran's initial steps to build its defensive cyber capabilities can be traced back to 2003, when units specializing in cybersecurity were set up within several ministries.65 A 2010 wake-up call occurred with the Stuxnet operation, followed by the “Wiper” and “Flame” malicious code attacks, solidifying the regime's understanding that Iran's adversaries possess a distinct qualitative advantage in offensive cyber activities. By 2016, Iran's cyber capabilities budget was reportedly over USD 1 billion (vs. USD 76 million in 2011), compared to the USD 2 billion budget of the United Kingdom, one of the world's leading cyberpowers. According to Iranian data, the country's cyber budget experienced a twelvefold increase between 2013 and 2021. By the late 2010s, approximately 18% of Iranian university students were studying computer science. Additionally, compulsory military service was utilized to direct technologically skilled graduates toward the state security apparatus, including the MOIS and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC),66 while the topic of cyber defense entered the high school textbook Preparation for Defense.67\nIn March 2012, the Supreme Council of Cyberspace, under the direction of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, was established. The Council is headed by the Iranian President and includes 25 senior government representatives and other key figures, such as the senior commander of the\nIRGC; the head of the Majlis; the Ministers of Science, Communications and Culture; the chief of police; and the president of the Islamic Propaganda Organization. The Council has the power to establish national cyber policy, and its decisions are mandatory for all Iranian institutions operating in the field.68 The National Center for Cyberspace, which is the main division of the Council, is responsible for comprehensive domestic and international surveillance, enforcing the enactments of the council, and preventing Iranians from accessing virtual private networks (VPNs) and internet proxies, which are used to bypass Iran's internet controls.69\nVarious organizations monitor and protect Iran's cyberspace infrastructure. All of them are affiliated with different government institutions and operate in different fields. A key defensive organization within this structure is the Cyberspace Defense Command, which functions under the Passive Defense Organization of the general staff of the armed forces. This organization is made up of both military personnel and representatives from the Communications, Defense, Intelligence, and Industry ministries. Its primary goal is to establish a comprehensive defensive strategy for safeguarding state institutions and infrastructures from potential cyber threats. The Cyberspace Defense Command is primarily focused on defense and does not appear to be engaged in offensive cyber activities. Another defensive entity within Iran's cyberspace structure is the Center for Information Security, also known as MAHER. This center is established and operated under the Communications and Information Technologies Ministry and is primarily responsible for activating computer security incident response teams during emergencies and cyberattacks. Furthermore, MAHER trains skilled manpower, develops response mechanisms for cyber crises, and stores and disseminates data security know-how. The center is responsible for defending all government websites, as well as those of private companies that are officially registered with the Communications Ministry.70 The Committee for Identifying Unauthorized Sites and FATA (an acronym for the Police for the Sphere of the Production and Exchange of Information) act as Iran's cyber police, overseeing internet usage for both domestic suppression and countering cybercrime.71 The IRGC runs its cyber operations, both defensive and offensive, through the IRGC Cyber-Electronic Command (IRGC-CEC), which is headquartered at the Ammar Cyberspace Base.72\nRegarding Iran's offensive cyber capabilities, the IRGC and MOIS are responsible for conducting both independent and joint offensive operations against perceived and real threats to Iranian national security. Among these two entities, the IRGC undoubtedly takes the lead. Its Electronic Warfare and Cyber Defense Organization offers training courses in cyber defense, restricts access to online content, and censors digital communications in Iranian cyberspace73 and “bears primary responsibility for offensive cyber\noperations.”74 By 2009, the IRGC started enlisting professionals for its internal cyberforce, as well as the closely associated military unit known as the Iranian Cyber Army (ICA). That same year, the Basij Cyber Council, another cyber entity overseen by the IRGC, revealed that it had trained 1,500 cybersecurity specialists. These professionals were prepared to join the IRGC's expanding offensive operations and espionage division. In 2010, the Basij cyber unit's leaders publicly declared their intention to launch digital attacks targeted at the actions of the “Zionist Entity,” Israel.75 The IRGC trains, equips, and provides operational support in the cyberdomain to Iranian proxies such as Hezbollah. For instance, in 2021, the IRGC helped establish a cybersecurity unit within Hezbollah's counterintelligence service. In parallel, a cybertraining facility disguised as a branch of Tehran's Sharif University was opened in Dahiye, in the southern suburbs of Beirut.76\nIran's cyberspace development is mainly driven by universities and technological institutes, with a focus on information technology (IT), computer engineering, and communications. Key institutions include Amirkabir University of Technology, Imam Hossein University, Shahid Beheshti University, and Sharif University of Technology. The Iranian government supports IT and computer communications companies through direct and indirect investments, with key government bodies being the Science Ministry, the Information and Communications Ministry, the Technology Cooperation Office, and hi-tech greenhouses like the Pardis Technology Park and Guilan Science and Technology Park.77 Furthermore, the universities play a crucial role in subcontracting cyber operations to front companies and individuals. Over the years, a tiered approach to cyber operations has developed within the Iranian intelligence landscape. At its core is a trusted network of middle managers—often university employees—who are ideologically aligned with the Iranian government and who translate intelligence priorities into segmented cyber tasks. These tasks are then bid out to multiple contractors, where about 50 organizations compete for regime-sponsored projects. The authorities compartmentalize tasks, often requiring different contractors for various parts of a project, such as creating exploits and establishing unauthorized access. Payments are only made upon the completion of the task, as competition is fierce and contractors are pitted against each other. Characteristic in this context is the case of Monica Witt—a former U.S. Air Force intelligence specialist who served in the Air Force from 1997 through 2008 and then with a defense contractor until 2010. Defecting to Iran in 2013, Witt leaked top-secret information to the Iranians, including the identities of U.S. intelligence agents and highly classified intelligence collection programs.78 In 2015, four Iranian hackers, coopted by the IRCG, targeted U.S. intelligence and military personnel in an unsophisticated and poorly executed cyber operation that ultimately failed.79\nAlthough Iran boasts a large network of IT professionals, the Islamic regime's inherent paranoia creates unique challenges. Those with the greatest offensive cyber skills and those demonstrating adherence to the government's ideology are usually mutually exclusive.80 Furthermore, the country is facing a significant brain drain, as many cybersecurity experts are leaving Iran at an alarming pace.\nCooperation with foreign actors, particularly China, North Korea, and Russia, has significantly contributed to Iran's cyber capabilities. In 2015, Russia and Iran signed the first cyber cooperation agreement, recognizing common threats in the cyberdomain. In 2017, a memorandum of understanding for cooperation on information and communication technology (ICT)--related issues, including “internet governance, network security,” and “international internet connection” was signed. In 2021, Russia and Iran concluded the agreement on information security aimed to coordinate activities in response to the growing importance of cyber issues in international relations and ICT-related crimes, as well as the creation of an Iranian “sovereign internet.”81 Since the beginning of the Ukraine conflict in 2022, Russia has supplied Iran with communication-surveillance capabilities, eavesdropping devices, advanced photography equipment, and lie detectors, and reportedly also shared more advanced software with Iran, enabling it to hack phones and systems of dissidents and adversaries. Protei Ltd. a Russian company specializing in communication monitoring tools, has started providing internet censorship software to the Iranian mobile services provider Ariantel. The Protei tools are believed to be part of a developing mobile phone system that would allow Iranian state authorities to directly monitor, intercept, redirect, degrade, or deny mobile communications.82 In 2021, Iranian cybersecurity company Lotus Gostar Arya (or Cysec) opened a branch in Kazan to foster cooperation and exchange of know-how between Iran and Russia.83\nOn 17 January 2025, Russia and Iran further solidified their partnership by signing the “Treaty on Comprehensive Strategic Partnership.” Article 4 of the treaty explicitly stipulates that the intelligence and security services of both nations “shall exchange information and experience and enhance the level of their cooperation.” This agreement is expected to further deepen collaboration in the cyber domain.84\nIn December 2010, the Chinese telecommunications firm ZTE Corp. sold a surveillance system to Iran's Telecommunication Co. of Iran (TCI) as part of a USD 130.6 million networking equipment contract. The surveillance system can monitor landline, mobile, and internet communications. TCI, which had at that time a near monopoly on Iran's landline telephone services, managed a significant portion of Iran's internet traffic.85 In 2019, China and Iran agreed to establish a joint workgroup to tackle cyber threats, emphasizing cooperation in IT, addressing cyber threats, and “counter[ing] U.S.\nunilateralism.”86 In 2009, a significant intelligence failure committed by the CIA occurred when a faulty web-based covert communications system used by the CIA in Iran was exposed, resulting in the arrest and execution of numerous CIA informants. The Iran events coincided with a similar setback in China in 2011 and 2012, where around 30 agents were apprehended and executed. Some officials suspected that the two nations might have collaborated, with Iran offering China technical information about the exposed communications system in exchange for equipment and expertise.87\nIn September 2012, Iran and North Korea signed a technology cooperation agreement, which allegedly included the cyberdomain.88 Iran potentially could have provided information on Stuxnet to North Korea, which ultimately prevented the Stuxnet-similar attack on the North Korean nuclear facility. A tightly controlled network and the inability of physical penetration of the facility to install the worm into the command systems might have also contributed to the failure.89\nTo conclude, Iran shares some defensive strategies with small states, such as resource constraints and the high costs associated with developing sophisticated offensive tools. Iran's investment in education and the development of technological expertise is consistent with the technology-oriented strategic culture described by Domingo. In a similar vein, the country's emphasis on training and harnessing its human capital shows how smaller states leverage technology to compensate for limited resources. The programs focusing on cyber hygiene, incident response teams, and legislative frameworks also mirror the defensive strategies typically adopted by small states.\nHowever, unlike many small states that focus primarily on defense, Iran has developed substantial offensive cyber capabilities. Organizations like the IRGC-CEC and ICA actively engage in offensive operations, targeting both regional adversaries and global entities. This level of offensive capability is more characteristic of larger, more powerful states. The integration of foreign expertise and technology, such as surveillance systems and cybersecurity tools, underscores Iran's ability to leverage international partnerships to bolster its cyber posture. The extent and sophistication of Iran's offensive operations, including cyberespionage and attacks, distinguish it from the typical small-state cyber posture, which often lacks the resources to develop such capabilities. Iran's cyber budget and institutional support structures, including the Supreme Cyberspace Council, are substantial compared to those of typical small states. The scale of investment and the comprehensive nature of its cyber governance framework indicate a level of state commitment that exceeds what is usually seen in smaller states with limited resources.\nSuch a combination of defensive focus, substantial offensive capacity, extensive foreign partnerships, and significant state investment makes Iran a unique player in the cyber landscape of small states.\nLEAKED INSIGHTS: IRAN'S CYBERDFENSE LANDSCAPE AND STRATEGIC CULTURE\nOver the last decade, Iran has been actively building a multifaceted cyber defense system to safeguard its critical infrastructure, suppress opposition groups, and block perceived harmful content, all aimed at maintaining the regime's stability. Guided by the Supreme Council of Cyberspace, Iran's numerous governmental agencies have been at the forefront of the implementation of this strategy. Despite such a concerted effort, the Iranian state organizations, including the MOIS, have been regularly experiencing high-impact leaks. For instance, since 2017 and into 2019, self-declared Iranian dissident groups—such as Lab Dookhtegan, Green Leakers, Black Box, and Hidden Reality—have emerged as “mystery groups” with unclear origins and affiliations.90 Over time, these groups have built reputations as reliable sources of information, exposing Iranian intelligence and military operations both within Iran and across the Middle East.91\nThe agencies tasked with cyber defense, although numerous and mature, are, as it seems, still lacking capabilities and know-how to fully prevent high-impact breaches. The researchers inside Iran have pointed out a number of weak points in the Iranian cyber defense. Hassan Monfared, writing about the cyberwarfare of the Iranian armed forces, finds that they lack a comprehensive view of cyber defense and highlights the need for a systematic approach to stabilize and improve cyber combat readiness across the army ranks.92 Shafiee et al. from Passive Defense Organization see the need to improve management of public opinion through cyberspace and identify several psychological operations techniques aimed at improving the image of the army and countering adversaries' psychological operations.93 Similarly, Mohammad Tabatabaei and Ehsan Movahedian in their study of the U.S cyber influence operations against Iran's internet users stress a gap in Iran's ability to counter foreign cyber influence effectively.94 Abolfazl and Mahdi Rohani stress cyberspace's dual nature as both a threat and opportunity and propose a catalog of measures to effectively managing and mitigating cyber threats. Interestingly enough, the measures proposed by the researchers are strikingly similar to those revealed in the leaked documents discussed below. They include strengthening the Supreme Council of Cyberspace and the National Cyber Space Center's role as the country's cyber focal point; enhancing capabilities of organizations such as the ICA; developing a local internet industry and broadband ecosystem; strengthening local entrepreneurs active in cyberdomain; and more active utilization of cyberspace for conflict, war, competition, and information operations against adversaries.95 Very insightful in this context is the confidential letter produced by Ali Asghar Qaimi, the advisor in the field of communication and IT, security, and cyber defense, to the speaker of the Iranian parliament,\nMohammad Bagher Ghalibaf.96 In it, Qaimi lists sixteen “challenges” faced by the Iranian cyber defense as of January 2024. Among them are: big differences in the quality of online infrastructure in various government bodies; existence of uncovered vulnerabilities and planted backdoors; lack of proper monitoring and action plans to locate and fix vulnerabilities; widespread attempts to cover up problems, incidents, and cyberattacks; lack of organizational discipline within the agencies responsible for vital and sensitive infrastructure; shortage of skilled personnel in the fields of security and cyber defense; utilization of unsuitable external cyber defense products in the vital infrastructure; the multiplicity of decisionmaking authorities and their interference, leading to the adoption of often contradictory decisions; brain drain of cybersecurity experts; and the long and exhausting process of obtaining security licenses and qualifications for individuals and private security companies.97 Qaimi concludes that, because many organizations in Iran fail to meet minimum security requirements, one should expect further cyberattacks, disclosure of information, and disruption of services in the future.98 To sum up, the challenges faced by Iran's cyber defense system, as outlined by Iranian researchers, highlight significant gaps in infrastructure, personnel, and overall preparedness, painting a troubling picture of the country's vulnerability to cyber threats. These weaknesses are also mirrored in a letter by Qaimi that lists several critical deficiencies, providing a realistic view on the current situation with cyber defense.\nThe analysis of the leaked documents begins with the four-year plan, classified as “secret,” laid down on 23 July 2021, by new Minister of Intelligence Hojjat al-Islam Seyyed Ismail Khatib. Although the document tackles the challenges and priorities related to cybersecurity, it does not explicitly describe the current state of cybersecurity in the country. Nevertheless, it highlights the significance of modernizing intelligence infrastructure to address cyber threats effectively, including monitoring, prevention, and capacity building in cyber.99 It also emphasizes the importance of protecting critical infrastructure, combating cyberespionage, and enhancing cooperation with international partners in cybersecurity efforts. The document refers to “the concrete operational plans” that need to be put in place based on the resolutions by the Supreme Council of Cyberspace.100\nIn addition to the four-year plan that due to its programmatic nature tackles the topic of cyber without sufficient depth, six other documents, all of which explicitly focus on various aspects of cybersecurity, will be analyzed using a framework of seven interconnected themes. These themes, which have been consistently addressed in all documents, provide a comprehensive understanding of Iran's approach to cybersecurity:Governance and regulatory framework,National Information Network,\n.International engagement and cyber diplomacy,Control over information flows and protection of Islamic-Iranian identity,Economic and technological integration within the cyberdomain,Human resources and workforce development, andCybersecurity infrastructure and cyber protective mechanisms.\n### Governance and Regulatory Framework\nThe importance of the Supreme Council of Cyberspace as the main body responsible for Iran's cyberdomain has been stressed in all documents. The decisions of the Council must be considered binding and be implemented by all organizations, including the office of the prosecutor and the courts.101 The Council also plays a crucial role in determining the budgetary spending on cybersecurity and monitoring measures to protect Iran's critical infrastructure.102 It is interesting to note in this context that the performance of the National Center for Cyberspace, which is controlled by the Council, is regularly assessed based on the principles of good governance (salamat-e edari).103\n### National Information Network\nEstablishing a “reliable, safe, stable, integrated, and extensive infrastructure throughout the country based on the National Information Network”104 that would enable the regime to “[r]educe as much as possible access to unauthorized foreign platforms”105 is seen as one of the most important priorities monitored by the Council. The Ministry of Communications and Information Technology was entrusted with the responsibility of connecting at least 80% of the country's households and businesses to the National Information Network by the end of 2023.106 In the foreseeable future, Iran's satellite infrastructure and the National Information Network should be integrated, further solidifying the country's digital autonomy and enhancing its cybersecurity capabilities.107\n### International Engagement and Cyber Diplomacy\nIn the international arena, Iran pursues two goals in the cyberdomain: first, to expand cooperation with allied and friendly nations, especially Islamic countries,108 as well as to “[a]chieve an active, strong, and purposeful presence in regional and international assemblies and institutions.”109 Second, Iran seeks to strengthen its position as a formidable cyberpower, leveraging international bodies as deterrent mechanisms in its cyberspace.110 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs plays a major role in setting up a “cyber space diplomacy system,” as well as assisting other state agencies in dealing with international organizations.111\n###\nControl over Information Flows and Protection of Islamic--Iranian Identity\nProtecting the Islamic--Iranian identity and lifestyle is a crucial aspect of cyber defense in Iran. Consequently, the country regulates social media presence in accordance with its laws and values. The Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance plays a significant role in this regard, responsible for registering official accounts, closing fake accounts, and blocking unauthorized advertisements of foreign social networks.112 As a countermeasure to potential threats in the digital space, content providers in Iran are required to promote the “discourse of the Islamic Revolution” and contribute to the creation of a “new Islamic civilization in cyberspace.”113 Government employees are forbidden from being present on “unauthorized social media platforms” without permission and required to follow guidelines and regulations if they are present on “approved” platforms.114\n### Economic and Technological Integration within the Cyberdomain\nIn the field of economic and technological integration within the cyberdomain, Iran pursues a twofold strategy—increasing the share of domestic products and services in cybersecurity, and supporting local providers. Thus, the need to double the local content of products and services has been emphasized time and again in different strategic documents.115 In parallel, the share of the digital segment in the Iranian economy is planned to reach 10% by 2031,116 while some suggest that the same share should be set at 20% of the Gross Domestic Product.117 Support of the local providers of products and services is considered vital. Several authors recommend that authorities make “[m]aximum usage of private cyber security contractors”118 and “support companies, particularly in the fields of security systems, locally-built browsers, and national messengers.”119\n### Human Resources and Workforce Development\nIn addition, it is considered crucial to address the need to establish criteria for recruiting, retaining, and protecting experts in the cybersecurity domain, as such plans require careful design and implementation.120 The salaries of cybersecurity specialists should be increased and the issue of brain drain requires urgent attention.121 Furthermore, the cybersecurity literacy among government employees needs to be addressed through internal training and specialized courses.122 The number of student admissions in cybersecurity-related fields also needs to be expanded.123 The goal is to create a reservoir of skilled and efficient cybersecurity experts, thereby gaining a strategic advantage for Iran in this area.124\nCybersecurity Infrastructure and Cyber Protective Mechanisms\nIran's cyber defense strategy has, over the decade, evolved as a multifaceted approach that includes regular assessments, clear role assignments, and a catalogue of proactive measures. The establishment and continuous development of cybersecurity measures within all state institutions are considered critical in safeguarding national security. The institutions are obliged to create and implement comprehensive cyberspace security plans to prevent, combat, and manage cyber incidents,125 including cyber drills.126 Additionally, regular evaluations and situational reports mandated to assess the fulfillment of cybersecurity tasks must be submitted to the Supreme Council of Cyberspace.127 Nongovernmental institutions are also urged to organize and enhance their cybersecurity capabilities.128\nAccording to the top-secret document of April 2023, the task of guarding Iran's cyber borders was at that time the responsibility of the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology. However, the document complains that this mission is not logically aligned with the Ministry's posture in protecting Iran's communication and information infrastructure. As a result, the role of the armed forces and the country's intelligence agencies in this area has been overlooked. Hence, it was necessary to reevaluate the legal framework for cyber border protection and consider assigning this important task to an organization that is better equipped to handle it. In addition, a plethora of organizations responsible for cyber defense, including the Passive Defense Organization, the Center for Information Security, and the cyber police (FATA), have overlapping responsibilities. This requires a clear definition of their roles and duties, particularly in their relations to the armed forces, the IRGC, and the Ministry of Intelligence.129 Furthermore, the general staff of the armed forces was “[t]asked to prepare a national program to prevent and address defense-security threats posed by unauthorized satellite systems for Iranian cyber space.”130\nThe insights gained from the documents examined in this section underline the key premises of strategic culture defined earlier. The overall structure of Iran's cyber governance is heavily centralized, reflecting Iran's historical preference for a strong, centralized leadership, which is seen as necessary to maintain order and control in a complex and multifaceted society. The country's commitment to reducing foreign dependence and fostering a self-reliant digital economy aligns with the drive toward self-sufficiency and autonomy as seen through historical experience of invasions and influence from foreign powers. In the eternal struggle between virtue and evil, a dwindling human capital in the cyberdomain needs to be exploited and protected to advance the country's strategic interests, as the entire society should remain resilient, in line with the values of vigilance and resistance against external threats. Internationally, Iran considers itself a leader of the\nIslamic world that stays firm in the face of Western influence. By leveraging international bodies as deterrent mechanisms, the regime attempts to project power and protect its interests in cyberspace. Iran's dual strategy of enhancing domestic cybersecurity capabilities while also striving for technological independence and integration into the global cyberdomain mirrors its cultural emphasis on adaptability to secure the country's position in a complex and competitive international environment. The role of cultural and media institutions in cyberspace is critical for the regime, as their task is to promote the dual elements of Iranian identity—nationality and religion. Such an emphasis on aligning cyber content with Islamic principles demonstrates the intertwining of religious ideology with national identity, as it reinforces the regime's narrative and counters foreign cultural influence.\nFinally, while concrete data are lacking, it is reasonable to infer that the multidecade economic and technological sanctions imposed on Iran have significantly affected its cyber defense capabilities, influencing both its strategy and the evolution of its cyber infrastructure. These sanctions have severely limited Iran's ability to acquire advanced cyber defense technologies, as restrictions on access to key software, hardware, and encryption technologies hinder the country's efforts to build a sophisticated cybersecurity infrastructure. A comprehensive analysis examining the impact of sanctions on Iran's cyber defense capabilities would be a fascinating subject for further study, shedding light on the consequences of such restrictions and their potential long-term effects on a nation's ability to protect itself in the cyber realm.\n## CONCLUSION\nA strategic culture that shaped Iranian perceptions, values, and norms has its roots in Persian culture and Shia Islam. Iran's historical experiences of conquest and foreign domination have led to a siege mentality, conspiracy thinking, and the admiration of cunning and manipulation. Besides, a unique blend of historical experiences and geostrategic positions have shaped Iran's sense of identity and its perception of exceptionalism and superiority. Some Iranian authors even advance the notion of “geopolitical superiority,” arguing that Iran's strategic positioning and its “geographical gravity” can somehow compensate for its technological deficiencies—a belief that underestimates the role of and need for technological advancement in the face of modern threats and evolving security dynamics.131\nConsequently, these specific operational codes, histories, and assumptions of strategic culture have a significant influence on the country's cyber defense posture, characterized by heightened sensitivity to cyberattacks by hostile actors. The Stuxnet attack was probably a pivotal moment that revealed Iran's vulnerabilities to advanced cyber threats from hostile actors and solidified the Manichean worldview of ruling elites about perceived external\nthreats, especially those emanating from the West. Over the last decade, Iran adopted a multifaceted approach to safeguarding infrastructure, suppressing opposition, and countering foreign influence. Iran has achieved a unique position in the cyber landscape that is characterized by a mix of defensive focus, offensive capabilities, partnerships with allied states, and significant state investment. The country's comprehensive cyber strategy and governance framework position it as a formidable player, blending characteristics of both small and larger states.\nOver the last few years, Iranian-affiliated cyber threat actors have demonstrated the ability to execute sustained, complex, and disruptive operations across multiple sectors outside of Iran. These groups frequently utilize advanced tactics, techniques, and procedures, continuously refining their strategies to avoid detection and maintain access to compromised networks. The coordination among these actors and their shared use of resources and tools demonstrate a unified effort to support Iran's geopolitical aims. Their ongoing use of destructive malware, ransomware, and espionage operations underscores the threat they pose, particularly in the context of regional tensions and global political events. Thus, Iran was one of the most assertive foreign actors attempting to create discord ahead of the 2024 U.S. presidential elections. Iranian operatives have launched influence operations targeting U.S. audiences, potentially aiming to sway the outcome of the elections. This cyber-enabled influence campaign is being driven by a mix of actors conducting preliminary cyber reconnaissance and inserting online personas and websites into the information ecosystem. In June 2024, hackers linked to the IRGC successfully infiltrated the Trump campaign, stealing internal documents and leaking them to media outlets.132\nIn the cyber defensive domain, the leaked documents mostly confirm the conclusions derived from the sources available in the public domain. The materials show that Iran has developed a multifaceted cyber defense system aimed at protecting its critical infrastructure, controlling information, and maintaining regime stability. The Supreme Council of Cyberspace oversees this strategy, coordinating efforts across various governmental agencies. Highly centralized cyber governance aims at strengthening the country's self-reliance and reducing foreign dependence, aligning with Iran's strategic culture of resistance to external influences. Internationally, Iran's posture is marked by adaptability and resilience to secure its position in the global cyberdomain. However, despite the extensive cyber defense measures, Iran still faces significant challenges, such as weaknesses in comprehensive defense strategies, management of public opinion, and countering foreign influence operations. Numerous high-impact leaks experienced by Iranian state organizations revealed persistent issues with infrastructure quality, cyber threat monitoring, and organizational discipline.\nROLE OF STRATEGIC CULTURE IN IRAN'S CYBER DEFENSE POLICY\n\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author."

This culture combines a strong national pride and historical consciousness with values centered on resisting external influences. Ultimately, strategic culture has influenced the country’s cyber capabilities, which have significantly evolved since 2003, largely due to state investment and the establishment of the Supreme Council of Cyberspace in 2012. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and the Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS) lead offensive cyber operations, making Iran’s cyber posture more aligned with larger state powers than typical small states. Leaked documents from the Iranian opposition disclosed that Iran has actively developed a comprehensive cyber defense framework over the past decade to protect its critical infrastructure, quell opposition, and control presumed harmful content to maintain regime stability. Despite these efforts, leaks from dissident groups have exposed persistent weaknesses in Iran’s cyber defense, highlighting challenges in infrastructure, threat monitoring, and organizational discipline. Moreover, these leaks reveal Iran’s strategic focus on self-reliance and resistance to foreign influence.\nDr. Grigorij Serscikov is an Independent Researcher and Consultant with over fifteen years of experience in offering strategic advice and analysis to companies within the energy and financial sectors. He earned his master’s degree in Crisis and Security Management from Leiden University and a Ph.D. from the University of Dundee. Several of his articles were published in this journal.

However, the credibility of the leaked documents—that is, the context in which the documents were produced and the intentions of the authors who wrote them4—although it invites certain skepticism, does not currently challenge its validity. Similarly, the representativeness of the papers is established through the sheer volume of the leaked materials on the various topics of Iranian internal and external policies. Therefore, while the authenticity of the documents may be subject to debate, their credibility and representativeness are well established, providing a solid foundation for the research.\nAmong the wealth of primary sources made available to the public, there were several related to Iran's cyber defense strategies, providing researchers with insights into the country's cybersecurity programs. One key document is titled, “The Program Proposed by the Minister of Intelligence Hojjat al-Islam wal-Muslimeen Seyyed Ismail Khatib for the 13th government Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, 23 July 2021”5—the newly appointed head of the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence (MOIS).6 In it, Khatib outlined his vision for the evolution of the MOIS over the next four years, addressing inter alia issues related to Iranian cybersecurity. Other documents that will be examined in this study are: “The Ninety-Fourth Session of the Supreme Council of the Country's Cyber Space of 16 August 2023,”7 “The Ninety-Second Meeting of the Supreme Council of Cyberspace of June 27, 2023,”8 “Parts One and Two of the Strategic Document of the Islamic Republic of Iran on Cyber Space of July 14, 2021,”9 “Requirements and Measures Related to the Use of Satellite Systems in Cyberspace of 30 August 2022,”10 “Opinion Regarding the Promotion of the Cyber Space of 9 April 2023,”11 and “The Letter of the Advisor to the Speaker of the Parliament in the Field of Communication and Information Technology, Security and Cyber Defense of 16 January 2024.”12\nFurthermore, Persian-language academic journals published in Iran, such as The Quarterly Journal of Multidisciplinary Studies for Strategic Knowledge,\nStrategic Studies Quarterly, and The Quarterly of Political Strategic Studies have been tackling the themes related to cybersecurity for almost a decade. Rarely quoted in the West, these publications, whose authors are often affiliated with the country's intelligence and military community, provide an outside-in perspective on the topic and, as will be shown, significantly complement primary sources.\nIranian cyber defense will be examined within the framework of a case study approach—a reliable and often-used methodology to explore the case's “why” and/or “how” questions in situations of complex causality where the researcher has limited control.13 This approach will be further strengthened through a detailed and systematic analysis of the leaked documents, which will play a central role in the research. By integrating the insights derived from the documents, the case study method enables the researcher to achieve high levels of “conceptual validity”—the identification of the most representative features within the specific context of Iranian cyber defense.14\nThe concept of strategic culture will be applied as a theoretical avenue for the analysis. First appearing in the late 1970s,15 the idea has experienced several waves of scholarly attention since then.16 Johnson and Larsen define strategic culture as “[a] set of shared beliefs, assumptions, and modes of behavior, derived from common experiences and accepted narratives (both oral and written), that shape collective identity and relationships to other groups, and which determine appropriate ends and means for achieving security objectives.”17 A country's strategic culture is not randomly chosen or influenced by intellectual trends. It is shaped by the character and context of its society and becomes, in the views of Jeremy Black, a “cultural assumption” that fits the nation's strategic needs and influences its strategic behavior.18 Strategic culture, which is rooted in historical experiences, can evolve but cannot be easily discarded. It is a crucial factor in a country's strategic effectiveness, but it is not infinitely adaptable. Radical changes in culture only occur as a result of significant political, social, or military shocks. Strategic cultures borrow and adapt from one another, but this process has its limits.\nThe concept of strategic culture is highly suitable for the analysis of cybersecurity and cyberwarfare. For instance, the study prepared for the U.S. Cyber Command applied the notion of strategic culture as a theoretical foundation to build four case studies, one of them Iran.19 The author believes that the concept offers an additional advantage for this research, as it allows for deriving further insights and drawing implications from the primary and secondary sources as well as tracing the development of Iran's strategies to cybersecurity in general and cyber defense in particular during a specific period.20\nROLE OF STRATEGIC CULTURE IN IRAN'S CYBER DEFENSE POLICY\n# IRANIAN STRATEGIC CULTURE\nStrategic culture faces the challenge of not having a clear collection of principles or a well-established theoretical framework. The common ground for strategic culture generally involves acknowledging culture as an epiphenomenal factor in the examination of foreign policy and security choices. However, this can be complicated by the fact that strategic culture is not a one-size-fits-all concept. Every actor possesses its own operational code, history, assumptions, and strategic culture. To develop a more streamlined research model, it is necessary to narrow national culture variables to those that consistently impact the actor's policy and hold significant value for that specific culture. For this study, a four-variable model suggested by Jeannie Johnson will be adopted, offering valuable insights for the analysis of Iranian strategic culture. The four variables are:\n1. Identity: This refers to a nation's self-perception regarding its character, role in regional and global interactions, and beliefs about its ultimate destiny.\n2. Values: These are the material and nonmaterial goods a society holds in high regard, prioritizing them over other aspects.\n3. Norms: These are the accepted and anticipated modes of behavior within a society, encompassing the concepts of right versus wrong and good versus evil. Some norms stem from deeply ingrained beliefs held by most members of society, while others are the result of political socialization.\n4. Perceptive lens: A set of beliefs and experiences, whether true or misinformed, shapes a nation's perspective of the world. Factors such as historical interpretations, self-image, the views of others, leadership capabilities, national resources, and other security-related concepts all play a crucial role in shaping what each regime considers to be rational foreign policy.\n# Identity\nIranian identity is a complex and multifaceted concept influenced by various factors, such as political values, historical experiences, religion, and geographical location. The Islamic Republic of Iran (IRI) has an identity that is defined by the elements of \"nationality\" and \"religion,\" with the weight and importance of these elements fluctuating over time. The distinctive Persian identity has thrived despite many invasions, with the Iranians adopting some of the invaders' ways but adapting them to be more Persian than not. This sense of identity and pride stems from the cultural continuity that has been maintained over time. At the same time, they also manifest themselves in a sense of superiority and exceptionalism over neighboring countries and peoples. Iran's geography has played a crucial role in its history as a land that has been home to various nomads, invaders, and settlers from surrounding areas. Settled within confines between the Caspian Sea in the north and the Persian Gulf in the south, and enclosed by the\nAND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE VOLUME 38, NUMBER 2\nmountains of Zagros and Alborz, these groups were able to live in relative isolation for extended periods, leading to the emergence of numerous ethnic, religious, tribal, and other groupings that often found reasons to be in conflict with one another.26 According to Pollack, “Because of the discrete separation of so much of the population, Iran became a patchwork of ethnic, religious, tribal, and other groupings, all of whom seemed to find constant reasons for conflict with their neighbors.”27\nThe Islamic Revolution enhanced Iran's sense of exceptionalism and created a potent mixture of religious ideology and deep-seated nationalism.28 Willis Stanley underscores that:“[t]he current Iranian leadership appears to have recognizable goals derived from its unique political ideology, which makes use of Shia Islam's gradual consolidation of a clerical caste and historical Iran's concerns about sovereignty and acceptance of an absolute ruler. In this ideology, Iran and Shia Islam are viewed as the same, indivisible.29”\nThe pride in Iran's pre-Islamic history shared by the majority of Iranians is reframed within an Islamist context and integrated into the overarching narrative. The IRI's perception of its own unique centrality is informed by its awareness of the country's role as one of the region's historical powers, today challenged by the alluring influence of the West as an alternative to the righteous path of the Iranian model.\n### Values\nAnthony Cain quotes Vakili-Zad who notes that the ideology of the Islamic Revolution was shaped by:“those who carried the heavy burden of often bloody confrontations with government troops, [and] were, in general, religiously oriented and linked to traditional values from the rural past ... . [T]he blueprint for future society was the Islamic Republic modeled on the one created by the Prophet Muhammad more than 1,400 years earlier.30”\nSeven years before the revolution, Ali Shariati, a leading Iranian sociologist and revolutionary, in his first public lecture on Islamology, insisted that a reassembly of past cultural values would underpin an overturning of the existing order.31 Such a remodeling of values, with an ultimate goal of creating a just society, cannot be achieved without a perennial struggle against the forces of evil. Ayatollah Khomeini believed that the world is perpetually embroiled in a struggle between good and evil, where the forces of virtue must resist domination and fight against oppression and injustice.32 Most importantly, the threats posed by rival cultures that have different sets of\nvalues from which Iranian society must be cleansed. If these values were to reemerge, it would signify the failure of the revolution's primary objective.33 As a result, the IRI's efforts to maintain the ethos of resistance and jihad against presumed or real adversaries are rooted in the moral and spiritual values of the Islamic Revolution. They are essential mechanisms created to insulate Iranian society against subversive foreign cultural influences and project Iran's power to confront its adversaries abroad. In this context, the concept of moqavamat (resistance) plays an important role. Initially originated as a slogan in the Palestinian national movement in the 1960s, it evolved into a quasi-religious doctrine of armed struggle by Palestinian Hamas and Lebanese Hizballah in the 1980s. It was later adopted by Iran. Although the doctrine of resistance has foreign origins, it resonates deeply with those who embrace the Shi'ite martyrdom narrative of Imam Hussein, who chose resistance and martyrdom at Karbala over surrender to the unjust seventh-century Caliph Yazid.34 Iranian scholars Hossein Salimi and Amin Hejazi, while explicitly highlighting the defensive nature of Iranian jihad, mention resistance against oppression and defense of the oppressed, negation of Western dominance, independence, and self-sufficiency as core values of the IRI.35\nTo sum up, the values that emerged after the Islamic Revolution in Iran, shaped by its religiously oriented and traditionally minded founders, are deeply rooted in a Manichean and one-dimensional worldview that pits good against evil, with the West representing the forces of evil threatening Iranian society. These values serve to protect Iran from foreign cultural influences and uphold principles of resistance.\n### Norms\nPierre Pahlavi and Eric Ouellet observe that Iran has often seen itself as isolated and threatened by neighboring countries due to its unique status as the only Persian-speaking, Shia nation in a predominantly Turkish--Arabic, Sunni region. This perception is exacerbated by the country's size, which makes it significant on the global stage but vulnerable to external threats. To cope with these challenges, Iran has historically pursued two strategic goals: protecting “fortress Iran” by maintaining economic autonomy and territorial integrity and expanding its regional influence as a buffer. While these objectives may seem contradictory, they are complementary and can be achieved through both offensive and detente strategies, transcending internal ideological differences.36 Such an ambiguous environment requires a specific set of norms and a distinct strategic culture that would govern the country's modus operandi.\nIndeed, according to some experts, IRI's strategic culture, influenced by the norms derived from both Persian culture and Shia Islam, includes the use\nof strategic ambiguity and deception, avoidance of frontal attacks, and soft power. When the country's interests are at stake, the strict tenets of Islamic jurisprudence can be abrogated under the concept of maslaha, or acting in the public interest.37 In addition, Kayhan Barzegar and Abdolrasool Divsallar speak about strategic patience, use of low-cost engagements, and diminishing rivals' margin to maneuver as the instruments that the current Iranian regime has masterfully applied for decades. Strategic patience is a deliberate postponement of decisions on critical national security issues, allowing Iran to buy time and conserve resources. This approach is particularly useful in situations where strategic limits exist and available resources are insufficient to counter them. Iranians, who lived under constant insecurity, practiced strategic patience as a means of avoiding emotional, reactionary decisions in the face of harsh conditions. Low-cost engagements, such as hybrid warfare and the use of proxies, are other aspects of norms that influence IRI's strategic culture. In countries like Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen, Iran has created a network of foreign fighters, military advisers, and local regime irregulars under Iranian advisory commands. Additionally, Iran employs a defensive strategy aimed at reducing its rivals' margin to maneuver by blocking their actions and limiting their choices. Called, since 2005, “mosaic defense doctrine,” this strategy includes the concept of “all-around defense,” which brings together all state, nonstate, and private actors to confront threats, and “strategic depth,” which involves creating security buffer zones to reduce the risk of direct attacks on Iranian territory. Anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) capabilities, which encompass military, informational, economic, and political measures, are used by Iran to disrupt adversaries' interests and reduce their choices, thereby raising the cost of any potential hostilities.38 Central to “mosaic doctrine” is the mobilization of a vast and dispersed militia force designed to engage invading forces in protracted, attritional warfare, thereby exhausting their resources and resolve.39\n### Perceptive Lens\nThe title of Graham Fuller's 1991 RAND Corporation study, The Center of the Universe, mirrors the perspective of the IRI's elites, who believe that Iran holds a natural, indispensable, and leading role in the Middle East and potentially the entire Muslim world.40 Such an inflated view of centrality and historic role of Iran is underlined by a deep-seated Iranian identity and a broadly shared historical awareness of Iran's power status in the region. Consequently, the occurrences that contradict these self-centered views may cause cognitive dissonance among Iranians. During his captivity as a hostage in the U.S. embassy in Tehran, following its takeover by Iranian “students” in November 1979, William Daugherty, then the Central Intelligence Agency\n(CIA) Chief of Station, noted that his captors struggled to comprehend and were personally offended by his inability to communicate in Persian, the language of what they considered such an important country as Iran.41 Experiences of victimization, insecurity, and feelings of inferiority have contributed to shaping Iran's sense of pride and significance. Initially, Iran was a nation of conquerors, but over time, it was invaded, conquered, and humbled by various powers, such as the Greeks, Arabs, Mongols, and Turks. The most recent manifestation of this victimization complex is linked to the British and Russian quasi-colonial domination of Iran from the nineteenth to the mid-twentieth centuries and the perceived American influence over Iran after World War II.42\nThe centuries of foreign domination had caused an acute sensitivity among Iranians about the role of foreigners in their culture and politics. Iranians believe, as Marvin Zonis emphasizes, that “[t]he rest of the world is somehow so taken with Iran's significance that it cannot let it go.”43 A siege mentality is fortified by real or presumed threats posed by both nearby and distant enemies. As a result, a pervasive culture of conspiracy thinking has emerged within Iranian society, with many viewing external forces as manipulating or undermining their nation's interests. This phenomenon bears a notable resemblance to the dynamics often attributed to the so-called Arab street. According to Fuller, “Rarely are events to be taken at face value, for to assume them as such is (a) to indicate ignorance of the superior forces around oneself or one's nation and (b) to demonstrate the stupidity, naivete, or insensitivity not to perceive the hidden motives of others.”44 Based on this logic, unanticipated events are not merely isolated incidents but rather the result of powerful external forces that dominate or control the situation. The most complex explanation of political events is usually preferred as the most likely, particularly when foreign powers are involved. While specific interpretations may differ based on individual ideological outlooks, the consensus is that it is naive to assume that a series of developments might be unrelated, particularly when a powerful foreign entity is involved.45\nOther cultural characteristics that have their roots in the prolonged periods of insecurity and foreign rule are a general wariness toward those outside one's intimate circle, particularly authority figures and foreigners, as well as a tendency toward cunning or astuteness. As life is perceived as an unpredictable game of chance, where both favorable and unfavorable opportunities arise and vanish without warning, people outside the inner cycle are considered as inherently malevolent, power-hungry, and irrational. There is a lack of trust in interpersonal relationships and altruistic motives are often looked at with suspicion.46 The mistrust leads to the necessity for manipulation in the struggle for survival, “empty and meaningless adulation,” and consequently, an expectation that others will also attempt to manipulate.47 Consequently, the\nfigure of the clever dissimulator, or zeræng, emerges. As described by William Beeman, zeræng is “[a]n operation on the part of an adroit operator that involves thwarting direct interpretation of his own actions or deliberately leading others to erroneous interpretation of those actions while being able to successfully interpret the actions of others.”48 Albeit being an inherently negative trait, it is, nevertheless, highly admired by Iranians as they see cleverness and wiliness as essential strategies for navigating and overcoming stronger forces.49 However, the reliance on zeræng, combined with the ingrained insecurity and anxiety about being deceived by strangers, can sometimes result in Iranian actors overplaying their hand in diplomacy, business dealings, and military activities.\nIn conclusion, the analysis of Iranian strategic culture based on four variables—identity, values, norms, and perceptive lens—demonstrates that Iran's identity is a fusion of nationality and religion, with a strong sense of exceptionalism and historical continuity. The values that emerged after the Islamic Revolution are deeply rooted in a Manichean worldview, pitting good against evil, with the West representing the forces of evil. The perceptive lens of Iran's elites is inflated, believing that Iran's indispensable and leading role in the Middle East and potentially the entire Muslim world would somehow compensate for technological deficiencies.\n## Building the Digital Wall: Iran's Cybersecurity Architecture\n### The Cyber Posture of Small States\nCyberspace is a complex and multifaceted concept, encompassing various subconcepts and nuanced definitions. Rain Ottis and Peeter Lorents describe cyberspace as “a time-dependent set of interconnected information systems and the human users that interact with these systems,” stressing a dynamic nature of cyberspace, where significant changes can occur rapidly, in a shorter time frame than other time-dependent systems.50\nCyberspace is widely considered offense-dominant, inferring that it is easier to execute attacks than to defend against them. Offensive dominance in cyberspace is due to varied and rapidly evolving attack vectors, which defenders struggle to keep up with. Such an asymmetry is in favor of an attacker, as offensive cyber capabilities are perceived to be resource-efficient compared to defensive measures, which are costly and often lag behind technological advancements.51 In parallel, traditional deterrence models face challenges in cyberspace due to difficulties in attribution and the covert nature of cyber capabilities. The anonymity and rapid execution of cyberattacks undermine the effectiveness of deterrence, which relies on the threat of assured retaliation. A key challenge in implementing cyber deterrence is the need for a strong system of protection as the first step, but\nmany countries prioritize offensive operations over defense, neglecting defense and resilience, instead focusing on offensive methods to deter adversaries.52 The system-wide framework analysis that focuses on the broadest dynamics and the systemic cyber risks inherent to the internet may be worth considering. It addresses both top-down factors, such as insecure technical standards, and bottom-up, emergent effects, like the spread of insecure Internet of Things (IoT) devices. This framework encompasses the full spectrum of attacks, including nation-state disruptions, espionage, cybercrime, and even hacking driven by curiosity or entertainment. Within this context, the tools, methods, and activities of offensive and defensive operations are relatively distinct.53\nHowever, the true destructive potential of cyber operations remains uncertain and a subject of ongoing speculation and debate within the cybersecurity community. As Torbjørn Pedersen notes,54 the initial anticipation of a “modern Pearl Harbor” or upcoming global cyberwars has given way to a more nuanced understanding of the limitations of cyber operations expressed in the article by Thomas Rid, “Cyber War Will Not Take Place.”55 According to Lennart Maschmeyer, cyber operations face an operational trilemma, where the three variables of speed, intensity of effect, and control are negatively correlated. This means that, in most cases, cyber operations will be either too slow, too low in intensity, or too unreliable to provide significant strategic utility.56 Overall, however, both opponents and proponents of cyberwar agree that cyberspace offers new methods of undermining national power by achieving strategic impact through ongoing campaigns of covert, less violent cyber operations with cumulative effects.57\nThe cyber capabilities of small states, defined by limited resources and smaller populations, are primarily focused on defensive measures. This is due to constraints in funding, a lack of specialized expertise and intelligence resources, and the high costs involved in developing advanced offensive tools. The notion that cyber capabilities provide an asymmetric advantage to weaker states is contested, as evidence suggests that powerful states with advanced resources are better positioned to exploit cyber operations.58 Jon Lindsay cites the Stuxnet operation of 2009--2010 as a prime example, when a malicious code penetrated the Iranian nuclear facility in Natanz, wiping out around 1,000 centrifuges. Although specific details about the Stuxnet operation's time frame and effects still remain obscure, Lindsay argues that this incident demonstrates that cyber capabilities do not automatically grant an advantage to weaker states. He emphasizes that small states encounter significant challenges in weaponizing cyber capabilities to inflict substantial damage.59 All these challenge the notion of asymmetric advantage of weaker adversaries in the cyberdomain proposed by some, suggesting instead that cyber capabilities tend to favor powerful states.60\nSmall states often adopt a technology-oriented strategic culture and focus on enhancing their defensive measures to protect their critical infrastructure and maintain national security. The effectiveness of cyber strategies varies among states, with some successfully integrating them into their national security frameworks, while others struggle to recognize the opportunities and threats associated with increased cyber engagement. However, small states often adopt several common strategies to compensate for their limited resources and cyber capabilities. These strategies may include:61 Cyber hygiene programs: Investing in national cyber hygiene programs to educate citizens and businesses about basic cybersecurity practices. This involves developing cybersecurity curricula in educational institutions, conducting regular training programs for government and private sector employees, and fostering a culture of cyber awareness. In Iran's case, this approach took the form of creating a “halal net,” a locally controlled version of the internet designed to limit public access to information. Incident response teams: Establishing national Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) or Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) to handle and coordinate responses to cyber incidents. Legislation and policy frameworks: Setting up robust legislative and policy frameworks. These frameworks set out the roles and responsibilities of various stakeholders and establish protocols for incident response and information sharing. Investment in technology: Despite resource limitations, small states are increasingly investing in advanced cyber defense technologies, such as intrusion detection systems, encryption, and secure communication platforms to protect critical infrastructure. Public--private partnerships often play a key role in supporting national cybersecurity strategies, provided there is a skilled workforce and organizational infrastructure to effectively utilize these technologies. Additionally, the absence of economic and technological sanctions mechanisms is crucial, as it allows these states to acquire the necessary technologies without significant barriers.Cyber defense alliances, collaboration, and information sharing with other states, international organizations, and private sector partners to enhance cyber defense capabilities.\nPutting the cyber capabilities of small states in the context of strategic culture, Francis Domingo introduced the concept of “technology-oriented” strategic culture, which refers to small states' inclination to rely on technology as a strategy to overcome limited resources, military capabilities, and strategic depth.62 In this context, technology serves as an enabler for states to pursue foreign policy objectives in a more deliberate and strategic manner. A technology-oriented strategic culture can be identified by examining three key implications for small states: High network readiness: Small states with a technology-oriented strategic culture prioritize the development and maintenance of advanced communication\nnetworks, data systems, and digital infrastructure to enhance their overall connectivity and readiness. Technology-driven military force: These states invest in technology-driven military capabilities, such as advanced weapon systems, unmanned aerial vehicles, and cyberwarfare tools, to augment their military power and strategic reach. Relevance of cybersecurity: Cybersecurity becomes a critical concern for small states with a technology-oriented strategic culture, as they recognize the potential risks and vulnerabilities associated with their reliance on technology. As a result, they prioritize the protection of their digital infrastructure and critical data to ensure their national security and maintain their strategic advantages.63\nIran offers an intriguing case study, as its strategic culture, characterized by its identity, values, norms, and perceptual lens, aligns closely with the defensive cybersecurity posture of many small states. The emphasis on resistance, strategic patience, ambiguity, and low-cost engagements constitutes Iran's approach to cyberspace, reflecting broader trends seen in the cyber strategies of small states. However, over the past decade, Iran has significantly stepped up its offensive cyber capabilities, elevating itself, according to some estimates, to the top of the second tier of global cyberpowers, with aspirations to join the leaders.64\n### Iranian Cyber Capabilities\nIran's initial steps to build its defensive cyber capabilities can be traced back to 2003, when units specializing in cybersecurity were set up within several ministries.65 A 2010 wake-up call occurred with the Stuxnet operation, followed by the “Wiper” and “Flame” malicious code attacks, solidifying the regime's understanding that Iran's adversaries possess a distinct qualitative advantage in offensive cyber activities. By 2016, Iran's cyber capabilities budget was reportedly over USD 1 billion (vs. USD 76 million in 2011), compared to the USD 2 billion budget of the United Kingdom, one of the world's leading cyberpowers. According to Iranian data, the country's cyber budget experienced a twelvefold increase between 2013 and 2021. By the late 2010s, approximately 18% of Iranian university students were studying computer science. Additionally, compulsory military service was utilized to direct technologically skilled graduates toward the state security apparatus, including the MOIS and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC),66 while the topic of cyber defense entered the high school textbook Preparation for Defense.67\nIn March 2012, the Supreme Council of Cyberspace, under the direction of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, was established. The Council is headed by the Iranian President and includes 25 senior government representatives and other key figures, such as the senior commander of the\nIRGC; the head of the Majlis; the Ministers of Science, Communications and Culture; the chief of police; and the president of the Islamic Propaganda Organization. The Council has the power to establish national cyber policy, and its decisions are mandatory for all Iranian institutions operating in the field.68 The National Center for Cyberspace, which is the main division of the Council, is responsible for comprehensive domestic and international surveillance, enforcing the enactments of the council, and preventing Iranians from accessing virtual private networks (VPNs) and internet proxies, which are used to bypass Iran's internet controls.69\nVarious organizations monitor and protect Iran's cyberspace infrastructure. All of them are affiliated with different government institutions and operate in different fields. A key defensive organization within this structure is the Cyberspace Defense Command, which functions under the Passive Defense Organization of the general staff of the armed forces. This organization is made up of both military personnel and representatives from the Communications, Defense, Intelligence, and Industry ministries. Its primary goal is to establish a comprehensive defensive strategy for safeguarding state institutions and infrastructures from potential cyber threats. The Cyberspace Defense Command is primarily focused on defense and does not appear to be engaged in offensive cyber activities. Another defensive entity within Iran's cyberspace structure is the Center for Information Security, also known as MAHER. This center is established and operated under the Communications and Information Technologies Ministry and is primarily responsible for activating computer security incident response teams during emergencies and cyberattacks. Furthermore, MAHER trains skilled manpower, develops response mechanisms for cyber crises, and stores and disseminates data security know-how. The center is responsible for defending all government websites, as well as those of private companies that are officially registered with the Communications Ministry.70 The Committee for Identifying Unauthorized Sites and FATA (an acronym for the Police for the Sphere of the Production and Exchange of Information) act as Iran's cyber police, overseeing internet usage for both domestic suppression and countering cybercrime.71 The IRGC runs its cyber operations, both defensive and offensive, through the IRGC Cyber-Electronic Command (IRGC-CEC), which is headquartered at the Ammar Cyberspace Base.72\nRegarding Iran's offensive cyber capabilities, the IRGC and MOIS are responsible for conducting both independent and joint offensive operations against perceived and real threats to Iranian national security. Among these two entities, the IRGC undoubtedly takes the lead. Its Electronic Warfare and Cyber Defense Organization offers training courses in cyber defense, restricts access to online content, and censors digital communications in Iranian cyberspace73 and “bears primary responsibility for offensive cyber\noperations.”74 By 2009, the IRGC started enlisting professionals for its internal cyberforce, as well as the closely associated military unit known as the Iranian Cyber Army (ICA). That same year, the Basij Cyber Council, another cyber entity overseen by the IRGC, revealed that it had trained 1,500 cybersecurity specialists. These professionals were prepared to join the IRGC's expanding offensive operations and espionage division. In 2010, the Basij cyber unit's leaders publicly declared their intention to launch digital attacks targeted at the actions of the “Zionist Entity,” Israel.75 The IRGC trains, equips, and provides operational support in the cyberdomain to Iranian proxies such as Hezbollah. For instance, in 2021, the IRGC helped establish a cybersecurity unit within Hezbollah's counterintelligence service. In parallel, a cybertraining facility disguised as a branch of Tehran's Sharif University was opened in Dahiye, in the southern suburbs of Beirut.76\nIran's cyberspace development is mainly driven by universities and technological institutes, with a focus on information technology (IT), computer engineering, and communications. Key institutions include Amirkabir University of Technology, Imam Hossein University, Shahid Beheshti University, and Sharif University of Technology. The Iranian government supports IT and computer communications companies through direct and indirect investments, with key government bodies being the Science Ministry, the Information and Communications Ministry, the Technology Cooperation Office, and hi-tech greenhouses like the Pardis Technology Park and Guilan Science and Technology Park.77 Furthermore, the universities play a crucial role in subcontracting cyber operations to front companies and individuals. Over the years, a tiered approach to cyber operations has developed within the Iranian intelligence landscape. At its core is a trusted network of middle managers—often university employees—who are ideologically aligned with the Iranian government and who translate intelligence priorities into segmented cyber tasks. These tasks are then bid out to multiple contractors, where about 50 organizations compete for regime-sponsored projects. The authorities compartmentalize tasks, often requiring different contractors for various parts of a project, such as creating exploits and establishing unauthorized access. Payments are only made upon the completion of the task, as competition is fierce and contractors are pitted against each other. Characteristic in this context is the case of Monica Witt—a former U.S. Air Force intelligence specialist who served in the Air Force from 1997 through 2008 and then with a defense contractor until 2010. Defecting to Iran in 2013, Witt leaked top-secret information to the Iranians, including the identities of U.S. intelligence agents and highly classified intelligence collection programs.78 In 2015, four Iranian hackers, coopted by the IRCG, targeted U.S. intelligence and military personnel in an unsophisticated and poorly executed cyber operation that ultimately failed.79\nAlthough Iran boasts a large network of IT professionals, the Islamic regime's inherent paranoia creates unique challenges. Those with the greatest offensive cyber skills and those demonstrating adherence to the government's ideology are usually mutually exclusive.80 Furthermore, the country is facing a significant brain drain, as many cybersecurity experts are leaving Iran at an alarming pace.\nCooperation with foreign actors, particularly China, North Korea, and Russia, has significantly contributed to Iran's cyber capabilities. In 2015, Russia and Iran signed the first cyber cooperation agreement, recognizing common threats in the cyberdomain. In 2017, a memorandum of understanding for cooperation on information and communication technology (ICT)--related issues, including “internet governance, network security,” and “international internet connection” was signed. In 2021, Russia and Iran concluded the agreement on information security aimed to coordinate activities in response to the growing importance of cyber issues in international relations and ICT-related crimes, as well as the creation of an Iranian “sovereign internet.”81 Since the beginning of the Ukraine conflict in 2022, Russia has supplied Iran with communication-surveillance capabilities, eavesdropping devices, advanced photography equipment, and lie detectors, and reportedly also shared more advanced software with Iran, enabling it to hack phones and systems of dissidents and adversaries. Protei Ltd. a Russian company specializing in communication monitoring tools, has started providing internet censorship software to the Iranian mobile services provider Ariantel. The Protei tools are believed to be part of a developing mobile phone system that would allow Iranian state authorities to directly monitor, intercept, redirect, degrade, or deny mobile communications.82 In 2021, Iranian cybersecurity company Lotus Gostar Arya (or Cysec) opened a branch in Kazan to foster cooperation and exchange of know-how between Iran and Russia.83\nOn 17 January 2025, Russia and Iran further solidified their partnership by signing the “Treaty on Comprehensive Strategic Partnership.” Article 4 of the treaty explicitly stipulates that the intelligence and security services of both nations “shall exchange information and experience and enhance the level of their cooperation.” This agreement is expected to further deepen collaboration in the cyber domain.84\nIn December 2010, the Chinese telecommunications firm ZTE Corp. sold a surveillance system to Iran's Telecommunication Co. of Iran (TCI) as part of a USD 130.6 million networking equipment contract. The surveillance system can monitor landline, mobile, and internet communications. TCI, which had at that time a near monopoly on Iran's landline telephone services, managed a significant portion of Iran's internet traffic.85 In 2019, China and Iran agreed to establish a joint workgroup to tackle cyber threats, emphasizing cooperation in IT, addressing cyber threats, and “counter[ing] U.S.\nunilateralism.”86 In 2009, a significant intelligence failure committed by the CIA occurred when a faulty web-based covert communications system used by the CIA in Iran was exposed, resulting in the arrest and execution of numerous CIA informants. The Iran events coincided with a similar setback in China in 2011 and 2012, where around 30 agents were apprehended and executed. Some officials suspected that the two nations might have collaborated, with Iran offering China technical information about the exposed communications system in exchange for equipment and expertise.87\nIn September 2012, Iran and North Korea signed a technology cooperation agreement, which allegedly included the cyberdomain.88 Iran potentially could have provided information on Stuxnet to North Korea, which ultimately prevented the Stuxnet-similar attack on the North Korean nuclear facility. A tightly controlled network and the inability of physical penetration of the facility to install the worm into the command systems might have also contributed to the failure.89\nTo conclude, Iran shares some defensive strategies with small states, such as resource constraints and the high costs associated with developing sophisticated offensive tools. Iran's investment in education and the development of technological expertise is consistent with the technology-oriented strategic culture described by Domingo. In a similar vein, the country's emphasis on training and harnessing its human capital shows how smaller states leverage technology to compensate for limited resources. The programs focusing on cyber hygiene, incident response teams, and legislative frameworks also mirror the defensive strategies typically adopted by small states.\nHowever, unlike many small states that focus primarily on defense, Iran has developed substantial offensive cyber capabilities. Organizations like the IRGC-CEC and ICA actively engage in offensive operations, targeting both regional adversaries and global entities. This level of offensive capability is more characteristic of larger, more powerful states. The integration of foreign expertise and technology, such as surveillance systems and cybersecurity tools, underscores Iran's ability to leverage international partnerships to bolster its cyber posture. The extent and sophistication of Iran's offensive operations, including cyberespionage and attacks, distinguish it from the typical small-state cyber posture, which often lacks the resources to develop such capabilities. Iran's cyber budget and institutional support structures, including the Supreme Cyberspace Council, are substantial compared to those of typical small states. The scale of investment and the comprehensive nature of its cyber governance framework indicate a level of state commitment that exceeds what is usually seen in smaller states with limited resources.\nSuch a combination of defensive focus, substantial offensive capacity, extensive foreign partnerships, and significant state investment makes Iran a unique player in the cyber landscape of small states.\nLEAKED INSIGHTS: IRAN'S CYBERDFENSE LANDSCAPE AND STRATEGIC CULTURE\nOver the last decade, Iran has been actively building a multifaceted cyber defense system to safeguard its critical infrastructure, suppress opposition groups, and block perceived harmful content, all aimed at maintaining the regime's stability. Guided by the Supreme Council of Cyberspace, Iran's numerous governmental agencies have been at the forefront of the implementation of this strategy. Despite such a concerted effort, the Iranian state organizations, including the MOIS, have been regularly experiencing high-impact leaks. For instance, since 2017 and into 2019, self-declared Iranian dissident groups—such as Lab Dookhtegan, Green Leakers, Black Box, and Hidden Reality—have emerged as “mystery groups” with unclear origins and affiliations.90 Over time, these groups have built reputations as reliable sources of information, exposing Iranian intelligence and military operations both within Iran and across the Middle East.91\nThe agencies tasked with cyber defense, although numerous and mature, are, as it seems, still lacking capabilities and know-how to fully prevent high-impact breaches. The researchers inside Iran have pointed out a number of weak points in the Iranian cyber defense. Hassan Monfared, writing about the cyberwarfare of the Iranian armed forces, finds that they lack a comprehensive view of cyber defense and highlights the need for a systematic approach to stabilize and improve cyber combat readiness across the army ranks.92 Shafiee et al. from Passive Defense Organization see the need to improve management of public opinion through cyberspace and identify several psychological operations techniques aimed at improving the image of the army and countering adversaries' psychological operations.93 Similarly, Mohammad Tabatabaei and Ehsan Movahedian in their study of the U.S cyber influence operations against Iran's internet users stress a gap in Iran's ability to counter foreign cyber influence effectively.94 Abolfazl and Mahdi Rohani stress cyberspace's dual nature as both a threat and opportunity and propose a catalog of measures to effectively managing and mitigating cyber threats. Interestingly enough, the measures proposed by the researchers are strikingly similar to those revealed in the leaked documents discussed below. They include strengthening the Supreme Council of Cyberspace and the National Cyber Space Center's role as the country's cyber focal point; enhancing capabilities of organizations such as the ICA; developing a local internet industry and broadband ecosystem; strengthening local entrepreneurs active in cyberdomain; and more active utilization of cyberspace for conflict, war, competition, and information operations against adversaries.95 Very insightful in this context is the confidential letter produced by Ali Asghar Qaimi, the advisor in the field of communication and IT, security, and cyber defense, to the speaker of the Iranian parliament,\nMohammad Bagher Ghalibaf.96 In it, Qaimi lists sixteen “challenges” faced by the Iranian cyber defense as of January 2024. Among them are: big differences in the quality of online infrastructure in various government bodies; existence of uncovered vulnerabilities and planted backdoors; lack of proper monitoring and action plans to locate and fix vulnerabilities; widespread attempts to cover up problems, incidents, and cyberattacks; lack of organizational discipline within the agencies responsible for vital and sensitive infrastructure; shortage of skilled personnel in the fields of security and cyber defense; utilization of unsuitable external cyber defense products in the vital infrastructure; the multiplicity of decisionmaking authorities and their interference, leading to the adoption of often contradictory decisions; brain drain of cybersecurity experts; and the long and exhausting process of obtaining security licenses and qualifications for individuals and private security companies.97 Qaimi concludes that, because many organizations in Iran fail to meet minimum security requirements, one should expect further cyberattacks, disclosure of information, and disruption of services in the future.98 To sum up, the challenges faced by Iran's cyber defense system, as outlined by Iranian researchers, highlight significant gaps in infrastructure, personnel, and overall preparedness, painting a troubling picture of the country's vulnerability to cyber threats. These weaknesses are also mirrored in a letter by Qaimi that lists several critical deficiencies, providing a realistic view on the current situation with cyber defense.\nThe analysis of the leaked documents begins with the four-year plan, classified as “secret,” laid down on 23 July 2021, by new Minister of Intelligence Hojjat al-Islam Seyyed Ismail Khatib. Although the document tackles the challenges and priorities related to cybersecurity, it does not explicitly describe the current state of cybersecurity in the country. Nevertheless, it highlights the significance of modernizing intelligence infrastructure to address cyber threats effectively, including monitoring, prevention, and capacity building in cyber.99 It also emphasizes the importance of protecting critical infrastructure, combating cyberespionage, and enhancing cooperation with international partners in cybersecurity efforts. The document refers to “the concrete operational plans” that need to be put in place based on the resolutions by the Supreme Council of Cyberspace.100\nIn addition to the four-year plan that due to its programmatic nature tackles the topic of cyber without sufficient depth, six other documents, all of which explicitly focus on various aspects of cybersecurity, will be analyzed using a framework of seven interconnected themes. These themes, which have been consistently addressed in all documents, provide a comprehensive understanding of Iran's approach to cybersecurity:Governance and regulatory framework,National Information Network,\n.International engagement and cyber diplomacy,Control over information flows and protection of Islamic-Iranian identity,Economic and technological integration within the cyberdomain,Human resources and workforce development, andCybersecurity infrastructure and cyber protective mechanisms.\n### Governance and Regulatory Framework\nThe importance of the Supreme Council of Cyberspace as the main body responsible for Iran's cyberdomain has been stressed in all documents. The decisions of the Council must be considered binding and be implemented by all organizations, including the office of the prosecutor and the courts.101 The Council also plays a crucial role in determining the budgetary spending on cybersecurity and monitoring measures to protect Iran's critical infrastructure.102 It is interesting to note in this context that the performance of the National Center for Cyberspace, which is controlled by the Council, is regularly assessed based on the principles of good governance (salamat-e edari).103\n### National Information Network\nEstablishing a “reliable, safe, stable, integrated, and extensive infrastructure throughout the country based on the National Information Network”104 that would enable the regime to “[r]educe as much as possible access to unauthorized foreign platforms”105 is seen as one of the most important priorities monitored by the Council. The Ministry of Communications and Information Technology was entrusted with the responsibility of connecting at least 80% of the country's households and businesses to the National Information Network by the end of 2023.106 In the foreseeable future, Iran's satellite infrastructure and the National Information Network should be integrated, further solidifying the country's digital autonomy and enhancing its cybersecurity capabilities.107\n### International Engagement and Cyber Diplomacy\nIn the international arena, Iran pursues two goals in the cyberdomain: first, to expand cooperation with allied and friendly nations, especially Islamic countries,108 as well as to “[a]chieve an active, strong, and purposeful presence in regional and international assemblies and institutions.”109 Second, Iran seeks to strengthen its position as a formidable cyberpower, leveraging international bodies as deterrent mechanisms in its cyberspace.110 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs plays a major role in setting up a “cyber space diplomacy system,” as well as assisting other state agencies in dealing with international organizations.111\n###\nControl over Information Flows and Protection of Islamic--Iranian Identity\nProtecting the Islamic--Iranian identity and lifestyle is a crucial aspect of cyber defense in Iran. Consequently, the country regulates social media presence in accordance with its laws and values. The Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance plays a significant role in this regard, responsible for registering official accounts, closing fake accounts, and blocking unauthorized advertisements of foreign social networks.112 As a countermeasure to potential threats in the digital space, content providers in Iran are required to promote the “discourse of the Islamic Revolution” and contribute to the creation of a “new Islamic civilization in cyberspace.”113 Government employees are forbidden from being present on “unauthorized social media platforms” without permission and required to follow guidelines and regulations if they are present on “approved” platforms.114\n### Economic and Technological Integration within the Cyberdomain\nIn the field of economic and technological integration within the cyberdomain, Iran pursues a twofold strategy—increasing the share of domestic products and services in cybersecurity, and supporting local providers. Thus, the need to double the local content of products and services has been emphasized time and again in different strategic documents.115 In parallel, the share of the digital segment in the Iranian economy is planned to reach 10% by 2031,116 while some suggest that the same share should be set at 20% of the Gross Domestic Product.117 Support of the local providers of products and services is considered vital. Several authors recommend that authorities make “[m]aximum usage of private cyber security contractors”118 and “support companies, particularly in the fields of security systems, locally-built browsers, and national messengers.”119\n### Human Resources and Workforce Development\nIn addition, it is considered crucial to address the need to establish criteria for recruiting, retaining, and protecting experts in the cybersecurity domain, as such plans require careful design and implementation.120 The salaries of cybersecurity specialists should be increased and the issue of brain drain requires urgent attention.121 Furthermore, the cybersecurity literacy among government employees needs to be addressed through internal training and specialized courses.122 The number of student admissions in cybersecurity-related fields also needs to be expanded.123 The goal is to create a reservoir of skilled and efficient cybersecurity experts, thereby gaining a strategic advantage for Iran in this area.124\nCybersecurity Infrastructure and Cyber Protective Mechanisms\nIran's cyber defense strategy has, over the decade, evolved as a multifaceted approach that includes regular assessments, clear role assignments, and a catalogue of proactive measures. The establishment and continuous development of cybersecurity measures within all state institutions are considered critical in safeguarding national security. The institutions are obliged to create and implement comprehensive cyberspace security plans to prevent, combat, and manage cyber incidents,125 including cyber drills.126 Additionally, regular evaluations and situational reports mandated to assess the fulfillment of cybersecurity tasks must be submitted to the Supreme Council of Cyberspace.127 Nongovernmental institutions are also urged to organize and enhance their cybersecurity capabilities.128\nAccording to the top-secret document of April 2023, the task of guarding Iran's cyber borders was at that time the responsibility of the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology. However, the document complains that this mission is not logically aligned with the Ministry's posture in protecting Iran's communication and information infrastructure. As a result, the role of the armed forces and the country's intelligence agencies in this area has been overlooked. Hence, it was necessary to reevaluate the legal framework for cyber border protection and consider assigning this important task to an organization that is better equipped to handle it. In addition, a plethora of organizations responsible for cyber defense, including the Passive Defense Organization, the Center for Information Security, and the cyber police (FATA), have overlapping responsibilities. This requires a clear definition of their roles and duties, particularly in their relations to the armed forces, the IRGC, and the Ministry of Intelligence.129 Furthermore, the general staff of the armed forces was “[t]asked to prepare a national program to prevent and address defense-security threats posed by unauthorized satellite systems for Iranian cyber space.”130\nThe insights gained from the documents examined in this section underline the key premises of strategic culture defined earlier. The overall structure of Iran's cyber governance is heavily centralized, reflecting Iran's historical preference for a strong, centralized leadership, which is seen as necessary to maintain order and control in a complex and multifaceted society. The country's commitment to reducing foreign dependence and fostering a self-reliant digital economy aligns with the drive toward self-sufficiency and autonomy as seen through historical experience of invasions and influence from foreign powers. In the eternal struggle between virtue and evil, a dwindling human capital in the cyberdomain needs to be exploited and protected to advance the country's strategic interests, as the entire society should remain resilient, in line with the values of vigilance and resistance against external threats. Internationally, Iran considers itself a leader of the\nIslamic world that stays firm in the face of Western influence. By leveraging international bodies as deterrent mechanisms, the regime attempts to project power and protect its interests in cyberspace. Iran's dual strategy of enhancing domestic cybersecurity capabilities while also striving for technological independence and integration into the global cyberdomain mirrors its cultural emphasis on adaptability to secure the country's position in a complex and competitive international environment. The role of cultural and media institutions in cyberspace is critical for the regime, as their task is to promote the dual elements of Iranian identity—nationality and religion. Such an emphasis on aligning cyber content with Islamic principles demonstrates the intertwining of religious ideology with national identity, as it reinforces the regime's narrative and counters foreign cultural influence.\nFinally, while concrete data are lacking, it is reasonable to infer that the multidecade economic and technological sanctions imposed on Iran have significantly affected its cyber defense capabilities, influencing both its strategy and the evolution of its cyber infrastructure. These sanctions have severely limited Iran's ability to acquire advanced cyber defense technologies, as restrictions on access to key software, hardware, and encryption technologies hinder the country's efforts to build a sophisticated cybersecurity infrastructure. A comprehensive analysis examining the impact of sanctions on Iran's cyber defense capabilities would be a fascinating subject for further study, shedding light on the consequences of such restrictions and their potential long-term effects on a nation's ability to protect itself in the cyber realm.\n## CONCLUSION\nA strategic culture that shaped Iranian perceptions, values, and norms has its roots in Persian culture and Shia Islam. Iran's historical experiences of conquest and foreign domination have led to a siege mentality, conspiracy thinking, and the admiration of cunning and manipulation. Besides, a unique blend of historical experiences and geostrategic positions have shaped Iran's sense of identity and its perception of exceptionalism and superiority. Some Iranian authors even advance the notion of “geopolitical superiority,” arguing that Iran's strategic positioning and its “geographical gravity” can somehow compensate for its technological deficiencies—a belief that underestimates the role of and need for technological advancement in the face of modern threats and evolving security dynamics.131\nConsequently, these specific operational codes, histories, and assumptions of strategic culture have a significant influence on the country's cyber defense posture, characterized by heightened sensitivity to cyberattacks by hostile actors. The Stuxnet attack was probably a pivotal moment that revealed Iran's vulnerabilities to advanced cyber threats from hostile actors and solidified the Manichean worldview of ruling elites about perceived external\nthreats, especially those emanating from the West. Over the last decade, Iran adopted a multifaceted approach to safeguarding infrastructure, suppressing opposition, and countering foreign influence. Iran has achieved a unique position in the cyber landscape that is characterized by a mix of defensive focus, offensive capabilities, partnerships with allied states, and significant state investment. The country's comprehensive cyber strategy and governance framework position it as a formidable player, blending characteristics of both small and larger states.\nOver the last few years, Iranian-affiliated cyber threat actors have demonstrated the ability to execute sustained, complex, and disruptive operations across multiple sectors outside of Iran. These groups frequently utilize advanced tactics, techniques, and procedures, continuously refining their strategies to avoid detection and maintain access to compromised networks. The coordination among these actors and their shared use of resources and tools demonstrate a unified effort to support Iran's geopolitical aims. Their ongoing use of destructive malware, ransomware, and espionage operations underscores the threat they pose, particularly in the context of regional tensions and global political events. Thus, Iran was one of the most assertive foreign actors attempting to create discord ahead of the 2024 U.S. presidential elections. Iranian operatives have launched influence operations targeting U.S. audiences, potentially aiming to sway the outcome of the elections. This cyber-enabled influence campaign is being driven by a mix of actors conducting preliminary cyber reconnaissance and inserting online personas and websites into the information ecosystem. In June 2024, hackers linked to the IRGC successfully infiltrated the Trump campaign, stealing internal documents and leaking them to media outlets.132\nIn the cyber defensive domain, the leaked documents mostly confirm the conclusions derived from the sources available in the public domain. The materials show that Iran has developed a multifaceted cyber defense system aimed at protecting its critical infrastructure, controlling information, and maintaining regime stability. The Supreme Council of Cyberspace oversees this strategy, coordinating efforts across various governmental agencies. Highly centralized cyber governance aims at strengthening the country's self-reliance and reducing foreign dependence, aligning with Iran's strategic culture of resistance to external influences. Internationally, Iran's posture is marked by adaptability and resilience to secure its position in the global cyberdomain. However, despite the extensive cyber defense measures, Iran still faces significant challenges, such as weaknesses in comprehensive defense strategies, management of public opinion, and countering foreign influence operations. Numerous high-impact leaks experienced by Iranian state organizations revealed persistent issues with infrastructure quality, cyber threat monitoring, and organizational discipline.\nROLE OF STRATEGIC CULTURE IN IRAN'S CYBER DEFENSE POLICY\n681\n# DISCLOSURE STATEMENT\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author."

This culture combines a strong national pride and historical consciousness with values centered on resisting external influences. Ultimately, strategic culture has influenced the country’s cyber capabilities, which have significantly evolved since 2003, largely due to state investment and the establishment of the Supreme Council of Cyberspace in 2012. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and the Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS) lead offensive cyber operations, making Iran’s cyber posture more aligned with larger state powers than typical small states. Leaked documents from the Iranian opposition disclosed that Iran has actively developed a comprehensive cyber defense framework over the past decade to protect its critical infrastructure, quell opposition, and control presumed harmful content to maintain regime stability. Despite these efforts, leaks from dissident groups have exposed persistent weaknesses in Iran’s cyber defense, highlighting challenges in infrastructure, threat monitoring, and organizational discipline. Moreover, these leaks reveal Iran’s strategic focus on self-reliance and resistance to foreign influence.\nDr. Grigorij Serscikov is an Independent Researcher and Consultant with over fifteen years of experience in offering strategic advice and analysis to companies within the energy and financial sectors.

However, the credibility of the leaked documents—that is, the context in which the documents were produced and the intentions of the authors who wrote them4—although it invites certain skepticism, does not currently challenge its validity. Similarly, the representativeness of the papers is established through the sheer volume of the leaked materials on the various topics of Iranian internal and external policies. Therefore, while the authenticity of the documents may be subject to debate, their credibility and representativeness are well established, providing a solid foundation for the research.\nAmong the wealth of primary sources made available to the public, there were several related to Iran's cyber defense strategies, providing researchers with insights into the country's cybersecurity programs. One key document is titled, “The Program Proposed by the Minister of Intelligence Hojjat al-Islam wal-Muslimeen Seyyed Ismail Khatib for the 13th government Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, 23 July 2021”5—the newly appointed head of the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence (MOIS).6 In it, Khatib outlined his vision for the evolution of the MOIS over the next four years, addressing inter alia issues related to Iranian cybersecurity. Other documents that will be examined in this study are: “The Ninety-Fourth Session of the Supreme Council of the Country's Cyber Space of 16 August 2023,”7 “The Ninety-Second Meeting of the Supreme Council of Cyberspace of June 27, 2023,”8 “Parts One and Two of the Strategic Document of the Islamic Republic of Iran on Cyber Space of July 14, 2021,”9 “Requirements and Measures Related to the Use of Satellite Systems in Cyberspace of 30 August 2022,”10 “Opinion Regarding the Promotion of the Cyber Space of 9 April 2023,”11 and “The Letter of the Advisor to the Speaker of the Parliament in the Field of Communication and Information Technology, Security and Cyber Defense of 16 January 2024.”12 Furthermore, Persian-language academic journals published in Iran, such as The Quarterly Journal of Multidisciplinary Studies for Strategic Knowledge, Strategic Studies Quarterly, and The Quarterly of Political Strategic Studies have been tackling the themes related to cybersecurity for almost a decade. Rarely quoted in the West, these publications, whose authors are often affiliated with the country's intelligence and military community, provide an outside-in perspective on the topic and, as will be shown, significantly complement primary sources.\nIranian cyber defense will be examined within the framework of a case study approach—a reliable and often-used methodology to explore the case's “why” and/or “how” questions in situations of complex causality where the researcher has limited control.13 This approach will be further strengthened through a detailed and systematic analysis of the leaked documents, which will play a central role in the research. By integrating the insights derived from the documents, the case study method enables the researcher to achieve high levels of “conceptual validity”—the identification of the most representative features within the specific context of Iranian cyber defense.14 The concept of strategic culture will be applied as a theoretical avenue for the analysis. First appearing in the late 1970s,15 the idea has experienced several waves of scholarly attention since then.16 Johnson and Larsen define strategic culture as “[a] set of shared beliefs, assumptions, and modes of behavior, derived from common experiences and accepted narratives (both oral and written), that shape collective identity and relationships to other groups, and which determine appropriate ends and means for achieving security objectives.”17 A country's strategic culture is not randomly chosen or influenced by intellectual trends. It is shaped by the character and context of its society and becomes, in the views of Jeremy Black, a “cultural assumption” that fits the nation's strategic needs and influences its strategic behavior.18 Strategic culture, which is rooted in historical experiences, can evolve but cannot be easily discarded. It is a crucial factor in a country's strategic effectiveness, but it is not infinitely adaptable. Radical changes in culture only occur as a result of significant political, social, or military shocks. Strategic cultures borrow and adapt from one another, but this process has its limits.\nThe concept of strategic culture is highly suitable for the analysis of cybersecurity and cyberwarfare. For instance, the study prepared for the U.S. Cyber Command applied the notion of strategic culture as a theoretical foundation to build four case studies, one of them Iran.19 The author believes that the concept offers an additional advantage for this research, as it allows for deriving further insights and drawing implications from the primary and secondary sources as well as tracing the development of Iran's strategies to cybersecurity in general and cyber defense in particular during a specific period.20 ROLE OF STRATEGIC CULTURE IN IRAN'S CYBER DEFENSE POLICY # IRANIAN STRATEGIC CULTURE Strategic culture faces the challenge of not having a clear collection of principles or a well-established theoretical framework. The common ground for strategic culture generally involves acknowledging culture as an epiphenomenal factor in the examination of foreign policy and security choices.[21] However, this can be complicated by the fact that strategic culture is not a one-size-fits-all concept. Every actor possesses its own operational code, history, assumptions, and strategic culture. To develop a more streamlined research model, it is necessary to narrow national culture variables to those that consistently impact the actor's policy and hold significant value for that specific culture. For this study, a four-variable model suggested by Jeannie Johnson will be adopted, offering valuable insights for the analysis of Iranian strategic culture. The four variables are:\n\n# Identity\nIranian identity is a complex and multifaceted concept influenced by various factors, such as political values, historical experiences, religion, and geographical location. The Islamic Republic of Iran (IRI) has an identity that is defined by the elements of \"nationality\" and \"religion,\" with the weight and importance of these elements fluctuating over time.[23] The distinctive Persian identity has thrived despite many invasions, with the Iranians adopting some of the invaders' ways but adapting them to be more Persian than not.[24] This sense of identity and pride stems from the cultural continuity that has been maintained over time. At the same time, they also manifest themselves in a sense of superiority and exceptionalism over neighboring countries and peoples.[25] Iran's geography has played a crucial role in its history as a land that has been home to various nomads, invaders, and settlers from surrounding areas. Settled within confines between the Caspian Sea in the north and the Persian Gulf in the south, and enclosed by the\nAND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE VOLUME 38, NUMBER 2\nmountains of Zagros and Alborz, these groups were able to live in relative isolation for extended periods, leading to the emergence of numerous ethnic, religious, tribal, and other groupings that often found reasons to be in conflict with one another.26 According to Pollack, “Because of the discrete separation of so much of the population, Iran became a patchwork of ethnic, religious, tribal, and other groupings, all of whom seemed to find constant reasons for conflict with their neighbors.”27\nThe Islamic Revolution enhanced Iran's sense of exceptionalism and created a potent mixture of religious ideology and deep-seated nationalism.28 Willis Stanley underscores that:“[t]he current Iranian leadership appears to have recognizable goals derived from its unique political ideology, which makes use of Shia Islam's gradual consolidation of a clerical caste and historical Iran's concerns about sovereignty and acceptance of an absolute ruler. In this ideology, Iran and Shia Islam are viewed as the same, indivisible.29”\nThe pride in Iran's pre-Islamic history shared by the majority of Iranians is reframed within an Islamist context and integrated into the overarching narrative. The IRI's perception of its own unique centrality is informed by its awareness of the country's role as one of the region's historical powers, today challenged by the alluring influence of the West as an alternative to the righteous path of the Iranian model.\n### Values\nAnthony Cain quotes Vakili-Zad who notes that the ideology of the Islamic Revolution was shaped by:“those who carried the heavy burden of often bloody confrontations with government troops, [and] were, in general, religiously oriented and linked to traditional values from the rural past ... . [T]he blueprint for future society was the Islamic Republic modeled on the one created by the Prophet Muhammad more than 1,400 years earlier.30”\nSeven years before the revolution, Ali Shariati, a leading Iranian sociologist and revolutionary, in his first public lecture on Islamology, insisted that a reassembly of past cultural values would underpin an overturning of the existing order.31 Such a remodeling of values, with an ultimate goal of creating a just society, cannot be achieved without a perennial struggle against the forces of evil. Ayatollah Khomeini believed that the world is perpetually embroiled in a struggle between good and evil, where the forces of virtue must resist domination and fight against oppression and injustice.32 Most importantly, the threats posed by rival cultures that have different sets of\nvalues from which Iranian society must be cleansed. If these values were to reemerge, it would signify the failure of the revolution's primary objective.33 As a result, the IRI's efforts to maintain the ethos of resistance and jihad against presumed or real adversaries are rooted in the moral and spiritual values of the Islamic Revolution. They are essential mechanisms created to insulate Iranian society against subversive foreign cultural influences and project Iran's power to confront its adversaries abroad. In this context, the concept of moqavamat (resistance) plays an important role. Initially originated as a slogan in the Palestinian national movement in the 1960s, it evolved into a quasi-religious doctrine of armed struggle by Palestinian Hamas and Lebanese Hizballah in the 1980s. It was later adopted by Iran. Although the doctrine of resistance has foreign origins, it resonates deeply with those who embrace the Shi'ite martyrdom narrative of Imam Hussein, who chose resistance and martyrdom at Karbala over surrender to the unjust seventh-century Caliph Yazid.34 Iranian scholars Hossein Salimi and Amin Hejazi, while explicitly highlighting the defensive nature of Iranian jihad, mention resistance against oppression and defense of the oppressed, negation of Western dominance, independence, and self-sufficiency as core values of the IRI.35\nTo sum up, the values that emerged after the Islamic Revolution in Iran, shaped by its religiously oriented and traditionally minded founders, are deeply rooted in a Manichean and one-dimensional worldview that pits good against evil, with the West representing the forces of evil threatening Iranian society. These values serve to protect Iran from foreign cultural influences and uphold principles of resistance.\n### Norms\nPierre Pahlavi and Eric Ouellet observe that Iran has often seen itself as isolated and threatened by neighboring countries due to its unique status as the only Persian-speaking, Shia nation in a predominantly Turkish--Arabic, Sunni region. This perception is exacerbated by the country's size, which makes it significant on the global stage but vulnerable to external threats. To cope with these challenges, Iran has historically pursued two strategic goals: protecting “fortress Iran” by maintaining economic autonomy and territorial integrity and expanding its regional influence as a buffer. While these objectives may seem contradictory, they are complementary and can be achieved through both offensive and detente strategies, transcending internal ideological differences.36 Such an ambiguous environment requires a specific set of norms and a distinct strategic culture that would govern the country's modus operandi.\nIndeed, according to some experts, IRI's strategic culture, influenced by the norms derived from both Persian culture and Shia Islam, includes the use\nof strategic ambiguity and deception, avoidance of frontal attacks, and soft power. When the country's interests are at stake, the strict tenets of Islamic jurisprudence can be abrogated under the concept of maslaha, or acting in the public interest.37 In addition, Kayhan Barzegar and Abdolrasool Divsallar speak about strategic patience, use of low-cost engagements, and diminishing rivals' margin to maneuver as the instruments that the current Iranian regime has masterfully applied for decades. Strategic patience is a deliberate postponement of decisions on critical national security issues, allowing Iran to buy time and conserve resources. This approach is particularly useful in situations where strategic limits exist and available resources are insufficient to counter them. Iranians, who lived under constant insecurity, practiced strategic patience as a means of avoiding emotional, reactionary decisions in the face of harsh conditions. Low-cost engagements, such as hybrid warfare and the use of proxies, are other aspects of norms that influence IRI's strategic culture. In countries like Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen, Iran has created a network of foreign fighters, military advisers, and local regime irregulars under Iranian advisory commands. Additionally, Iran employs a defensive strategy aimed at reducing its rivals' margin to maneuver by blocking their actions and limiting their choices. Called, since 2005, “mosaic defense doctrine,” this strategy includes the concept of “all-around defense,” which brings together all state, nonstate, and private actors to confront threats, and “strategic depth,” which involves creating security buffer zones to reduce the risk of direct attacks on Iranian territory. Anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) capabilities, which encompass military, informational, economic, and political measures, are used by Iran to disrupt adversaries' interests and reduce their choices, thereby raising the cost of any potential hostilities.38 Central to “mosaic doctrine” is the mobilization of a vast and dispersed militia force designed to engage invading forces in protracted, attritional warfare, thereby exhausting their resources and resolve.39\n### Perceptive Lens\nThe title of Graham Fuller's 1991 RAND Corporation study, The Center of the Universe, mirrors the perspective of the IRI's elites, who believe that Iran holds a natural, indispensable, and leading role in the Middle East and potentially the entire Muslim world.40 Such an inflated view of centrality and historic role of Iran is underlined by a deep-seated Iranian identity and a broadly shared historical awareness of Iran's power status in the region. Consequently, the occurrences that contradict these self-centered views may cause cognitive dissonance among Iranians. During his captivity as a hostage in the U.S. embassy in Tehran, following its takeover by Iranian “students” in November 1979, William Daugherty, then the Central Intelligence Agency\n(CIA) Chief of Station, noted that his captors struggled to comprehend and were personally offended by his inability to communicate in Persian, the language of what they considered such an important country as Iran.41 Experiences of victimization, insecurity, and feelings of inferiority have contributed to shaping Iran's sense of pride and significance. Initially, Iran was a nation of conquerors, but over time, it was invaded, conquered, and humbled by various powers, such as the Greeks, Arabs, Mongols, and Turks. The most recent manifestation of this victimization complex is linked to the British and Russian quasi-colonial domination of Iran from the nineteenth to the mid-twentieth centuries and the perceived American influence over Iran after World War II.42\nThe centuries of foreign domination had caused an acute sensitivity among Iranians about the role of foreigners in their culture and politics. Iranians believe, as Marvin Zonis emphasizes, that “[t]he rest of the world is somehow so taken with Iran's significance that it cannot let it go.”43 A siege mentality is fortified by real or presumed threats posed by both nearby and distant enemies. As a result, a pervasive culture of conspiracy thinking has emerged within Iranian society, with many viewing external forces as manipulating or undermining their nation's interests. This phenomenon bears a notable resemblance to the dynamics often attributed to the so-called Arab street. According to Fuller, “Rarely are events to be taken at face value, for to assume them as such is (a) to indicate ignorance of the superior forces around oneself or one's nation and (b) to demonstrate the stupidity, naivete, or insensitivity not to perceive the hidden motives of others.”44 Based on this logic, unanticipated events are not merely isolated incidents but rather the result of powerful external forces that dominate or control the situation. The most complex explanation of political events is usually preferred as the most likely, particularly when foreign powers are involved. While specific interpretations may differ based on individual ideological outlooks, the consensus is that it is naive to assume that a series of developments might be unrelated, particularly when a powerful foreign entity is involved.45\nOther cultural characteristics that have their roots in the prolonged periods of insecurity and foreign rule are a general wariness toward those outside one's intimate circle, particularly authority figures and foreigners, as well as a tendency toward cunning or astuteness. As life is perceived as an unpredictable game of chance, where both favorable and unfavorable opportunities arise and vanish without warning, people outside the inner cycle are considered as inherently malevolent, power-hungry, and irrational. There is a lack of trust in interpersonal relationships and altruistic motives are often looked at with suspicion.46 The mistrust leads to the necessity for manipulation in the struggle for survival, “empty and meaningless adulation,” and consequently, an expectation that others will also attempt to manipulate.47 Consequently, the\nfigure of the clever dissimulator, or zeræng, emerges. As described by William Beeman, zeræng is “[a]n operation on the part of an adroit operator that involves thwarting direct interpretation of his own actions or deliberately leading others to erroneous interpretation of those actions while being able to successfully interpret the actions of others.”48 Albeit being an inherently negative trait, it is, nevertheless, highly admired by Iranians as they see cleverness and wiliness as essential strategies for navigating and overcoming stronger forces.49 However, the reliance on zeræng, combined with the ingrained insecurity and anxiety about being deceived by strangers, can sometimes result in Iranian actors overplaying their hand in diplomacy, business dealings, and military activities.\nIn conclusion, the analysis of Iranian strategic culture based on four variables—identity, values, norms, and perceptive lens—demonstrates that Iran's identity is a fusion of nationality and religion, with a strong sense of exceptionalism and historical continuity. The values that emerged after the Islamic Revolution are deeply rooted in a Manichean worldview, pitting good against evil, with the West representing the forces of evil. The perceptive lens of Iran's elites is inflated, believing that Iran's indispensable and leading role in the Middle East and potentially the entire Muslim world would somehow compensate for technological deficiencies.\n## Building the Digital Wall: Iran's Cybersecurity Architecture\n### The Cyber Posture of Small States\nCyberspace is a complex and multifaceted concept, encompassing various subconcepts and nuanced definitions. Rain Ottis and Peeter Lorents describe cyberspace as “a time-dependent set of interconnected information systems and the human users that interact with these systems,” stressing a dynamic nature of cyberspace, where significant changes can occur rapidly, in a shorter time frame than other time-dependent systems.50\nCyberspace is widely considered offense-dominant, inferring that it is easier to execute attacks than to defend against them. Offensive dominance in cyberspace is due to varied and rapidly evolving attack vectors, which defenders struggle to keep up with. Such an asymmetry is in favor of an attacker, as offensive cyber capabilities are perceived to be resource-efficient compared to defensive measures, which are costly and often lag behind technological advancements.51 In parallel, traditional deterrence models face challenges in cyberspace due to difficulties in attribution and the covert nature of cyber capabilities. The anonymity and rapid execution of cyberattacks undermine the effectiveness of deterrence, which relies on the threat of assured retaliation. A key challenge in implementing cyber deterrence is the need for a strong system of protection as the first step, but\nmany countries prioritize offensive operations over defense, neglecting defense and resilience, instead focusing on offensive methods to deter adversaries.52 The system-wide framework analysis that focuses on the broadest dynamics and the systemic cyber risks inherent to the internet may be worth considering. It addresses both top-down factors, such as insecure technical standards, and bottom-up, emergent effects, like the spread of insecure Internet of Things (IoT) devices. This framework encompasses the full spectrum of attacks, including nation-state disruptions, espionage, cybercrime, and even hacking driven by curiosity or entertainment. Within this context, the tools, methods, and activities of offensive and defensive operations are relatively distinct.53\nHowever, the true destructive potential of cyber operations remains uncertain and a subject of ongoing speculation and debate within the cybersecurity community. As Torbjørn Pedersen notes,54 the initial anticipation of a “modern Pearl Harbor” or upcoming global cyberwars has given way to a more nuanced understanding of the limitations of cyber operations expressed in the article by Thomas Rid, “Cyber War Will Not Take Place.”55 According to Lennart Maschmeyer, cyber operations face an operational trilemma, where the three variables of speed, intensity of effect, and control are negatively correlated. This means that, in most cases, cyber operations will be either too slow, too low in intensity, or too unreliable to provide significant strategic utility.56 Overall, however, both opponents and proponents of cyberwar agree that cyberspace offers new methods of undermining national power by achieving strategic impact through ongoing campaigns of covert, less violent cyber operations with cumulative effects.57\nThe cyber capabilities of small states, defined by limited resources and smaller populations, are primarily focused on defensive measures. This is due to constraints in funding, a lack of specialized expertise and intelligence resources, and the high costs involved in developing advanced offensive tools. The notion that cyber capabilities provide an asymmetric advantage to weaker states is contested, as evidence suggests that powerful states with advanced resources are better positioned to exploit cyber operations.58 Jon Lindsay cites the Stuxnet operation of 2009--2010 as a prime example, when a malicious code penetrated the Iranian nuclear facility in Natanz, wiping out around 1,000 centrifuges. Although specific details about the Stuxnet operation's time frame and effects still remain obscure, Lindsay argues that this incident demonstrates that cyber capabilities do not automatically grant an advantage to weaker states. He emphasizes that small states encounter significant challenges in weaponizing cyber capabilities to inflict substantial damage.59 All these challenge the notion of asymmetric advantage of weaker adversaries in the cyberdomain proposed by some, suggesting instead that cyber capabilities tend to favor powerful states.60\nSmall states often adopt a technology-oriented strategic culture and focus on enhancing their defensive measures to protect their critical infrastructure and maintain national security. The effectiveness of cyber strategies varies among states, with some successfully integrating them into their national security frameworks, while others struggle to recognize the opportunities and threats associated with increased cyber engagement. However, small states often adopt several common strategies to compensate for their limited resources and cyber capabilities. These strategies may include:61 Cyber hygiene programs: Investing in national cyber hygiene programs to educate citizens and businesses about basic cybersecurity practices. This involves developing cybersecurity curricula in educational institutions, conducting regular training programs for government and private sector employees, and fostering a culture of cyber awareness. In Iran's case, this approach took the form of creating a “halal net,” a locally controlled version of the internet designed to limit public access to information. Incident response teams: Establishing national Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) or Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) to handle and coordinate responses to cyber incidents. Legislation and policy frameworks: Setting up robust legislative and policy frameworks. These frameworks set out the roles and responsibilities of various stakeholders and establish protocols for incident response and information sharing. Investment in technology: Despite resource limitations, small states are increasingly investing in advanced cyber defense technologies, such as intrusion detection systems, encryption, and secure communication platforms to protect critical infrastructure. Public--private partnerships often play a key role in supporting national cybersecurity strategies, provided there is a skilled workforce and organizational infrastructure to effectively utilize these technologies. Additionally, the absence of economic and technological sanctions mechanisms is crucial, as it allows these states to acquire the necessary technologies without significant barriers.Cyber defense alliances, collaboration, and information sharing with other states, international organizations, and private sector partners to enhance cyber defense capabilities.\nPutting the cyber capabilities of small states in the context of strategic culture, Francis Domingo introduced the concept of “technology-oriented” strategic culture, which refers to small states' inclination to rely on technology as a strategy to overcome limited resources, military capabilities, and strategic depth.62 In this context, technology serves as an enabler for states to pursue foreign policy objectives in a more deliberate and strategic manner. A technology-oriented strategic culture can be identified by examining three key implications for small states: High network readiness: Small states with a technology-oriented strategic culture prioritize the development and maintenance of advanced communication\nnetworks, data systems, and digital infrastructure to enhance their overall connectivity and readiness. Technology-driven military force: These states invest in technology-driven military capabilities, such as advanced weapon systems, unmanned aerial vehicles, and cyberwarfare tools, to augment their military power and strategic reach. Relevance of cybersecurity: Cybersecurity becomes a critical concern for small states with a technology-oriented strategic culture, as they recognize the potential risks and vulnerabilities associated with their reliance on technology. As a result, they prioritize the protection of their digital infrastructure and critical data to ensure their national security and maintain their strategic advantages.63\nIran offers an intriguing case study, as its strategic culture, characterized by its identity, values, norms, and perceptual lens, aligns closely with the defensive cybersecurity posture of many small states. The emphasis on resistance, strategic patience, ambiguity, and low-cost engagements constitutes Iran's approach to cyberspace, reflecting broader trends seen in the cyber strategies of small states. However, over the past decade, Iran has significantly stepped up its offensive cyber capabilities, elevating itself, according to some estimates, to the top of the second tier of global cyberpowers, with aspirations to join the leaders.64\n### Iranian Cyber Capabilities\nIran's initial steps to build its defensive cyber capabilities can be traced back to 2003, when units specializing in cybersecurity were set up within several ministries.65 A 2010 wake-up call occurred with the Stuxnet operation, followed by the “Wiper” and “Flame” malicious code attacks, solidifying the regime's understanding that Iran's adversaries possess a distinct qualitative advantage in offensive cyber activities. By 2016, Iran's cyber capabilities budget was reportedly over USD 1 billion (vs. USD 76 million in 2011), compared to the USD 2 billion budget of the United Kingdom, one of the world's leading cyberpowers. According to Iranian data, the country's cyber budget experienced a twelvefold increase between 2013 and 2021. By the late 2010s, approximately 18% of Iranian university students were studying computer science. Additionally, compulsory military service was utilized to direct technologically skilled graduates toward the state security apparatus, including the MOIS and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC),66 while the topic of cyber defense entered the high school textbook Preparation for Defense.67\nIn March 2012, the Supreme Council of Cyberspace, under the direction of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, was established. The Council is headed by the Iranian President and includes 25 senior government representatives and other key figures, such as the senior commander of the\nIRGC; the head of the Majlis; the Ministers of Science, Communications and Culture; the chief of police; and the president of the Islamic Propaganda Organization. The Council has the power to establish national cyber policy, and its decisions are mandatory for all Iranian institutions operating in the field.68 The National Center for Cyberspace, which is the main division of the Council, is responsible for comprehensive domestic and international surveillance, enforcing the enactments of the council, and preventing Iranians from accessing virtual private networks (VPNs) and internet proxies, which are used to bypass Iran's internet controls.69\nVarious organizations monitor and protect Iran's cyberspace infrastructure. All of them are affiliated with different government institutions and operate in different fields. A key defensive organization within this structure is the Cyberspace Defense Command, which functions under the Passive Defense Organization of the general staff of the armed forces. This organization is made up of both military personnel and representatives from the Communications, Defense, Intelligence, and Industry ministries. Its primary goal is to establish a comprehensive defensive strategy for safeguarding state institutions and infrastructures from potential cyber threats. The Cyberspace Defense Command is primarily focused on defense and does not appear to be engaged in offensive cyber activities. Another defensive entity within Iran's cyberspace structure is the Center for Information Security, also known as MAHER. This center is established and operated under the Communications and Information Technologies Ministry and is primarily responsible for activating computer security incident response teams during emergencies and cyberattacks. Furthermore, MAHER trains skilled manpower, develops response mechanisms for cyber crises, and stores and disseminates data security know-how. The center is responsible for defending all government websites, as well as those of private companies that are officially registered with the Communications Ministry.70 The Committee for Identifying Unauthorized Sites and FATA (an acronym for the Police for the Sphere of the Production and Exchange of Information) act as Iran's cyber police, overseeing internet usage for both domestic suppression and countering cybercrime.71 The IRGC runs its cyber operations, both defensive and offensive, through the IRGC Cyber-Electronic Command (IRGC-CEC), which is headquartered at the Ammar Cyberspace Base.72\nRegarding Iran's offensive cyber capabilities, the IRGC and MOIS are responsible for conducting both independent and joint offensive operations against perceived and real threats to Iranian national security. Among these two entities, the IRGC undoubtedly takes the lead. Its Electronic Warfare and Cyber Defense Organization offers training courses in cyber defense, restricts access to online content, and censors digital communications in Iranian cyberspace73 and “bears primary responsibility for offensive cyber\noperations.”74 By 2009, the IRGC started enlisting professionals for its internal cyberforce, as well as the closely associated military unit known as the Iranian Cyber Army (ICA). That same year, the Basij Cyber Council, another cyber entity overseen by the IRGC, revealed that it had trained 1,500 cybersecurity specialists. These professionals were prepared to join the IRGC's expanding offensive operations and espionage division. In 2010, the Basij cyber unit's leaders publicly declared their intention to launch digital attacks targeted at the actions of the “Zionist Entity,” Israel.75 The IRGC trains, equips, and provides operational support in the cyberdomain to Iranian proxies such as Hezbollah. For instance, in 2021, the IRGC helped establish a cybersecurity unit within Hezbollah's counterintelligence service. In parallel, a cybertraining facility disguised as a branch of Tehran's Sharif University was opened in Dahiye, in the southern suburbs of Beirut.76\nIran's cyberspace development is mainly driven by universities and technological institutes, with a focus on information technology (IT), computer engineering, and communications. Key institutions include Amirkabir University of Technology, Imam Hossein University, Shahid Beheshti University, and Sharif University of Technology. The Iranian government supports IT and computer communications companies through direct and indirect investments, with key government bodies being the Science Ministry, the Information and Communications Ministry, the Technology Cooperation Office, and hi-tech greenhouses like the Pardis Technology Park and Guilan Science and Technology Park.77 Furthermore, the universities play a crucial role in subcontracting cyber operations to front companies and individuals. Over the years, a tiered approach to cyber operations has developed within the Iranian intelligence landscape. At its core is a trusted network of middle managers—often university employees—who are ideologically aligned with the Iranian government and who translate intelligence priorities into segmented cyber tasks. These tasks are then bid out to multiple contractors, where about 50 organizations compete for regime-sponsored projects. The authorities compartmentalize tasks, often requiring different contractors for various parts of a project, such as creating exploits and establishing unauthorized access. Payments are only made upon the completion of the task, as competition is fierce and contractors are pitted against each other. Characteristic in this context is the case of Monica Witt—a former U.S. Air Force intelligence specialist who served in the Air Force from 1997 through 2008 and then with a defense contractor until 2010. Defecting to Iran in 2013, Witt leaked top-secret information to the Iranians, including the identities of U.S. intelligence agents and highly classified intelligence collection programs.78 In 2015, four Iranian hackers, coopted by the IRCG, targeted U.S. intelligence and military personnel in an unsophisticated and poorly executed cyber operation that ultimately failed.79\nAlthough Iran boasts a large network of IT professionals, the Islamic regime's inherent paranoia creates unique challenges. Those with the greatest offensive cyber skills and those demonstrating adherence to the government's ideology are usually mutually exclusive.80 Furthermore, the country is facing a significant brain drain, as many cybersecurity experts are leaving Iran at an alarming pace.\nCooperation with foreign actors, particularly China, North Korea, and Russia, has significantly contributed to Iran's cyber capabilities. In 2015, Russia and Iran signed the first cyber cooperation agreement, recognizing common threats in the cyberdomain. In 2017, a memorandum of understanding for cooperation on information and communication technology (ICT)--related issues, including “internet governance, network security,” and “international internet connection” was signed. In 2021, Russia and Iran concluded the agreement on information security aimed to coordinate activities in response to the growing importance of cyber issues in international relations and ICT-related crimes, as well as the creation of an Iranian “sovereign internet.”81 Since the beginning of the Ukraine conflict in 2022, Russia has supplied Iran with communication-surveillance capabilities, eavesdropping devices, advanced photography equipment, and lie detectors, and reportedly also shared more advanced software with Iran, enabling it to hack phones and systems of dissidents and adversaries. Protei Ltd. a Russian company specializing in communication monitoring tools, has started providing internet censorship software to the Iranian mobile services provider Ariantel. The Protei tools are believed to be part of a developing mobile phone system that would allow Iranian state authorities to directly monitor, intercept, redirect, degrade, or deny mobile communications.82 In 2021, Iranian cybersecurity company Lotus Gostar Arya (or Cysec) opened a branch in Kazan to foster cooperation and exchange of know-how between Iran and Russia.83\nOn 17 January 2025, Russia and Iran further solidified their partnership by signing the “Treaty on Comprehensive Strategic Partnership.” Article 4 of the treaty explicitly stipulates that the intelligence and security services of both nations “shall exchange information and experience and enhance the level of their cooperation.” This agreement is expected to further deepen collaboration in the cyber domain.84\nIn December 2010, the Chinese telecommunications firm ZTE Corp. sold a surveillance system to Iran's Telecommunication Co. of Iran (TCI) as part of a USD 130.6 million networking equipment contract. The surveillance system can monitor landline, mobile, and internet communications. TCI, which had at that time a near monopoly on Iran's landline telephone services, managed a significant portion of Iran's internet traffic.85 In 2019, China and Iran agreed to establish a joint workgroup to tackle cyber threats, emphasizing cooperation in IT, addressing cyber threats, and “counter[ing] U.S.\nunilateralism.”86 In 2009, a significant intelligence failure committed by the CIA occurred when a faulty web-based covert communications system used by the CIA in Iran was exposed, resulting in the arrest and execution of numerous CIA informants. The Iran events coincided with a similar setback in China in 2011 and 2012, where around 30 agents were apprehended and executed. Some officials suspected that the two nations might have collaborated, with Iran offering China technical information about the exposed communications system in exchange for equipment and expertise.87\nIn September 2012, Iran and North Korea signed a technology cooperation agreement, which allegedly included the cyberdomain.88 Iran potentially could have provided information on Stuxnet to North Korea, which ultimately prevented the Stuxnet-similar attack on the North Korean nuclear facility. A tightly controlled network and the inability of physical penetration of the facility to install the worm into the command systems might have also contributed to the failure.89\nTo conclude, Iran shares some defensive strategies with small states, such as resource constraints and the high costs associated with developing sophisticated offensive tools. Iran's investment in education and the development of technological expertise is consistent with the technology-oriented strategic culture described by Domingo. In a similar vein, the country's emphasis on training and harnessing its human capital shows how smaller states leverage technology to compensate for limited resources. The programs focusing on cyber hygiene, incident response teams, and legislative frameworks also mirror the defensive strategies typically adopted by small states.\nHowever, unlike many small states that focus primarily on defense, Iran has developed substantial offensive cyber capabilities. Organizations like the IRGC-CEC and ICA actively engage in offensive operations, targeting both regional adversaries and global entities. This level of offensive capability is more characteristic of larger, more powerful states. The integration of foreign expertise and technology, such as surveillance systems and cybersecurity tools, underscores Iran's ability to leverage international partnerships to bolster its cyber posture. The extent and sophistication of Iran's offensive operations, including cyberespionage and attacks, distinguish it from the typical small-state cyber posture, which often lacks the resources to develop such capabilities. Iran's cyber budget and institutional support structures, including the Supreme Cyberspace Council, are substantial compared to those of typical small states. The scale of investment and the comprehensive nature of its cyber governance framework indicate a level of state commitment that exceeds what is usually seen in smaller states with limited resources.\nSuch a combination of defensive focus, substantial offensive capacity, extensive foreign partnerships, and significant state investment makes Iran a unique player in the cyber landscape of small states.\nLEAKED INSIGHTS: IRAN'S CYBERDFENSE LANDSCAPE AND STRATEGIC CULTURE\nOver the last decade, Iran has been actively building a multifaceted cyber defense system to safeguard its critical infrastructure, suppress opposition groups, and block perceived harmful content, all aimed at maintaining the regime's stability. Guided by the Supreme Council of Cyberspace, Iran's numerous governmental agencies have been at the forefront of the implementation of this strategy. Despite such a concerted effort, the Iranian state organizations, including the MOIS, have been regularly experiencing high-impact leaks. For instance, since 2017 and into 2019, self-declared Iranian dissident groups—such as Lab Dookhtegan, Green Leakers, Black Box, and Hidden Reality—have emerged as “mystery groups” with unclear origins and affiliations.90 Over time, these groups have built reputations as reliable sources of information, exposing Iranian intelligence and military operations both within Iran and across the Middle East.91\nThe agencies tasked with cyber defense, although numerous and mature, are, as it seems, still lacking capabilities and know-how to fully prevent high-impact breaches. The researchers inside Iran have pointed out a number of weak points in the Iranian cyber defense. Hassan Monfared, writing about the cyberwarfare of the Iranian armed forces, finds that they lack a comprehensive view of cyber defense and highlights the need for a systematic approach to stabilize and improve cyber combat readiness across the army ranks.92 Shafiee et al. from Passive Defense Organization see the need to improve management of public opinion through cyberspace and identify several psychological operations techniques aimed at improving the image of the army and countering adversaries' psychological operations.93 Similarly, Mohammad Tabatabaei and Ehsan Movahedian in their study of the U.S cyber influence operations against Iran's internet users stress a gap in Iran's ability to counter foreign cyber influence effectively.94 Abolfazl and Mahdi Rohani stress cyberspace's dual nature as both a threat and opportunity and propose a catalog of measures to effectively managing and mitigating cyber threats. Interestingly enough, the measures proposed by the researchers are strikingly similar to those revealed in the leaked documents discussed below. They include strengthening the Supreme Council of Cyberspace and the National Cyber Space Center's role as the country's cyber focal point; enhancing capabilities of organizations such as the ICA; developing a local internet industry and broadband ecosystem; strengthening local entrepreneurs active in cyberdomain; and more active utilization of cyberspace for conflict, war, competition, and information operations against adversaries.95 Very insightful in this context is the confidential letter produced by Ali Asghar Qaimi, the advisor in the field of communication and IT, security, and cyber defense, to the speaker of the Iranian parliament,\nMohammad Bagher Ghalibaf.96 In it, Qaimi lists sixteen “challenges” faced by the Iranian cyber defense as of January 2024. Among them are: big differences in the quality of online infrastructure in various government bodies; existence of uncovered vulnerabilities and planted backdoors; lack of proper monitoring and action plans to locate and fix vulnerabilities; widespread attempts to cover up problems, incidents, and cyberattacks; lack of organizational discipline within the agencies responsible for vital and sensitive infrastructure; shortage of skilled personnel in the fields of security and cyber defense; utilization of unsuitable external cyber defense products in the vital infrastructure; the multiplicity of decisionmaking authorities and their interference, leading to the adoption of often contradictory decisions; brain drain of cybersecurity experts; and the long and exhausting process of obtaining security licenses and qualifications for individuals and private security companies.97 Qaimi concludes that, because many organizations in Iran fail to meet minimum security requirements, one should expect further cyberattacks, disclosure of information, and disruption of services in the future.98 To sum up, the challenges faced by Iran's cyber defense system, as outlined by Iranian researchers, highlight significant gaps in infrastructure, personnel, and overall preparedness, painting a troubling picture of the country's vulnerability to cyber threats. These weaknesses are also mirrored in a letter by Qaimi that lists several critical deficiencies, providing a realistic view on the current situation with cyber defense.\nThe analysis of the leaked documents begins with the four-year plan, classified as “secret,” laid down on 23 July 2021, by new Minister of Intelligence Hojjat al-Islam Seyyed Ismail Khatib. Although the document tackles the challenges and priorities related to cybersecurity, it does not explicitly describe the current state of cybersecurity in the country. Nevertheless, it highlights the significance of modernizing intelligence infrastructure to address cyber threats effectively, including monitoring, prevention, and capacity building in cyber.99 It also emphasizes the importance of protecting critical infrastructure, combating cyberespionage, and enhancing cooperation with international partners in cybersecurity efforts. The document refers to “the concrete operational plans” that need to be put in place based on the resolutions by the Supreme Council of Cyberspace.100\nIn addition to the four-year plan that due to its programmatic nature tackles the topic of cyber without sufficient depth, six other documents, all of which explicitly focus on various aspects of cybersecurity, will be analyzed using a framework of seven interconnected themes. These themes, which have been consistently addressed in all documents, provide a comprehensive understanding of Iran's approach to cybersecurity:Governance and regulatory framework,National Information Network,\n.International engagement and cyber diplomacy,Control over information flows and protection of Islamic-Iranian identity,Economic and technological integration within the cyberdomain,Human resources and workforce development, andCybersecurity infrastructure and cyber protective mechanisms.\n### Governance and Regulatory Framework\nThe importance of the Supreme Council of Cyberspace as the main body responsible for Iran's cyberdomain has been stressed in all documents. The decisions of the Council must be considered binding and be implemented by all organizations, including the office of the prosecutor and the courts.101 The Council also plays a crucial role in determining the budgetary spending on cybersecurity and monitoring measures to protect Iran's critical infrastructure.102 It is interesting to note in this context that the performance of the National Center for Cyberspace, which is controlled by the Council, is regularly assessed based on the principles of good governance (salamat-e edari).103\n### National Information Network\nEstablishing a “reliable, safe, stable, integrated, and extensive infrastructure throughout the country based on the National Information Network”104 that would enable the regime to “[r]educe as much as possible access to unauthorized foreign platforms”105 is seen as one of the most important priorities monitored by the Council. The Ministry of Communications and Information Technology was entrusted with the responsibility of connecting at least 80% of the country's households and businesses to the National Information Network by the end of 2023.106 In the foreseeable future, Iran's satellite infrastructure and the National Information Network should be integrated, further solidifying the country's digital autonomy and enhancing its cybersecurity capabilities.107\n### International Engagement and Cyber Diplomacy\nIn the international arena, Iran pursues two goals in the cyberdomain: first, to expand cooperation with allied and friendly nations, especially Islamic countries,108 as well as to “[a]chieve an active, strong, and purposeful presence in regional and international assemblies and institutions.”109 Second, Iran seeks to strengthen its position as a formidable cyberpower, leveraging international bodies as deterrent mechanisms in its cyberspace.110 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs plays a major role in setting up a “cyber space diplomacy system,” as well as assisting other state agencies in dealing with international organizations.111\n###\nControl over Information Flows and Protection of Islamic--Iranian Identity\nProtecting the Islamic--Iranian identity and lifestyle is a crucial aspect of cyber defense in Iran. Consequently, the country regulates social media presence in accordance with its laws and values. The Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance plays a significant role in this regard, responsible for registering official accounts, closing fake accounts, and blocking unauthorized advertisements of foreign social networks.112 As a countermeasure to potential threats in the digital space, content providers in Iran are required to promote the “discourse of the Islamic Revolution” and contribute to the creation of a “new Islamic civilization in cyberspace.”113 Government employees are forbidden from being present on “unauthorized social media platforms” without permission and required to follow guidelines and regulations if they are present on “approved” platforms.114\n### Economic and Technological Integration within the Cyberdomain\nIn the field of economic and technological integration within the cyberdomain, Iran pursues a twofold strategy—increasing the share of domestic products and services in cybersecurity, and supporting local providers. Thus, the need to double the local content of products and services has been emphasized time and again in different strategic documents.115 In parallel, the share of the digital segment in the Iranian economy is planned to reach 10% by 2031,116 while some suggest that the same share should be set at 20% of the Gross Domestic Product.117 Support of the local providers of products and services is considered vital. Several authors recommend that authorities make “[m]aximum usage of private cyber security contractors”118 and “support companies, particularly in the fields of security systems, locally-built browsers, and national messengers.”119\n### Human Resources and Workforce Development\nIn addition, it is considered crucial to address the need to establish criteria for recruiting, retaining, and protecting experts in the cybersecurity domain, as such plans require careful design and implementation.120 The salaries of cybersecurity specialists should be increased and the issue of brain drain requires urgent attention.121 Furthermore, the cybersecurity literacy among government employees needs to be addressed through internal training and specialized courses.122 The number of student admissions in cybersecurity-related fields also needs to be expanded.123 The goal is to create a reservoir of skilled and efficient cybersecurity experts, thereby gaining a strategic advantage for Iran in this area.124\nCybersecurity Infrastructure and Cyber Protective Mechanisms\nIran's cyber defense strategy has, over the decade, evolved as a multifaceted approach that includes regular assessments, clear role assignments, and a catalogue of proactive measures. The establishment and continuous development of cybersecurity measures within all state institutions are considered critical in safeguarding national security. The institutions are obliged to create and implement comprehensive cyberspace security plans to prevent, combat, and manage cyber incidents,125 including cyber drills.126 Additionally, regular evaluations and situational reports mandated to assess the fulfillment of cybersecurity tasks must be submitted to the Supreme Council of Cyberspace.127 Nongovernmental institutions are also urged to organize and enhance their cybersecurity capabilities.128\nAccording to the top-secret document of April 2023, the task of guarding Iran's cyber borders was at that time the responsibility of the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology. However, the document complains that this mission is not logically aligned with the Ministry's posture in protecting Iran's communication and information infrastructure. As a result, the role of the armed forces and the country's intelligence agencies in this area has been overlooked. Hence, it was necessary to reevaluate the legal framework for cyber border protection and consider assigning this important task to an organization that is better equipped to handle it. In addition, a plethora of organizations responsible for cyber defense, including the Passive Defense Organization, the Center for Information Security, and the cyber police (FATA), have overlapping responsibilities. This requires a clear definition of their roles and duties, particularly in their relations to the armed forces, the IRGC, and the Ministry of Intelligence.129 Furthermore, the general staff of the armed forces was “[t]asked to prepare a national program to prevent and address defense-security threats posed by unauthorized satellite systems for Iranian cyber space.”130\nThe insights gained from the documents examined in this section underline the key premises of strategic culture defined earlier. The overall structure of Iran's cyber governance is heavily centralized, reflecting Iran's historical preference for a strong, centralized leadership, which is seen as necessary to maintain order and control in a complex and multifaceted society. The country's commitment to reducing foreign dependence and fostering a self-reliant digital economy aligns with the drive toward self-sufficiency and autonomy as seen through historical experience of invasions and influence from foreign powers. In the eternal struggle between virtue and evil, a dwindling human capital in the cyberdomain needs to be exploited and protected to advance the country's strategic interests, as the entire society should remain resilient, in line with the values of vigilance and resistance against external threats. Internationally, Iran considers itself a leader of the\nIslamic world that stays firm in the face of Western influence. By leveraging international bodies as deterrent mechanisms, the regime attempts to project power and protect its interests in cyberspace. Iran's dual strategy of enhancing domestic cybersecurity capabilities while also striving for technological independence and integration into the global cyberdomain mirrors its cultural emphasis on adaptability to secure the country's position in a complex and competitive international environment. The role of cultural and media institutions in cyberspace is critical for the regime, as their task is to promote the dual elements of Iranian identity—nationality and religion. Such an emphasis on aligning cyber content with Islamic principles demonstrates the intertwining of religious ideology with national identity, as it reinforces the regime's narrative and counters foreign cultural influence.\nFinally, while concrete data are lacking, it is reasonable to infer that the multidecade economic and technological sanctions imposed on Iran have significantly affected its cyber defense capabilities, influencing both its strategy and the evolution of its cyber infrastructure. These sanctions have severely limited Iran's ability to acquire advanced cyber defense technologies, as restrictions on access to key software, hardware, and encryption technologies hinder the country's efforts to build a sophisticated cybersecurity infrastructure. A comprehensive analysis examining the impact of sanctions on Iran's cyber defense capabilities would be a fascinating subject for further study, shedding light on the consequences of such restrictions and their potential long-term effects on a nation's ability to protect itself in the cyber realm.\n## CONCLUSION\nA strategic culture that shaped Iranian perceptions, values, and norms has its roots in Persian culture and Shia Islam. Iran's historical experiences of conquest and foreign domination have led to a siege mentality, conspiracy thinking, and the admiration of cunning and manipulation. Besides, a unique blend of historical experiences and geostrategic positions have shaped Iran's sense of identity and its perception of exceptionalism and superiority. Some Iranian authors even advance the notion of “geopolitical superiority,” arguing that Iran's strategic positioning and its “geographical gravity” can somehow compensate for its technological deficiencies—a belief that underestimates the role of and need for technological advancement in the face of modern threats and evolving security dynamics.131\nConsequently, these specific operational codes, histories, and assumptions of strategic culture have a significant influence on the country's cyber defense posture, characterized by heightened sensitivity to cyberattacks by hostile actors. The Stuxnet attack was probably a pivotal moment that revealed Iran's vulnerabilities to advanced cyber threats from hostile actors and solidified the Manichean worldview of ruling elites about perceived external\nthreats, especially those emanating from the West. Over the last decade, Iran adopted a multifaceted approach to safeguarding infrastructure, suppressing opposition, and countering foreign influence. Iran has achieved a unique position in the cyber landscape that is characterized by a mix of defensive focus, offensive capabilities, partnerships with allied states, and significant state investment. The country's comprehensive cyber strategy and governance framework position it as a formidable player, blending characteristics of both small and larger states.\nOver the last few years, Iranian-affiliated cyber threat actors have demonstrated the ability to execute sustained, complex, and disruptive operations across multiple sectors outside of Iran. These groups frequently utilize advanced tactics, techniques, and procedures, continuously refining their strategies to avoid detection and maintain access to compromised networks. The coordination among these actors and their shared use of resources and tools demonstrate a unified effort to support Iran's geopolitical aims. Their ongoing use of destructive malware, ransomware, and espionage operations underscores the threat they pose, particularly in the context of regional tensions and global political events. Thus, Iran was one of the most assertive foreign actors attempting to create discord ahead of the 2024 U.S. presidential elections. Iranian operatives have launched influence operations targeting U.S. audiences, potentially aiming to sway the outcome of the elections. This cyber-enabled influence campaign is being driven by a mix of actors conducting preliminary cyber reconnaissance and inserting online personas and websites into the information ecosystem. In June 2024, hackers linked to the IRGC successfully infiltrated the Trump campaign, stealing internal documents and leaking them to media outlets.132\nIn the cyber defensive domain, the leaked documents mostly confirm the conclusions derived from the sources available in the public domain. The materials show that Iran has developed a multifaceted cyber defense system aimed at protecting its critical infrastructure, controlling information, and maintaining regime stability. The Supreme Council of Cyberspace oversees this strategy, coordinating efforts across various governmental agencies. Highly centralized cyber governance aims at strengthening the country's self-reliance and reducing foreign dependence, aligning with Iran's strategic culture of resistance to external influences. Internationally, Iran's posture is marked by adaptability and resilience to secure its position in the global cyberdomain. However, despite the extensive cyber defense measures, Iran still faces significant challenges, such as weaknesses in comprehensive defense strategies, management of public opinion, and countering foreign influence operations. Numerous high-impact leaks experienced by Iranian state organizations revealed persistent issues with infrastructure quality, cyber threat monitoring, and organizational discipline.\nROLE OF STRATEGIC CULTURE IN IRAN'S CYBER DEFENSE POLICY\n\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author."

This culture combines a strong national pride and historical consciousness with values centered on resisting external influences. Ultimately, strategic culture has influenced the country’s cyber capabilities, which have significantly evolved since 2003, largely due to state investment and the establishment of the Supreme Council of Cyberspace in 2012. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and the Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS) lead offensive cyber operations, making Iran’s cyber posture more aligned with larger state powers than typical small states. Leaked documents from the Iranian opposition disclosed that Iran has actively developed a comprehensive cyber defense framework over the past decade to protect its critical infrastructure, quell opposition, and control presumed harmful content to maintain regime stability. Despite these efforts, leaks from dissident groups have exposed persistent weaknesses in Iran’s cyber defense, highlighting challenges in infrastructure, threat monitoring, and organizational discipline. Moreover, these leaks reveal Iran’s strategic focus on self-reliance and resistance to foreign influence.\nDr. Grigorij Serscikov is an Independent Researcher and Consultant with over fifteen years of experience in offering strategic advice and analysis to companies within the energy and financial sectors.

However, the credibility of the leaked documents—that is, the context in which the documents were produced and the intentions of the authors who wrote them4—although it invites certain skepticism, does not currently challenge its validity. Similarly, the representativeness of the papers is established through the sheer volume of the leaked materials on the various topics of Iranian internal and external policies. Therefore, while the authenticity of the documents may be subject to debate, their credibility and representativeness are well established, providing a solid foundation for the research.\nAmong the wealth of primary sources made available to the public, there were several related to Iran's cyber defense strategies, providing researchers with insights into the country's cybersecurity programs. One key document is titled, “The Program Proposed by the Minister of Intelligence Hojjat al-Islam wal-Muslimeen Seyyed Ismail Khatib for the 13th government Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, 23 July 2021”5—the newly appointed head of the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence (MOIS).6 In it, Khatib outlined his vision for the evolution of the MOIS over the next four years, addressing inter alia issues related to Iranian cybersecurity. Other documents that will be examined in this study are: “The Ninety-Fourth Session of the Supreme Council of the Country's Cyber Space of 16 August 2023,”7 “The Ninety-Second Meeting of the Supreme Council of Cyberspace of June 27, 2023,”8 “Parts One and Two of the Strategic Document of the Islamic Republic of Iran on Cyber Space of July 14, 2021,”9 “Requirements and Measures Related to the Use of Satellite Systems in Cyberspace of 30 August 2022,”10 “Opinion Regarding the Promotion of the Cyber Space of 9 April 2023,”11 and “The Letter of the Advisor to the Speaker of the Parliament in the Field of Communication and Information Technology, Security and Cyber Defense of 16 January 2024.”12 Furthermore, Persian-language academic journals published in Iran, such as The Quarterly Journal of Multidisciplinary Studies for Strategic Knowledge, Strategic Studies Quarterly, and The Quarterly of Political Strategic Studies have been tackling the themes related to cybersecurity for almost a decade. Rarely quoted in the West, these publications, whose authors are often affiliated with the country's intelligence and military community, provide an outside-in perspective on the topic and, as will be shown, significantly complement primary sources.\nIranian cyber defense will be examined within the framework of a case study approach—a reliable and often-used methodology to explore the case's “why” and/or “how” questions in situations of complex causality where the researcher has limited control.13 This approach will be further strengthened through a detailed and systematic analysis of the leaked documents, which will play a central role in the research. By integrating the insights derived from the documents, the case study method enables the researcher to achieve high levels of “conceptual validity”—the identification of the most representative features within the specific context of Iranian cyber defense.14 The concept of strategic culture will be applied as a theoretical avenue for the analysis. First appearing in the late 1970s,15 the idea has experienced several waves of scholarly attention since then.16 Johnson and Larsen define strategic culture as “[a] set of shared beliefs, assumptions, and modes of behavior, derived from common experiences and accepted narratives (both oral and written), that shape collective identity and relationships to other groups, and which determine appropriate ends and means for achieving security objectives.”17 A country's strategic culture is not randomly chosen or influenced by intellectual trends. It is shaped by the character and context of its society and becomes, in the views of Jeremy Black, a “cultural assumption” that fits the nation's strategic needs and influences its strategic behavior.18 Strategic culture, which is rooted in historical experiences, can evolve but cannot be easily discarded. It is a crucial factor in a country's strategic effectiveness, but it is not infinitely adaptable. Radical changes in culture only occur as a result of significant political, social, or military shocks. Strategic cultures borrow and adapt from one another, but this process has its limits.\nThe concept of strategic culture is highly suitable for the analysis of cybersecurity and cyberwarfare. For instance, the study prepared for the U.S. Cyber Command applied the notion of strategic culture as a theoretical foundation to build four case studies, one of them Iran.19 The author believes that the concept offers an additional advantage for this research, as it allows for deriving further insights and drawing implications from the primary and secondary sources as well as tracing the development of Iran's strategies to cybersecurity in general and cyber defense in particular during a specific period.20 ROLE OF STRATEGIC CULTURE IN IRAN'S CYBER DEFENSE POLICY # IRANIAN STRATEGIC CULTURE Strategic culture faces the challenge of not having a clear collection of principles or a well-established theoretical framework. The common ground for strategic culture generally involves acknowledging culture as an epiphenomenal factor in the examination of foreign policy and security choices.[21] However, this can be complicated by the fact that strategic culture is not a one-size-fits-all concept. Every actor possesses its own operational code, history, assumptions, and strategic culture. To develop a more streamlined research model, it is necessary to narrow national culture variables to those that consistently impact the actor's policy and hold significant value for that specific culture. For this study, a four-variable model suggested by Jeannie Johnson will be adopted, offering valuable insights for the analysis of Iranian strategic culture. The four variables are:\n\n---\n\n## ## CONCLUSION\n\nA strategic culture that shaped Iranian perceptions, values, and norms has its roots in Persian culture and Shia Islam.

This culture combines a strong national pride and historical consciousness with values centered on resisting external influences. Ultimately, strategic culture has influenced the country’s cyber capabilities, which have significantly evolved since 2003, largely due to state investment and the establishment of the Supreme Council of Cyberspace in 2012. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and the Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS) lead offensive cyber operations, making Iran’s cyber posture more aligned with larger state powers than typical small states. Leaked documents from the Iranian opposition disclosed that Iran has actively developed a comprehensive cyber defense framework over the past decade to protect its critical infrastructure, quell opposition, and control presumed harmful content to maintain regime stability. Despite these efforts, leaks from dissident groups have exposed persistent weaknesses in Iran’s cyber defense, highlighting challenges in infrastructure, threat monitoring, and organizational discipline. Moreover, these leaks reveal Iran’s strategic focus on self-reliance and resistance to foreign influence.\n\nDr. Grigorij Serscikov is an Independent Researcher and Consultant with over fifteen years of experience in offering strategic advice and analysis to companies within the energy and financial sectors.

    "On 26 January 2022, a Persian-speaking group called “GhyamSarnegouni,” which translates as “Rebellion to Overthrow,” established a Telegram account and began leaking internal documents, including many classified as “secret” or “top secret.”1 The group with alleged ties to the leading Iranian opposition movement Mojahedin-e Khalq (MEK), currently based in Albania, claimed that it gained access to 120 servers connected to late President Ebrahim Raisi's internal network and central databases, encompassing more than 1,300 computers.2 As of this publication, the group continues to release internal documents.\n\nWhile the Iranian authorities called the hack “fake,” experts have confirmed its legitimacy.3 The author is aware that the authenticity of the trove could always be questioned due to the sensitivity of the topic for national security and the lack of comparable materials in the public domain. However, the credibility of the leaked documents—that is, the context in which the documents were produced and the intentions of the authors who wrote them4—although it invites certain skepticism, does not currently challenge its validity. Similarly, the representativeness of the papers is established through the sheer volume of the leaked materials on the various topics of Iranian internal and external policies. Therefore, while the authenticity of the documents may be subject to debate, their credibility and representativeness are well established, providing a solid foundation for the research.\n\nAmong the wealth of primary sources made available to the public, there were several related to Iran's cyber defense strategies, providing researchers with insights into the country's cybersecurity programs. One key document is titled, “The Program Proposed by the Minister of Intelligence Hojjat al-Islam wal-Muslimeen Seyyed Ismail Khatib for the 13th government Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, 23 July 2021”5—the newly appointed head of the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence (MOIS).6 In it, Khatib outlined his vision for the evolution of the MOIS over the next four years, addressing inter alia issues related to Iranian cybersecurity. Other documents that will be examined in this study are: “The Ninety-Fourth Session of the Supreme Council of the Country's Cyber Space of 16 August 2023,”7 “The Ninety-Second Meeting of the Supreme Council of Cyberspace of June 27, 2023,”8 “Parts One and Two of the Strategic Document of the Islamic Republic of Iran on Cyber Space of July 14, 2021,”9 “Requirements and Measures Related to the Use of Satellite Systems in Cyberspace of 30 August 2022,”10 “Opinion Regarding the Promotion of the Cyber Space of 9 April 2023,”11 and “The Letter of the Advisor to the Speaker of the Parliament in the Field of Communication and Information Technology, Security and Cyber Defense of 16 January 2024.”12\n\nFurthermore, Persian-language academic journals published in Iran, such as The Quarterly Journal of Multidisciplinary Studies for Strategic Knowledge,",
    "Strategic Studies Quarterly, and The Quarterly of Political Strategic Studies have been tackling the themes related to cybersecurity for almost a decade. Rarely quoted in the West, these publications, whose authors are often affiliated with the country's intelligence and military community, provide an outside-in perspective on the topic and, as will be shown, significantly complement primary sources.\n\nIranian cyber defense will be examined within the framework of a case study approach—a reliable and often-used methodology to explore the case's “why” and/or “how” questions in situations of complex causality where the researcher has limited control.13 This approach will be further strengthened through a detailed and systematic analysis of the leaked documents, which will play a central role in the research. By integrating the insights derived from the documents, the case study method enables the researcher to achieve high levels of “conceptual validity”—the identification of the most representative features within the specific context of Iranian cyber defense.14\n\nThe concept of strategic culture will be applied as a theoretical avenue for the analysis. First appearing in the late 1970s,15 the idea has experienced several waves of scholarly attention since then.16 Johnson and Larsen define strategic culture as “[a] set of shared beliefs, assumptions, and modes of behavior, derived from common experiences and accepted narratives (both oral and written), that shape collective identity and relationships to other groups, and which determine appropriate ends and means for achieving security objectives.”17 A country's strategic culture is not randomly chosen or influenced by intellectual trends. It is shaped by the character and context of its society and becomes, in the views of Jeremy Black, a “cultural assumption” that fits the nation's strategic needs and influences its strategic behavior.18 Strategic culture, which is rooted in historical experiences, can evolve but cannot be easily discarded. It is a crucial factor in a country's strategic effectiveness, but it is not infinitely adaptable. Radical changes in culture only occur as a result of significant political, social, or military shocks. Strategic cultures borrow and adapt from one another, but this process has its limits.\n\nThe concept of strategic culture is highly suitable for the analysis of cybersecurity and cyberwarfare. For instance, the study prepared for the U.S. Cyber Command applied the notion of strategic culture as a theoretical foundation to build four case studies, one of them Iran.19 The author believes that the concept offers an additional advantage for this research, as it allows for deriving further insights and drawing implications from the primary and secondary sources as well as tracing the development of Iran's strategies to cybersecurity in general and cyber defense in particular during a specific period.20",
    "ROLE OF STRATEGIC CULTURE IN IRAN'S CYBER DEFENSE POLICY\n\n# IRANIAN STRATEGIC CULTURE\n\nStrategic culture faces the challenge of not having a clear collection of principles or a well-established theoretical framework. The common ground for strategic culture generally involves acknowledging culture as an epiphenomenal factor in the examination of foreign policy and security choices.[21] However, this can be complicated by the fact that strategic culture is not a one-size-fits-all concept. Every actor possesses its own operational code, history, assumptions, and strategic culture. To develop a more streamlined research model, it is necessary to narrow national culture variables to those that consistently impact the actor's policy and hold significant value for that specific culture. For this study, a four-variable model suggested by Jeannie Johnson will be adopted, offering valuable insights for the analysis of Iranian strategic culture. The four variables are:\n\n1. Identity: This refers to a nation's self-perception regarding its character, role in regional and global interactions, and beliefs about its ultimate destiny.\n2. Values: These are the material and nonmaterial goods a society holds in high regard, prioritizing them over other aspects.\n3. Norms: These are the accepted and anticipated modes of behavior within a society, encompassing the concepts of right versus wrong and good versus evil. Some norms stem from deeply ingrained beliefs held by most members of society, while others are the result of political socialization.\n4. Perceptive lens: A set of beliefs and experiences, whether true or misinformed, shapes a nation's perspective of the world. Factors such as historical interpretations, self-image, the views of others, leadership capabilities, national resources, and other security-related concepts all play a crucial role in shaping what each regime considers to be rational foreign policy.[22]\n\n# Identity\n\nIranian identity is a complex and multifaceted concept influenced by various factors, such as political values, historical experiences, religion, and geographical location. The Islamic Republic of Iran (IRI) has an identity that is defined by the elements of \"nationality\" and \"religion,\" with the weight and importance of these elements fluctuating over time.[23] The distinctive Persian identity has thrived despite many invasions, with the Iranians adopting some of the invaders' ways but adapting them to be more Persian than not.[24] This sense of identity and pride stems from the cultural continuity that has been maintained over time. At the same time, they also manifest themselves in a sense of superiority and exceptionalism over neighboring countries and peoples.[25] Iran's geography has played a crucial role in its history as a land that has been home to various nomads, invaders, and settlers from surrounding areas. Settled within confines between the Caspian Sea in the north and the Persian Gulf in the south, and enclosed by the\n\nAND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE VOLUME 38, NUMBER 2",
    "mountains of Zagros and Alborz, these groups were able to live in relative isolation for extended periods, leading to the emergence of numerous ethnic, religious, tribal, and other groupings that often found reasons to be in conflict with one another.26 According to Pollack, “Because of the discrete separation of so much of the population, Iran became a patchwork of ethnic, religious, tribal, and other groupings, all of whom seemed to find constant reasons for conflict with their neighbors.”27\n\nThe Islamic Revolution enhanced Iran's sense of exceptionalism and created a potent mixture of religious ideology and deep-seated nationalism.28 Willis Stanley underscores that:“[t]he current Iranian leadership appears to have recognizable goals derived from its unique political ideology, which makes use of Shia Islam's gradual consolidation of a clerical caste and historical Iran's concerns about sovereignty and acceptance of an absolute ruler. In this ideology, Iran and Shia Islam are viewed as the same, indivisible.29”\n\nThe pride in Iran's pre-Islamic history shared by the majority of Iranians is reframed within an Islamist context and integrated into the overarching narrative. The IRI's perception of its own unique centrality is informed by its awareness of the country's role as one of the region's historical powers, today challenged by the alluring influence of the West as an alternative to the righteous path of the Iranian model.\n\n### Values\n\nAnthony Cain quotes Vakili-Zad who notes that the ideology of the Islamic Revolution was shaped by:“those who carried the heavy burden of often bloody confrontations with government troops, [and] were, in general, religiously oriented and linked to traditional values from the rural past ... . [T]he blueprint for future society was the Islamic Republic modeled on the one created by the Prophet Muhammad more than 1,400 years earlier.30”\n\nSeven years before the revolution, Ali Shariati, a leading Iranian sociologist and revolutionary, in his first public lecture on Islamology, insisted that a reassembly of past cultural values would underpin an overturning of the existing order.31 Such a remodeling of values, with an ultimate goal of creating a just society, cannot be achieved without a perennial struggle against the forces of evil. Ayatollah Khomeini believed that the world is perpetually embroiled in a struggle between good and evil, where the forces of virtue must resist domination and fight against oppression and injustice.32 Most importantly, the threats posed by rival cultures that have different sets of",
    "values from which Iranian society must be cleansed. If these values were to reemerge, it would signify the failure of the revolution's primary objective.33 As a result, the IRI's efforts to maintain the ethos of resistance and jihad against presumed or real adversaries are rooted in the moral and spiritual values of the Islamic Revolution. They are essential mechanisms created to insulate Iranian society against subversive foreign cultural influences and project Iran's power to confront its adversaries abroad. In this context, the concept of moqavamat (resistance) plays an important role. Initially originated as a slogan in the Palestinian national movement in the 1960s, it evolved into a quasi-religious doctrine of armed struggle by Palestinian Hamas and Lebanese Hizballah in the 1980s. It was later adopted by Iran. Although the doctrine of resistance has foreign origins, it resonates deeply with those who embrace the Shi'ite martyrdom narrative of Imam Hussein, who chose resistance and martyrdom at Karbala over surrender to the unjust seventh-century Caliph Yazid.34 Iranian scholars Hossein Salimi and Amin Hejazi, while explicitly highlighting the defensive nature of Iranian jihad, mention resistance against oppression and defense of the oppressed, negation of Western dominance, independence, and self-sufficiency as core values of the IRI.35\n\nTo sum up, the values that emerged after the Islamic Revolution in Iran, shaped by its religiously oriented and traditionally minded founders, are deeply rooted in a Manichean and one-dimensional worldview that pits good against evil, with the West representing the forces of evil threatening Iranian society. These values serve to protect Iran from foreign cultural influences and uphold principles of resistance.\n\n### Norms\n\nPierre Pahlavi and Eric Ouellet observe that Iran has often seen itself as isolated and threatened by neighboring countries due to its unique status as the only Persian-speaking, Shia nation in a predominantly Turkish--Arabic, Sunni region. This perception is exacerbated by the country's size, which makes it significant on the global stage but vulnerable to external threats. To cope with these challenges, Iran has historically pursued two strategic goals: protecting “fortress Iran” by maintaining economic autonomy and territorial integrity and expanding its regional influence as a buffer. While these objectives may seem contradictory, they are complementary and can be achieved through both offensive and detente strategies, transcending internal ideological differences.36 Such an ambiguous environment requires a specific set of norms and a distinct strategic culture that would govern the country's modus operandi.\n\nIndeed, according to some experts, IRI's strategic culture, influenced by the norms derived from both Persian culture and Shia Islam, includes the use",
    "of strategic ambiguity and deception, avoidance of frontal attacks, and soft power. When the country's interests are at stake, the strict tenets of Islamic jurisprudence can be abrogated under the concept of maslaha, or acting in the public interest.37 In addition, Kayhan Barzegar and Abdolrasool Divsallar speak about strategic patience, use of low-cost engagements, and diminishing rivals' margin to maneuver as the instruments that the current Iranian regime has masterfully applied for decades. Strategic patience is a deliberate postponement of decisions on critical national security issues, allowing Iran to buy time and conserve resources. This approach is particularly useful in situations where strategic limits exist and available resources are insufficient to counter them. Iranians, who lived under constant insecurity, practiced strategic patience as a means of avoiding emotional, reactionary decisions in the face of harsh conditions. Low-cost engagements, such as hybrid warfare and the use of proxies, are other aspects of norms that influence IRI's strategic culture. In countries like Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen, Iran has created a network of foreign fighters, military advisers, and local regime irregulars under Iranian advisory commands. Additionally, Iran employs a defensive strategy aimed at reducing its rivals' margin to maneuver by blocking their actions and limiting their choices. Called, since 2005, “mosaic defense doctrine,” this strategy includes the concept of “all-around defense,” which brings together all state, nonstate, and private actors to confront threats, and “strategic depth,” which involves creating security buffer zones to reduce the risk of direct attacks on Iranian territory. Anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) capabilities, which encompass military, informational, economic, and political measures, are used by Iran to disrupt adversaries' interests and reduce their choices, thereby raising the cost of any potential hostilities.38 Central to “mosaic doctrine” is the mobilization of a vast and dispersed militia force designed to engage invading forces in protracted, attritional warfare, thereby exhausting their resources and resolve.39\n\n### Perceptive Lens\n\nThe title of Graham Fuller's 1991 RAND Corporation study, The Center of the Universe, mirrors the perspective of the IRI's elites, who believe that Iran holds a natural, indispensable, and leading role in the Middle East and potentially the entire Muslim world.40 Such an inflated view of centrality and historic role of Iran is underlined by a deep-seated Iranian identity and a broadly shared historical awareness of Iran's power status in the region. Consequently, the occurrences that contradict these self-centered views may cause cognitive dissonance among Iranians. During his captivity as a hostage in the U.S. embassy in Tehran, following its takeover by Iranian “students” in November 1979, William Daugherty, then the Central Intelligence Agency",
    "(CIA) Chief of Station, noted that his captors struggled to comprehend and were personally offended by his inability to communicate in Persian, the language of what they considered such an important country as Iran.41 Experiences of victimization, insecurity, and feelings of inferiority have contributed to shaping Iran's sense of pride and significance. Initially, Iran was a nation of conquerors, but over time, it was invaded, conquered, and humbled by various powers, such as the Greeks, Arabs, Mongols, and Turks. The most recent manifestation of this victimization complex is linked to the British and Russian quasi-colonial domination of Iran from the nineteenth to the mid-twentieth centuries and the perceived American influence over Iran after World War II.42\n\nThe centuries of foreign domination had caused an acute sensitivity among Iranians about the role of foreigners in their culture and politics. Iranians believe, as Marvin Zonis emphasizes, that “[t]he rest of the world is somehow so taken with Iran's significance that it cannot let it go.”43 A siege mentality is fortified by real or presumed threats posed by both nearby and distant enemies. As a result, a pervasive culture of conspiracy thinking has emerged within Iranian society, with many viewing external forces as manipulating or undermining their nation's interests. This phenomenon bears a notable resemblance to the dynamics often attributed to the so-called Arab street. According to Fuller, “Rarely are events to be taken at face value, for to assume them as such is (a) to indicate ignorance of the superior forces around oneself or one's nation and (b) to demonstrate the stupidity, naivete, or insensitivity not to perceive the hidden motives of others.”44 Based on this logic, unanticipated events are not merely isolated incidents but rather the result of powerful external forces that dominate or control the situation. The most complex explanation of political events is usually preferred as the most likely, particularly when foreign powers are involved. While specific interpretations may differ based on individual ideological outlooks, the consensus is that it is naive to assume that a series of developments might be unrelated, particularly when a powerful foreign entity is involved.45\n\nOther cultural characteristics that have their roots in the prolonged periods of insecurity and foreign rule are a general wariness toward those outside one's intimate circle, particularly authority figures and foreigners, as well as a tendency toward cunning or astuteness. As life is perceived as an unpredictable game of chance, where both favorable and unfavorable opportunities arise and vanish without warning, people outside the inner cycle are considered as inherently malevolent, power-hungry, and irrational. There is a lack of trust in interpersonal relationships and altruistic motives are often looked at with suspicion.46 The mistrust leads to the necessity for manipulation in the struggle for survival, “empty and meaningless adulation,” and consequently, an expectation that others will also attempt to manipulate.47 Consequently, the",
    "figure of the clever dissimulator, or zeræng, emerges. As described by William Beeman, zeræng is “[a]n operation on the part of an adroit operator that involves thwarting direct interpretation of his own actions or deliberately leading others to erroneous interpretation of those actions while being able to successfully interpret the actions of others.”48 Albeit being an inherently negative trait, it is, nevertheless, highly admired by Iranians as they see cleverness and wiliness as essential strategies for navigating and overcoming stronger forces.49 However, the reliance on zeræng, combined with the ingrained insecurity and anxiety about being deceived by strangers, can sometimes result in Iranian actors overplaying their hand in diplomacy, business dealings, and military activities.\n\nIn conclusion, the analysis of Iranian strategic culture based on four variables—identity, values, norms, and perceptive lens—demonstrates that Iran's identity is a fusion of nationality and religion, with a strong sense of exceptionalism and historical continuity. The values that emerged after the Islamic Revolution are deeply rooted in a Manichean worldview, pitting good against evil, with the West representing the forces of evil. The perceptive lens of Iran's elites is inflated, believing that Iran's indispensable and leading role in the Middle East and potentially the entire Muslim world would somehow compensate for technological deficiencies.\n\n## Building the Digital Wall: Iran's Cybersecurity Architecture\n\n### The Cyber Posture of Small States\n\nCyberspace is a complex and multifaceted concept, encompassing various subconcepts and nuanced definitions. Rain Ottis and Peeter Lorents describe cyberspace as “a time-dependent set of interconnected information systems and the human users that interact with these systems,” stressing a dynamic nature of cyberspace, where significant changes can occur rapidly, in a shorter time frame than other time-dependent systems.50\n\nCyberspace is widely considered offense-dominant, inferring that it is easier to execute attacks than to defend against them. Offensive dominance in cyberspace is due to varied and rapidly evolving attack vectors, which defenders struggle to keep up with. Such an asymmetry is in favor of an attacker, as offensive cyber capabilities are perceived to be resource-efficient compared to defensive measures, which are costly and often lag behind technological advancements.51 In parallel, traditional deterrence models face challenges in cyberspace due to difficulties in attribution and the covert nature of cyber capabilities. The anonymity and rapid execution of cyberattacks undermine the effectiveness of deterrence, which relies on the threat of assured retaliation. A key challenge in implementing cyber deterrence is the need for a strong system of protection as the first step, but",
    "many countries prioritize offensive operations over defense, neglecting defense and resilience, instead focusing on offensive methods to deter adversaries.52 The system-wide framework analysis that focuses on the broadest dynamics and the systemic cyber risks inherent to the internet may be worth considering. It addresses both top-down factors, such as insecure technical standards, and bottom-up, emergent effects, like the spread of insecure Internet of Things (IoT) devices. This framework encompasses the full spectrum of attacks, including nation-state disruptions, espionage, cybercrime, and even hacking driven by curiosity or entertainment. Within this context, the tools, methods, and activities of offensive and defensive operations are relatively distinct.53\n\nHowever, the true destructive potential of cyber operations remains uncertain and a subject of ongoing speculation and debate within the cybersecurity community. As Torbjørn Pedersen notes,54 the initial anticipation of a “modern Pearl Harbor” or upcoming global cyberwars has given way to a more nuanced understanding of the limitations of cyber operations expressed in the article by Thomas Rid, “Cyber War Will Not Take Place.”55 According to Lennart Maschmeyer, cyber operations face an operational trilemma, where the three variables of speed, intensity of effect, and control are negatively correlated. This means that, in most cases, cyber operations will be either too slow, too low in intensity, or too unreliable to provide significant strategic utility.56 Overall, however, both opponents and proponents of cyberwar agree that cyberspace offers new methods of undermining national power by achieving strategic impact through ongoing campaigns of covert, less violent cyber operations with cumulative effects.57\n\nThe cyber capabilities of small states, defined by limited resources and smaller populations, are primarily focused on defensive measures. This is due to constraints in funding, a lack of specialized expertise and intelligence resources, and the high costs involved in developing advanced offensive tools. The notion that cyber capabilities provide an asymmetric advantage to weaker states is contested, as evidence suggests that powerful states with advanced resources are better positioned to exploit cyber operations.58 Jon Lindsay cites the Stuxnet operation of 2009--2010 as a prime example, when a malicious code penetrated the Iranian nuclear facility in Natanz, wiping out around 1,000 centrifuges. Although specific details about the Stuxnet operation's time frame and effects still remain obscure, Lindsay argues that this incident demonstrates that cyber capabilities do not automatically grant an advantage to weaker states. He emphasizes that small states encounter significant challenges in weaponizing cyber capabilities to inflict substantial damage.59 All these challenge the notion of asymmetric advantage of weaker adversaries in the cyberdomain proposed by some, suggesting instead that cyber capabilities tend to favor powerful states.60",
    "Small states often adopt a technology-oriented strategic culture and focus on enhancing their defensive measures to protect their critical infrastructure and maintain national security. The effectiveness of cyber strategies varies among states, with some successfully integrating them into their national security frameworks, while others struggle to recognize the opportunities and threats associated with increased cyber engagement. However, small states often adopt several common strategies to compensate for their limited resources and cyber capabilities. These strategies may include:61 Cyber hygiene programs: Investing in national cyber hygiene programs to educate citizens and businesses about basic cybersecurity practices. This involves developing cybersecurity curricula in educational institutions, conducting regular training programs for government and private sector employees, and fostering a culture of cyber awareness. In Iran's case, this approach took the form of creating a “halal net,” a locally controlled version of the internet designed to limit public access to information. Incident response teams: Establishing national Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) or Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) to handle and coordinate responses to cyber incidents. Legislation and policy frameworks: Setting up robust legislative and policy frameworks. These frameworks set out the roles and responsibilities of various stakeholders and establish protocols for incident response and information sharing. Investment in technology: Despite resource limitations, small states are increasingly investing in advanced cyber defense technologies, such as intrusion detection systems, encryption, and secure communication platforms to protect critical infrastructure. Public--private partnerships often play a key role in supporting national cybersecurity strategies, provided there is a skilled workforce and organizational infrastructure to effectively utilize these technologies. Additionally, the absence of economic and technological sanctions mechanisms is crucial, as it allows these states to acquire the necessary technologies without significant barriers.Cyber defense alliances, collaboration, and information sharing with other states, international organizations, and private sector partners to enhance cyber defense capabilities.\n\nPutting the cyber capabilities of small states in the context of strategic culture, Francis Domingo introduced the concept of “technology-oriented” strategic culture, which refers to small states' inclination to rely on technology as a strategy to overcome limited resources, military capabilities, and strategic depth.62 In this context, technology serves as an enabler for states to pursue foreign policy objectives in a more deliberate and strategic manner. A technology-oriented strategic culture can be identified by examining three key implications for small states: High network readiness: Small states with a technology-oriented strategic culture prioritize the development and maintenance of advanced communication",
    "networks, data systems, and digital infrastructure to enhance their overall connectivity and readiness. Technology-driven military force: These states invest in technology-driven military capabilities, such as advanced weapon systems, unmanned aerial vehicles, and cyberwarfare tools, to augment their military power and strategic reach. Relevance of cybersecurity: Cybersecurity becomes a critical concern for small states with a technology-oriented strategic culture, as they recognize the potential risks and vulnerabilities associated with their reliance on technology. As a result, they prioritize the protection of their digital infrastructure and critical data to ensure their national security and maintain their strategic advantages.63\n\nIran offers an intriguing case study, as its strategic culture, characterized by its identity, values, norms, and perceptual lens, aligns closely with the defensive cybersecurity posture of many small states. The emphasis on resistance, strategic patience, ambiguity, and low-cost engagements constitutes Iran's approach to cyberspace, reflecting broader trends seen in the cyber strategies of small states. However, over the past decade, Iran has significantly stepped up its offensive cyber capabilities, elevating itself, according to some estimates, to the top of the second tier of global cyberpowers, with aspirations to join the leaders.64\n\n### Iranian Cyber Capabilities\n\nIran's initial steps to build its defensive cyber capabilities can be traced back to 2003, when units specializing in cybersecurity were set up within several ministries.65 A 2010 wake-up call occurred with the Stuxnet operation, followed by the “Wiper” and “Flame” malicious code attacks, solidifying the regime's understanding that Iran's adversaries possess a distinct qualitative advantage in offensive cyber activities. By 2016, Iran's cyber capabilities budget was reportedly over USD 1 billion (vs. USD 76 million in 2011), compared to the USD 2 billion budget of the United Kingdom, one of the world's leading cyberpowers. According to Iranian data, the country's cyber budget experienced a twelvefold increase between 2013 and 2021. By the late 2010s, approximately 18% of Iranian university students were studying computer science. Additionally, compulsory military service was utilized to direct technologically skilled graduates toward the state security apparatus, including the MOIS and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC),66 while the topic of cyber defense entered the high school textbook Preparation for Defense.67\n\nIn March 2012, the Supreme Council of Cyberspace, under the direction of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, was established. The Council is headed by the Iranian President and includes 25 senior government representatives and other key figures, such as the senior commander of the",
    "IRGC; the head of the Majlis; the Ministers of Science, Communications and Culture; the chief of police; and the president of the Islamic Propaganda Organization. The Council has the power to establish national cyber policy, and its decisions are mandatory for all Iranian institutions operating in the field.68 The National Center for Cyberspace, which is the main division of the Council, is responsible for comprehensive domestic and international surveillance, enforcing the enactments of the council, and preventing Iranians from accessing virtual private networks (VPNs) and internet proxies, which are used to bypass Iran's internet controls.69\n\nVarious organizations monitor and protect Iran's cyberspace infrastructure. All of them are affiliated with different government institutions and operate in different fields. A key defensive organization within this structure is the Cyberspace Defense Command, which functions under the Passive Defense Organization of the general staff of the armed forces. This organization is made up of both military personnel and representatives from the Communications, Defense, Intelligence, and Industry ministries. Its primary goal is to establish a comprehensive defensive strategy for safeguarding state institutions and infrastructures from potential cyber threats. The Cyberspace Defense Command is primarily focused on defense and does not appear to be engaged in offensive cyber activities. Another defensive entity within Iran's cyberspace structure is the Center for Information Security, also known as MAHER. This center is established and operated under the Communications and Information Technologies Ministry and is primarily responsible for activating computer security incident response teams during emergencies and cyberattacks. Furthermore, MAHER trains skilled manpower, develops response mechanisms for cyber crises, and stores and disseminates data security know-how. The center is responsible for defending all government websites, as well as those of private companies that are officially registered with the Communications Ministry.70 The Committee for Identifying Unauthorized Sites and FATA (an acronym for the Police for the Sphere of the Production and Exchange of Information) act as Iran's cyber police, overseeing internet usage for both domestic suppression and countering cybercrime.71 The IRGC runs its cyber operations, both defensive and offensive, through the IRGC Cyber-Electronic Command (IRGC-CEC), which is headquartered at the Ammar Cyberspace Base.72\n\nRegarding Iran's offensive cyber capabilities, the IRGC and MOIS are responsible for conducting both independent and joint offensive operations against perceived and real threats to Iranian national security. Among these two entities, the IRGC undoubtedly takes the lead. Its Electronic Warfare and Cyber Defense Organization offers training courses in cyber defense, restricts access to online content, and censors digital communications in Iranian cyberspace73 and “bears primary responsibility for offensive cyber",
    "operations.”74 By 2009, the IRGC started enlisting professionals for its internal cyberforce, as well as the closely associated military unit known as the Iranian Cyber Army (ICA). That same year, the Basij Cyber Council, another cyber entity overseen by the IRGC, revealed that it had trained 1,500 cybersecurity specialists. These professionals were prepared to join the IRGC's expanding offensive operations and espionage division. In 2010, the Basij cyber unit's leaders publicly declared their intention to launch digital attacks targeted at the actions of the “Zionist Entity,” Israel.75 The IRGC trains, equips, and provides operational support in the cyberdomain to Iranian proxies such as Hezbollah. For instance, in 2021, the IRGC helped establish a cybersecurity unit within Hezbollah's counterintelligence service. In parallel, a cybertraining facility disguised as a branch of Tehran's Sharif University was opened in Dahiye, in the southern suburbs of Beirut.76\n\nIran's cyberspace development is mainly driven by universities and technological institutes, with a focus on information technology (IT), computer engineering, and communications. Key institutions include Amirkabir University of Technology, Imam Hossein University, Shahid Beheshti University, and Sharif University of Technology. The Iranian government supports IT and computer communications companies through direct and indirect investments, with key government bodies being the Science Ministry, the Information and Communications Ministry, the Technology Cooperation Office, and hi-tech greenhouses like the Pardis Technology Park and Guilan Science and Technology Park.77 Furthermore, the universities play a crucial role in subcontracting cyber operations to front companies and individuals. Over the years, a tiered approach to cyber operations has developed within the Iranian intelligence landscape. At its core is a trusted network of middle managers—often university employees—who are ideologically aligned with the Iranian government and who translate intelligence priorities into segmented cyber tasks. These tasks are then bid out to multiple contractors, where about 50 organizations compete for regime-sponsored projects. The authorities compartmentalize tasks, often requiring different contractors for various parts of a project, such as creating exploits and establishing unauthorized access. Payments are only made upon the completion of the task, as competition is fierce and contractors are pitted against each other. Characteristic in this context is the case of Monica Witt—a former U.S. Air Force intelligence specialist who served in the Air Force from 1997 through 2008 and then with a defense contractor until 2010. Defecting to Iran in 2013, Witt leaked top-secret information to the Iranians, including the identities of U.S. intelligence agents and highly classified intelligence collection programs.78 In 2015, four Iranian hackers, coopted by the IRCG, targeted U.S. intelligence and military personnel in an unsophisticated and poorly executed cyber operation that ultimately failed.79",
    "Although Iran boasts a large network of IT professionals, the Islamic regime's inherent paranoia creates unique challenges. Those with the greatest offensive cyber skills and those demonstrating adherence to the government's ideology are usually mutually exclusive.80 Furthermore, the country is facing a significant brain drain, as many cybersecurity experts are leaving Iran at an alarming pace.\n\nCooperation with foreign actors, particularly China, North Korea, and Russia, has significantly contributed to Iran's cyber capabilities. In 2015, Russia and Iran signed the first cyber cooperation agreement, recognizing common threats in the cyberdomain. In 2017, a memorandum of understanding for cooperation on information and communication technology (ICT)--related issues, including “internet governance, network security,” and “international internet connection” was signed. In 2021, Russia and Iran concluded the agreement on information security aimed to coordinate activities in response to the growing importance of cyber issues in international relations and ICT-related crimes, as well as the creation of an Iranian “sovereign internet.”81 Since the beginning of the Ukraine conflict in 2022, Russia has supplied Iran with communication-surveillance capabilities, eavesdropping devices, advanced photography equipment, and lie detectors, and reportedly also shared more advanced software with Iran, enabling it to hack phones and systems of dissidents and adversaries. Protei Ltd. a Russian company specializing in communication monitoring tools, has started providing internet censorship software to the Iranian mobile services provider Ariantel. The Protei tools are believed to be part of a developing mobile phone system that would allow Iranian state authorities to directly monitor, intercept, redirect, degrade, or deny mobile communications.82 In 2021, Iranian cybersecurity company Lotus Gostar Arya (or Cysec) opened a branch in Kazan to foster cooperation and exchange of know-how between Iran and Russia.83\n\nOn 17 January 2025, Russia and Iran further solidified their partnership by signing the “Treaty on Comprehensive Strategic Partnership.” Article 4 of the treaty explicitly stipulates that the intelligence and security services of both nations “shall exchange information and experience and enhance the level of their cooperation.” This agreement is expected to further deepen collaboration in the cyber domain.84\n\nIn December 2010, the Chinese telecommunications firm ZTE Corp. sold a surveillance system to Iran's Telecommunication Co. of Iran (TCI) as part of a USD 130.6 million networking equipment contract. The surveillance system can monitor landline, mobile, and internet communications. TCI, which had at that time a near monopoly on Iran's landline telephone services, managed a significant portion of Iran's internet traffic.85 In 2019, China and Iran agreed to establish a joint workgroup to tackle cyber threats, emphasizing cooperation in IT, addressing cyber threats, and “counter[ing] U.S.",
    "unilateralism.”86 In 2009, a significant intelligence failure committed by the CIA occurred when a faulty web-based covert communications system used by the CIA in Iran was exposed, resulting in the arrest and execution of numerous CIA informants. The Iran events coincided with a similar setback in China in 2011 and 2012, where around 30 agents were apprehended and executed. Some officials suspected that the two nations might have collaborated, with Iran offering China technical information about the exposed communications system in exchange for equipment and expertise.87\n\nIn September 2012, Iran and North Korea signed a technology cooperation agreement, which allegedly included the cyberdomain.88 Iran potentially could have provided information on Stuxnet to North Korea, which ultimately prevented the Stuxnet-similar attack on the North Korean nuclear facility. A tightly controlled network and the inability of physical penetration of the facility to install the worm into the command systems might have also contributed to the failure.89\n\nTo conclude, Iran shares some defensive strategies with small states, such as resource constraints and the high costs associated with developing sophisticated offensive tools. Iran's investment in education and the development of technological expertise is consistent with the technology-oriented strategic culture described by Domingo. In a similar vein, the country's emphasis on training and harnessing its human capital shows how smaller states leverage technology to compensate for limited resources. The programs focusing on cyber hygiene, incident response teams, and legislative frameworks also mirror the defensive strategies typically adopted by small states.\n\nHowever, unlike many small states that focus primarily on defense, Iran has developed substantial offensive cyber capabilities. Organizations like the IRGC-CEC and ICA actively engage in offensive operations, targeting both regional adversaries and global entities. This level of offensive capability is more characteristic of larger, more powerful states. The integration of foreign expertise and technology, such as surveillance systems and cybersecurity tools, underscores Iran's ability to leverage international partnerships to bolster its cyber posture. The extent and sophistication of Iran's offensive operations, including cyberespionage and attacks, distinguish it from the typical small-state cyber posture, which often lacks the resources to develop such capabilities. Iran's cyber budget and institutional support structures, including the Supreme Cyberspace Council, are substantial compared to those of typical small states. The scale of investment and the comprehensive nature of its cyber governance framework indicate a level of state commitment that exceeds what is usually seen in smaller states with limited resources.\n\nSuch a combination of defensive focus, substantial offensive capacity, extensive foreign partnerships, and significant state investment makes Iran a unique player in the cyber landscape of small states.",
    "LEAKED INSIGHTS: IRAN'S CYBERDFENSE LANDSCAPE AND STRATEGIC CULTURE\n\nOver the last decade, Iran has been actively building a multifaceted cyber defense system to safeguard its critical infrastructure, suppress opposition groups, and block perceived harmful content, all aimed at maintaining the regime's stability. Guided by the Supreme Council of Cyberspace, Iran's numerous governmental agencies have been at the forefront of the implementation of this strategy. Despite such a concerted effort, the Iranian state organizations, including the MOIS, have been regularly experiencing high-impact leaks. For instance, since 2017 and into 2019, self-declared Iranian dissident groups—such as Lab Dookhtegan, Green Leakers, Black Box, and Hidden Reality—have emerged as “mystery groups” with unclear origins and affiliations.90 Over time, these groups have built reputations as reliable sources of information, exposing Iranian intelligence and military operations both within Iran and across the Middle East.91\n\nThe agencies tasked with cyber defense, although numerous and mature, are, as it seems, still lacking capabilities and know-how to fully prevent high-impact breaches. The researchers inside Iran have pointed out a number of weak points in the Iranian cyber defense. Hassan Monfared, writing about the cyberwarfare of the Iranian armed forces, finds that they lack a comprehensive view of cyber defense and highlights the need for a systematic approach to stabilize and improve cyber combat readiness across the army ranks.92 Shafiee et al. from Passive Defense Organization see the need to improve management of public opinion through cyberspace and identify several psychological operations techniques aimed at improving the image of the army and countering adversaries' psychological operations.93 Similarly, Mohammad Tabatabaei and Ehsan Movahedian in their study of the U.S cyber influence operations against Iran's internet users stress a gap in Iran's ability to counter foreign cyber influence effectively.94 Abolfazl and Mahdi Rohani stress cyberspace's dual nature as both a threat and opportunity and propose a catalog of measures to effectively managing and mitigating cyber threats. Interestingly enough, the measures proposed by the researchers are strikingly similar to those revealed in the leaked documents discussed below. They include strengthening the Supreme Council of Cyberspace and the National Cyber Space Center's role as the country's cyber focal point; enhancing capabilities of organizations such as the ICA; developing a local internet industry and broadband ecosystem; strengthening local entrepreneurs active in cyberdomain; and more active utilization of cyberspace for conflict, war, competition, and information operations against adversaries.95 Very insightful in this context is the confidential letter produced by Ali Asghar Qaimi, the advisor in the field of communication and IT, security, and cyber defense, to the speaker of the Iranian parliament,",
    "Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf.96 In it, Qaimi lists sixteen “challenges” faced by the Iranian cyber defense as of January 2024. Among them are: big differences in the quality of online infrastructure in various government bodies; existence of uncovered vulnerabilities and planted backdoors; lack of proper monitoring and action plans to locate and fix vulnerabilities; widespread attempts to cover up problems, incidents, and cyberattacks; lack of organizational discipline within the agencies responsible for vital and sensitive infrastructure; shortage of skilled personnel in the fields of security and cyber defense; utilization of unsuitable external cyber defense products in the vital infrastructure; the multiplicity of decisionmaking authorities and their interference, leading to the adoption of often contradictory decisions; brain drain of cybersecurity experts; and the long and exhausting process of obtaining security licenses and qualifications for individuals and private security companies.97 Qaimi concludes that, because many organizations in Iran fail to meet minimum security requirements, one should expect further cyberattacks, disclosure of information, and disruption of services in the future.98 To sum up, the challenges faced by Iran's cyber defense system, as outlined by Iranian researchers, highlight significant gaps in infrastructure, personnel, and overall preparedness, painting a troubling picture of the country's vulnerability to cyber threats. These weaknesses are also mirrored in a letter by Qaimi that lists several critical deficiencies, providing a realistic view on the current situation with cyber defense.\n\nThe analysis of the leaked documents begins with the four-year plan, classified as “secret,” laid down on 23 July 2021, by new Minister of Intelligence Hojjat al-Islam Seyyed Ismail Khatib. Although the document tackles the challenges and priorities related to cybersecurity, it does not explicitly describe the current state of cybersecurity in the country. Nevertheless, it highlights the significance of modernizing intelligence infrastructure to address cyber threats effectively, including monitoring, prevention, and capacity building in cyber.99 It also emphasizes the importance of protecting critical infrastructure, combating cyberespionage, and enhancing cooperation with international partners in cybersecurity efforts. The document refers to “the concrete operational plans” that need to be put in place based on the resolutions by the Supreme Council of Cyberspace.100\n\nIn addition to the four-year plan that due to its programmatic nature tackles the topic of cyber without sufficient depth, six other documents, all of which explicitly focus on various aspects of cybersecurity, will be analyzed using a framework of seven interconnected themes. These themes, which have been consistently addressed in all documents, provide a comprehensive understanding of Iran's approach to cybersecurity:Governance and regulatory framework,National Information Network,",
    ".International engagement and cyber diplomacy,Control over information flows and protection of Islamic-Iranian identity,Economic and technological integration within the cyberdomain,Human resources and workforce development, andCybersecurity infrastructure and cyber protective mechanisms.\n\n### Governance and Regulatory Framework\n\nThe importance of the Supreme Council of Cyberspace as the main body responsible for Iran's cyberdomain has been stressed in all documents. The decisions of the Council must be considered binding and be implemented by all organizations, including the office of the prosecutor and the courts.101 The Council also plays a crucial role in determining the budgetary spending on cybersecurity and monitoring measures to protect Iran's critical infrastructure.102 It is interesting to note in this context that the performance of the National Center for Cyberspace, which is controlled by the Council, is regularly assessed based on the principles of good governance (salamat-e edari).103\n\n### National Information Network\n\nEstablishing a “reliable, safe, stable, integrated, and extensive infrastructure throughout the country based on the National Information Network”104 that would enable the regime to “[r]educe as much as possible access to unauthorized foreign platforms”105 is seen as one of the most important priorities monitored by the Council. The Ministry of Communications and Information Technology was entrusted with the responsibility of connecting at least 80% of the country's households and businesses to the National Information Network by the end of 2023.106 In the foreseeable future, Iran's satellite infrastructure and the National Information Network should be integrated, further solidifying the country's digital autonomy and enhancing its cybersecurity capabilities.107\n\n### International Engagement and Cyber Diplomacy\n\nIn the international arena, Iran pursues two goals in the cyberdomain: first, to expand cooperation with allied and friendly nations, especially Islamic countries,108 as well as to “[a]chieve an active, strong, and purposeful presence in regional and international assemblies and institutions.”109 Second, Iran seeks to strengthen its position as a formidable cyberpower, leveraging international bodies as deterrent mechanisms in its cyberspace.110 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs plays a major role in setting up a “cyber space diplomacy system,” as well as assisting other state agencies in dealing with international organizations.111\n\n###",
    "Control over Information Flows and Protection of Islamic--Iranian Identity\n\nProtecting the Islamic--Iranian identity and lifestyle is a crucial aspect of cyber defense in Iran. Consequently, the country regulates social media presence in accordance with its laws and values. The Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance plays a significant role in this regard, responsible for registering official accounts, closing fake accounts, and blocking unauthorized advertisements of foreign social networks.112 As a countermeasure to potential threats in the digital space, content providers in Iran are required to promote the “discourse of the Islamic Revolution” and contribute to the creation of a “new Islamic civilization in cyberspace.”113 Government employees are forbidden from being present on “unauthorized social media platforms” without permission and required to follow guidelines and regulations if they are present on “approved” platforms.114\n\n### Economic and Technological Integration within the Cyberdomain\n\nIn the field of economic and technological integration within the cyberdomain, Iran pursues a twofold strategy—increasing the share of domestic products and services in cybersecurity, and supporting local providers. Thus, the need to double the local content of products and services has been emphasized time and again in different strategic documents.115 In parallel, the share of the digital segment in the Iranian economy is planned to reach 10% by 2031,116 while some suggest that the same share should be set at 20% of the Gross Domestic Product.117 Support of the local providers of products and services is considered vital. Several authors recommend that authorities make “[m]aximum usage of private cyber security contractors”118 and “support companies, particularly in the fields of security systems, locally-built browsers, and national messengers.”119\n\n### Human Resources and Workforce Development\n\nIn addition, it is considered crucial to address the need to establish criteria for recruiting, retaining, and protecting experts in the cybersecurity domain, as such plans require careful design and implementation.120 The salaries of cybersecurity specialists should be increased and the issue of brain drain requires urgent attention.121 Furthermore, the cybersecurity literacy among government employees needs to be addressed through internal training and specialized courses.122 The number of student admissions in cybersecurity-related fields also needs to be expanded.123 The goal is to create a reservoir of skilled and efficient cybersecurity experts, thereby gaining a strategic advantage for Iran in this area.124",
    "Cybersecurity Infrastructure and Cyber Protective Mechanisms\n\nIran's cyber defense strategy has, over the decade, evolved as a multifaceted approach that includes regular assessments, clear role assignments, and a catalogue of proactive measures. The establishment and continuous development of cybersecurity measures within all state institutions are considered critical in safeguarding national security. The institutions are obliged to create and implement comprehensive cyberspace security plans to prevent, combat, and manage cyber incidents,125 including cyber drills.126 Additionally, regular evaluations and situational reports mandated to assess the fulfillment of cybersecurity tasks must be submitted to the Supreme Council of Cyberspace.127 Nongovernmental institutions are also urged to organize and enhance their cybersecurity capabilities.128\n\nAccording to the top-secret document of April 2023, the task of guarding Iran's cyber borders was at that time the responsibility of the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology. However, the document complains that this mission is not logically aligned with the Ministry's posture in protecting Iran's communication and information infrastructure. As a result, the role of the armed forces and the country's intelligence agencies in this area has been overlooked. Hence, it was necessary to reevaluate the legal framework for cyber border protection and consider assigning this important task to an organization that is better equipped to handle it. In addition, a plethora of organizations responsible for cyber defense, including the Passive Defense Organization, the Center for Information Security, and the cyber police (FATA), have overlapping responsibilities. This requires a clear definition of their roles and duties, particularly in their relations to the armed forces, the IRGC, and the Ministry of Intelligence.129 Furthermore, the general staff of the armed forces was “[t]asked to prepare a national program to prevent and address defense-security threats posed by unauthorized satellite systems for Iranian cyber space.”130\n\nThe insights gained from the documents examined in this section underline the key premises of strategic culture defined earlier. The overall structure of Iran's cyber governance is heavily centralized, reflecting Iran's historical preference for a strong, centralized leadership, which is seen as necessary to maintain order and control in a complex and multifaceted society. The country's commitment to reducing foreign dependence and fostering a self-reliant digital economy aligns with the drive toward self-sufficiency and autonomy as seen through historical experience of invasions and influence from foreign powers. In the eternal struggle between virtue and evil, a dwindling human capital in the cyberdomain needs to be exploited and protected to advance the country's strategic interests, as the entire society should remain resilient, in line with the values of vigilance and resistance against external threats. Internationally, Iran considers itself a leader of the",
    "Islamic world that stays firm in the face of Western influence. By leveraging international bodies as deterrent mechanisms, the regime attempts to project power and protect its interests in cyberspace. Iran's dual strategy of enhancing domestic cybersecurity capabilities while also striving for technological independence and integration into the global cyberdomain mirrors its cultural emphasis on adaptability to secure the country's position in a complex and competitive international environment. The role of cultural and media institutions in cyberspace is critical for the regime, as their task is to promote the dual elements of Iranian identity—nationality and religion. Such an emphasis on aligning cyber content with Islamic principles demonstrates the intertwining of religious ideology with national identity, as it reinforces the regime's narrative and counters foreign cultural influence.\n\nFinally, while concrete data are lacking, it is reasonable to infer that the multidecade economic and technological sanctions imposed on Iran have significantly affected its cyber defense capabilities, influencing both its strategy and the evolution of its cyber infrastructure. These sanctions have severely limited Iran's ability to acquire advanced cyber defense technologies, as restrictions on access to key software, hardware, and encryption technologies hinder the country's efforts to build a sophisticated cybersecurity infrastructure. A comprehensive analysis examining the impact of sanctions on Iran's cyber defense capabilities would be a fascinating subject for further study, shedding light on the consequences of such restrictions and their potential long-term effects on a nation's ability to protect itself in the cyber realm.\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\nA strategic culture that shaped Iranian perceptions, values, and norms has its roots in Persian culture and Shia Islam. Iran's historical experiences of conquest and foreign domination have led to a siege mentality, conspiracy thinking, and the admiration of cunning and manipulation. Besides, a unique blend of historical experiences and geostrategic positions have shaped Iran's sense of identity and its perception of exceptionalism and superiority. Some Iranian authors even advance the notion of “geopolitical superiority,” arguing that Iran's strategic positioning and its “geographical gravity” can somehow compensate for its technological deficiencies—a belief that underestimates the role of and need for technological advancement in the face of modern threats and evolving security dynamics.131\n\nConsequently, these specific operational codes, histories, and assumptions of strategic culture have a significant influence on the country's cyber defense posture, characterized by heightened sensitivity to cyberattacks by hostile actors. The Stuxnet attack was probably a pivotal moment that revealed Iran's vulnerabilities to advanced cyber threats from hostile actors and solidified the Manichean worldview of ruling elites about perceived external",
    "threats, especially those emanating from the West. Over the last decade, Iran adopted a multifaceted approach to safeguarding infrastructure, suppressing opposition, and countering foreign influence. Iran has achieved a unique position in the cyber landscape that is characterized by a mix of defensive focus, offensive capabilities, partnerships with allied states, and significant state investment. The country's comprehensive cyber strategy and governance framework position it as a formidable player, blending characteristics of both small and larger states.\n\nOver the last few years, Iranian-affiliated cyber threat actors have demonstrated the ability to execute sustained, complex, and disruptive operations across multiple sectors outside of Iran. These groups frequently utilize advanced tactics, techniques, and procedures, continuously refining their strategies to avoid detection and maintain access to compromised networks. The coordination among these actors and their shared use of resources and tools demonstrate a unified effort to support Iran's geopolitical aims. Their ongoing use of destructive malware, ransomware, and espionage operations underscores the threat they pose, particularly in the context of regional tensions and global political events. Thus, Iran was one of the most assertive foreign actors attempting to create discord ahead of the 2024 U.S. presidential elections. Iranian operatives have launched influence operations targeting U.S. audiences, potentially aiming to sway the outcome of the elections. This cyber-enabled influence campaign is being driven by a mix of actors conducting preliminary cyber reconnaissance and inserting online personas and websites into the information ecosystem. In June 2024, hackers linked to the IRGC successfully infiltrated the Trump campaign, stealing internal documents and leaking them to media outlets.132\n\nIn the cyber defensive domain, the leaked documents mostly confirm the conclusions derived from the sources available in the public domain. The materials show that Iran has developed a multifaceted cyber defense system aimed at protecting its critical infrastructure, controlling information, and maintaining regime stability. The Supreme Council of Cyberspace oversees this strategy, coordinating efforts across various governmental agencies. Highly centralized cyber governance aims at strengthening the country's self-reliance and reducing foreign dependence, aligning with Iran's strategic culture of resistance to external influences. Internationally, Iran's posture is marked by adaptability and resilience to secure its position in the global cyberdomain. However, despite the extensive cyber defense measures, Iran still faces significant challenges, such as weaknesses in comprehensive defense strategies, management of public opinion, and countering foreign influence operations. Numerous high-impact leaks experienced by Iranian state organizations revealed persistent issues with infrastructure quality, cyber threat monitoring, and organizational discipline.",

    "abstract": "Iranian identity is influenced by politics, history, religion, and geography, giving rise to Iran’s strategic culture. This culture combines a strong national pride and historical consciousness with values centered on resisting external influences. Ultimately, strategic culture has influenced the country’s cyber capabilities, which have significantly evolved since 2003, largely due to state investment and the establishment of the Supreme Council of Cyberspace in 2012. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and the Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS) lead offensive cyber operations, making Iran’s cyber posture more aligned with larger state powers than typical small states. Leaked documents from the Iranian opposition disclosed that Iran has actively developed a comprehensive cyber defense framework over the past decade to protect its critical infrastructure, quell opposition, and control presumed harmful content to maintain regime stability. Despite these efforts, leaks from dissident groups have exposed persistent weaknesses in Iran’s cyber defense, highlighting challenges in infrastructure, threat monitoring, and organizational discipline. Moreover, these leaks reveal Iran’s strategic focus on self-reliance and resistance to foreign influence.",
