So, for example, a state might drop leaflets on a city urging the residents to take a particular action. Or, the state might broadcast messages over radio or other media. Or, the interfering state might make corrupt deals with local politicians or officials in ways that might constitute meddling. In today's world, however, these prosaic forms of interference have been replaced with their digital counterparts: the use of email hacking and fraudulent social media presence to influence the public and consequently interfere with an election. Because the method of election interference has shifted to the digital domain, there is a strong temptation to view the legality of election interference through the international legal rules governing cyber-attacks. In other words, one common assumption made by commentators is that election interference should be understood as a subcategory or particular instantiation of cyber-attacks. Although the international law governing cyber-activity is still emerging, the greatest clarity in that area stems from the international law regarding cyber-war. The majority view among international lawyers is that the regular rules governing kinetic warfare – that is, physical military movements – also apply to cyber-warfare.¹ So, for example, an attack that would violate the law of war if conducted by planes and tanks would also violate the law of war if the same effects are produced by a cyber-attack launched by a team of hackers acting as state-cyber-combatants.\n\nWe will discuss this particular argument in greater detail below, but for the moment the key point is that there is a strong temptation to understand election\n\n¹ For an expression of this point of view, see Jody M. Prescott, *Building the Ethical Cyber Commander and the Law of Armed Conflict*, 40 RUTGERS COMPUTER &amp; TECH. L.J. 42, 47 (2014) (“As nations move toward securing the means to conduct cyber conflict that begins to approach our common understandings of war, a consensus appears to be emerging among international organizations concerned with the implementation of LOAC, and in academia, that LOAC at least applies to those actions in cyberspace that either result in, or are intended to result in, injury to humans and damage to geophysical things.”).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press",

In other words, some would condemn election interference as illegal under international law because it represents a form of cyber-warfare. Other lawyers and politicians will argue the opposite: that election interference does not violate international law because it does not rise to the level of a cyber-war, as if this is the end of the matter in terms of the legal analysis. What unites these two competing conclusions is the assumption that cyber-warfare is the correct framework for judging the legality of election interference. That assumption is profoundly mistaken.\n\nThis chapter will explain why the assumption is mistaken and why the cyber-war framework is unhelpful. Although international law is a broad and sweeping body of law, the legal regulation of warfare is one of the most prominent and successful subdisciplines of international law. So, perhaps it is not surprising that lawyers should jump to cyber-war as an attractive framing device. But the framing device is poor and sucks up oxygen from other more compelling frameworks that international law has to offer.\n\nIn order to explain why cyber-war is a poor fit for understanding election interference, this chapter will first explain the basic principles behind the legal regulation of warfare. Then, in Section 2, this chapter will explain how these principles apply in the context of cyber-attacks. Finally, Section 3 will consider the specific case of election interference to show why it does not constitute an illegal cyber-attack in violation of the law of war. But just because it does not violate the rules regarding cyber-war does not mean that it might not violate some other area of international law. The field of international law is at once broader and deeper than the legal regulation of armed conflict. But only by first pushing aside the most obvious framing device can we move toward more compelling and innovative frameworks for understanding the particular harm posed by foreign election interference. This argument will unfold over the course of the subsequent chapters.\n\n## INTERNATIONAL REGULATION OF WARFARE\n\n### The Distinction Between Jus ad Bellum and Jus in Bello\n\nThe international legal regulation of warfare is based on the foundational distinction between jus ad bellum and jus in bello -- terms that originate with the Just War philosophical tradition. Jus ad bellum regulates the recourse to force, that is, the decision to go to war in the first place. With very few exceptions, states are mostly prohibited from using military force to settle international disputes, but in some situations, the recourse to military force might be justified. In contrast, jus in bello regulates the conduct of hostilities during an armed conflict. So, for example, jus in bello passes judgment on the tactics used during an armed conflict, such as who can be targeted, in what",

The victim state is not entitled to more liberal rules for the conduct of warfare, just because the victim state is on the receiving end of a *jus ad bellum* violation. Conversely, the aggressor state is not subject to more restrictive conduct rules just because the aggressor state has violated *jus ad bellum* principles. In the conduct of cyber-war, this means that whether a state has violated *jus ad bellum* or not is irrelevant to the question of how the rules of *jus in bello* are applied in the context of cyber-attacks. It is important to keep the macro-level and micro-level questions separate.\n\nThere has been a recent trend in the philosophical literature to question the canonical separation between *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* principles. These “revisionist just war” arguments have pushed back against the classical Just War Tradition, which always assumed that the *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* domains were conceptually distinct.⁵ Under the revisionist line of thinking, philosophers have suggested that, for example, noncombatants on the victim side should be entitled to fight back against an unjust aggression, whereas under the traditional view, noncombatants are prohibited from participating in hostilities and are therefore not entitled to the combatant’s privilege.⁶ Part of the inspiration for the revisionist trend is that the ethical rules regarding killing should be the same for individuals as they are for groups.⁷ In other words, the revisionist camp aims to\n\n² See GARY SOLIS, THE LAW OF ARMED CONFLICT 7–8 (2nd edn., Cambridge University Press, 2016) (noting that: “All’s fair in love and war?

Under principles governing personal self-defense, for example, the victim of an unjust attack is entitled to fight back whereas the aggressor is not entitled to use physical force. Revisionists ask why the same should not be true also in the context of warfare.\n\nWhatever one thinks about the philosophical legitimacy of these revisionist arguments, even the philosophers do not contend that their arguments are currently represented in international legal doctrine.⁸ The revisionist just war philosophers are making arguments about the deep morality of warfare and even some of them concede that there might be legitimate institutional or pragmatic reasons why international law separates *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* into conceptually distinct normative regimes. For example, it might be unworkable to assign to each soldier and to each civilian the task of determining whether a military invasion is justified under *jus ad bellum* before they decide how they should behave.⁹ So, the virtue of the current legal regime is that soldiers and civilians alike can fight (or not fight) in a war without having to adjudicate the contentious *jus ad bellum* questions. Whether this separation is consistent with the “deep morality” of warfare or not, it certainly makes life for the professional solider (on both sides) more workable and represents the current state of the legal regulation of warfare. It may even be morally justified as an instrumental matter, because separating the two domains might service the legitimate goal of designing real-world institutions that ensure compliance with rules that are a second-best alternative to the deep morality of war.¹⁰\n\n## B. The Basic Rules Regarding Jus ad Bellum\n\nThe rules regarding *jus ad bellum* are relatively straightforward to articulate, although they are contentious when it comes to their *application*. The use of military force by one state against another state is only justified if taken in self-defense or in accordance with a Security Council authorization. Article 2(4) of the UN Charter prohibits the use of military force for the resolution of international disputes, but article 51 of the UN Charter carves out cases of self-defense from the basic article 2(4) prohibition.¹¹ Article 51 imposes various requirements for the exercise of self-defense, including the existence of an armed attack against the victim\n\n⁸ *Id.* at 208 (“There are compelling reasons why the laws of war cannot treat the use of violence by Unjust Combatants as criminal.”).\n\n⁹ *Id.* at 208.\n\n¹⁰ See Janina Dill, *Should International Law Ensure the Moral Acceptability of War?*, 26 LEIDEN J.

Although not explicitly articulated in the text of article 51, international law also imposes additional constraints, including requirements of imminence, necessity, and proportionality.¹² The former requires that the armed attack against the victim state be imminent at the point in time when the victim state uses military force to repel the threat. The latter requirement requires that the defensive force be necessary to stop the threat; if nonmilitary measures are available to resolve the threat, the resort to defensive force is illegitimate (because it is unnecessary at the point in time when it is exercised). Any military response to an attack, undertaken in self-defense pursuant to article 51, would be constrained by the principle of proportionality, meaning that the defensive force must not be disproportionate to the legitimate interest being vindicated by the defensive force.¹³\n\nThe Security Council is entitled under Chapter VII of the UN Charter to issue a binding resolution calling on member states to use military force to resolve a threat of or breach of international peace and security.¹⁴ Member states are not required to use military force in that situation, but they are permitted to do so; the Security Council resolution transforms what would otherwise potentially be a violation of article 2(4) into a lawful police action to enforce international law. The Security Council is therefore a clearinghouse for decisions regarding the lawfulness of military force, although individual states retain the \"inherent\" right to exercise defensive force even in situations where the Security Council fails to act to authorize military force.¹⁵ The Security Council may also authorize nonmilitary measures under article 41 of the UN Charter.¹⁶ The right to unilateral defense force is particularly important since the Security Council includes five permanent members (China, France, Russia, United States, United Kingdom), each of whom enjoys a veto, that is, the right to veto any resolution coming out of the Security Council.\n\nthis right of self-defence shall be immediately reported to the Security Council and shall not in any way affect the authority and responsibility of the Security Council under the present Charter to take at any time such action as it deems necessary in order to maintain or restore international peace and security.\"\n\n¹² For a discussion of these requirements, see generally YORAM DINSTEIN, WAR, AGGRESSION, AND SELF-DEFENSE (Cambridge University Press, 2012).\n¹³ For a discussion of the proportionality requirement, see generally MICHAEL A.

International Regulation of Warfare\n45\n\nConsequently, a resolution authorizing the use of force is exceedingly rare and requires universal approval from the world's major powers. Given the possibility for gridlock on the Council, most cases of military force are justified, if at all, under article 51 self-defense.\n\n## C. The Basic Rules Regarding Jus in Bello\n\nThe rules regarding the conduct of warfare are expressed in major treaty conventions such as the four post-World War II Geneva Conventions, two additional protocols to the Geneva Conventions from 1977, and the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907. These treaty sources can be combined with rules of customary international law that equally regulate the conduct of hostilities. The rules regarding the conduct of warfare can be broadly fit into the following categories: targeting, participation in hostilities, tactics in warfare, and weaponry.\n\nFor example, the bedrock principle of *jus in bello* is that attacking forces should limit their attacks to enemy combatants, that is, members of enemy military forces or other militia units that meet the requirements of combatancy. Attacking forces are also entitled to attack civilians for such time as those civilians are directly participating in hostilities.¹⁷ It would be incongruous if a state could avoid its nationals being targeted simply by refusing to organize itself into formal military units, hence the exceptional rule that allows targeting of civilians who directly participate in hostilities. Despite this cardinal rule of distinction, civilians may be killed but only as collateral damage.¹⁸ By the phrase “collateral damage,” the law means that the civilians were not the object of the attack but were killed as a side effect of an attack on a lawful military objective such as a military asset or military personnel.¹⁹ So the difference between a violation of the principle of distinction and a case of permissible collateral damage is the attitude of the attacker. If the attacker is aiming at the civilian, the attacker has violated the principle of distinction. On the other hand, if the attacker is aiming at a lawful military objective, but still kills a civilian or a group of civilians, the civilians are considered collateral damage. The attacking force may even envision the civilian deaths, and they should still be counted as collateral damage.²⁰ However, the *jus in bello* imposes a major constraint on the existence of collateral damage by prohibiting collateral\n\n¹⁷ This rule is codified in article 51(3) of Additional Protocol I (API) to the General Conventions: “Civilians shall enjoy the protection afforded by this Section, unless and for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities.”\n\n¹⁸ The principle of distinction is also sometimes referred to as the principle of discrimination. The two are roughly synonymous, though the word “distinction” is more often used by lawyers and “discrimination” is more common among philosophers of war.\n\n¹⁹ Solis dates the term “collateral damage” to the 1991 Gulf War. See SOLIS, *supra* note 2, at 295; SAHR CONWAY-LANZ, *COLLATERAL DAMAGE* 221 (Routledge, 2006).\n\n²⁰ The question of mental intent in the context of collateral damage is somewhat complicated and has produced a series of unfortunate statements from international courts. For a discussion of this issue, see Jens David Ohlin, *Targeting and the Concept of Intent*, 35 MICH. J. INT’L L. 79 (2013).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press",

Killing by perfidy is outlawed, such as pretending to be a civilian to draw out the enemy or waiving a white flag and pretending to surrender, only to kill the enemy during an ambush.²² These are “dishonest stratagems” as Kant called them, and impermissible as far back as the Lieber Code.²³ Similarly, the *jus in bello* prohibits tactics that increase the suffering of the enemy (*maux superflus*) but do not produce any additional military benefit.²⁴ So, in other words, it would be illegal to use a weapon that does not increase lethality but only increases the pain that the enemy will suffer before dying. Similarly, particular weapons may be outlawed by particular treaties or conventions, such as nuclear weapons (for some states that have signed nonproliferation accords), chemical weapons, cluster munitions, and landmines, though in each of these cases (other than chemical weapons) several states have refused to sign on to the conventions because they consider the weapon system in question to be necessary for strategic interests. Finally, attacking forces are not permitted to attack soldiers who are *hors de combat* because they are sick or because they have effectively communicated their surrender. Consequently, summarily executing a group of POWs (without legal process or criminal culpability) would constitute a war crime.\n\nThe basic structure behind the *jus in bello* is to create a special “war convention,” as Michael Walzer once described it. It creates, in other words, a special framework for the conduct of hostilities. Lawful combatants are granted the combatant’s privilege: in exchange for opening themselves up to the reciprocal risk of killing, combatants may not be prosecuted by the enemy for lawful acts of belligerency. In exchange, combatants are required to limit their attacks to military objects, thus sparing civilians from the burdens of war, as much as possible as would be consistent with the need to pursue the war effort (banning collateral damage entirely would effectively hamper warfare entirely). The requirement to carry arms openly and to avoid perfidious killing – among other prohibitions – install a basic notion of transparency in the law of war. Combatants do not simply fight for themselves as if they were fighting in a duel. Rather, combatants are representatives of the state, killing on the state’s behalf, and therefore combatants and the state “advance and retrograde” together on the field of battle, in Lieber’s\n\n²¹ See API, art. 51(5) (“Among others, the following types of attacks are to be considered as indiscriminate . . . (b) an attack which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.”).\n\n²² See API, art. 37(1) (“It is prohibited to kill, injure or capture an adversary by resort to perfidy. Acts inviting the confidence of an adversary to lead him to believe that he is entitled to, or is obliged to accord, protection under the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, with intent to betray that confidence, shall constitute perfidy . . .”).\n\n²³ However, it should be noted that “ruses of war are not prohibited.” See API, art. 37(2).\n\n²⁴ API, art. 35(2) (“2.

THE EMERGING CONSENSUS ON CYBER-WAR\n\nThe last few years have witnessed a tremendous acceleration of work applying the law of war to the context of cyber-attacks. That being said, there is some uncertainty over the application of core law of war principles to cyber-space. There are several reasons for the uncertainty. The first is that there has been little diplomatic effort to codify specific international rules for cyber-attacks. One reason for the reluctance is that many lawyers believe that existing rules of IHL are adequate to the task of regulating state behavior in cyber-space. Second, some states want to preserve flexibility for their operations conducted in the cyber-realm. Third, the secretive nature of cyber-activities hampers the formation of customary rules. Customary international law develops out of state practice (action) and *opinio juris* (performing the legal action from a sense of legal obligation). But many cyber-attacks are conducted in secret, either covertly or clandestinely, and states often refuse to acknowledge their involvement in cyber-attacks. Other states will sometimes criticize those attacks, but in other situations the difficulty with “attribution” will hamper those public criticisms, thus leading to more private criticism through diplomatic channels.²⁶ This dynamic scuttles or limits the formation of customary norms. However, despite these limitations, international lawyers have worked hard to explain, through soft-law mechanisms, how the law of war applies in cyber-space. One result of this effort, the Tallinn Manual, brought together experts on cyber-law and sought feedback from state governments.\n\nThis section outlines the state of international law regarding cyber-war: subsection A focuses on the role of the Tallinn Manual in constructing these norms; subsection B on whether cyber-wars are armed conflicts under international law; subsection C on the armed attack requirement for self-defense; and subsection D on the application of *jus in bello* principles to cyber-attacks.\n\n²⁵ Lieber Code, art. 20 (“Public war is a state of armed hostility between sovereign nations or governments.

The Role of the Tallinn Manual\n\nThe Tallinn Manual was initiated by the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, which is located in Tallinn, Estonia.²⁷ The initiative involved a collaboration of international law and military law experts from across the world, followed by consultation and feedback from governments and their legal advisors. Although the Tallinn Manual is not a source of international law per se, it is relevant to the state of international law for two reasons. First, it may help in the formation of customary international law, as states gravitate towards particular statements of customary rules and norms, providing expression of legal rules for states to either accept or reject through the process of *opinio juris*. Second, the Tallinn Manual is a semi-authoritative statement of how experts believe that the existing law can and should be applied in cyber-space. If there is no need to amend or create new law, but simply a need to apply existing law to activities in cyber-space, then there is no requirement that the application be guided by the stringent rules for the creation of international law.²⁸\n\nThe Tallinn Manual focused on a variety of legal questions, including the applicability of *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* principles to cyber-attacks, and the use of countermeasures to thwart cyber-attacks. Also, the Tallinn Manual discusses violations of sovereignty that fall below the “armed attack” threshold – violations that will be the focus of the next chapter of this book.²⁹\n\n## B. Are Cyber-Wars Real Wars As a Matter of International Law?\n\nThe first threshold question is whether a cyber-war is a real “war” in the legal sense of that term as used by international lawyers. The answer to that question is yes, depending on the type of damage produced by the conflict, though this answer is a bit controversial.³⁰ Some legal scholars argue that defining cyber-wars as real “armed conflicts” only functions to give state militaries control over cyber-infrastructure and cyber-governance – questions that necessarily impact civilian life and which ought not to be exclusively managed by state militaries.³¹ There is\n\n²⁷ See TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE (Michael N. Schmitt et al. (eds.), 2013) [hereinafter cited as “Tallinn Manual”].\n\n²⁸ The strictly defined sources of international law are generally outlined in article 38 of the ICJ Statute.\n\n²⁹ For our purposes, the Tallinn Manual sections on cyber-war are the most relevant to our analysis.\n\n³⁰ For example, the philosopher Larry May has argued that cyber-wars should not be understood as real “armed conflicts” in the way that international lawyers use that term. See Larry May, The Nature of War and the Idea of “Cyberwar,” in Ohlin et al. (eds.), CYBER WAR: LAW AND ETHICS FOR VIRTUAL CONFLICTS 3 (Oxford University Press, 2015) (suggesting that one could look at cyber-attacks as more like embargoes than as armed conflicts).\n\n³¹ See Mary Ellen O’Connell, *Cyber Security without Cyber War*, 17 J.

The Emerging Consensus on Cyber-War\n\nwisdom in this criticism, though it is also the case that some cyber-wars should be considered significant enough to qualify as an armed conflict if they result in physical damage.\n\nIn terms of the application of international law, there is a widely shared definition for what counts as an armed conflict. International lawyers generally distinguish between international armed conflicts (IACs) between states, and noninternational armed conflicts (NIACs) between a state and a nonstate actor or between two nonstate actors. An IAC is triggered when there is a resort to \"armed force\" by one state against another state.[32] The standard view, though it is not codified in any treaty, is that there is no intensity threshold for this determination. In other words, an IAC exists between two states when one state uses military force against the other, regardless of how much force is used, or for how long it lasts. An IAC might involve a one-time airstrike by one state's air force, bombing targets in the other state, or the IAC might involve a full-scale land invasion that lasts for months or even years.[33] Either way, military force is traditionally thought of as involving some kinetic activity – the crossing of a border with a military asset, or the use of a confederate to destroy installations or buildings within the target state. It is very hard to think of an international armed conflict being triggered without either a border crossing or some physical destruction of at least some kind.\n\nIn contrast, a NIAC requires the existence of violent hostilities between a state and a nonstate actor that reaches a certain level of scope and intensity. So, for example, the state's use of physical force against a nonstate actor, such as a group of rebels, might not constitute an armed conflict if the state simply fires a few shots and arrests the members of the rebel organization. However, if there are sustained hostilities between the state and the nonstate actor that pass a certain threshold, the situation\n\nGovernments have followed this modelling, pouring resources into the military for keeping the Internet safe and for taking advantage of what it offers to attack opponents. Doing so has required strained analogies of cyber-attacks to conventional kinetic attacks. The Internet is now far less secure than before there was a Cyber Command or a NATO CCDCOE. It is time, therefore, to turn to cyber disarmament and a focus on peaceful protection of the Internet.\"). See also Christopher J. Finlay, Just War, Cyber War, and the Concept of Violence, 31 PHILOSOPHY &amp; TECHNOLOGY 357-77 (2018) (preferring to conceptualize cyber-attacks under the broader rubric of \"violence\" instead of \"war\"); Ryan Patterson, Silencing the Call to Arms: A Shift Away from Cyber Attacks As Warfare, 48 LOY.

Although the standard for the creation of an armed conflict is more liberal for international conflicts (IACs) than internal ones (NIACs), because the standard allows any use of force, it is unclear whether a cyber-attack would constitute a “use of force” against another state.³⁵ On this question there is not universal agreement. At first blush, one can distinguish between three examples of cyber-attacks. In the first, one state uses a cyber-attack to cause damage or to destroy a physical building in the target state. For example, the state uses a cyber-attack to cause an electrical power station to overheat, resulting in an explosion and fire that destroys the power station. The second example would be a cyber-attack that is launched against a computer system in the target state, resulting in the physical destruction of the computer system but no other physical destruction. The third example would be a cyber-attack that penetrates a foreign computer system, resulting in the theft or destruction of information but no physical damage, not even physical damage to the computer system.\n\nAlthough experts are divided on some of these questions, there is widespread agreement that the first example would constitute a use of force that would trigger the existence of an armed conflict. In that case, a cyber-war would be a “war” in the sense of an “armed conflict” as international lawyers use the term. As the Tallinn Manual stated in its Rule 11, “A cyber operation constitutes a use force when its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force.”³⁶ In making this determination, international lawyers sometimes look at the “scale and effects” of the force to determine whether it crosses the relevant threshold.³⁷ In determining whether a cyber-attack constitutes a use of force, the Tallinn Manual suggests looking at the following criteria: severity, immediacy,\n\n³⁴ Although customary international law arguably imposes the same (or similar) rules of conduct in both types of armed conflict, major treaties regulating *jus in bello* impose different legal regimes in each type of conflict. For example, the full Geneva Conventions apply during IACs, whereas only one article of the Geneva Conventions – Common article 3 – applies during NIACs.\n\n³⁵ Solis, one of the leading American experts on the law of war, describes the standard in the following terms: “A cyber attack, as opposed to a cyber intrusion, constitutes a ‘use of force’ if undertaken by a state’s armed forces, intelligence services, or a private contractor whose conduct is attributable to the state, and its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations that rise to a level of a use of force.” Gary D. Solis, *Cyber Warfare*, 219 MIL. L.

The use of the “scale and effects” language in the Tallinn Manual is a bit unfortunate because it confuses the ICJ standard for armed attack within the context of self-defense for the standard for determining whether something counts as a use of force, despite the fact that the Tallinn Manual concedes that the definitions for a “use of force” and an “armed attack” are designed to “serve different normative purposes.” *Id.* at 52.

Some international lawyers would consider the second example a use of force because it involved the physical destruction of a computer system. The third example is the most difficult, because many lawyers would consider the loss or theft of information to be insufficient to count as a use of force under international law. A small minority of lawyers are more liberal in their interpretation of what counts as a use of force. However, it would seem that the majority has the better of the argument, because it is hard to understand how the mere theft of information could constitute an armed attack. Indeed, it seems to be theft or destruction of information, rather than an armed attack. One might argue that the concept of an armed attack should be amended in today's world of cyber-threats, but indeed the whole point of using this legal trigger is to declare the existence of an armed conflict and trigger the application of IHL, and it is unclear how anything would be improved by triggering the application of IHL every time there is a cross-border cyber-attack. Indeed, one should remember that IHL has both a regulating and licensing function, in that it allows privileged (i.e. lawful) combatants to kill each other with personal legal immunity. So, there are some costs to the application of IHL, and placing states in a constant state of armed conflict simply because of a cyber-attack would do little to resolve international disputes peacefully.\n\nIn practical terms, what this means for election interference is that most cases of cyber-election interference will not trigger the existence of an armed conflict under international law. If state agents seek to influence an election by surreptitiously posting messages on social media, even if in doing so they pretend to be American citizens, this hardly seems like a \"use of force\" in the military sense of that term. Even if a state uses a cyber-attack to hack election results and change vote tallies, this clearly constitutes a substantial intrusion in the political integrity of another state, though again it is hard to qualify it as a use of force. The changing of the vote tallies would alter – arguably destroy – the legitimacy of the election results, but the problem is that international law views the concept of the use of force through a military lens, while in this case the harm seems decidedly political rather than military.\n\nbecause all parties agree that a cyber operation can, in theory, constitute a use of force under international law.\n\n³⁸ Id. at 48–52 (but noting that the factors are not exhaustive and that \"States may look to others, such as the prevailing political environment, whether the cyber operation portends the future use of military force, the identity of the attacker, any record of cyber operations by the attacker, and the nature of the target (such as critical infrastructure)\").\n\n³⁹ Id. at 52 (Rule 12: \"A cyber operation, or threatened cyber operation, constitutes an unlawful threat of force when the threatened action, if carried out, would be an unlawful use of force.\").\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press",

Based on the analysis in this chapter, it is quite clear that the war paradigm is deficient.\n\nThe one situation where there might be an argument for classifying election interference as a use of force is if the cyber-attack does more than simply penetrate election infrastructure but actually physically destroys it. So, for example, if a state were to launch a cyber-attack that caused election machines to overheat and become inoperable, there is an argument that such a cyber-attack might constitute a use of force. Or, similarly, if a cyber-attack causes the electrical system at a state board of elections to overheat and cause a fire, this too would create the physical manifestation necessary to constitute a use of force. But if the election interference of 2016 has taught us anything, it is that the most potent forms of interference involve no physical damage at all. The target of this interference is not physical locations or the lives of military or civilian personnel; the target is democratic institutions through the strategic deployment of misinformation. Social media campaigns designed to influence an election are not acts of war, though this conclusion should not blind us to the threat they pose to democratic systems. We will need to leave to the next two chapters whether international law has an alternative paradigm to describe the harm caused by these cyber-attacks.\n\n### C. The Armed Attack Requirement for Self-Defense\n\nThe prior subsection focused exclusively on the triggering conditions for the existence of an armed conflict (and hence the applicability of IHL). A distinct but related question is what constitutes an “armed attack” under article 51 of the UN Charter. The existence of an armed attack is a condition for the target being permitted to exercise lethal force in response as a defensive measure. It is important to remember that not every violation of international law triggers a right of self-defense in response. Some violations, when they rise to the level of an armed attack, are considered sufficiently serious that the victim state is entitled to unilaterally exercise defensive force even in the absence of Security Council authorization.\n\nThe armed attack requirement is not subject to the same intensity requirements as required by the use of force analysis by IHL in the context of a NIAC. However, given the similarities between the two tests, international lawyers have generally assumed that an armed attack for purposes of article 51 requires some physical destruction. In the Nicaragua opinion, the ICJ argued that an attack must meet a “scale and effects” criterion in order to qualify as an armed attack -- a standard that has had enormous influence in contemporary international legal and diplomatic practice. The Tallinn Manual endorses the “scale and effects” standard in the",

REV. 399, 419 (2017) (concluding that “there is ample evidence to believe that investments over the past several years have dramatically improved the United States’ monitoring abilities in this arena”). The Tallinn Manual argues that the right to self-defense in response to an offensive cyber armed attack is limited by two temporal limitations. First, the original cyber-attack must have occurred or must be imminent. Second, the defensive response must be immediately necessary to counter the threat. See Tallinn Manual, *supra* note 27, at 64–5. This second immediacy requirement is especially important in cases of anticipatory self-defense.\n\n⁴⁸ See Herbert S.

However, different rules would apply for a right of cyber-defense in response to a first cyber-attack.

Election Interference Is Not Cyber-War\n\nthere have been extensive calls for more regulation, perhaps even a new treaty, to govern cyber-space, the lack of serious development of explicit rules suggests that most states are interested in keeping the law open in order to preserve their flexibility going forward. Indeed, states often refuse to even acknowledge publicly when they have perpetrated or been victimized by a cyber-attack – a reticence that hampers the development of legal norms in this area.\n\n## D. Application of Jus in Bello Principles to Cyber-Attacks\n\nPrinciples of *jus in bello* apply to cyber-attacks as long as the cyber-attack either triggers an armed conflict or is launched during an armed conflict.^[57]^ Outside the context of an armed conflict, a cyber-attack would be constrained by principles of international human rights law, and general constraints embodied in public international law (including the concept of proportionality), but the more specific rules of *jus in bello* would not apply. But in the context of an armed conflict, there are at least three *jus in bello* rules that are of prime importance to consider: the principle of distinction, the prohibition on excessive collateral damage, and the combatant's privilege.^[58]^ Each will now be considered.\n\nThe principle of distinction requires attacking forces to limit their attacks to military objectives. A cyber-attack that takes place during an armed conflict would be subject to the same limitations.^[59]^ So, for example, a state launching a cyber-attack would be prohibited from using a cyber-weapon to disable a purely civilian system, such as a school computer system, an electrical power grid providing electricity to a civilian neighborhood, or a computer system associated with a medical-care facility. This prohibition applies not just to attacks against civilian personnel, but also to attacks against civilian installations and civilian infrastructure. This rule would explicitly permit cyber-attacks against military targets, such as a computer system for any military base, missile system, air-defense system, or even an infrastructure system that provides resources exclusively to a military system. So, for example, it would be consistent with the laws of war to use a cyber-attack to disable an oil refinery that provides oil exclusively to a nation's military, with the goal of denying tanks, Humvees, and other military vehicles the fuel that they need to operate.\n\n^[57]^ See, e.g., Gary D. Solis, *Cyber Warfare*, 219 MIL. L.

The Emerging Consensus on Cyber-War\n\nOf course, a civilian target may be destroyed as collateral damage, provided that the collateral damage is not excessive or disproportionate to the military advantage gained by destroying the military target. In the context of a cyber-attack, it might be permissible to destroy a civilian computer system if it is a collateral consequence of destroying a military computer system, which might be the case if the two computer systems are linked together. However, if the destruction of the civilian computer system is disproportionate relative to the military advantage conferred by destroying the military computer system, the collateral damage would be disallowed by *jus in bello*.⁶⁰ There is some uncertainty about how to apply the concept of collateral damage to cyber-attacks. Some scholars have argued that the rule against disproportionate collateral damage should apply even when the damage to the civilian system is limited to loss of *functionality* to a computer system that provides service to the civilian population, even if the computer system is not physically destroyed.⁶¹ The general law-of-war impulse to insulate civilians from the burdens of war applies just as much in cyber-space as it does on the kinetic battlefield.\n\nThe much more difficult application of this rule involves dual-infrastructure targets. Many infrastructure targets, such as power plants, oil refineries, water treatment plants and mining facilities, provide general resources for both civilian and military uses.⁶² International lawyers have been perplexed by these targets for many years, and the NATO bombing of Serbia in 1999 threw into sharp relief the legal uncertainty over their status. For example, NATO forces attacked bridges that were used by both civilian and military vehicles, and also attacked TV stations that were owned by the government and used to broadcast nationalist propaganda. Although controversial, the prevailing consensus is that dual-use infrastructure targets need to be considered as both civilian and military at the same time and evaluated on that basis. Consequently, while it might be legitimate to destroy the military-side of a dual-use infrastructure target, the destruction of the civilian part (or the civilian percentage) is only justified if it is not excessive or disproportionate to the military advantage gained by destroying the military part. So, for example, the bridge\n\n⁶⁰ For a discussion of the proportionality analysis related to a cyber-attack, see Jeremy Richmond, *Evolving Battlefields: Does Stuxnet Demonstrate A Need for Modifications to the Law of Armed Conflict?*, 35 FORDHAM INT’L L.J. 842, 891 (2012) (concluding that the Stuxnet cyber-attack against Iran was proportionate because “[g]iven the minimal amount of collateral damage caused by Stuxnet, Stuxnet’s commanders were almost certainly reasonable in their calculations”).\n\n⁶¹ See, e.g., Eric Talbot Jensen, *Cyber Attacks: Proportionality and Precautions in Attack*, 89 INT’L L. STUD. 198, 206 (2013) (noting that “some have taken the view that damage also encompasses serious interruptions in functionality, such as would require replacing parts or reloading software systems. For example, in the kinetic analogy used above where a cyber attack shut down a communication port but left the rest of the computer unaffected, the computer would still turn on but its actual functionality might be seriously affected. If functionality is considered when determining damage, the kinetic analogy would be of limited value.”).\n\n⁶² See Captain Christopher M.

For a cyber-attack, this means that a computer system could be destroyed even if it has some civilian use, but only if that civilian use is not disproportionate to the military advantage. A cyber-attack against a general power grid that supplies power to both the civilian population and the military would be lawful or unlawful depending on the exact proportion of the two uses and the relative harm it would impose on the civilian population weighed against the military value of denying power to the military.⁶³ The same would hold true for a cyber-attack against an oil refinery.\n\nThe combatant’s privilege provides immunity to military personnel who fight during an armed conflict: as long as their acts comply with the laws of war, the soldiers cannot be prosecuted by a foreign adversary in a domestic court. The privilege applies to members of armed forces and members of a militia who wear uniforms or a fixed emblem, carry arms openly, have a responsible command structure, and comply with the laws and customs of warfare. In the kinetic context, it is clear what this means. Soldiers should wear uniforms, carry their rifles openly, and comply with the laws of war. Members of the CIA or other civilian agencies who are deployed covertly, without the state acknowledging their link to the forces, are not entitled to the combatant’s privilege and could be prosecuted by the enemy upon capture. For a cyber-warrior working for the U.S. government, it is unclear how these requirements should translate.⁶⁴ In theory, the cyber-warrior should be wearing a uniform or fixed emblem, although there is little transparency gain from a hacker’s wearing a uniform as compared to the transparency gain from an infantry soldier wearing a uniform. The problem of remoteness is not unique to cyber-warriors, since missile operators or airmen might never be seen by the enemy either and the general assumption is that these service personnel should wear identifying emblems.\n\nWhat does it mean for a cyber-warrior to “carry arms openly”? This is genuinely unclear and it is doubtful that there is a nonquestion-begging answer to this question. Military cyber-operations are often unacknowledged in the sense that the U.S. government will not acknowledge its role in an offensive cyber-attack, nor does it release much information about defensive cyber-activities either.

Future National Security Advisor John Bolton referred to Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election as an act of war, a “casus belli” that Washington would not and should not accept, and argued that negotiating with Russia was dangerous.⁶⁶ Despite their disagreements over how to approach Russia (and their disagreements about Russian election interference), Trump would later appoint Bolton as National Security Advisor. Similarly, Sen. Richard Blumenthal stated: “This was an act of war, in my view.” Blumenthal continued: “I’ve said it in various hearings before this indictment. Interestingly enough the indictment refers to information warfare, that’s the term the Russians use.”⁶⁷ Nikki Haley, at the time US Ambassador to the United Nations, stated that “[w]hen a country can come and interfere in another country’s elections, that is warfare,” and she also described election interference as Russia’s “weapon” of choice in its conflict with the United States.⁶⁸ Former Vice President and Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney used similar language.⁶⁹ Many pundits and political observers referred to election interference as an act of war:\n\nCall it a different kind of war – asymmetric warfare, or whatever. But it is war. Whatever role Trump played in the attack, whatever he knew or didn’t know about\n\n⁶⁵ As noted above, if a cyber-attack produces physical destruction, it would be regulated by the laws of war.

And it is, so far, winning.⁷⁰\n\nOr consider the statement from one Democratic lawmaker who said that he had “no doubt” that Russian interference constituted an act of war.⁷¹ Even John McCain referred to it as an act of war.⁷² Other politicians referred to the Russian interference as “hybrid warfare” – a category that evokes armed conflict but at least in some usages would be defined as falling below the level of armed conflict. For example, Secretary of Defense Ash Carter said that Russia interfered in “our democratic processes” with hybrid warfare, that is “interference in the internal affairs of nations, short of war.”⁷³\n\nMost scholars who have considered the issue have correctly analyzed that Russian interference falls outside the scope of armed conflict, though each has struggled to articulate a convincing framing device.

In theory, some types of cyber-attacks might fall under the regulation of the law of war, but most cases of election interference would not. The primary reason for this conclusion is that election interference rarely involves physical damage. In cases where data is destroyed, there is a case to be made that we should label such interference as an act of war. The erasure of the data could be accomplished by physically damaging election computers, or by simply erasing the data without physically destroying the hardware where it resides. In the case of a physical destruction, the election interference might be regulated by the law of war, but in all other cases, not.\n\nThe most salient examples of election interference involve either the theft and public release of private information or the posting of political views on social media platforms, often with the goal of disguising the true identity, and national origin, of the account holder. In the case of theft-and-release, a state might steal private information about a candidate – such as emails, text messages, private medical information, or confidential employment records from a human resources department – and release the damaging information to the public in order to favor a rival candidate.77 Some of the information might be real and some of the information might be doctored or otherwise misleading. In the case of the second example of election interference, the foreign state might create fake Facebook groups focusing on a particular issue or candidate, in order to drum up excitement for or against a particular candidate, or fake Twitter or Instagram accounts with the same goal in mind. Each of these activities involves foreign interference that arguably interferes with the political process and the political integrity of the target state, but neither involves the kind of physical destruction or territorial infringement that is the sine qua non of armed conflict.\n\nThere is a strong temptation to reduce all important issues of international law to questions of warfare. Armed conflict is a distinctive moment for international lawyers, full of peril, and the concept of warfare captures the imagination of nonlawyers. Often the critical question (does this conduct violate international law?) gets displaced by the simpler question (is the conduct a war crime?), without first considering whether war is the relevant paradigm or not. But international law is not reducible to the law of war. Public international law is so much richer than just rules regulating the use of force and the conduct of hostilities. We need to resist the temptation to put everything into a war framework. The distinct harm of election interference speaks to broader and more complex questions of political integrity that go well beyond the concept of armed conflict.\n\n77 The Tallinn Manual, supra note 27, at 55 concludes that “acts of cyber intelligence gathering and cyber theft, as well as cyber operations that involve brief or periodic interruption of non-essential cyber services, do not qualify as armed attacks.” It is unclear whether the experts considered the fact that a mere cyber theft, when used for the purpose of election interference, could have an enormous impact on the target state’s political process.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press",

The regulation of warfare is one of the great success stories of international law, because the discourse on warfare, both *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello*, has been wholeheartedly legalized. International lawyers discuss the rules of warfare with a precision that is almost scientific in nature. For a public grasping for certainty and legality, the law of war is an attractive horizon to steer towards. So, it is no wonder that people gravitate to the war paradigm given how successful international lawyers have been in occupying the field. But the war discussion crowds out alternative legal frameworks for understanding election interference, frameworks that focus on the political significance of elections and the way that foreign interference undermines the political integrity of the state.\n\nThe concept of “sovereignty” is one alternative framework.78 Clearly, a state’s violating the sovereignty of another state is illegal under some circumstances. So, it is intuitively plausible to suggest that election interference violates the sovereignty of the target state whose election is disputed, compromised, or influenced by the outside actor. The next chapter will explore “sovereignty” as a more salient legal category than armed conflict and examine both the benefits and the drawbacks of describing election interference in those terms. One noteworthy complication is the fact that the technical and doctrinal requirements for a legal infringement of sovereignty do not line up with common-sense intuitions about what counts as a violation of sovereignty. Consequently, many behaviors that sound as if they should count as sovereignty violations turn out to be perfectly legal – or at the very least contested – according to established doctrines of public international law. It also does not help that the concept of sovereignty is a cluster concept, housing diverse notions such as physical control over territory, control over a population, and expressions of a polity’s popular will. This produces a lot of cross-talking since not everyone means the same thing when they utter the word “sovereignty.”\n\nOne argument for focusing on sovereignty is that international law is much broader than the regulation of war. Just because election interference fails to qualify as an armed attack does not mean that the interference is lawful under international law. Similarly, even though election interference does not trigger a right of self-defense, international law might allow other responses to the interference. Under international law, a state is not required to simply suffer violations falling short of an armed attack. Victim states are entitled to use retorsions and countermeasures in an attempt to get the offending state to back off and cease the illegal behavior.\n\nCountermeasures and retorsions are united by the state’s intention behind their use, which is to induce the law-breaking state into compliance in the future. Countermeasures and retorsions differ in the legal status of the action used to induce\n\n78 See Michael N. Schmitt and Liis Vihul, *Respect for Sovereignty in Cyberspace*, 95 TEX. L. REV. 1659, 1647 (2017) (“Treating violations of sovereignty as a primary rule of international law, Tallinn Manual 2.0 seeks to add granularity to the circumstances in which a cyber operation might violate a State’s territorial sovereignty.”).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press",

In the case of a countermeasure, the state that uses the countermeasure is engaging in conduct that is otherwise illegal; because the illegal conduct is used as a countermeasure to induce compliance, it becomes permissible. In contrast, a retorsion involves action that is already lawful and within the lawful discretion of the state. The classic example of a retorsion is recalling an ambassador, closing an embassy or breaking off diplomatic relations with a state. There is no requirement under international law for a state to have diplomatic relations with another state,79 and the state may recall an ambassador for any reason or no reason at all. Similarly, imagine that a state $a$ plans to sell missiles to state $b$, but becomes angry when state $b$ violates international law and refuses to sell the missiles. This would constitute a retorsion because state $a$ was under no obligation to sell the missiles in the first place.\n\nOf the two, countermeasures are the more controversial because they involve conduct that would otherwise be illegal. However, it should be noted that countermeasures should not include the use of military force, which are governed by the principles of self-defense. Although the issue is somewhat contested, the majority (and better) view is that the doctrine of countermeasures cannot be used as an exception to the requirements of *jus ad bellum*. If a state wishes to use military force, it needs either Security Council authorization or a defensive claim under article 51 of the UN Charter.\n\nAfter the Russian interference in the 2016 election, President Obama announced sanctions designed to punish the Russian government for election interference and related behavior, including Russian interference in Ukraine.80 For example, on April 1, 2015, President Obama issued an executive order declaring that “the increasing prevalence and severity of malicious cyber-enabled activities originating from, or directed by persons located, in whole or in substantial part, outside the United States constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.”81 On December 28, 2016, Obama amended the earlier executive order and ordered the Treasury Department to freeze the assets of individuals involved in Russian cyber-interference.82\n\n79 Of course, international law imposes certain restrictions on how ambassadors should be treated if a state is engaging in diplomatic relations with another state, but nothing requires the state to have the diplomatic relations in the first instance.\n\n80 Christina Lam, *A Slap on the Wrist: Combatting Russia’s Cyber Attack on the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election*, 59 B.C.

In a related move, the Obama administration shut down two Russian diplomatic \"compounds\" that the administration claimed were being used for intelligence collection. Though these compounds were probably connected with domestic intelligence gathering rather than troll farm activity launched from St. Petersburg, the move to shut down the compounds was part of a general package of punitive actions against Moscow. In making this move, Obama stated:\n\nThese actions are not the sum total of our response to Russia's aggressive activities.

Although this refusal is somewhat perplexing, it may have been connected with Obama's general reluctance to declare Russian interference as \"illegal\" under international law.[86] Describing a punitive action as a countermeasure implies a conclusion both about the illegality of the offending conduct and also the illegality of the punitive measure under nonpunitive circumstances.

But this is not to diminish its significance, or even to diminish its illegality under both U.S. and international law. It may still be illegal, and the sooner that the public recognizes that it does not trigger a right of kinetic response under article 51 of the UN Charter, the sooner a more nuanced discussion can open up about the range of permissible responses under international law, such as retorsions and countermeasures outside the context of the use of force.⁸⁸ Political leaders have a range of options at their disposal but selecting among them requires consideration of the vast tools for enforcing international law beyond the use of force.\n\nTo recap the argument presented in this chapter: The principles governing *jus in bello* and *jus ad bellum* apply with equal force in the realm of cyber-attacks. A cyberattack that causes physical destruction may qualify as an armed attack triggering a right of self-defense under article 51 of the UN Charter, and a cyber-attack that causes physical destruction may constitute a resort to force that triggers the existence of an armed conflict and the application of IHL. But in the absence of physical destruction, cyber-attacks probably fall outside the scope of the laws of war.⁸⁹ Cyberwar is a real phenomenon, but in many cases, the \"war\" suffix is, legally speaking, a metaphor. In technical discussions, the term \"war\" is meant to convey the notion of an armed conflict pursued through sustained military engagements. In contrast, most cyber-attacks have more in common with the tools of statecraft than the tools of military science. Election interference falls in the category of statecraft, though it is important to remember that even statecraft is regulated by public international law.\n\n⁸⁷ See, e.g., Jack Crowe, *Rosenstein Calls Out Obama Admin For Failing to \"Publicize\" Russian Election Interference*, NATIONAL REVIEW (April 26, 2019).\n\n⁸⁸ In this sense, Brown is absolutely right when he concludes that \"[l]aw is a critical aspect of discussions about the cyber aspects of privacy rights, espionage, sovereignty, international norms of behavior, and more – but none of these things is within the realm of LOAC.\" Gary D.

Lubell also argues that psychological operations (such as operations that have the goal of disseminating propaganda) \"are not considered to be ones that cause direct harm to the civilian population and, as such, can be excluded from certain restrictions placed on attacks.\" *Id.* at 263.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press",

So, for example, a state might drop leaflets on a city urging the residents to take a particular action. Or, the state might broadcast messages over radio or other media. Or, the interfering state might make corrupt deals with local politicians or officials in ways that might constitute meddling. In today's world, however, these prosaic forms of interference have been replaced with their digital counterparts: the use of email hacking and fraudulent social media presence to influence the public and consequently interfere with an election. Because the method of election interference has shifted to the digital domain, there is a strong temptation to view the legality of election interference through the international legal rules governing cyber-attacks. In other words, one common assumption made by commentators is that election interference should be understood as a subcategory or particular instantiation of cyber-attacks. Although the international law governing cyber-activity is still emerging, the greatest clarity in that area stems from the international law regarding cyber-war. The majority view among international lawyers is that the regular rules governing kinetic warfare – that is, physical military movements – also apply to cyber-warfare.¹ So, for example, an attack that would violate the law of war if conducted by planes and tanks would also violate the law of war if the same effects are produced by a cyber-attack launched by a team of hackers acting as state-cyber-combatants.\nWe will discuss this particular argument in greater detail below, but for the moment the key point is that there is a strong temptation to understand election\n¹ For an expression of this point of view, see Jody M. Prescott, *Building the Ethical Cyber Commander and the Law of Armed Conflict*, 40 RUTGERS COMPUTER &amp; TECH. L.J. 42, 47 (2014) (“As nations move toward securing the means to conduct cyber conflict that begins to approach our common understandings of war, a consensus appears to be emerging among international organizations concerned with the implementation of LOAC, and in academia, that LOAC at least applies to those actions in cyberspace that either result in, or are intended to result in, injury to humans and damage to geophysical things.”).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\ninterference through the lens of cyber-war. In other words, some would condemn election interference as illegal under international law because it represents a form of cyber-warfare. Other lawyers and politicians will argue the opposite: that election interference does not violate international law because it does not rise to the level of a cyber-war, as if this is the end of the matter in terms of the legal analysis. What unites these two competing conclusions is the assumption that cyber-warfare is the correct framework for judging the legality of election interference. That assumption is profoundly mistaken.\nThis chapter will explain why the assumption is mistaken and why the cyber-war framework is unhelpful. Although international law is a broad and sweeping body of law, the legal regulation of warfare is one of the most prominent and successful subdisciplines of international law. So, perhaps it is not surprising that lawyers should jump to cyber-war as an attractive framing device. But the framing device is poor and sucks up oxygen from other more compelling frameworks that international law has to offer.\nIn order to explain why cyber-war is a poor fit for understanding election interference, this chapter will first explain the basic principles behind the legal regulation of warfare. Then, in Section 2, this chapter will explain how these principles apply in the context of cyber-attacks. Finally, Section 3 will consider the specific case of election interference to show why it does not constitute an illegal cyber-attack in violation of the law of war. But just because it does not violate the rules regarding cyber-war does not mean that it might not violate some other area of international law. The field of international law is at once broader and deeper than the legal regulation of armed conflict. But only by first pushing aside the most obvious framing device can we move toward more compelling and innovative frameworks for understanding the particular harm posed by foreign election interference. This argument will unfold over the course of the subsequent chapters.\n## INTERNATIONAL REGULATION OF WARFARE\n### The Distinction Between Jus ad Bellum and Jus in Bello\nThe international legal regulation of warfare is based on the foundational distinction between jus ad bellum and jus in bello -- terms that originate with the Just War philosophical tradition. Jus ad bellum regulates the recourse to force, that is, the decision to go to war in the first place. With very few exceptions, states are mostly prohibited from using military force to settle international disputes, but in some situations, the recourse to military force might be justified. In contrast, jus in bello regulates the conduct of hostilities during an armed conflict. So, for example, jus in bello passes judgment on the tactics used during an armed conflict, such as who can be targeted, in what\n2. Election Interference Is Not Cyber-War\ncircumstances, and with what weapons.² For example, one of the cardinal rules of *jus in bello* is the rule prohibiting collateral damage that is excessive or disproportionate to the value of the military target.³ One way of explaining the distinction between *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* is that the former covers macro-questions regarding the legality of the overall war, while the latter covers micro-questions regarding the conduct of individual military operations within that war.\nThe legal domains of *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* are legally and conceptually independent, in the sense that a *jus in bello* analysis does not depend on the outcome of the *jus ad bellum* analysis.⁴ In other words, both the aggressor state and the victim state are required to follow the same rules regarding the conduct of warfare. The victim state is not entitled to more liberal rules for the conduct of warfare, just because the victim state is on the receiving end of a *jus ad bellum* violation. Conversely, the aggressor state is not subject to more restrictive conduct rules just because the aggressor state has violated *jus ad bellum* principles. In the conduct of cyber-war, this means that whether a state has violated *jus ad bellum* or not is irrelevant to the question of how the rules of *jus in bello* are applied in the context of cyber-attacks. It is important to keep the macro-level and micro-level questions separate.\nThere has been a recent trend in the philosophical literature to question the canonical separation between *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* principles. These “revisionist just war” arguments have pushed back against the classical Just War Tradition, which always assumed that the *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* domains were conceptually distinct.⁵ Under the revisionist line of thinking, philosophers have suggested that, for example, noncombatants on the victim side should be entitled to fight back against an unjust aggression, whereas under the traditional view, noncombatants are prohibited from participating in hostilities and are therefore not entitled to the combatant’s privilege.⁶ Part of the inspiration for the revisionist trend is that the ethical rules regarding killing should be the same for individuals as they are for groups.⁷ In other words, the revisionist camp aims to\n² See GARY SOLIS, THE LAW OF ARMED CONFLICT 7–8 (2nd edn., Cambridge University Press, 2016) (noting that: “All’s fair in love and war? Hardly! Any divorce lawyer will attest that ‘all’ is decidedly not fair in love. Just as surely, all is not fair in war.”).\n³ Id. at 292–300.\n⁴ See MICHAEL WALZER, JUST AND UNJUST WARS: A MORAL ARGUMENT WITH HISTORICAL ILLUSTRATIONS 21 (3rd edn., Basic Books, 2000) (suggesting that the “two sorts of judgment are logically independent”). See also Nathaniel Berman, Privileging Combat? Contemporary Conflict and the Legal Construction of War, 43 COLUM. J. TRANSNAT’L L. 1, 27 (2004) (discussing the “indifference of jus in bello to the relative jus ad bellum merits of the parties”).\n⁵ See Jeff McMahan, War as Self-Defense, 18 ETH. &amp; INT’L AFF. 75 (2004).\n⁶ See Jeff McMahan, Innocence, Self-Defense and Killing in War, 2 J. POL. PHIL. 193–221 (1994).\n⁷ McMahan, supra note 6, at 198 (“According to virtually all accounts of the right of individual self-defense, the Culpable Attacker is not morally permitted to use lethal violence even to defend himself against his initial victim’s self-defensive response.”).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n1. International Regulation of Warfare\n43\nharmonize rules of individual morality with rules for group morality, rather than seeing them as separate modes of ethical conduct. Under principles governing personal self-defense, for example, the victim of an unjust attack is entitled to fight back whereas the aggressor is not entitled to use physical force. Revisionists ask why the same should not be true also in the context of warfare.\nWhatever one thinks about the philosophical legitimacy of these revisionist arguments, even the philosophers do not contend that their arguments are currently represented in international legal doctrine.⁸ The revisionist just war philosophers are making arguments about the deep morality of warfare and even some of them concede that there might be legitimate institutional or pragmatic reasons why international law separates *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* into conceptually distinct normative regimes. For example, it might be unworkable to assign to each soldier and to each civilian the task of determining whether a military invasion is justified under *jus ad bellum* before they decide how they should behave.⁹ So, the virtue of the current legal regime is that soldiers and civilians alike can fight (or not fight) in a war without having to adjudicate the contentious *jus ad bellum* questions. Whether this separation is consistent with the “deep morality” of warfare or not, it certainly makes life for the professional solider (on both sides) more workable and represents the current state of the legal regulation of warfare. It may even be morally justified as an instrumental matter, because separating the two domains might service the legitimate goal of designing real-world institutions that ensure compliance with rules that are a second-best alternative to the deep morality of war.¹⁰\n## B. The Basic Rules Regarding Jus ad Bellum\nThe rules regarding *jus ad bellum* are relatively straightforward to articulate, although they are contentious when it comes to their *application*. The use of military force by one state against another state is only justified if taken in self-defense or in accordance with a Security Council authorization. Article 2(4) of the UN Charter prohibits the use of military force for the resolution of international disputes, but article 51 of the UN Charter carves out cases of self-defense from the basic article 2(4) prohibition.¹¹ Article 51 imposes various requirements for the exercise of self-defense, including the existence of an armed attack against the victim\n⁸ *Id.* at 208 (“There are compelling reasons why the laws of war cannot treat the use of violence by Unjust Combatants as criminal.”).\n⁹ *Id.* at 208.\n¹⁰ See Janina Dill, *Should International Law Ensure the Moral Acceptability of War?*, 26 LEIDEN J. INT’L. L. 253–70 (2013).\n¹¹ Article 2(4) of the UN Charter states: “All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.” Article 51 states that “Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. Measures taken by Members in the exercise of\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. Election Interference Is Not Cyber-War\nstate, and a requirement that the Security Council be informed if a state is exercising its legal right of self-defense. Although not explicitly articulated in the text of article 51, international law also imposes additional constraints, including requirements of imminence, necessity, and proportionality.¹² The former requires that the armed attack against the victim state be imminent at the point in time when the victim state uses military force to repel the threat. The latter requirement requires that the defensive force be necessary to stop the threat; if nonmilitary measures are available to resolve the threat, the resort to defensive force is illegitimate (because it is unnecessary at the point in time when it is exercised). Any military response to an attack, undertaken in self-defense pursuant to article 51, would be constrained by the principle of proportionality, meaning that the defensive force must not be disproportionate to the legitimate interest being vindicated by the defensive force.¹³\nThe Security Council is entitled under Chapter VII of the UN Charter to issue a binding resolution calling on member states to use military force to resolve a threat of or breach of international peace and security.¹⁴ Member states are not required to use military force in that situation, but they are permitted to do so; the Security Council resolution transforms what would otherwise potentially be a violation of article 2(4) into a lawful police action to enforce international law. The Security Council is therefore a clearinghouse for decisions regarding the lawfulness of military force, although individual states retain the \"inherent\" right to exercise defensive force even in situations where the Security Council fails to act to authorize military force.¹⁵ The Security Council may also authorize nonmilitary measures under article 41 of the UN Charter.¹⁶ The right to unilateral defense force is particularly important since the Security Council includes five permanent members (China, France, Russia, United States, United Kingdom), each of whom enjoys a veto, that is, the right to veto any resolution coming out of the Security Council.\nthis right of self-defence shall be immediately reported to the Security Council and shall not in any way affect the authority and responsibility of the Security Council under the present Charter to take at any time such action as it deems necessary in order to maintain or restore international peace and security.\"\n¹² For a discussion of these requirements, see generally YORAM DINSTEIN, WAR, AGGRESSION, AND SELF-DEFENSE (Cambridge University Press, 2012).\n¹³ For a discussion of the proportionality requirement, see generally MICHAEL A. NEWTON AND LARRY MAY, PROPORTIONALITY IN INTERNATIONAL LAW (Oxford University Press, 2014).\n¹⁴ See art. 42 (\"Should the Security Council consider that measures provided for in Article 41 would be inadequate or have proved to be inadequate, it may take such action by air, sea, or land forces as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security. Such action may include demonstrations, blockade, and other operations by air, sea, or land forces of Members of the United Nations.\")\n¹⁵ See art. 51.\n¹⁶ See art. 41 (\"The Security Council may decide what measures not involving the use of armed force are to be employed to give effect to its decisions, and it may call upon the Members of the United Nations to apply such measures. These may include complete or partial interruption of economic relations and of rail, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio, and other means of communication, and the severance of diplomatic relations.\")\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n1. International Regulation of Warfare\n45\nConsequently, a resolution authorizing the use of force is exceedingly rare and requires universal approval from the world's major powers. Given the possibility for gridlock on the Council, most cases of military force are justified, if at all, under article 51 self-defense.\n## C. The Basic Rules Regarding Jus in Bello\nThe rules regarding the conduct of warfare are expressed in major treaty conventions such as the four post-World War II Geneva Conventions, two additional protocols to the Geneva Conventions from 1977, and the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907. These treaty sources can be combined with rules of customary international law that equally regulate the conduct of hostilities. The rules regarding the conduct of warfare can be broadly fit into the following categories: targeting, participation in hostilities, tactics in warfare, and weaponry.\nFor example, the bedrock principle of *jus in bello* is that attacking forces should limit their attacks to enemy combatants, that is, members of enemy military forces or other militia units that meet the requirements of combatancy. Attacking forces are also entitled to attack civilians for such time as those civilians are directly participating in hostilities.¹⁷ It would be incongruous if a state could avoid its nationals being targeted simply by refusing to organize itself into formal military units, hence the exceptional rule that allows targeting of civilians who directly participate in hostilities. Despite this cardinal rule of distinction, civilians may be killed but only as collateral damage.¹⁸ By the phrase “collateral damage,” the law means that the civilians were not the object of the attack but were killed as a side effect of an attack on a lawful military objective such as a military asset or military personnel.¹⁹ So the difference between a violation of the principle of distinction and a case of permissible collateral damage is the attitude of the attacker. If the attacker is aiming at the civilian, the attacker has violated the principle of distinction. On the other hand, if the attacker is aiming at a lawful military objective, but still kills a civilian or a group of civilians, the civilians are considered collateral damage. The attacking force may even envision the civilian deaths, and they should still be counted as collateral damage.²⁰ However, the *jus in bello* imposes a major constraint on the existence of collateral damage by prohibiting collateral\n¹⁷ This rule is codified in article 51(3) of Additional Protocol I (API) to the General Conventions: “Civilians shall enjoy the protection afforded by this Section, unless and for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities.”\n¹⁸ The principle of distinction is also sometimes referred to as the principle of discrimination. The two are roughly synonymous, though the word “distinction” is more often used by lawyers and “discrimination” is more common among philosophers of war.\n¹⁹ Solis dates the term “collateral damage” to the 1991 Gulf War. See SOLIS, *supra* note 2, at 295; SAHR CONWAY-LANZ, *COLLATERAL DAMAGE* 221 (Routledge, 2006).\n²⁰ The question of mental intent in the context of collateral damage is somewhat complicated and has produced a series of unfortunate statements from international courts. For a discussion of this issue, see Jens David Ohlin, *Targeting and the Concept of Intent*, 35 MICH. J. INT’L L. 79 (2013).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. Election Interference Is Not Cyber-War\ndamage that is disproportionate or “excessive” to the anticipated value of the military advantage that will be gained from destroying the military target.²¹\nThe *jus in bello* also outlaws particular tactics. Killing by perfidy is outlawed, such as pretending to be a civilian to draw out the enemy or waiving a white flag and pretending to surrender, only to kill the enemy during an ambush.²² These are “dishonest stratagems” as Kant called them, and impermissible as far back as the Lieber Code.²³ Similarly, the *jus in bello* prohibits tactics that increase the suffering of the enemy (*maux superflus*) but do not produce any additional military benefit.²⁴ So, in other words, it would be illegal to use a weapon that does not increase lethality but only increases the pain that the enemy will suffer before dying. Similarly, particular weapons may be outlawed by particular treaties or conventions, such as nuclear weapons (for some states that have signed nonproliferation accords), chemical weapons, cluster munitions, and landmines, though in each of these cases (other than chemical weapons) several states have refused to sign on to the conventions because they consider the weapon system in question to be necessary for strategic interests. Finally, attacking forces are not permitted to attack soldiers who are *hors de combat* because they are sick or because they have effectively communicated their surrender. Consequently, summarily executing a group of POWs (without legal process or criminal culpability) would constitute a war crime.\nThe basic structure behind the *jus in bello* is to create a special “war convention,” as Michael Walzer once described it. It creates, in other words, a special framework for the conduct of hostilities. Lawful combatants are granted the combatant’s privilege: in exchange for opening themselves up to the reciprocal risk of killing, combatants may not be prosecuted by the enemy for lawful acts of belligerency. In exchange, combatants are required to limit their attacks to military objects, thus sparing civilians from the burdens of war, as much as possible as would be consistent with the need to pursue the war effort (banning collateral damage entirely would effectively hamper warfare entirely). The requirement to carry arms openly and to avoid perfidious killing – among other prohibitions – install a basic notion of transparency in the law of war. Combatants do not simply fight for themselves as if they were fighting in a duel. Rather, combatants are representatives of the state, killing on the state’s behalf, and therefore combatants and the state “advance and retrograde” together on the field of battle, in Lieber’s\n²¹ See API, art. 51(5) (“Among others, the following types of attacks are to be considered as indiscriminate . . . (b) an attack which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.”).\n²² See API, art. 37(1) (“It is prohibited to kill, injure or capture an adversary by resort to perfidy. Acts inviting the confidence of an adversary to lead him to believe that he is entitled to, or is obliged to accord, protection under the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, with intent to betray that confidence, shall constitute perfidy . . .”).\n²³ However, it should be noted that “ruses of war are not prohibited.” See API, art. 37(2).\n²⁴ API, art. 35(2) (“2. It is prohibited to employ weapons, projectiles and material and methods of warfare of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering.”).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. The Emerging Consensus on Cyber-War\nfamous phrase.²⁵ None of that would be possible without a basic principle of transparency in the application of *jus in bello*, which requires for its operation a tangible and public connection between individual combatants and the state on whose behalf they fight.\n## 2. THE EMERGING CONSENSUS ON CYBER-WAR\nThe last few years have witnessed a tremendous acceleration of work applying the law of war to the context of cyber-attacks. That being said, there is some uncertainty over the application of core law of war principles to cyber-space. There are several reasons for the uncertainty. The first is that there has been little diplomatic effort to codify specific international rules for cyber-attacks. One reason for the reluctance is that many lawyers believe that existing rules of IHL are adequate to the task of regulating state behavior in cyber-space. Second, some states want to preserve flexibility for their operations conducted in the cyber-realm. Third, the secretive nature of cyber-activities hampers the formation of customary rules. Customary international law develops out of state practice (action) and *opinio juris* (performing the legal action from a sense of legal obligation). But many cyber-attacks are conducted in secret, either covertly or clandestinely, and states often refuse to acknowledge their involvement in cyber-attacks. Other states will sometimes criticize those attacks, but in other situations the difficulty with “attribution” will hamper those public criticisms, thus leading to more private criticism through diplomatic channels.²⁶ This dynamic scuttles or limits the formation of customary norms. However, despite these limitations, international lawyers have worked hard to explain, through soft-law mechanisms, how the law of war applies in cyber-space. One result of this effort, the Tallinn Manual, brought together experts on cyber-law and sought feedback from state governments.\nThis section outlines the state of international law regarding cyber-war: subsection A focuses on the role of the Tallinn Manual in constructing these norms; subsection B on whether cyber-wars are armed conflicts under international law; subsection C on the armed attack requirement for self-defense; and subsection D on the application of *jus in bello* principles to cyber-attacks.\n²⁵ Lieber Code, art. 20 (“Public war is a state of armed hostility between sovereign nations or governments.

Election Interference Is Not Cyber-War\n## A. The Role of the Tallinn Manual\nThe Tallinn Manual was initiated by the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, which is located in Tallinn, Estonia.²⁷ The initiative involved a collaboration of international law and military law experts from across the world, followed by consultation and feedback from governments and their legal advisors. Although the Tallinn Manual is not a source of international law per se, it is relevant to the state of international law for two reasons. First, it may help in the formation of customary international law, as states gravitate towards particular statements of customary rules and norms, providing expression of legal rules for states to either accept or reject through the process of *opinio juris*. Second, the Tallinn Manual is a semi-authoritative statement of how experts believe that the existing law can and should be applied in cyber-space. If there is no need to amend or create new law, but simply a need to apply existing law to activities in cyber-space, then there is no requirement that the application be guided by the stringent rules for the creation of international law.²⁸\nThe Tallinn Manual focused on a variety of legal questions, including the applicability of *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* principles to cyber-attacks, and the use of countermeasures to thwart cyber-attacks. Also, the Tallinn Manual discusses violations of sovereignty that fall below the “armed attack” threshold – violations that will be the focus of the next chapter of this book.²⁹\n## B. Are Cyber-Wars Real Wars As a Matter of International Law?\nThe first threshold question is whether a cyber-war is a real “war” in the legal sense of that term as used by international lawyers. The answer to that question is yes, depending on the type of damage produced by the conflict, though this answer is a bit controversial.³⁰ Some legal scholars argue that defining cyber-wars as real “armed conflicts” only functions to give state militaries control over cyber-infrastructure and cyber-governance – questions that necessarily impact civilian life and which ought not to be exclusively managed by state militaries.³¹ There is\n²⁷ See TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE (Michael N. Schmitt et al. (eds.), 2013) [hereinafter cited as “Tallinn Manual”].\n²⁸ The strictly defined sources of international law are generally outlined in article 38 of the ICJ Statute.\n²⁹ For our purposes, the Tallinn Manual sections on cyber-war are the most relevant to our analysis.\n³⁰ For example, the philosopher Larry May has argued that cyber-wars should not be understood as real “armed conflicts” in the way that international lawyers use that term. See Larry May, The Nature of War and the Idea of “Cyberwar,” in Ohlin et al. (eds.), CYBER WAR: LAW AND ETHICS FOR VIRTUAL CONFLICTS 3 (Oxford University Press, 2015) (suggesting that one could look at cyber-attacks as more like embargoes than as armed conflicts).\n³¹ See Mary Ellen O’Connell, *Cyber Security without Cyber War*, 17 J. CONFLICT &amp; SEC. L. 187, 209 (2012) (“To date, the problem of Internet security has been the domain of international law scholars with expertise in use of force questions. They have sent the message that the Internet may be protected through military force or the threat of military force, analogizing to Cold War deterrence strategy.”\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. The Emerging Consensus on Cyber-War\nwisdom in this criticism, though it is also the case that some cyber-wars should be considered significant enough to qualify as an armed conflict if they result in physical damage.\nIn terms of the application of international law, there is a widely shared definition for what counts as an armed conflict. International lawyers generally distinguish between international armed conflicts (IACs) between states, and noninternational armed conflicts (NIACs) between a state and a nonstate actor or between two nonstate actors. An IAC is triggered when there is a resort to \"armed force\" by one state against another state.[32] The standard view, though it is not codified in any treaty, is that there is no intensity threshold for this determination. In other words, an IAC exists between two states when one state uses military force against the other, regardless of how much force is used, or for how long it lasts. An IAC might involve a one-time airstrike by one state's air force, bombing targets in the other state, or the IAC might involve a full-scale land invasion that lasts for months or even years.[33] Either way, military force is traditionally thought of as involving some kinetic activity – the crossing of a border with a military asset, or the use of a confederate to destroy installations or buildings within the target state. It is very hard to think of an international armed conflict being triggered without either a border crossing or some physical destruction of at least some kind.\nIn contrast, a NIAC requires the existence of violent hostilities between a state and a nonstate actor that reaches a certain level of scope and intensity. So, for example, the state's use of physical force against a nonstate actor, such as a group of rebels, might not constitute an armed conflict if the state simply fires a few shots and arrests the members of the rebel organization. However, if there are sustained hostilities between the state and the nonstate actor that pass a certain threshold, the situation\nGovernments have followed this modelling, pouring resources into the military for keeping the Internet safe and for taking advantage of what it offers to attack opponents. Doing so has required strained analogies of cyber-attacks to conventional kinetic attacks. The Internet is now far less secure than before there was a Cyber Command or a NATO CCDCOE. It is time, therefore, to turn to cyber disarmament and a focus on peaceful protection of the Internet.\"). See also Christopher J. Finlay, Just War, Cyber War, and the Concept of Violence, 31 PHILOSOPHY &amp; TECHNOLOGY 357-77 (2018) (preferring to conceptualize cyber-attacks under the broader rubric of \"violence\" instead of \"war\"); Ryan Patterson, Silencing the Call to Arms: A Shift Away from Cyber Attacks As Warfare, 48 LOY.

Election Interference Is Not Cyber-War\nmight graduate from a law enforcement operation to a full-blown NIAC that triggers the application of IHL rules (at least the rules that apply during a NIAC).³⁴\nAssuming that these articulations are correct statements about the international legal threshold for armed conflict, most cyber-attacks will not rise to the level of an armed conflict. Although the standard for the creation of an armed conflict is more liberal for international conflicts (IACs) than internal ones (NIACs), because the standard allows any use of force, it is unclear whether a cyber-attack would constitute a “use of force” against another state.³⁵ On this question there is not universal agreement. At first blush, one can distinguish between three examples of cyber-attacks. In the first, one state uses a cyber-attack to cause damage or to destroy a physical building in the target state. For example, the state uses a cyber-attack to cause an electrical power station to overheat, resulting in an explosion and fire that destroys the power station. The second example would be a cyber-attack that is launched against a computer system in the target state, resulting in the physical destruction of the computer system but no other physical destruction. The third example would be a cyber-attack that penetrates a foreign computer system, resulting in the theft or destruction of information but no physical damage, not even physical damage to the computer system.\nAlthough experts are divided on some of these questions, there is widespread agreement that the first example would constitute a use of force that would trigger the existence of an armed conflict. In that case, a cyber-war would be a “war” in the sense of an “armed conflict” as international lawyers use the term. As the Tallinn Manual stated in its Rule 11, “A cyber operation constitutes a use force when its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force.”³⁶ In making this determination, international lawyers sometimes look at the “scale and effects” of the force to determine whether it crosses the relevant threshold.³⁷ In determining whether a cyber-attack constitutes a use of force, the Tallinn Manual suggests looking at the following criteria: severity, immediacy,\n³⁴ Although customary international law arguably imposes the same (or similar) rules of conduct in both types of armed conflict, major treaties regulating *jus in bello* impose different legal regimes in each type of conflict. For example, the full Geneva Conventions apply during IACs, whereas only one article of the Geneva Conventions – Common article 3 – applies during NIACs.\n³⁵ Solis, one of the leading American experts on the law of war, describes the standard in the following terms: “A cyber attack, as opposed to a cyber intrusion, constitutes a ‘use of force’ if undertaken by a state’s armed forces, intelligence services, or a private contractor whose conduct is attributable to the state, and its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations that rise to a level of a use of force.” Gary D. Solis, *Cyber Warfare*, 219 MIL. L. REV. 1, 15 (2014).\n³⁶ Tallinn Manual, *supra* note 27, at 45.\n³⁷ *Id.* at 46 (noting that “scale and effects” is a shorthand term that captures the quantitative and qualitative factors to be analysed in determining whether a cyber operation qualifies as a use of force”). The use of the “scale and effects” language in the Tallinn Manual is a bit unfortunate because it confuses the ICJ standard for armed attack within the context of self-defense for the standard for determining whether something counts as a use of force, despite the fact that the Tallinn Manual concedes that the definitions for a “use of force” and an “armed attack” are designed to “serve different normative purposes.” *Id.* at 52. That being said, the confusion is not important,\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. The Emerging Consensus on Cyber-War\n51\ndirectness, invasiveness, measurability of effects, military character, state involvement, and presumptive legality.³⁸ Even a threatened cyber-operation can constitute a use of force under certain circumstances.³⁹\nThe second and third examples are more complicated. Some international lawyers would consider the second example a use of force because it involved the physical destruction of a computer system. The third example is the most difficult, because many lawyers would consider the loss or theft of information to be insufficient to count as a use of force under international law. A small minority of lawyers are more liberal in their interpretation of what counts as a use of force. However, it would seem that the majority has the better of the argument, because it is hard to understand how the mere theft of information could constitute an armed attack. Indeed, it seems to be theft or destruction of information, rather than an armed attack. One might argue that the concept of an armed attack should be amended in today's world of cyber-threats, but indeed the whole point of using this legal trigger is to declare the existence of an armed conflict and trigger the application of IHL, and it is unclear how anything would be improved by triggering the application of IHL every time there is a cross-border cyber-attack. Indeed, one should remember that IHL has both a regulating and licensing function, in that it allows privileged (i.e. lawful) combatants to kill each other with personal legal immunity. So, there are some costs to the application of IHL, and placing states in a constant state of armed conflict simply because of a cyber-attack would do little to resolve international disputes peacefully.\nIn practical terms, what this means for election interference is that most cases of cyber-election interference will not trigger the existence of an armed conflict under international law. If state agents seek to influence an election by surreptitiously posting messages on social media, even if in doing so they pretend to be American citizens, this hardly seems like a \"use of force\" in the military sense of that term. Even if a state uses a cyber-attack to hack election results and change vote tallies, this clearly constitutes a substantial intrusion in the political integrity of another state, though again it is hard to qualify it as a use of force. The changing of the vote tallies would alter – arguably destroy – the legitimacy of the election results, but the problem is that international law views the concept of the use of force through a military lens, while in this case the harm seems decidedly political rather than military.\nbecause all parties agree that a cyber operation can, in theory, constitute a use of force under international law.\n³⁸ Id. at 48–52 (but noting that the factors are not exhaustive and that \"States may look to others, such as the prevailing political environment, whether the cyber operation portends the future use of military force, the identity of the attacker, any record of cyber operations by the attacker, and the nature of the target (such as critical infrastructure)\").\n³⁹ Id. at 52 (Rule 12: \"A cyber operation, or threatened cyber operation, constitutes an unlawful threat of force when the threatened action, if carried out, would be an unlawful use of force.\").\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nIn drawing this conclusion, we need to postpone the more general question of whether such interference violates another body of international law and focus for the moment on the narrower question of whether the “war” paradigm is the right way for understanding information operations aimed at undermining the legitimacy of an election. Based on the analysis in this chapter, it is quite clear that the war paradigm is deficient.\nThe one situation where there might be an argument for classifying election interference as a use of force is if the cyber-attack does more than simply penetrate election infrastructure but actually physically destroys it. So, for example, if a state were to launch a cyber-attack that caused election machines to overheat and become inoperable, there is an argument that such a cyber-attack might constitute a use of force. Or, similarly, if a cyber-attack causes the electrical system at a state board of elections to overheat and cause a fire, this too would create the physical manifestation necessary to constitute a use of force. But if the election interference of 2016 has taught us anything, it is that the most potent forms of interference involve no physical damage at all. The target of this interference is not physical locations or the lives of military or civilian personnel; the target is democratic institutions through the strategic deployment of misinformation. Social media campaigns designed to influence an election are not acts of war, though this conclusion should not blind us to the threat they pose to democratic systems. We will need to leave to the next two chapters whether international law has an alternative paradigm to describe the harm caused by these cyber-attacks.\n### C. The Armed Attack Requirement for Self-Defense\nThe prior subsection focused exclusively on the triggering conditions for the existence of an armed conflict (and hence the applicability of IHL). A distinct but related question is what constitutes an “armed attack” under article 51 of the UN Charter. The existence of an armed attack is a condition for the target being permitted to exercise lethal force in response as a defensive measure. It is important to remember that not every violation of international law triggers a right of self-defense in response. Some violations, when they rise to the level of an armed attack, are considered sufficiently serious that the victim state is entitled to unilaterally exercise defensive force even in the absence of Security Council authorization.\nThe armed attack requirement is not subject to the same intensity requirements as required by the use of force analysis by IHL in the context of a NIAC. However, given the similarities between the two tests, international lawyers have generally assumed that an armed attack for purposes of article 51 requires some physical destruction. In the Nicaragua opinion, the ICJ argued that an attack must meet a “scale and effects” criterion in order to qualify as an armed attack -- a standard that has had enormous influence in contemporary international legal and diplomatic practice. The Tallinn Manual endorses the “scale and effects” standard in the\n2. The Emerging Consensus on Cyber-War\ncontext of self-defense, though it concedes that even before the complication of cyber-attacks is added to the mix, the standard is somewhat vague and requires contentious application.⁴⁰ Governments likely support an “effects” test for evaluating a cyber-attack because it preserves maximum flexibility for using offensive cyber-attacks in many situations that fall below the relevant “effects” threshold.⁴¹\nConsequently, a cyber-attack in some circumstances could qualify as an armed attack that triggers the inherent right to self-defense article in article 51.⁴² The destruction must be foreseeable but it need not be immediate.⁴³ For example, if a cyber-attack produces death or physical destruction, even if that consequence is a “downstream” consequence, it might still qualify as an armed attack, as long as the resulting destruction is a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the cyber-attack.⁴⁴ One notable example is a cyber-attack against a water-filtration plant that prevents the target state from maintaining the quality of its water-supply; if civilians ultimately get sick or die, even if that occurs weeks or months after the original cyber-attack, this could qualify as an armed attack for purposes of article 51.⁴⁵\nIf a military – that is, kinetic – response is going to be authorized by international law, it makes sense to have a demanding trigger. Consequently, the majority of experts who worked on the Tallinn Manual concluded that an armed attack requires an actual or imminent territorial infringement that will cause physical damage to persons or things.⁴⁶ The imminence requirement is a preexisting element of the\n⁴⁰ Id. at 55 (concluding that “the parameters of the scale and effects criteria remain unsettled beyond the indication that they need to be grave”).\n⁴¹ See Matthew C. Waxman, Cyber-Attacks and the Use of Force: Back to the Future of Article 2(4), 36 YALE J. INT’L L. 421, 434–5 (2011) (concluding that “the U.S. government probably prefers an effects- or consequences-based interpretation of ‘force’ or ‘armed attack’ with respect to cyber-attacks not only for what it includes (and therefore what the Charter prohibits and what could trigger self-defense rights), but also for what it excludes. Computer-based espionage, intelligence collection, or even some preemptive cyber-operations or countermeasures designed to disable an adversary’s threatening capabilities, for example, would generally not constitute prohibited force because these activities do not produce destructive consequences analogous to a kinetic military attack”).\n⁴² Tallinn Manual, supra note 27, at 54 (“The International Group of Experts unanimously concluded that some cyber operations may be sufficiently grave to warrant classifying them as an ‘armed attack’ within the meaning of the Charter.”).\n⁴³ See Michael Gervais, Cyber Attacks and the Laws of War, 30 BERKELEY J. INT’L L. 525, 538 (2012) (noting that “[c]yber attacks do not always intentionally target the critical infrastructure that they eventually disrupt”). For another defense of the “reasonably foreseeable” standard in this context, see Michael N. Schmitt, Computer Network Attack and the Use of Force in International Law: Thoughts on a Normative Framework, 37 COLUM. J. TRANSNAT’L. L. 885, 916 (1999) (arguing that “the nature of the act’s reasonably foreseeable consequences would be assessed to determine whether they resemble those of armed coercion”).\n⁴⁴ However, it is certainly true that “it is very difficult from a practical standpoint to predict whether a cyber attack will lead to kinetic harm or not.” See Stephen Petkis, Rethinking Proportionality in the Cyber Context, 47 GEO. J. INT’L L. 1431, 1449 (2016).\n⁴⁵ This example is explored in the Tallinn Manual, supra note 27, at 57.\n⁴⁶ Tallinn Manual, supra note 27, at 54 (Rule 13: “A state that is the target of a cyber operation that rises to the level of an armed attack may exercise its inherent right of self-defense. Whether a cyber operation constitutes an armed attack depends on its scale and effects.”).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. Election Interference Is Not Cyber-War\ninternational legal doctrine on self-defense, though how imminence should be understood for a cyber-attack is more difficult than its kinetic analog. For example, an imminent military attack might be manifested in the form of air, sea, and land forces moving into position to launch a strike or invasion. The public nature of these deployments ensures that the imminent requirement can be transparently evaluated by the court of world opinion. But a cyber-attack that is brewing would not be manifested in the same public manner, because the preparatory works would most likely be private, secret, or unknown.⁴⁷\nThe physical damage could be caused by a physical attack or by a cyber-attack, but the resulting damage must be physical in nature.⁴⁸ The experts concluded that “it is not the nature (injurious or destructive) of the consequences that matters, but rather the extent of the ensuing effects.”⁴⁹ However, it should be noted that a minority of scholars working on the Tallinn Manual concluded that a cyber-attack that destroys “data,” even if it fails to destroy the computer system that houses the data, might in some circumstances constitute an armed attack.⁵⁰ A cyber-attack that disrupts the stock exchange and causes financial damage would not produce the requisite physical damage to be considered an armed attack, though there is disagreement on this question, with a minority of scholars suggesting that the negative consequences flowing from such an attack might meet the requirements for an armed attack.⁵¹ Presumably, those scholars who view the “catastrophic effects” of a cyber-attack against a stock market as enough to qualify as an armed attack might also be\n⁴⁷ However, some scholars have disputed that cyber-attacks can never be identified when they are still in the imminence window. See Ryan J. Hayward, *Evaluating the “Imminence” of A Cyber Attack for Purposes of Anticipatory Self-Defense*, 117 COLUM. L. REV. 399, 419 (2017) (concluding that “there is ample evidence to believe that investments over the past several years have dramatically improved the United States’ monitoring abilities in this arena”). The Tallinn Manual argues that the right to self-defense in response to an offensive cyber armed attack is limited by two temporal limitations. First, the original cyber-attack must have occurred or must be imminent. Second, the defensive response must be immediately necessary to counter the threat. See Tallinn Manual, *supra* note 27, at 64–5. This second immediacy requirement is especially important in cases of anticipatory self-defense.\n⁴⁸ See Herbert S. Lin, *Offensive Cyber Operations and the Use of Force*, 4 J. NAT’L SECURITY L. &amp; POL’Y 63, 73 (2010) (suggesting that “effects rather than the modality of an action are the appropriate starting point for understanding how jus ad bellum and the U.N. Charter apply to offensive cyber operations” and concluding that “[e]ffects-based analysis suggests that the ambiguities are fewest when cyber attacks cause physical damage to property and loss of life in ways that are comparable to kinetic attacks and traditional war, because traditional LOAC provides various relevant precedents and analogies”).\n⁴⁹ Tallinn Manual, *supra* note 27, at 56. For example, Lubell argues that it is “at least arguable that computer data is closer to what the drafters wanted to include as objects than to the notion of what they wanted to exclude as aim or purpose.” See Noam Lubell, *Lawful Targets in Cyber Operations: Does the Principle of Distinction Apply?*, 89 INT’L L. STUD. 252, 268 (2013). Lubell points out that data is, in some circumstances, more precious than physical objects; buildings can be rebuilt, but data that is not backed up (or if the backup tapes are destroyed as well) is gone forever.\n⁵⁰ See Lubell, *supra* note 49, at 267 (concluding that “[t]he problem that arises, which is relatively unique to cyber operations, is whether data can be considered an object. While there is no definitive answer to this question, the currently prevailing view among LOAC experts appears to hold that in most cases data, for the purposes of LOAC targeting, should not be considered an object.”).\n⁵¹ Tallinn Manual, *supra* note 27, at 56.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. The Emerging Consensus on Cyber-War\nwilling to view similarly a cyber-attack against election infrastructure or some other form of election cyber-interference.⁵² However, this conclusion would appear to stretch the concept of “armed attack” well beyond its original meaning, at least when judged against its functional role in the overall ecosystem of *jus ad bellum*.⁵³\nSo far our discussion has focused on the requirements for triggering a military response under article 51 after a state suffers a cyber-attack. However, different rules would apply for a right of cyber-defense in response to a first cyber-attack. If both a first cyber-attack and a defensive cyber-response fall below the threshold for armed attacks, then two nations could engage in a tit-for-tat response of increasingly serious cyber-attacks, and none of it will be regulated by either *jus ad bellum* or *jus in bello*.⁵⁴ The absence of physical destruction of persons or things will remove the cyber-engagement from the legal regulation of warfare, potentially emboldening states to engage in a wide range of cyber-activities.⁵⁵\nThe question in today’s world is whether states would prefer to continue these cyber-attacks without legal regulation or whether a system of reciprocal constraints on cyber-attacks below the military threshold would be a good idea.⁵⁶ Although\n⁵² It should also be noted that the downstream “effects” of a cyber-attack could take weeks or months to be fully manifested – a factor which makes the law of war much more difficult to apply to cyber-attacks, rather than conventional military attacks where the effects are more readily ascertainable in the hours and days after the attack. See Stephen Petkis, *Rethinking Proportionality in the Cyber Context*, 47 GEO. J. INT’L L. 1431, 1448 (2016) (concluding that “the principal problem with an ‘effects test’ in the cyber context is that the nature and gravity of a cyber attack can be incredibly difficult to ascertain at the time the attack occurs. Unlike kinetic action, the true ‘effect’ of a cyber intrusion may not be known until weeks, months, or years after it is first discovered”).\n⁵³ See, e.g., Michael Gervais, *Cyber Attacks and the Laws of War*, 30 BERKELEY J. INT’L L. 525, 536 (2012) (concluding that “in light of the ‘object and purpose’ of the Charter, ‘force’ should be read more narrowly. The express aim of the United Nations is to maintain international peace and security, as well as ‘to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war’. That suggests the notion of force in 1945 was limited to the military instrument.”). Gervais goes on to correctly note that “treating all forms of cyber attack as a use of force would require an implausibly broad reading of Article 2(4) that includes non-physical damage.” *Id.* at 537. But see Schmitt, *supra* note 43, at 919 (asking whether there should be a presumption that computer attacks fall in the use of force box and suggesting that “the security framework of the Charter would be best effected by application of an inclusivity presumption”).\n⁵⁴ See Priyanka R. Dev, “Use of Force” and “Armed Attack” Thresholds in Cyber Conflict: The Looming Definitional Gaps and the Growing Need for Formal U.N. Response, 50 TEX. INT’L L.J. 381, 392–93 (2015) (musing that “an alternative solution to better encapsulate non-physical cyber effects, rather than expanding ill-fitted traditional concepts, would be for the international community to create a new threshold for actions that do not meet the traditional use of force threshold but nonetheless constitute a ‘breach of the peace’ under Article 39 of the U.N. Charter”).\n⁵⁵ See, e.g., Matthew C. Waxman, *Cyber-Attacks and the Use of Force: Back to the Future of Article 2(4)*, 36 YALE J. INT’L L. 421, 434 (2011) (noting that “in addition to the more traditional military defense and deterrence strategies just described, the U.S. government may also be considering legal interpretations flexible enough to permit its own offensive cyber-operations below a certain threshold or against inchoate hostile cyber-activities”).\n⁵⁶ Cyber-attacks that fall below the armed attack threshold would still be subject to international legal regulation, just not under the law of war.

Election Interference Is Not Cyber-War\nthere have been extensive calls for more regulation, perhaps even a new treaty, to govern cyber-space, the lack of serious development of explicit rules suggests that most states are interested in keeping the law open in order to preserve their flexibility going forward. Indeed, states often refuse to even acknowledge publicly when they have perpetrated or been victimized by a cyber-attack – a reticence that hampers the development of legal norms in this area.\n## D. Application of Jus in Bello Principles to Cyber-Attacks\nPrinciples of *jus in bello* apply to cyber-attacks as long as the cyber-attack either triggers an armed conflict or is launched during an armed conflict.^[57]^ Outside the context of an armed conflict, a cyber-attack would be constrained by principles of international human rights law, and general constraints embodied in public international law (including the concept of proportionality), but the more specific rules of *jus in bello* would not apply. But in the context of an armed conflict, there are at least three *jus in bello* rules that are of prime importance to consider: the principle of distinction, the prohibition on excessive collateral damage, and the combatant's privilege.^[58]^ Each will now be considered.\nThe principle of distinction requires attacking forces to limit their attacks to military objectives. A cyber-attack that takes place during an armed conflict would be subject to the same limitations.^[59]^ So, for example, a state launching a cyber-attack would be prohibited from using a cyber-weapon to disable a purely civilian system, such as a school computer system, an electrical power grid providing electricity to a civilian neighborhood, or a computer system associated with a medical-care facility. This prohibition applies not just to attacks against civilian personnel, but also to attacks against civilian installations and civilian infrastructure. This rule would explicitly permit cyber-attacks against military targets, such as a computer system for any military base, missile system, air-defense system, or even an infrastructure system that provides resources exclusively to a military system. So, for example, it would be consistent with the laws of war to use a cyber-attack to disable an oil refinery that provides oil exclusively to a nation's military, with the goal of denying tanks, Humvees, and other military vehicles the fuel that they need to operate.\n^[57]^ See, e.g., Gary D. Solis, *Cyber Warfare*, 219 MIL. L.

The Emerging Consensus on Cyber-War\nOf course, a civilian target may be destroyed as collateral damage, provided that the collateral damage is not excessive or disproportionate to the military advantage gained by destroying the military target. In the context of a cyber-attack, it might be permissible to destroy a civilian computer system if it is a collateral consequence of destroying a military computer system, which might be the case if the two computer systems are linked together. However, if the destruction of the civilian computer system is disproportionate relative to the military advantage conferred by destroying the military computer system, the collateral damage would be disallowed by *jus in bello*.⁶⁰ There is some uncertainty about how to apply the concept of collateral damage to cyber-attacks. Some scholars have argued that the rule against disproportionate collateral damage should apply even when the damage to the civilian system is limited to loss of *functionality* to a computer system that provides service to the civilian population, even if the computer system is not physically destroyed.⁶¹ The general law-of-war impulse to insulate civilians from the burdens of war applies just as much in cyber-space as it does on the kinetic battlefield.\nThe much more difficult application of this rule involves dual-infrastructure targets. Many infrastructure targets, such as power plants, oil refineries, water treatment plants and mining facilities, provide general resources for both civilian and military uses.⁶² International lawyers have been perplexed by these targets for many years, and the NATO bombing of Serbia in 1999 threw into sharp relief the legal uncertainty over their status. For example, NATO forces attacked bridges that were used by both civilian and military vehicles, and also attacked TV stations that were owned by the government and used to broadcast nationalist propaganda. Although controversial, the prevailing consensus is that dual-use infrastructure targets need to be considered as both civilian and military at the same time and evaluated on that basis. Consequently, while it might be legitimate to destroy the military-side of a dual-use infrastructure target, the destruction of the civilian part (or the civilian percentage) is only justified if it is not excessive or disproportionate to the military advantage gained by destroying the military part. So, for example, the bridge\n⁶⁰ For a discussion of the proportionality analysis related to a cyber-attack, see Jeremy Richmond, *Evolving Battlefields: Does Stuxnet Demonstrate A Need for Modifications to the Law of Armed Conflict?*, 35 FORDHAM INT’L L.J. 842, 891 (2012) (concluding that the Stuxnet cyber-attack against Iran was proportionate because “[g]iven the minimal amount of collateral damage caused by Stuxnet, Stuxnet’s commanders were almost certainly reasonable in their calculations”).\n⁶¹ See, e.g., Eric Talbot Jensen, *Cyber Attacks: Proportionality and Precautions in Attack*, 89 INT’L L. STUD. 198, 206 (2013) (noting that “some have taken the view that damage also encompasses serious interruptions in functionality, such as would require replacing parts or reloading software systems. For example, in the kinetic analogy used above where a cyber attack shut down a communication port but left the rest of the computer unaffected, the computer would still turn on but its actual functionality might be seriously affected. If functionality is considered when determining damage, the kinetic analogy would be of limited value.”).\n⁶² See Captain Christopher M. Kovach, *Beyond Skynet: Reconciling Increased Autonomy in Computer-Based Weapons Systems with the Laws of War*, 71 A.F. L. REV. 231, 250 (2014) (noting that “the proliferation of dual-use facilities and systems complicates the ability of cyberweapons to limit their effects solely to lawful targets”).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. Election Interference Is Not Cyber-War\ncan be destroyed if the civilian harm is not disproportionate to the advantage conferred by denying the military use of the bridge. For a cyber-attack, this means that a computer system could be destroyed even if it has some civilian use, but only if that civilian use is not disproportionate to the military advantage. A cyber-attack against a general power grid that supplies power to both the civilian population and the military would be lawful or unlawful depending on the exact proportion of the two uses and the relative harm it would impose on the civilian population weighed against the military value of denying power to the military.⁶³ The same would hold true for a cyber-attack against an oil refinery.\nThe combatant’s privilege provides immunity to military personnel who fight during an armed conflict: as long as their acts comply with the laws of war, the soldiers cannot be prosecuted by a foreign adversary in a domestic court. The privilege applies to members of armed forces and members of a militia who wear uniforms or a fixed emblem, carry arms openly, have a responsible command structure, and comply with the laws and customs of warfare. In the kinetic context, it is clear what this means. Soldiers should wear uniforms, carry their rifles openly, and comply with the laws of war. Members of the CIA or other civilian agencies who are deployed covertly, without the state acknowledging their link to the forces, are not entitled to the combatant’s privilege and could be prosecuted by the enemy upon capture. For a cyber-warrior working for the U.S. government, it is unclear how these requirements should translate.⁶⁴ In theory, the cyber-warrior should be wearing a uniform or fixed emblem, although there is little transparency gain from a hacker’s wearing a uniform as compared to the transparency gain from an infantry soldier wearing a uniform. The problem of remoteness is not unique to cyber-warriors, since missile operators or airmen might never be seen by the enemy either and the general assumption is that these service personnel should wear identifying emblems.\nWhat does it mean for a cyber-warrior to “carry arms openly”? This is genuinely unclear and it is doubtful that there is a nonquestion-begging answer to this question. Military cyber-operations are often unacknowledged in the sense that the U.S. government will not acknowledge its role in an offensive cyber-attack, nor does it release much information about defensive cyber-activities either. To comply with the requirements of carrying arms openly and wearing a fixed emblem, should\n⁶³ See Duncan B.

Arguably yes, if the analogy to tanks and airplanes is the appropriate analogy.\n## 3. ELECTION INTERFERENCE AND THE LAW OF WAR\nBased on the preceding analysis, it is clear that while election interference is certainly destructive, it is not destructive in the way contemplated by the law of war.⁶⁵ Consequently, politicians who refer to election interference as an “act of war” almost surely have the legal analysis wrong. Future National Security Advisor John Bolton referred to Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election as an act of war, a “casus belli” that Washington would not and should not accept, and argued that negotiating with Russia was dangerous.⁶⁶ Despite their disagreements over how to approach Russia (and their disagreements about Russian election interference), Trump would later appoint Bolton as National Security Advisor. Similarly, Sen. Richard Blumenthal stated: “This was an act of war, in my view.” Blumenthal continued: “I’ve said it in various hearings before this indictment. Interestingly enough the indictment refers to information warfare, that’s the term the Russians use.”⁶⁷ Nikki Haley, at the time US Ambassador to the United Nations, stated that “[w]hen a country can come and interfere in another country’s elections, that is warfare,” and she also described election interference as Russia’s “weapon” of choice in its conflict with the United States.⁶⁸ Former Vice President and Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney used similar language.⁶⁹ Many pundits and political observers referred to election interference as an act of war:\nCall it a different kind of war – asymmetric warfare, or whatever. But it is war. Whatever role Trump played in the attack, whatever he knew or didn’t know about\n⁶⁵ As noted above, if a cyber-attack produces physical destruction, it would be regulated by the laws of war. See Thomas C. Wingfield, International Law and Information Operations, in Franklin D. Kramer, Stuart H. Starr, and Larry K. Wentz (eds.), CYBERPOWER AND NATIONAL SECURITY (Potomac Books, 2009) 538 (noting that “[i]t should be immaterial whether a refinery was destroyed by a 2,000-pound bomb or by a line of malicious code in its pressure regulation subroutine; what did matter was the size of the hole left in the ground after the attack”).\n⁶⁶ John Bolton, Vladimir Putin Looked Trump in the Eye and Lied to Him; We Negotiate With Russia at Our Peril, THE TELEGRAPH (July 10, 2017).\n⁶⁷ Nicholas Rondinone, Blumenthal: Russian Interference is “Act of War,” HARTFORD COURANT (Feb. 24, 2018). Blumenthal also said that: “There was clearly indisputably Russian interference in our last election, an attack on our democracy. Some would regard it, and I believe as well, an act of war.” CNN, Interview with Senator, 2017 WLNR 26117365.\n⁶⁸ See, e.g., Associated Press, Trump UN Envoy: Russia’s Election Interference is “Warfare,” Associated Press (Oct. 19, 2017).\n⁶⁹ See Morgan Chalfant, Cheney: Russian Election Interference Could be “Act of War,” THE HILL (Mar. 27, 2017).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. Election Interference Is Not Cyber-War\nit previously, Russia took a hostile strike against this country. And it is, so far, winning.⁷⁰\nOr consider the statement from one Democratic lawmaker who said that he had “no doubt” that Russian interference constituted an act of war.⁷¹ Even John McCain referred to it as an act of war.⁷² Other politicians referred to the Russian interference as “hybrid warfare” – a category that evokes armed conflict but at least in some usages would be defined as falling below the level of armed conflict. For example, Secretary of Defense Ash Carter said that Russia interfered in “our democratic processes” with hybrid warfare, that is “interference in the internal affairs of nations, short of war.”⁷³\nMost scholars who have considered the issue have correctly analyzed that Russian interference falls outside the scope of armed conflict, though each has struggled to articulate a convincing framing device. For example, Herb Lin has stated that:\nIW/IO is a hostile non-kinetic activity, or at least an activity that is conducted between two parties whose interests are not well-aligned. At the same time, IW/IO is not warfare in the Clausewitzian sense (nor in any sense presently recognized under the laws of war or armed conflict); it is better characterized as hostile or adversarial psychological manipulation. IW/IO has connotations of soft power (more properly, a mix of soft power and sharp power): propaganda, persuasion, culture, social forces, confusion, deception.⁷⁴\nOthers have similarly concluded that the interference fell below the threshold of armed conflict.⁷⁵ Understood in this way, interference is extremely disruptive but not a subject for *jus in bello* regulation.⁷⁶\nOutsiders (non-lawyers) often assume that the law of war is designed to regulate every infringement of a state’s territorial or political integrity. But that is certainly not the case. The law of war is designed to regulate the use of force and the conduct of\n⁷⁰ Michelangelo Signorile, *Russia Committed An Act Of War And Trump Won’t Talk About It*, HUFFINGTON POST (July 16, 2018).\n⁷¹ *Dem Calls Russia Meddling “Act of War,” Urges Cyber Attack on Moscow Banks*, THE HILL (July 17, 2018) (quoting Rep.

Election Interference and the Law of War\n61\nhostilities – concepts which are internal to the concept of warfare. In theory, some types of cyber-attacks might fall under the regulation of the law of war, but most cases of election interference would not. The primary reason for this conclusion is that election interference rarely involves physical damage. In cases where data is destroyed, there is a case to be made that we should label such interference as an act of war. The erasure of the data could be accomplished by physically damaging election computers, or by simply erasing the data without physically destroying the hardware where it resides. In the case of a physical destruction, the election interference might be regulated by the law of war, but in all other cases, not.\nThe most salient examples of election interference involve either the theft and public release of private information or the posting of political views on social media platforms, often with the goal of disguising the true identity, and national origin, of the account holder. In the case of theft-and-release, a state might steal private information about a candidate – such as emails, text messages, private medical information, or confidential employment records from a human resources department – and release the damaging information to the public in order to favor a rival candidate.77 Some of the information might be real and some of the information might be doctored or otherwise misleading. In the case of the second example of election interference, the foreign state might create fake Facebook groups focusing on a particular issue or candidate, in order to drum up excitement for or against a particular candidate, or fake Twitter or Instagram accounts with the same goal in mind. Each of these activities involves foreign interference that arguably interferes with the political process and the political integrity of the target state, but neither involves the kind of physical destruction or territorial infringement that is the sine qua non of armed conflict.\nThere is a strong temptation to reduce all important issues of international law to questions of warfare. Armed conflict is a distinctive moment for international lawyers, full of peril, and the concept of warfare captures the imagination of nonlawyers. Often the critical question (does this conduct violate international law?) gets displaced by the simpler question (is the conduct a war crime?), without first considering whether war is the relevant paradigm or not. But international law is not reducible to the law of war. Public international law is so much richer than just rules regulating the use of force and the conduct of hostilities. We need to resist the temptation to put everything into a war framework. The distinct harm of election interference speaks to broader and more complex questions of political integrity that go well beyond the concept of armed conflict.\n77 The Tallinn Manual, supra note 27, at 55 concludes that “acts of cyber intelligence gathering and cyber theft, as well as cyber operations that involve brief or periodic interruption of non-essential cyber services, do not qualify as armed attacks.” It is unclear whether the experts considered the fact that a mere cyber theft, when used for the purpose of election interference, could have an enormous impact on the target state’s political process.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. Election Interference Is Not Cyber-War\nThat being said, it is important to recognize the impulse to analyze election interference through the war paradigm. The regulation of warfare is one of the great success stories of international law, because the discourse on warfare, both *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello*, has been wholeheartedly legalized. International lawyers discuss the rules of warfare with a precision that is almost scientific in nature. For a public grasping for certainty and legality, the law of war is an attractive horizon to steer towards. So, it is no wonder that people gravitate to the war paradigm given how successful international lawyers have been in occupying the field. But the war discussion crowds out alternative legal frameworks for understanding election interference, frameworks that focus on the political significance of elections and the way that foreign interference undermines the political integrity of the state.\nThe concept of “sovereignty” is one alternative framework.78 Clearly, a state’s violating the sovereignty of another state is illegal under some circumstances. So, it is intuitively plausible to suggest that election interference violates the sovereignty of the target state whose election is disputed, compromised, or influenced by the outside actor. The next chapter will explore “sovereignty” as a more salient legal category than armed conflict and examine both the benefits and the drawbacks of describing election interference in those terms. One noteworthy complication is the fact that the technical and doctrinal requirements for a legal infringement of sovereignty do not line up with common-sense intuitions about what counts as a violation of sovereignty. Consequently, many behaviors that sound as if they should count as sovereignty violations turn out to be perfectly legal – or at the very least contested – according to established doctrines of public international law. It also does not help that the concept of sovereignty is a cluster concept, housing diverse notions such as physical control over territory, control over a population, and expressions of a polity’s popular will. This produces a lot of cross-talking since not everyone means the same thing when they utter the word “sovereignty.”\nOne argument for focusing on sovereignty is that international law is much broader than the regulation of war. Just because election interference fails to qualify as an armed attack does not mean that the interference is lawful under international law. Similarly, even though election interference does not trigger a right of self-defense, international law might allow other responses to the interference. Under international law, a state is not required to simply suffer violations falling short of an armed attack. Victim states are entitled to use retorsions and countermeasures in an attempt to get the offending state to back off and cease the illegal behavior.\nCountermeasures and retorsions are united by the state’s intention behind their use, which is to induce the law-breaking state into compliance in the future. Countermeasures and retorsions differ in the legal status of the action used to induce\n78 See Michael N. Schmitt and Liis Vihul, *Respect for Sovereignty in Cyberspace*, 95 TEX. L. REV. 1659, 1647 (2017) (“Treating violations of sovereignty as a primary rule of international law, Tallinn Manual 2.0 seeks to add granularity to the circumstances in which a cyber operation might violate a State’s territorial sovereignty.”).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n3. Election Interference and the Law of War\n63\ncompliance. In the case of a countermeasure, the state that uses the countermeasure is engaging in conduct that is otherwise illegal; because the illegal conduct is used as a countermeasure to induce compliance, it becomes permissible. In contrast, a retorsion involves action that is already lawful and within the lawful discretion of the state. The classic example of a retorsion is recalling an ambassador, closing an embassy or breaking off diplomatic relations with a state. There is no requirement under international law for a state to have diplomatic relations with another state,79 and the state may recall an ambassador for any reason or no reason at all. Similarly, imagine that a state $a$ plans to sell missiles to state $b$, but becomes angry when state $b$ violates international law and refuses to sell the missiles. This would constitute a retorsion because state $a$ was under no obligation to sell the missiles in the first place.\nOf the two, countermeasures are the more controversial because they involve conduct that would otherwise be illegal. However, it should be noted that countermeasures should not include the use of military force, which are governed by the principles of self-defense. Although the issue is somewhat contested, the majority (and better) view is that the doctrine of countermeasures cannot be used as an exception to the requirements of *jus ad bellum*. If a state wishes to use military force, it needs either Security Council authorization or a defensive claim under article 51 of the UN Charter.\nAfter the Russian interference in the 2016 election, President Obama announced sanctions designed to punish the Russian government for election interference and related behavior, including Russian interference in Ukraine.80 For example, on April 1, 2015, President Obama issued an executive order declaring that “the increasing prevalence and severity of malicious cyber-enabled activities originating from, or directed by persons located, in whole or in substantial part, outside the United States constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.”81 On December 28, 2016, Obama amended the earlier executive order and ordered the Treasury Department to freeze the assets of individuals involved in Russian cyber-interference.82\n79 Of course, international law imposes certain restrictions on how ambassadors should be treated if a state is engaging in diplomatic relations with another state, but nothing requires the state to have the diplomatic relations in the first instance.\n80 Christina Lam, *A Slap on the Wrist: Combatting Russia’s Cyber Attack on the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election*, 59 B.C. L. Rev. 2167, 2201 (2018).\n81 See Exec. Order No. 13694, 80 Fed. Reg. 18,077 (Apr. 1, 2015).\n82 See Exec. Order No. 13757 (Dec. 28, 2016). The order was made pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1701, and the National Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1601. The executive order covered the following entities: Main Intelligence Directorate (a.k.a. GRU); Federal Security Service (a.k.a. FSB); Special Technology Center (a.k.a. STLC, Ltd. Special Technology Center St. Petersburg); Zorsecurity (a.k.a. Esage Lab); Autonomous Noncommercial Organization “Professional Association of Designers of Data Processing Systems” (a.k.a. ANO PO KSI). The order also included four Russian named individuals.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. Election Interference Is Not Cyber-War\nIn December 2016, the Obama administration also expelled thirty-five Russian diplomats who were described as members of Russian intelligence. In a related move, the Obama administration shut down two Russian diplomatic \"compounds\" that the administration claimed were being used for intelligence collection. Though these compounds were probably connected with domestic intelligence gathering rather than troll farm activity launched from St. Petersburg, the move to shut down the compounds was part of a general package of punitive actions against Moscow. In making this move, Obama stated:\nThese actions are not the sum total of our response to Russia's aggressive activities. We will continue to take a variety of actions at a time and place of our choosing, some of which will not be publicized. In addition to holding Russia accountable for what it has done, the United States and friends and allies around the world must work together to oppose Russia's efforts to undermine established international norms of behavior, and interfere with democratic governance. To that end, my Administration will be providing a report to Congress in the coming days about Russia's efforts to interfere in our election, as well as malicious cyber activity related to our election cycle in previous elections.[83]\nIn addition to these punitive actions, it is possible that the United States also engaged in classified or covert actions that were not publicly disclosed.[84] In particular, the United States reportedly launched a cyber-attack against the Russian government as a proportional countermeasure to the election interference.[85] But the United States was careful not to describe any of its responses as either countermeasures or retorsions. Although this refusal is somewhat perplexing, it may have been connected with Obama's general reluctance to declare Russian interference as \"illegal\" under international law.[86] Describing a punitive action as a countermeasure implies a conclusion both about the illegality of the offending conduct and also the illegality of the punitive measure under nonpunitive circumstances. The United States may have preferred to preserve maximum flexibility regarding its legal position on cyber-attacks. This may\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nConclusion\nhave contributed to the Obama Administration's relative silence on Russian interference in the 2016 election.⁸⁷\n# CONCLUSION\nRussia's interference in the 2016 election may have violated international law, but it was neither an act of war nor was it the opening salvo in a cyber-war between the United States and Russia. But this is not to diminish its significance, or even to diminish its illegality under both U.S. and international law. It may still be illegal, and the sooner that the public recognizes that it does not trigger a right of kinetic response under article 51 of the UN Charter, the sooner a more nuanced discussion can open up about the range of permissible responses under international law, such as retorsions and countermeasures outside the context of the use of force.⁸⁸ Political leaders have a range of options at their disposal but selecting among them requires consideration of the vast tools for enforcing international law beyond the use of force.\nTo recap the argument presented in this chapter: The principles governing *jus in bello* and *jus ad bellum* apply with equal force in the realm of cyber-attacks. A cyberattack that causes physical destruction may qualify as an armed attack triggering a right of self-defense under article 51 of the UN Charter, and a cyber-attack that causes physical destruction may constitute a resort to force that triggers the existence of an armed conflict and the application of IHL. But in the absence of physical destruction, cyber-attacks probably fall outside the scope of the laws of war.⁸⁹ Cyberwar is a real phenomenon, but in many cases, the \"war\" suffix is, legally speaking, a metaphor. In technical discussions, the term \"war\" is meant to convey the notion of an armed conflict pursued through sustained military engagements. In contrast, most cyber-attacks have more in common with the tools of statecraft than the tools of military science. Election interference falls in the category of statecraft, though it is important to remember that even statecraft is regulated by public international law.\n⁸⁷ See, e.g., Jack Crowe, *Rosenstein Calls Out Obama Admin For Failing to \"Publicize\" Russian Election Interference*, NATIONAL REVIEW (April 26, 2019).\n⁸⁸ In this sense, Brown is absolutely right when he concludes that \"[l]aw is a critical aspect of discussions about the cyber aspects of privacy rights, espionage, sovereignty, international norms of behavior, and more – but none of these things is within the realm of LOAC.\" Gary D. Brown, *International Law Applies to Cyber Warfare! Now What?*, 46 SW. L. REV. 355, 356 (2017).\n⁸⁹ See Prescott, *supra* note 1, at 48 (asserting that \"[b]elow the level of this use of force, cyber operations that result only in direct effects within cyberspace itself would not be considered uses of force regulated by LOAC, even though their indirect effects might have far-reaching and negative impacts upon the nation targeted.\"); Lubell, *supra* note 49, at 259 (concluding that \"[t]here can be plenty of cyber operations that occur outside the context of an armed conflict, such as certain types of cyber espionage between supposedly friendly countries to which the law of armed conflict would not apply\"). Lubell also argues that psychological operations (such as operations that have the goal of disseminating propaganda) \"are not considered to be ones that cause direct harm to the civilian population and, as such, can be excluded from certain restrictions placed on attacks.\" *Id.* at 263.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. Election Interference Is Not Cyber-War\nJust because a tool of statecraft falls below the legal threshold for armed conflict does not necessarily mean that the tool is part of a state's exclusive discretion, or what international lawyers sometimes call its domaine réservé.\nThe next two chapters focus on two competing frameworks for regulating cyber-election interference. Chapter 3 analyzes whether \"sovereignty\" is the correct concept, such that cyber interference might be viewed as an illegal infringement of a state's sovereignty. Among international lawyers, this is the \"preferred\" framework or the \"majority\" approach, though there are significant drawbacks to the approach, and I count myself as a dissenting voice. Then, Chapter 4 analyzes whether \"self-determination\" is a more promising framework, so that cyber interference might be viewed as a violation of a people's collective right of self-determination. This is an uncommon approach not yet adopted by public international lawyers, though they should give this approach a second look. In addition to being doctrinally salient, the concept of self-determination dovetails with our commonsense intuition that election interference is harmful because of its corrosive effect on the machinery of core democratic institutions.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press",

  "flat_text": "## INTRODUCTION\nHistorically, foreign election interference was accomplished through nondigital means. So, for example, a state might drop leaflets on a city urging the residents to take a particular action. Or, the state might broadcast messages over radio or other media. Or, the interfering state might make corrupt deals with local politicians or officials in ways that might constitute meddling. In today's world, however, these prosaic forms of interference have been replaced with their digital counterparts: the use of email hacking and fraudulent social media presence to influence the public and consequently interfere with an election. Because the method of election interference has shifted to the digital domain, there is a strong temptation to view the legality of election interference through the international legal rules governing cyber-attacks. In other words, one common assumption made by commentators is that election interference should be understood as a subcategory or particular instantiation of cyber-attacks. Although the international law governing cyber-activity is still emerging, the greatest clarity in that area stems from the international law regarding cyber-war. The majority view among international lawyers is that the regular rules governing kinetic warfare – that is, physical military movements – also apply to cyber-warfare. So, for example, an attack that would violate the law of war if conducted by planes and tanks would also violate the law of war if the same effects are produced by a cyber-attack launched by a team of hackers acting as state-cyber-combatants.\nWe will discuss this particular argument in greater detail below, but for the moment the key point is that there is a strong temptation to understand election\n For an expression of this point of view, see Jody M.

L.J. 42, 47 (2014) (“As nations move toward securing the means to conduct cyber conflict that begins to approach our common understandings of war, a consensus appears to be emerging among international organizations concerned with the implementation of LOAC, and in academia, that LOAC at least applies to those actions in cyberspace that either result in, or are intended to result in, injury to humans and damage to geophysical things.”).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\ninterference through the lens of cyber-war. In other words, some would condemn election interference as illegal under international law because it represents a form of cyber-warfare. Other lawyers and politicians will argue the opposite: that election interference does not violate international law because it does not rise to the level of a cyber-war, as if this is the end of the matter in terms of the legal analysis. What unites these two competing conclusions is the assumption that cyber-warfare is the correct framework for judging the legality of election interference. That assumption is profoundly mistaken.\nThis chapter will explain why the assumption is mistaken and why the cyber-war framework is unhelpful. Although international law is a broad and sweeping body of law, the legal regulation of warfare is one of the most prominent and successful subdisciplines of international law. So, perhaps it is not surprising that lawyers should jump to cyber-war as an attractive framing device. But the framing device is poor and sucks up oxygen from other more compelling frameworks that international law has to offer.\nIn order to explain why cyber-war is a poor fit for understanding election interference, this chapter will first explain the basic principles behind the legal regulation of warfare. Then, in Section 2, this chapter will explain how these principles apply in the context of cyber-attacks. Finally, Section 3 will consider the specific case of election interference to show why it does not constitute an illegal cyber-attack in violation of the law of war. But just because it does not violate the rules regarding cyber-war does not mean that it might not violate some other area of international law. The field of international law is at once broader and deeper than the legal regulation of armed conflict. But only by first pushing aside the most obvious framing device can we move toward more compelling and innovative frameworks for understanding the particular harm posed by foreign election interference. This argument will unfold over the course of the subsequent chapters.\n## INTERNATIONAL REGULATION OF WARFARE\n### The Distinction Between Jus ad Bellum and Jus in Bello\nThe international legal regulation of warfare is based on the foundational distinction between jus ad bellum and jus in bello -- terms that originate with the Just War philosophical tradition. Jus ad bellum regulates the recourse to force, that is, the decision to go to war in the first place. With very few exceptions, states are mostly prohibited from using military force to settle international disputes, but in some situations, the recourse to military force might be justified. In contrast, jus in bello regulates the conduct of hostilities during an armed conflict. So, for example, jus in bello passes judgment on the tactics used during an armed conflict, such as who can be targeted, in what\n2. Election Interference Is Not Cyber-War\ncircumstances, and with what weapons. For example, one of the cardinal rules of *jus in bello* is the rule prohibiting collateral damage that is excessive or disproportionate to the value of the military target. One way of explaining the distinction between *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* is that the former covers macro-questions regarding the legality of the overall war, while the latter covers micro-questions regarding the conduct of individual military operations within that war.\nThe legal domains of *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* are legally and conceptually independent, in the sense that a *jus in bello* analysis does not depend on the outcome of the *jus ad bellum* analysis. In other words, both the aggressor state and the victim state are required to follow the same rules regarding the conduct of warfare. The victim state is not entitled to more liberal rules for the conduct of warfare, just because the victim state is on the receiving end of a *jus ad bellum* violation. Conversely, the aggressor state is not subject to more restrictive conduct rules just because the aggressor state has violated *jus ad bellum* principles. In the conduct of cyber-war, this means that whether a state has violated *jus ad bellum* or not is irrelevant to the question of how the rules of *jus in bello* are applied in the context of cyber-attacks. It is important to keep the macro-level and micro-level questions separate.\nThere has been a recent trend in the philosophical literature to question the canonical separation between *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* principles. These “revisionist just war” arguments have pushed back against the classical Just War Tradition, which always assumed that the *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* domains were conceptually distinct. Under the revisionist line of thinking, philosophers have suggested that, for example, noncombatants on the victim side should be entitled to fight back against an unjust aggression, whereas under the traditional view, noncombatants are prohibited from participating in hostilities and are therefore not entitled to the combatant’s privilege. Part of the inspiration for the revisionist trend is that the ethical rules regarding killing should be the same for individuals as they are for groups. In other words, the revisionist camp aims to\n See GARY SOLIS, THE LAW OF ARMED CONFLICT 7–8 (2nd edn., Cambridge University Press, 2016) (noting that: “All’s fair in love and war? Hardly!

International Regulation of Warfare\n\nWhatever one thinks about the philosophical legitimacy of these revisionist arguments, even the philosophers do not contend that their arguments are currently represented in international legal doctrine. The revisionist just war philosophers are making arguments about the deep morality of warfare and even some of them concede that there might be legitimate institutional or pragmatic reasons why international law separates *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* into conceptually distinct normative regimes. For example, it might be unworkable to assign to each soldier and to each civilian the task of determining whether a military invasion is justified under *jus ad bellum* before they decide how they should behave. So, the virtue of the current legal regime is that soldiers and civilians alike can fight (or not fight) in a war without having to adjudicate the contentious *jus ad bellum* questions. Whether this separation is consistent with the “deep morality” of warfare or not, it certainly makes life for the professional solider (on both sides) more workable and represents the current state of the legal regulation of warfare. It may even be morally justified as an instrumental matter, because separating the two domains might service the legitimate goal of designing real-world institutions that ensure compliance with rules that are a second-best alternative to the deep morality of war.\n## B. The Basic Rules Regarding Jus ad Bellum\nThe rules regarding *jus ad bellum* are relatively straightforward to articulate, although they are contentious when it comes to their *application*. The use of military force by one state against another state is only justified if taken in self-defense or in accordance with a Security Council authorization. Article 2(4) of the UN Charter prohibits the use of military force for the resolution of international disputes, but article 51 of the UN Charter carves out cases of self-defense from the basic article 2(4) prohibition. Article 51 imposes various requirements for the exercise of self-defense, including the existence of an armed attack against the victim\n *Id.* at 208 (“There are compelling reasons why the laws of war cannot treat the use of violence by Unjust Combatants as criminal.”).\n *Id.* at 208.\n See Janina Dill, *Should International Law Ensure the Moral Acceptability of War?*, 26 LEIDEN J. INT’L. L. 253–70 (2013).\n Article 2(4) of the UN Charter states: “All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.” Article 51 states that “Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. Measures taken by Members in the exercise of\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. Election Interference Is Not Cyber-War\nstate, and a requirement that the Security Council be informed if a state is exercising its legal right of self-defense. Although not explicitly articulated in the text of article 51, international law also imposes additional constraints, including requirements of imminence, necessity, and proportionality. The former requires that the armed attack against the victim state be imminent at the point in time when the victim state uses military force to repel the threat. The latter requirement requires that the defensive force be necessary to stop the threat; if nonmilitary measures are available to resolve the threat, the resort to defensive force is illegitimate (because it is unnecessary at the point in time when it is exercised). Any military response to an attack, undertaken in self-defense pursuant to article 51, would be constrained by the principle of proportionality, meaning that the defensive force must not be disproportionate to the legitimate interest being vindicated by the defensive force.\nThe Security Council is entitled under Chapter VII of the UN Charter to issue a binding resolution calling on member states to use military force to resolve a threat of or breach of international peace and security. Member states are not required to use military force in that situation, but they are permitted to do so; the Security Council resolution transforms what would otherwise potentially be a violation of article 2(4) into a lawful police action to enforce international law. The Security Council is therefore a clearinghouse for decisions regarding the lawfulness of military force, although individual states retain the \"inherent\" right to exercise defensive force even in situations where the Security Council fails to act to authorize military force. The Security Council may also authorize nonmilitary measures under article 41 of the UN Charter. The right to unilateral defense force is particularly important since the Security Council includes five permanent members (China, France, Russia, United States, United Kingdom), each of whom enjoys a veto, that is, the right to veto any resolution coming out of the Security Council.\nthis right of self-defence shall be immediately reported to the Security Council and shall not in any way affect the authority and responsibility of the Security Council under the present Charter to take at any time such action as it deems necessary in order to maintain or restore international peace and security.\"\n For a discussion of these requirements, see generally YORAM DINSTEIN, WAR, AGGRESSION, AND SELF-DEFENSE (Cambridge University Press, 2012).\n For a discussion of the proportionality requirement, see generally MICHAEL A. NEWTON AND LARRY MAY, PROPORTIONALITY IN INTERNATIONAL LAW (Oxford University Press, 2014).\n See art. 42 (\"Should the Security Council consider that measures provided for in Article 41 would be inadequate or have proved to be inadequate, it may take such action by air, sea, or land forces as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security.

International Regulation of Warfare\n\n## C. The Basic Rules Regarding Jus in Bello\nThe rules regarding the conduct of warfare are expressed in major treaty conventions such as the four post-World War II Geneva Conventions, two additional protocols to the Geneva Conventions from 1977, and the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907. These treaty sources can be combined with rules of customary international law that equally regulate the conduct of hostilities. The rules regarding the conduct of warfare can be broadly fit into the following categories: targeting, participation in hostilities, tactics in warfare, and weaponry.\nFor example, the bedrock principle of *jus in bello* is that attacking forces should limit their attacks to enemy combatants, that is, members of enemy military forces or other militia units that meet the requirements of combatancy. Attacking forces are also entitled to attack civilians for such time as those civilians are directly participating in hostilities. It would be incongruous if a state could avoid its nationals being targeted simply by refusing to organize itself into formal military units, hence the exceptional rule that allows targeting of civilians who directly participate in hostilities. Despite this cardinal rule of distinction, civilians may be killed but only as collateral damage. By the phrase “collateral damage,” the law means that the civilians were not the object of the attack but were killed as a side effect of an attack on a lawful military objective such as a military asset or military personnel. So the difference between a violation of the principle of distinction and a case of permissible collateral damage is the attitude of the attacker. If the attacker is aiming at the civilian, the attacker has violated the principle of distinction. On the other hand, if the attacker is aiming at a lawful military objective, but still kills a civilian or a group of civilians, the civilians are considered collateral damage. The attacking force may even envision the civilian deaths, and they should still be counted as collateral damage. However, the *jus in bello* imposes a major constraint on the existence of collateral damage by prohibiting collateral\n This rule is codified in article 51(3) of Additional Protocol I (API) to the General Conventions: “Civilians shall enjoy the protection afforded by this Section, unless and for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities.”\n The principle of distinction is also sometimes referred to as the principle of discrimination. The two are roughly synonymous, though the word “distinction” is more often used by lawyers and “discrimination” is more common among philosophers of war.\n Solis dates the term “collateral damage” to the 1991 Gulf War. See SOLIS, *supra* note 2, at 295; SAHR CONWAY-LANZ, *COLLATERAL DAMAGE* 221 (Routledge, 2006).\n The question of mental intent in the context of collateral damage is somewhat complicated and has produced a series of unfortunate statements from international courts. For a discussion of this issue, see Jens David Ohlin, *Targeting and the Concept of Intent*, 35 MICH. J. INT’L L. 79 (2013).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. Election Interference Is Not Cyber-War\ndamage that is disproportionate or “excessive” to the anticipated value of the military advantage that will be gained from destroying the military target.\nThe *jus in bello* also outlaws particular tactics. Killing by perfidy is outlawed, such as pretending to be a civilian to draw out the enemy or waiving a white flag and pretending to surrender, only to kill the enemy during an ambush. These are “dishonest stratagems” as Kant called them, and impermissible as far back as the Lieber Code. Similarly, the *jus in bello* prohibits tactics that increase the suffering of the enemy (*maux superflus*) but do not produce any additional military benefit. So, in other words, it would be illegal to use a weapon that does not increase lethality but only increases the pain that the enemy will suffer before dying. Similarly, particular weapons may be outlawed by particular treaties or conventions, such as nuclear weapons (for some states that have signed nonproliferation accords), chemical weapons, cluster munitions, and landmines, though in each of these cases (other than chemical weapons) several states have refused to sign on to the conventions because they consider the weapon system in question to be necessary for strategic interests. Finally, attacking forces are not permitted to attack soldiers who are *hors de combat* because they are sick or because they have effectively communicated their surrender. Consequently, summarily executing a group of POWs (without legal process or criminal culpability) would constitute a war crime.\nThe basic structure behind the *jus in bello* is to create a special “war convention,” as Michael Walzer once described it. It creates, in other words, a special framework for the conduct of hostilities. Lawful combatants are granted the combatant’s privilege: in exchange for opening themselves up to the reciprocal risk of killing, combatants may not be prosecuted by the enemy for lawful acts of belligerency. In exchange, combatants are required to limit their attacks to military objects, thus sparing civilians from the burdens of war, as much as possible as would be consistent with the need to pursue the war effort (banning collateral damage entirely would effectively hamper warfare entirely). The requirement to carry arms openly and to avoid perfidious killing – among other prohibitions – install a basic notion of transparency in the law of war. Combatants do not simply fight for themselves as if they were fighting in a duel. Rather, combatants are representatives of the state, killing on the state’s behalf, and therefore combatants and the state “advance and retrograde” together on the field of battle, in Lieber’s\n See API, art. 51(5) (“Among others, the following types of attacks are to be considered as indiscriminate . . . (b) an attack which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.”).\n See API, art. 37(1) (“It is prohibited to kill, injure or capture an adversary by resort to perfidy. Acts inviting the confidence of an adversary to lead him to believe that he is entitled to, or is obliged to accord, protection under the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, with intent to betray that confidence, shall constitute perfidy . . .”).\n However, it should be noted that “ruses of war are not prohibited.” See API, art. 37(2).\n API, art. 35(2) (“2. It is prohibited to employ weapons, projectiles and material and methods of warfare of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering.”).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. The Emerging Consensus on Cyber-War\nfamous phrase. None of that would be possible without a basic principle of transparency in the application of *jus in bello*, which requires for its operation a tangible and public connection between individual combatants and the state on whose behalf they fight.\n## 2. THE EMERGING CONSENSUS ON CYBER-WAR\nThe last few years have witnessed a tremendous acceleration of work applying the law of war to the context of cyber-attacks. That being said, there is some uncertainty over the application of core law of war principles to cyber-space. There are several reasons for the uncertainty. The first is that there has been little diplomatic effort to codify specific international rules for cyber-attacks. One reason for the reluctance is that many lawyers believe that existing rules of IHL are adequate to the task of regulating state behavior in cyber-space. Second, some states want to preserve flexibility for their operations conducted in the cyber-realm. Third, the secretive nature of cyber-activities hampers the formation of customary rules. Customary international law develops out of state practice (action) and *opinio juris* (performing the legal action from a sense of legal obligation). But many cyber-attacks are conducted in secret, either covertly or clandestinely, and states often refuse to acknowledge their involvement in cyber-attacks. Other states will sometimes criticize those attacks, but in other situations the difficulty with “attribution” will hamper those public criticisms, thus leading to more private criticism through diplomatic channels. This dynamic scuttles or limits the formation of customary norms. However, despite these limitations, international lawyers have worked hard to explain, through soft-law mechanisms, how the law of war applies in cyber-space. One result of this effort, the Tallinn Manual, brought together experts on cyber-law and sought feedback from state governments.\nThis section outlines the state of international law regarding cyber-war: subsection A focuses on the role of the Tallinn Manual in constructing these norms; subsection B on whether cyber-wars are armed conflicts under international law; subsection C on the armed attack requirement for self-defense; and subsection D on the application of *jus in bello* principles to cyber-attacks.\n Lieber Code, art. 20 (“Public war is a state of armed hostility between sovereign nations or governments. It is a law and requisite of civilized existence that men live in political, continuous societies, forming organized units, called states or nations, whose constituents bear, enjoy, suffer, advance and retrograde together, in peace and in war.”).\n See Delbert Tran, *The Law of Attribution: Rules for Attributing the Source of A Cyber-Attack*, 20 YALE J. L. &amp; TECH. 376, 386 (2018) (noting that the “difficulty in tracing the source of a cyber-attack has long plagued discussions of cybersecurity, and much of current scholarship has accepted the traditional wisdom that the technological architecture of the internet makes attribution an exceedingly difficult problem”); Collin S. Allan, *Attribution Issues in Cyberspace*, 13 CHI.-KENT J. INT’L &amp; COMP. L. 55 (2013).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. Election Interference Is Not Cyber-War\n## A. The Role of the Tallinn Manual\nThe Tallinn Manual was initiated by the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, which is located in Tallinn, Estonia. The initiative involved a collaboration of international law and military law experts from across the world, followed by consultation and feedback from governments and their legal advisors. Although the Tallinn Manual is not a source of international law per se, it is relevant to the state of international law for two reasons. First, it may help in the formation of customary international law, as states gravitate towards particular statements of customary rules and norms, providing expression of legal rules for states to either accept or reject through the process of *opinio juris*. Second, the Tallinn Manual is a semi-authoritative statement of how experts believe that the existing law can and should be applied in cyber-space. If there is no need to amend or create new law, but simply a need to apply existing law to activities in cyber-space, then there is no requirement that the application be guided by the stringent rules for the creation of international law.\nThe Tallinn Manual focused on a variety of legal questions, including the applicability of *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* principles to cyber-attacks, and the use of countermeasures to thwart cyber-attacks. Also, the Tallinn Manual discusses violations of sovereignty that fall below the “armed attack” threshold – violations that will be the focus of the next chapter of this book.\n## B. Are Cyber-Wars Real Wars As a Matter of International Law?\nThe first threshold question is whether a cyber-war is a real “war” in the legal sense of that term as used by international lawyers. The answer to that question is yes, depending on the type of damage produced by the conflict, though this answer is a bit controversial. Some legal scholars argue that defining cyber-wars as real “armed conflicts” only functions to give state militaries control over cyber-infrastructure and cyber-governance – questions that necessarily impact civilian life and which ought not to be exclusively managed by state militaries. There is\n See TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE (Michael N. Schmitt et al. (eds.), 2013) [hereinafter cited as “Tallinn Manual”].\n The strictly defined sources of international law are generally outlined in article 38 of the ICJ Statute.\n For our purposes, the Tallinn Manual sections on cyber-war are the most relevant to our analysis.\n For example, the philosopher Larry May has argued that cyber-wars should not be understood as real “armed conflicts” in the way that international lawyers use that term. See Larry May, The Nature of War and the Idea of “Cyberwar,” in Ohlin et al. (eds.), CYBER WAR: LAW AND ETHICS FOR VIRTUAL CONFLICTS 3 (Oxford University Press, 2015) (suggesting that one could look at cyber-attacks as more like embargoes than as armed conflicts).\n See Mary Ellen O’Connell, *Cyber Security without Cyber War*, 17 J. CONFLICT &amp; SEC. L. 187, 209 (2012) (“To date, the problem of Internet security has been the domain of international law scholars with expertise in use of force questions. They have sent the message that the Internet may be protected through military force or the threat of military force, analogizing to Cold War deterrence strategy.”\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. The Emerging Consensus on Cyber-War\nwisdom in this criticism, though it is also the case that some cyber-wars should be considered significant enough to qualify as an armed conflict if they result in physical damage.\nIn terms of the application of international law, there is a widely shared definition for what counts as an armed conflict. International lawyers generally distinguish between international armed conflicts (IACs) between states, and noninternational armed conflicts (NIACs) between a state and a nonstate actor or between two nonstate actors. An IAC is triggered when there is a resort to \"armed force\" by one state against another state.[32] The standard view, though it is not codified in any treaty, is that there is no intensity threshold for this determination. In other words, an IAC exists between two states when one state uses military force against the other, regardless of how much force is used, or for how long it lasts. An IAC might involve a one-time airstrike by one state's air force, bombing targets in the other state, or the IAC might involve a full-scale land invasion that lasts for months or even years.[33] Either way, military force is traditionally thought of as involving some kinetic activity – the crossing of a border with a military asset, or the use of a confederate to destroy installations or buildings within the target state. It is very hard to think of an international armed conflict being triggered without either a border crossing or some physical destruction of at least some kind.\nIn contrast, a NIAC requires the existence of violent hostilities between a state and a nonstate actor that reaches a certain level of scope and intensity. So, for example, the state's use of physical force against a nonstate actor, such as a group of rebels, might not constitute an armed conflict if the state simply fires a few shots and arrests the members of the rebel organization. However, if there are sustained hostilities between the state and the nonstate actor that pass a certain threshold, the situation\nGovernments have followed this modelling, pouring resources into the military for keeping the Internet safe and for taking advantage of what it offers to attack opponents. Doing so has required strained analogies of cyber-attacks to conventional kinetic attacks. The Internet is now far less secure than before there was a Cyber Command or a NATO CCDCOE. It is time, therefore, to turn to cyber disarmament and a focus on peaceful protection of the Internet.\"). See also Christopher J. Finlay, Just War, Cyber War, and the Concept of Violence, 31 PHILOSOPHY &amp; TECHNOLOGY 357-77 (2018) (preferring to conceptualize cyber-attacks under the broader rubric of \"violence\" instead of \"war\"); Ryan Patterson, Silencing the Call to Arms: A Shift Away from Cyber Attacks As Warfare, 48 LOY. L. A.L. REV. 969, 975 (2015) (arguing that \"alternate legal regimes, including domestic law enforcement and the international principle of non-interference, may prove more effective frameworks to govern malicious cyber activities\").

STUD. 276, 283 (2013) (\"There is nothing extraordinary in cyber warfare: it is just ordinary warfare with a little bit of extra. Cyber warfare does not merely resemble other forms of warfare: it is warfare. As such, it is directly governed by the jus in bello.\").\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. Election Interference Is Not Cyber-War\nmight graduate from a law enforcement operation to a full-blown NIAC that triggers the application of IHL rules (at least the rules that apply during a NIAC).\nAssuming that these articulations are correct statements about the international legal threshold for armed conflict, most cyber-attacks will not rise to the level of an armed conflict. Although the standard for the creation of an armed conflict is more liberal for international conflicts (IACs) than internal ones (NIACs), because the standard allows any use of force, it is unclear whether a cyber-attack would constitute a “use of force” against another state. On this question there is not universal agreement. At first blush, one can distinguish between three examples of cyber-attacks. In the first, one state uses a cyber-attack to cause damage or to destroy a physical building in the target state. For example, the state uses a cyber-attack to cause an electrical power station to overheat, resulting in an explosion and fire that destroys the power station. The second example would be a cyber-attack that is launched against a computer system in the target state, resulting in the physical destruction of the computer system but no other physical destruction. The third example would be a cyber-attack that penetrates a foreign computer system, resulting in the theft or destruction of information but no physical damage, not even physical damage to the computer system.\nAlthough experts are divided on some of these questions, there is widespread agreement that the first example would constitute a use of force that would trigger the existence of an armed conflict. In that case, a cyber-war would be a “war” in the sense of an “armed conflict” as international lawyers use the term. As the Tallinn Manual stated in its Rule 11, “A cyber operation constitutes a use force when its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force.” In making this determination, international lawyers sometimes look at the “scale and effects” of the force to determine whether it crosses the relevant threshold. In determining whether a cyber-attack constitutes a use of force, the Tallinn Manual suggests looking at the following criteria: severity, immediacy,\n Although customary international law arguably imposes the same (or similar) rules of conduct in both types of armed conflict, major treaties regulating *jus in bello* impose different legal regimes in each type of conflict. For example, the full Geneva Conventions apply during IACs, whereas only one article of the Geneva Conventions – Common article 3 – applies during NIACs.\n Solis, one of the leading American experts on the law of war, describes the standard in the following terms: “A cyber attack, as opposed to a cyber intrusion, constitutes a ‘use of force’ if undertaken by a state’s armed forces, intelligence services, or a private contractor whose conduct is attributable to the state, and its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations that rise to a level of a use of force.” Gary D. Solis, *Cyber Warfare*, 219 MIL. L. REV. 1, 15 (2014).\n Tallinn Manual, *supra* note 27, at 45.\n *Id.* at 46 (noting that “scale and effects” is a shorthand term that captures the quantitative and qualitative factors to be analysed in determining whether a cyber operation qualifies as a use of force”). The use of the “scale and effects” language in the Tallinn Manual is a bit unfortunate because it confuses the ICJ standard for armed attack within the context of self-defense for the standard for determining whether something counts as a use of force, despite the fact that the Tallinn Manual concedes that the definitions for a “use of force” and an “armed attack” are designed to “serve different normative purposes.” *Id.* at 52. That being said, the confusion is not important,\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. The Emerging Consensus on Cyber-War\n\nThe second and third examples are more complicated. Some international lawyers would consider the second example a use of force because it involved the physical destruction of a computer system. The third example is the most difficult, because many lawyers would consider the loss or theft of information to be insufficient to count as a use of force under international law. A small minority of lawyers are more liberal in their interpretation of what counts as a use of force. However, it would seem that the majority has the better of the argument, because it is hard to understand how the mere theft of information could constitute an armed attack. Indeed, it seems to be theft or destruction of information, rather than an armed attack. One might argue that the concept of an armed attack should be amended in today's world of cyber-threats, but indeed the whole point of using this legal trigger is to declare the existence of an armed conflict and trigger the application of IHL, and it is unclear how anything would be improved by triggering the application of IHL every time there is a cross-border cyber-attack. Indeed, one should remember that IHL has both a regulating and licensing function, in that it allows privileged (i.e. lawful) combatants to kill each other with personal legal immunity. So, there are some costs to the application of IHL, and placing states in a constant state of armed conflict simply because of a cyber-attack would do little to resolve international disputes peacefully.\nIn practical terms, what this means for election interference is that most cases of cyber-election interference will not trigger the existence of an armed conflict under international law. If state agents seek to influence an election by surreptitiously posting messages on social media, even if in doing so they pretend to be American citizens, this hardly seems like a \"use of force\" in the military sense of that term. Even if a state uses a cyber-attack to hack election results and change vote tallies, this clearly constitutes a substantial intrusion in the political integrity of another state, though again it is hard to qualify it as a use of force. The changing of the vote tallies would alter – arguably destroy – the legitimacy of the election results, but the problem is that international law views the concept of the use of force through a military lens, while in this case the harm seems decidedly political rather than military.\nbecause all parties agree that a cyber operation can, in theory, constitute a use of force under international law.\n Id. at 48–52 (but noting that the factors are not exhaustive and that \"States may look to others, such as the prevailing political environment, whether the cyber operation portends the future use of military force, the identity of the attacker, any record of cyber operations by the attacker, and the nature of the target (such as critical infrastructure)\").\n Id. at 52 (Rule 12: \"A cyber operation, or threatened cyber operation, constitutes an unlawful threat of force when the threatened action, if carried out, would be an unlawful use of force.\").\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nIn drawing this conclusion, we need to postpone the more general question of whether such interference violates another body of international law and focus for the moment on the narrower question of whether the “war” paradigm is the right way for understanding information operations aimed at undermining the legitimacy of an election. Based on the analysis in this chapter, it is quite clear that the war paradigm is deficient.\nThe one situation where there might be an argument for classifying election interference as a use of force is if the cyber-attack does more than simply penetrate election infrastructure but actually physically destroys it. So, for example, if a state were to launch a cyber-attack that caused election machines to overheat and become inoperable, there is an argument that such a cyber-attack might constitute a use of force. Or, similarly, if a cyber-attack causes the electrical system at a state board of elections to overheat and cause a fire, this too would create the physical manifestation necessary to constitute a use of force. But if the election interference of 2016 has taught us anything, it is that the most potent forms of interference involve no physical damage at all. The target of this interference is not physical locations or the lives of military or civilian personnel; the target is democratic institutions through the strategic deployment of misinformation. Social media campaigns designed to influence an election are not acts of war, though this conclusion should not blind us to the threat they pose to democratic systems. We will need to leave to the next two chapters whether international law has an alternative paradigm to describe the harm caused by these cyber-attacks.\n### C. The Armed Attack Requirement for Self-Defense\nThe prior subsection focused exclusively on the triggering conditions for the existence of an armed conflict (and hence the applicability of IHL). A distinct but related question is what constitutes an “armed attack” under article 51 of the UN Charter. The existence of an armed attack is a condition for the target being permitted to exercise lethal force in response as a defensive measure. It is important to remember that not every violation of international law triggers a right of self-defense in response. Some violations, when they rise to the level of an armed attack, are considered sufficiently serious that the victim state is entitled to unilaterally exercise defensive force even in the absence of Security Council authorization.\nThe armed attack requirement is not subject to the same intensity requirements as required by the use of force analysis by IHL in the context of a NIAC. However, given the similarities between the two tests, international lawyers have generally assumed that an armed attack for purposes of article 51 requires some physical destruction. In the Nicaragua opinion, the ICJ argued that an attack must meet a “scale and effects” criterion in order to qualify as an armed attack -- a standard that has had enormous influence in contemporary international legal and diplomatic practice. The Tallinn Manual endorses the “scale and effects” standard in the\n2. The Emerging Consensus on Cyber-War\ncontext of self-defense, though it concedes that even before the complication of cyber-attacks is added to the mix, the standard is somewhat vague and requires contentious application. Governments likely support an “effects” test for evaluating a cyber-attack because it preserves maximum flexibility for using offensive cyber-attacks in many situations that fall below the relevant “effects” threshold.\nConsequently, a cyber-attack in some circumstances could qualify as an armed attack that triggers the inherent right to self-defense article in article 51. The destruction must be foreseeable but it need not be immediate. For example, if a cyber-attack produces death or physical destruction, even if that consequence is a “downstream” consequence, it might still qualify as an armed attack, as long as the resulting destruction is a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the cyber-attack. One notable example is a cyber-attack against a water-filtration plant that prevents the target state from maintaining the quality of its water-supply; if civilians ultimately get sick or die, even if that occurs weeks or months after the original cyber-attack, this could qualify as an armed attack for purposes of article 51.\nIf a military – that is, kinetic – response is going to be authorized by international law, it makes sense to have a demanding trigger. Consequently, the majority of experts who worked on the Tallinn Manual concluded that an armed attack requires an actual or imminent territorial infringement that will cause physical damage to persons or things. The imminence requirement is a preexisting element of the\n Id. at 55 (concluding that “the parameters of the scale and effects criteria remain unsettled beyond the indication that they need to be grave”).\n See Matthew C. Waxman, Cyber-Attacks and the Use of Force: Back to the Future of Article 2(4), 36 YALE J. INT’L L. 421, 434–5 (2011) (concluding that “the U.S. government probably prefers an effects- or consequences-based interpretation of ‘force’ or ‘armed attack’ with respect to cyber-attacks not only for what it includes (and therefore what the Charter prohibits and what could trigger self-defense rights), but also for what it excludes. Computer-based espionage, intelligence collection, or even some preemptive cyber-operations or countermeasures designed to disable an adversary’s threatening capabilities, for example, would generally not constitute prohibited force because these activities do not produce destructive consequences analogous to a kinetic military attack”).\n Tallinn Manual, supra note 27, at 54 (“The International Group of Experts unanimously concluded that some cyber operations may be sufficiently grave to warrant classifying them as an ‘armed attack’ within the meaning of the Charter.”).\n See Michael Gervais, Cyber Attacks and the Laws of War, 30 BERKELEY J. INT’L L. 525, 538 (2012) (noting that “[c]yber attacks do not always intentionally target the critical infrastructure that they eventually disrupt”). For another defense of the “reasonably foreseeable” standard in this context, see Michael N. Schmitt, Computer Network Attack and the Use of Force in International Law: Thoughts on a Normative Framework, 37 COLUM. J. TRANSNAT’L. L. 885, 916 (1999) (arguing that “the nature of the act’s reasonably foreseeable consequences would be assessed to determine whether they resemble those of armed coercion”).\n However, it is certainly true that “it is very difficult from a practical standpoint to predict whether a cyber attack will lead to kinetic harm or not.” See Stephen Petkis, Rethinking Proportionality in the Cyber Context, 47 GEO. J. INT’L L. 1431, 1449 (2016).\n This example is explored in the Tallinn Manual, supra note 27, at 57.\n Tallinn Manual, supra note 27, at 54 (Rule 13: “A state that is the target of a cyber operation that rises to the level of an armed attack may exercise its inherent right of self-defense. Whether a cyber operation constitutes an armed attack depends on its scale and effects.”).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. Election Interference Is Not Cyber-War\ninternational legal doctrine on self-defense, though how imminence should be understood for a cyber-attack is more difficult than its kinetic analog. For example, an imminent military attack might be manifested in the form of air, sea, and land forces moving into position to launch a strike or invasion. The public nature of these deployments ensures that the imminent requirement can be transparently evaluated by the court of world opinion. But a cyber-attack that is brewing would not be manifested in the same public manner, because the preparatory works would most likely be private, secret, or unknown.\nThe physical damage could be caused by a physical attack or by a cyber-attack, but the resulting damage must be physical in nature. The experts concluded that “it is not the nature (injurious or destructive) of the consequences that matters, but rather the extent of the ensuing effects.” However, it should be noted that a minority of scholars working on the Tallinn Manual concluded that a cyber-attack that destroys “data,” even if it fails to destroy the computer system that houses the data, might in some circumstances constitute an armed attack. A cyber-attack that disrupts the stock exchange and causes financial damage would not produce the requisite physical damage to be considered an armed attack, though there is disagreement on this question, with a minority of scholars suggesting that the negative consequences flowing from such an attack might meet the requirements for an armed attack. Presumably, those scholars who view the “catastrophic effects” of a cyber-attack against a stock market as enough to qualify as an armed attack might also be\n However, some scholars have disputed that cyber-attacks can never be identified when they are still in the imminence window. See Ryan J. Hayward, *Evaluating the “Imminence” of A Cyber Attack for Purposes of Anticipatory Self-Defense*, 117 COLUM. L. REV. 399, 419 (2017) (concluding that “there is ample evidence to believe that investments over the past several years have dramatically improved the United States’ monitoring abilities in this arena”). The Tallinn Manual argues that the right to self-defense in response to an offensive cyber armed attack is limited by two temporal limitations. First, the original cyber-attack must have occurred or must be imminent. Second, the defensive response must be immediately necessary to counter the threat. See Tallinn Manual, *supra* note 27, at 64–5. This second immediacy requirement is especially important in cases of anticipatory self-defense.\n See Herbert S. Lin, *Offensive Cyber Operations and the Use of Force*, 4 J. NAT’L SECURITY L. &amp; POL’Y 63, 73 (2010) (suggesting that “effects rather than the modality of an action are the appropriate starting point for understanding how jus ad bellum and the U.N. Charter apply to offensive cyber operations” and concluding that “[e]ffects-based analysis suggests that the ambiguities are fewest when cyber attacks cause physical damage to property and loss of life in ways that are comparable to kinetic attacks and traditional war, because traditional LOAC provides various relevant precedents and analogies”).\n Tallinn Manual, *supra* note 27, at 56. For example, Lubell argues that it is “at least arguable that computer data is closer to what the drafters wanted to include as objects than to the notion of what they wanted to exclude as aim or purpose.” See Noam Lubell, *Lawful Targets in Cyber Operations: Does the Principle of Distinction Apply?*, 89 INT’L L. STUD. 252, 268 (2013). Lubell points out that data is, in some circumstances, more precious than physical objects; buildings can be rebuilt, but data that is not backed up (or if the backup tapes are destroyed as well) is gone forever.\n See Lubell, *supra* note 49, at 267 (concluding that “[t]he problem that arises, which is relatively unique to cyber operations, is whether data can be considered an object. While there is no definitive answer to this question, the currently prevailing view among LOAC experts appears to hold that in most cases data, for the purposes of LOAC targeting, should not be considered an object.”).\n Tallinn Manual, *supra* note 27, at 56.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. The Emerging Consensus on Cyber-War\nwilling to view similarly a cyber-attack against election infrastructure or some other form of election cyber-interference. However, this conclusion would appear to stretch the concept of “armed attack” well beyond its original meaning, at least when judged against its functional role in the overall ecosystem of *jus ad bellum*.\nSo far our discussion has focused on the requirements for triggering a military response under article 51 after a state suffers a cyber-attack. However, different rules would apply for a right of cyber-defense in response to a first cyber-attack. If both a first cyber-attack and a defensive cyber-response fall below the threshold for armed attacks, then two nations could engage in a tit-for-tat response of increasingly serious cyber-attacks, and none of it will be regulated by either *jus ad bellum* or *jus in bello*. The absence of physical destruction of persons or things will remove the cyber-engagement from the legal regulation of warfare, potentially emboldening states to engage in a wide range of cyber-activities.\nThe question in today’s world is whether states would prefer to continue these cyber-attacks without legal regulation or whether a system of reciprocal constraints on cyber-attacks below the military threshold would be a good idea. Although\n It should also be noted that the downstream “effects” of a cyber-attack could take weeks or months to be fully manifested – a factor which makes the law of war much more difficult to apply to cyber-attacks, rather than conventional military attacks where the effects are more readily ascertainable in the hours and days after the attack. See Stephen Petkis, *Rethinking Proportionality in the Cyber Context*, 47 GEO. J. INT’L L. 1431, 1448 (2016) (concluding that “the principal problem with an ‘effects test’ in the cyber context is that the nature and gravity of a cyber attack can be incredibly difficult to ascertain at the time the attack occurs. Unlike kinetic action, the true ‘effect’ of a cyber intrusion may not be known until weeks, months, or years after it is first discovered”).\n See, e.g., Michael Gervais, *Cyber Attacks and the Laws of War*, 30 BERKELEY J. INT’L L. 525, 536 (2012) (concluding that “in light of the ‘object and purpose’ of the Charter, ‘force’ should be read more narrowly. The express aim of the United Nations is to maintain international peace and security, as well as ‘to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war’. That suggests the notion of force in 1945 was limited to the military instrument.”). Gervais goes on to correctly note that “treating all forms of cyber attack as a use of force would require an implausibly broad reading of Article 2(4) that includes non-physical damage.” *Id.* at 537. But see Schmitt, *supra* note 43, at 919 (asking whether there should be a presumption that computer attacks fall in the use of force box and suggesting that “the security framework of the Charter would be best effected by application of an inclusivity presumption”).\n See Priyanka R. Dev, “Use of Force” and “Armed Attack” Thresholds in Cyber Conflict: The Looming Definitional Gaps and the Growing Need for Formal U.N. Response, 50 TEX. INT’L L.J. 381, 392–93 (2015) (musing that “an alternative solution to better encapsulate non-physical cyber effects, rather than expanding ill-fitted traditional concepts, would be for the international community to create a new threshold for actions that do not meet the traditional use of force threshold but nonetheless constitute a ‘breach of the peace’ under Article 39 of the U.N. Charter”).\n See, e.g., Matthew C. Waxman, *Cyber-Attacks and the Use of Force: Back to the Future of Article 2(4)*, 36 YALE J. INT’L L. 421, 434 (2011) (noting that “in addition to the more traditional military defense and deterrence strategies just described, the U.S. government may also be considering legal interpretations flexible enough to permit its own offensive cyber-operations below a certain threshold or against inchoate hostile cyber-activities”).\n Cyber-attacks that fall below the armed attack threshold would still be subject to international legal regulation, just not under the law of war. See Daniel J. Ryan et al., *International Cyberlaw: A Normative Approach*, 42 GEO. J.

Election Interference Is Not Cyber-War\nthere have been extensive calls for more regulation, perhaps even a new treaty, to govern cyber-space, the lack of serious development of explicit rules suggests that most states are interested in keeping the law open in order to preserve their flexibility going forward. Indeed, states often refuse to even acknowledge publicly when they have perpetrated or been victimized by a cyber-attack – a reticence that hampers the development of legal norms in this area.\n## D. Application of Jus in Bello Principles to Cyber-Attacks\nPrinciples of *jus in bello* apply to cyber-attacks as long as the cyber-attack either triggers an armed conflict or is launched during an armed conflict.^[57]^ Outside the context of an armed conflict, a cyber-attack would be constrained by principles of international human rights law, and general constraints embodied in public international law (including the concept of proportionality), but the more specific rules of *jus in bello* would not apply. But in the context of an armed conflict, there are at least three *jus in bello* rules that are of prime importance to consider: the principle of distinction, the prohibition on excessive collateral damage, and the combatant's privilege.^[58]^ Each will now be considered.\nThe principle of distinction requires attacking forces to limit their attacks to military objectives. A cyber-attack that takes place during an armed conflict would be subject to the same limitations.^[59]^ So, for example, a state launching a cyber-attack would be prohibited from using a cyber-weapon to disable a purely civilian system, such as a school computer system, an electrical power grid providing electricity to a civilian neighborhood, or a computer system associated with a medical-care facility. This prohibition applies not just to attacks against civilian personnel, but also to attacks against civilian installations and civilian infrastructure. This rule would explicitly permit cyber-attacks against military targets, such as a computer system for any military base, missile system, air-defense system, or even an infrastructure system that provides resources exclusively to a military system. So, for example, it would be consistent with the laws of war to use a cyber-attack to disable an oil refinery that provides oil exclusively to a nation's military, with the goal of denying tanks, Humvees, and other military vehicles the fuel that they need to operate.\n^[57]^ See, e.g., Gary D. Solis, *Cyber Warfare*, 219 MIL. L. REV. 1, 2 (2014) (noting that “[w]hether a 500-pound bomb or a computer is used to effect death and destruction, a weapon is a weapon”).\n^[58]^ Strangely, Gary Brown argues that *jus in bello* \"has little of interest to say specifically about cyber warfare\" and \"the places where actual cyber activities and the LOAC intersect are few and, in the scheme of things, not especially relevant.\" Gary D. Brown, *International Law Applies to Cyber Warfare! Now What?*, 46 SW. L. REV. 355, 356 (2017).\n^[59]^ For a discussion of this issue, see Lubell, *supra* note 49, at 252.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. The Emerging Consensus on Cyber-War\nOf course, a civilian target may be destroyed as collateral damage, provided that the collateral damage is not excessive or disproportionate to the military advantage gained by destroying the military target. In the context of a cyber-attack, it might be permissible to destroy a civilian computer system if it is a collateral consequence of destroying a military computer system, which might be the case if the two computer systems are linked together. However, if the destruction of the civilian computer system is disproportionate relative to the military advantage conferred by destroying the military computer system, the collateral damage would be disallowed by *jus in bello*. There is some uncertainty about how to apply the concept of collateral damage to cyber-attacks. Some scholars have argued that the rule against disproportionate collateral damage should apply even when the damage to the civilian system is limited to loss of *functionality* to a computer system that provides service to the civilian population, even if the computer system is not physically destroyed. The general law-of-war impulse to insulate civilians from the burdens of war applies just as much in cyber-space as it does on the kinetic battlefield.\nThe much more difficult application of this rule involves dual-infrastructure targets. Many infrastructure targets, such as power plants, oil refineries, water treatment plants and mining facilities, provide general resources for both civilian and military uses. International lawyers have been perplexed by these targets for many years, and the NATO bombing of Serbia in 1999 threw into sharp relief the legal uncertainty over their status. For example, NATO forces attacked bridges that were used by both civilian and military vehicles, and also attacked TV stations that were owned by the government and used to broadcast nationalist propaganda. Although controversial, the prevailing consensus is that dual-use infrastructure targets need to be considered as both civilian and military at the same time and evaluated on that basis. Consequently, while it might be legitimate to destroy the military-side of a dual-use infrastructure target, the destruction of the civilian part (or the civilian percentage) is only justified if it is not excessive or disproportionate to the military advantage gained by destroying the military part. So, for example, the bridge\n For a discussion of the proportionality analysis related to a cyber-attack, see Jeremy Richmond, *Evolving Battlefields: Does Stuxnet Demonstrate A Need for Modifications to the Law of Armed Conflict?*, 35 FORDHAM INT’L L.J. 842, 891 (2012) (concluding that the Stuxnet cyber-attack against Iran was proportionate because “[g]iven the minimal amount of collateral damage caused by Stuxnet, Stuxnet’s commanders were almost certainly reasonable in their calculations”).\n See, e.g., Eric Talbot Jensen, *Cyber Attacks: Proportionality and Precautions in Attack*, 89 INT’L L. STUD. 198, 206 (2013) (noting that “some have taken the view that damage also encompasses serious interruptions in functionality, such as would require replacing parts or reloading software systems. For example, in the kinetic analogy used above where a cyber attack shut down a communication port but left the rest of the computer unaffected, the computer would still turn on but its actual functionality might be seriously affected. If functionality is considered when determining damage, the kinetic analogy would be of limited value.”).\n See Captain Christopher M. Kovach, *Beyond Skynet: Reconciling Increased Autonomy in Computer-Based Weapons Systems with the Laws of War*, 71 A.F. L. REV. 231, 250 (2014) (noting that “the proliferation of dual-use facilities and systems complicates the ability of cyberweapons to limit their effects solely to lawful targets”).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. Election Interference Is Not Cyber-War\ncan be destroyed if the civilian harm is not disproportionate to the advantage conferred by denying the military use of the bridge. For a cyber-attack, this means that a computer system could be destroyed even if it has some civilian use, but only if that civilian use is not disproportionate to the military advantage. A cyber-attack against a general power grid that supplies power to both the civilian population and the military would be lawful or unlawful depending on the exact proportion of the two uses and the relative harm it would impose on the civilian population weighed against the military value of denying power to the military. The same would hold true for a cyber-attack against an oil refinery.\nThe combatant’s privilege provides immunity to military personnel who fight during an armed conflict: as long as their acts comply with the laws of war, the soldiers cannot be prosecuted by a foreign adversary in a domestic court. The privilege applies to members of armed forces and members of a militia who wear uniforms or a fixed emblem, carry arms openly, have a responsible command structure, and comply with the laws and customs of warfare. In the kinetic context, it is clear what this means. Soldiers should wear uniforms, carry their rifles openly, and comply with the laws of war. Members of the CIA or other civilian agencies who are deployed covertly, without the state acknowledging their link to the forces, are not entitled to the combatant’s privilege and could be prosecuted by the enemy upon capture. For a cyber-warrior working for the U.S. government, it is unclear how these requirements should translate. In theory, the cyber-warrior should be wearing a uniform or fixed emblem, although there is little transparency gain from a hacker’s wearing a uniform as compared to the transparency gain from an infantry soldier wearing a uniform. The problem of remoteness is not unique to cyber-warriors, since missile operators or airmen might never be seen by the enemy either and the general assumption is that these service personnel should wear identifying emblems.\nWhat does it mean for a cyber-warrior to “carry arms openly”? This is genuinely unclear and it is doubtful that there is a nonquestion-begging answer to this question. Military cyber-operations are often unacknowledged in the sense that the U.S. government will not acknowledge its role in an offensive cyber-attack, nor does it release much information about defensive cyber-activities either. To comply with the requirements of carrying arms openly and wearing a fixed emblem, should\n See Duncan B.

Election Interference and the Law of War\n\n## 3. ELECTION INTERFERENCE AND THE LAW OF WAR\nBased on the preceding analysis, it is clear that while election interference is certainly destructive, it is not destructive in the way contemplated by the law of war. Consequently, politicians who refer to election interference as an “act of war” almost surely have the legal analysis wrong. Future National Security Advisor John Bolton referred to Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election as an act of war, a “casus belli” that Washington would not and should not accept, and argued that negotiating with Russia was dangerous. Despite their disagreements over how to approach Russia (and their disagreements about Russian election interference), Trump would later appoint Bolton as National Security Advisor. Similarly, Sen. Richard Blumenthal stated: “This was an act of war, in my view.” Blumenthal continued: “I’ve said it in various hearings before this indictment. Interestingly enough the indictment refers to information warfare, that’s the term the Russians use.” Nikki Haley, at the time US Ambassador to the United Nations, stated that “[w]hen a country can come and interfere in another country’s elections, that is warfare,” and she also described election interference as Russia’s “weapon” of choice in its conflict with the United States. Former Vice President and Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney used similar language. Many pundits and political observers referred to election interference as an act of war:\nCall it a different kind of war – asymmetric warfare, or whatever. But it is war. Whatever role Trump played in the attack, whatever he knew or didn’t know about\n As noted above, if a cyber-attack produces physical destruction, it would be regulated by the laws of war. See Thomas C. Wingfield, International Law and Information Operations, in Franklin D. Kramer, Stuart H. Starr, and Larry K. Wentz (eds.), CYBERPOWER AND NATIONAL SECURITY (Potomac Books, 2009) 538 (noting that “[i]t should be immaterial whether a refinery was destroyed by a 2,000-pound bomb or by a line of malicious code in its pressure regulation subroutine; what did matter was the size of the hole left in the ground after the attack”).\n John Bolton, Vladimir Putin Looked Trump in the Eye and Lied to Him; We Negotiate With Russia at Our Peril, THE TELEGRAPH (July 10, 2017).\n Nicholas Rondinone, Blumenthal: Russian Interference is “Act of War,” HARTFORD COURANT (Feb. 24, 2018).

Election Interference Is Not Cyber-War\nit previously, Russia took a hostile strike against this country. And it is, so far, winning.\nOr consider the statement from one Democratic lawmaker who said that he had “no doubt” that Russian interference constituted an act of war. Even John McCain referred to it as an act of war. Other politicians referred to the Russian interference as “hybrid warfare” – a category that evokes armed conflict but at least in some usages would be defined as falling below the level of armed conflict. For example, Secretary of Defense Ash Carter said that Russia interfered in “our democratic processes” with hybrid warfare, that is “interference in the internal affairs of nations, short of war.”\nMost scholars who have considered the issue have correctly analyzed that Russian interference falls outside the scope of armed conflict, though each has struggled to articulate a convincing framing device. For example, Herb Lin has stated that:\nIW/IO is a hostile non-kinetic activity, or at least an activity that is conducted between two parties whose interests are not well-aligned. At the same time, IW/IO is not warfare in the Clausewitzian sense (nor in any sense presently recognized under the laws of war or armed conflict); it is better characterized as hostile or adversarial psychological manipulation. IW/IO has connotations of soft power (more properly, a mix of soft power and sharp power): propaganda, persuasion, culture, social forces, confusion, deception.\nOthers have similarly concluded that the interference fell below the threshold of armed conflict. Understood in this way, interference is extremely disruptive but not a subject for *jus in bello* regulation.\nOutsiders (non-lawyers) often assume that the law of war is designed to regulate every infringement of a state’s territorial or political integrity. But that is certainly not the case.

Election Interference and the Law of War\n\nThe most salient examples of election interference involve either the theft and public release of private information or the posting of political views on social media platforms, often with the goal of disguising the true identity, and national origin, of the account holder. In the case of theft-and-release, a state might steal private information about a candidate – such as emails, text messages, private medical information, or confidential employment records from a human resources department – and release the damaging information to the public in order to favor a rival candidate.77 Some of the information might be real and some of the information might be doctored or otherwise misleading. In the case of the second example of election interference, the foreign state might create fake Facebook groups focusing on a particular issue or candidate, in order to drum up excitement for or against a particular candidate, or fake Twitter or Instagram accounts with the same goal in mind. Each of these activities involves foreign interference that arguably interferes with the political process and the political integrity of the target state, but neither involves the kind of physical destruction or territorial infringement that is the sine qua non of armed conflict.\nThere is a strong temptation to reduce all important issues of international law to questions of warfare. Armed conflict is a distinctive moment for international lawyers, full of peril, and the concept of warfare captures the imagination of nonlawyers. Often the critical question (does this conduct violate international law?) gets displaced by the simpler question (is the conduct a war crime?), without first considering whether war is the relevant paradigm or not. But international law is not reducible to the law of war. Public international law is so much richer than just rules regulating the use of force and the conduct of hostilities. We need to resist the temptation to put everything into a war framework. The distinct harm of election interference speaks to broader and more complex questions of political integrity that go well beyond the concept of armed conflict.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. Election Interference Is Not Cyber-War\nThat being said, it is important to recognize the impulse to analyze election interference through the war paradigm. The regulation of warfare is one of the great success stories of international law, because the discourse on warfare, both *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello*, has been wholeheartedly legalized. International lawyers discuss the rules of warfare with a precision that is almost scientific in nature. For a public grasping for certainty and legality, the law of war is an attractive horizon to steer towards. So, it is no wonder that people gravitate to the war paradigm given how successful international lawyers have been in occupying the field. But the war discussion crowds out alternative legal frameworks for understanding election interference, frameworks that focus on the political significance of elections and the way that foreign interference undermines the political integrity of the state.\nThe concept of “sovereignty” is one alternative framework.78 Clearly, a state’s violating the sovereignty of another state is illegal under some circumstances. So, it is intuitively plausible to suggest that election interference violates the sovereignty of the target state whose election is disputed, compromised, or influenced by the outside actor. The next chapter will explore “sovereignty” as a more salient legal category than armed conflict and examine both the benefits and the drawbacks of describing election interference in those terms. One noteworthy complication is the fact that the technical and doctrinal requirements for a legal infringement of sovereignty do not line up with common-sense intuitions about what counts as a violation of sovereignty. Consequently, many behaviors that sound as if they should count as sovereignty violations turn out to be perfectly legal – or at the very least contested – according to established doctrines of public international law. It also does not help that the concept of sovereignty is a cluster concept, housing diverse notions such as physical control over territory, control over a population, and expressions of a polity’s popular will. This produces a lot of cross-talking since not everyone means the same thing when they utter the word “sovereignty.”\nOne argument for focusing on sovereignty is that international law is much broader than the regulation of war. Just because election interference fails to qualify as an armed attack does not mean that the interference is lawful under international law. Similarly, even though election interference does not trigger a right of self-defense, international law might allow other responses to the interference. Under international law, a state is not required to simply suffer violations falling short of an armed attack. Victim states are entitled to use retorsions and countermeasures in an attempt to get the offending state to back off and cease the illegal behavior.\nCountermeasures and retorsions are united by the state’s intention behind their use, which is to induce the law-breaking state into compliance in the future. Countermeasures and retorsions differ in the legal status of the action used to induce\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n3. Election Interference and the Law of War\n\nOf the two, countermeasures are the more controversial because they involve conduct that would otherwise be illegal. However, it should be noted that countermeasures should not include the use of military force, which are governed by the principles of self-defense. Although the issue is somewhat contested, the majority (and better) view is that the doctrine of countermeasures cannot be used as an exception to the requirements of *jus ad bellum*. If a state wishes to use military force, it needs either Security Council authorization or a defensive claim under article 51 of the UN Charter.\nAfter the Russian interference in the 2016 election, President Obama announced sanctions designed to punish the Russian government for election interference and related behavior, including Russian interference in Ukraine.80 For example, on April 1, 2015, President Obama issued an executive order declaring that “the increasing prevalence and severity of malicious cyber-enabled activities originating from, or directed by persons located, in whole or in substantial part, outside the United States constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.”81 On December 28, 2016, Obama amended the earlier executive order and ordered the Treasury Department to freeze the assets of individuals involved in Russian cyber-interference.82\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. Election Interference Is Not Cyber-War\nIn December 2016, the Obama administration also expelled thirty-five Russian diplomats who were described as members of Russian intelligence. In a related move, the Obama administration shut down two Russian diplomatic \"compounds\" that the administration claimed were being used for intelligence collection. Though these compounds were probably connected with domestic intelligence gathering rather than troll farm activity launched from St. Petersburg, the move to shut down the compounds was part of a general package of punitive actions against Moscow. In making this move, Obama stated:\nThese actions are not the sum total of our response to Russia's aggressive activities. We will continue to take a variety of actions at a time and place of our choosing, some of which will not be publicized. In addition to holding Russia accountable for what it has done, the United States and friends and allies around the world must work together to oppose Russia's efforts to undermine established international norms of behavior, and interfere with democratic governance. To that end, my Administration will be providing a report to Congress in the coming days about Russia's efforts to interfere in our election, as well as malicious cyber activity related to our election cycle in previous elections.[83]\nIn addition to these punitive actions, it is possible that the United States also engaged in classified or covert actions that were not publicly disclosed.[84] In particular, the United States reportedly launched a cyber-attack against the Russian government as a proportional countermeasure to the election interference.[85] But the United States was careful not to describe any of its responses as either countermeasures or retorsions. Although this refusal is somewhat perplexing, it may have been connected with Obama's general reluctance to declare Russian interference as \"illegal\" under international law.[86] Describing a punitive action as a countermeasure implies a conclusion both about the illegality of the offending conduct and also the illegality of the punitive measure under nonpunitive circumstances. The United States may have preferred to preserve maximum flexibility regarding its legal position on cyber-attacks. This may\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nConclusion\nhave contributed to the Obama Administration's relative silence on Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n# CONCLUSION\nRussia's interference in the 2016 election may have violated international law, but it was neither an act of war nor was it the opening salvo in a cyber-war between the United States and Russia. But this is not to diminish its significance, or even to diminish its illegality under both U.S. and international law. It may still be illegal, and the sooner that the public recognizes that it does not trigger a right of kinetic response under article 51 of the UN Charter, the sooner a more nuanced discussion can open up about the range of permissible responses under international law, such as retorsions and countermeasures outside the context of the use of force. Political leaders have a range of options at their disposal but selecting among them requires consideration of the vast tools for enforcing international law beyond the use of force.\nTo recap the argument presented in this chapter: The principles governing *jus in bello* and *jus ad bellum* apply with equal force in the realm of cyber-attacks. A cyberattack that causes physical destruction may qualify as an armed attack triggering a right of self-defense under article 51 of the UN Charter, and a cyber-attack that causes physical destruction may constitute a resort to force that triggers the existence of an armed conflict and the application of IHL. But in the absence of physical destruction, cyber-attacks probably fall outside the scope of the laws of war. Cyberwar is a real phenomenon, but in many cases, the \"war\" suffix is, legally speaking, a metaphor. In technical discussions, the term \"war\" is meant to convey the notion of an armed conflict pursued through sustained military engagements. In contrast, most cyber-attacks have more in common with the tools of statecraft than the tools of military science. Election interference falls in the category of statecraft, though it is important to remember that even statecraft is regulated by public international law.\n See, e.g., Jack Crowe, *Rosenstein Calls Out Obama Admin For Failing to \"Publicize\" Russian Election Interference*, NATIONAL REVIEW (April 26, 2019).\n In this sense, Brown is absolutely right when he concludes that \"[l]aw is a critical aspect of discussions about the cyber aspects of privacy rights, espionage, sovereignty, international norms of behavior, and more – but none of these things is within the realm of LOAC.\" Gary D. Brown, *International Law Applies to Cyber Warfare! Now What?*, 46 SW. L. REV. 355, 356 (2017).\n See Prescott, *supra* note 1, at 48 (asserting that \"[b]elow the level of this use of force, cyber operations that result only in direct effects within cyberspace itself would not be considered uses of force regulated by LOAC, even though their indirect effects might have far-reaching and negative impacts upon the nation targeted.\"); Lubell, *supra* note 49, at 259 (concluding that \"[t]here can be plenty of cyber operations that occur outside the context of an armed conflict, such as certain types of cyber espionage between supposedly friendly countries to which the law of armed conflict would not apply\"). Lubell also argues that psychological operations (such as operations that have the goal of disseminating propaganda) \"are not considered to be ones that cause direct harm to the civilian population and, as such, can be excluded from certain restrictions placed on attacks.\" *Id.* at 263.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. Election Interference Is Not Cyber-War\nJust because a tool of statecraft falls below the legal threshold for armed conflict does not necessarily mean that the tool is part of a state's exclusive discretion, or what international lawyers sometimes call its domaine réservé.\nThe next two chapters focus on two competing frameworks for regulating cyber-election interference. Chapter 3 analyzes whether \"sovereignty\" is the correct concept, such that cyber interference might be viewed as an illegal infringement of a state's sovereignty. Among international lawyers, this is the \"preferred\" framework or the \"majority\" approach, though there are significant drawbacks to the approach, and I count myself as a dissenting voice. Then, Chapter 4 analyzes whether \"self-determination\" is a more promising framework, so that cyber interference might be viewed as a violation of a people's collective right of self-determination. This is an uncommon approach not yet adopted by public international lawyers, though they should give this approach a second look. In addition to being doctrinally salient, the concept of self-determination dovetails with our commonsense intuition that election interference is harmful because of its corrosive effect on the machinery of core democratic institutions.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press",

    "flat_text": "## INTRODUCTION\nHistorically, foreign election interference was accomplished through nondigital means. So, for example, a state might drop leaflets on a city urging the residents to take a particular action. Or, the state might broadcast messages over radio or other media. Or, the interfering state might make corrupt deals with local politicians or officials in ways that might constitute meddling. In today's world, however, these prosaic forms of interference have been replaced with their digital counterparts: the use of email hacking and fraudulent social media presence to influence the public and consequently interfere with an election. Because the method of election interference has shifted to the digital domain, there is a strong temptation to view the legality of election interference through the international legal rules governing cyber-attacks. In other words, one common assumption made by commentators is that election interference should be understood as a subcategory or particular instantiation of cyber-attacks. Although the international law governing cyber-activity is still emerging, the greatest clarity in that area stems from the international law regarding cyber-war. The majority view among international lawyers is that the regular rules governing kinetic warfare – that is, physical military movements – also apply to cyber-warfare. So, for example, an attack that would violate the law of war if conducted by planes and tanks would also violate the law of war if the same effects are produced by a cyber-attack launched by a team of hackers acting as state-cyber-combatants.\nWe will discuss this particular argument in greater detail below, but for the moment the key point is that there is a strong temptation to understand election\n For an expression of this point of view, see Jody M. Prescott, *Building the Ethical Cyber Commander and the Law of Armed Conflict*, 40 RUTGERS COMPUTER &amp; TECH. L.J. 42, 47 (2014) (“As nations move toward securing the means to conduct cyber conflict that begins to approach our common understandings of war, a consensus appears to be emerging among international organizations concerned with the implementation of LOAC, and in academia, that LOAC at least applies to those actions in cyberspace that either result in, or are intended to result in, injury to humans and damage to geophysical things.”).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\ninterference through the lens of cyber-war. In other words, some would condemn election interference as illegal under international law because it represents a form of cyber-warfare. Other lawyers and politicians will argue the opposite: that election interference does not violate international law because it does not rise to the level of a cyber-war, as if this is the end of the matter in terms of the legal analysis. What unites these two competing conclusions is the assumption that cyber-warfare is the correct framework for judging the legality of election interference. That assumption is profoundly mistaken.\nThis chapter will explain why the assumption is mistaken and why the cyber-war framework is unhelpful. Although international law is a broad and sweeping body of law, the legal regulation of warfare is one of the most prominent and successful subdisciplines of international law. So, perhaps it is not surprising that lawyers should jump to cyber-war as an attractive framing device. But the framing device is poor and sucks up oxygen from other more compelling frameworks that international law has to offer.\nIn order to explain why cyber-war is a poor fit for understanding election interference, this chapter will first explain the basic principles behind the legal regulation of warfare. Then, in Section 2, this chapter will explain how these principles apply in the context of cyber-attacks. Finally, Section 3 will consider the specific case of election interference to show why it does not constitute an illegal cyber-attack in violation of the law of war. But just because it does not violate the rules regarding cyber-war does not mean that it might not violate some other area of international law. The field of international law is at once broader and deeper than the legal regulation of armed conflict. But only by first pushing aside the most obvious framing device can we move toward more compelling and innovative frameworks for understanding the particular harm posed by foreign election interference. This argument will unfold over the course of the subsequent chapters.\n## INTERNATIONAL REGULATION OF WARFARE\n### The Distinction Between Jus ad Bellum and Jus in Bello\nThe international legal regulation of warfare is based on the foundational distinction between jus ad bellum and jus in bello -- terms that originate with the Just War philosophical tradition. Jus ad bellum regulates the recourse to force, that is, the decision to go to war in the first place. With very few exceptions, states are mostly prohibited from using military force to settle international disputes, but in some situations, the recourse to military force might be justified. In contrast, jus in bello regulates the conduct of hostilities during an armed conflict. So, for example, jus in bello passes judgment on the tactics used during an armed conflict, such as who can be targeted, in what\n2. Election Interference Is Not Cyber-War\ncircumstances, and with what weapons. For example, one of the cardinal rules of *jus in bello* is the rule prohibiting collateral damage that is excessive or disproportionate to the value of the military target. One way of explaining the distinction between *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* is that the former covers macro-questions regarding the legality of the overall war, while the latter covers micro-questions regarding the conduct of individual military operations within that war.\nThe legal domains of *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* are legally and conceptually independent, in the sense that a *jus in bello* analysis does not depend on the outcome of the *jus ad bellum* analysis. In other words, both the aggressor state and the victim state are required to follow the same rules regarding the conduct of warfare. The victim state is not entitled to more liberal rules for the conduct of warfare, just because the victim state is on the receiving end of a *jus ad bellum* violation. Conversely, the aggressor state is not subject to more restrictive conduct rules just because the aggressor state has violated *jus ad bellum* principles. In the conduct of cyber-war, this means that whether a state has violated *jus ad bellum* or not is irrelevant to the question of how the rules of *jus in bello* are applied in the context of cyber-attacks. It is important to keep the macro-level and micro-level questions separate.\nThere has been a recent trend in the philosophical literature to question the canonical separation between *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* principles. These “revisionist just war” arguments have pushed back against the classical Just War Tradition, which always assumed that the *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* domains were conceptually distinct. Under the revisionist line of thinking, philosophers have suggested that, for example, noncombatants on the victim side should be entitled to fight back against an unjust aggression, whereas under the traditional view, noncombatants are prohibited from participating in hostilities and are therefore not entitled to the combatant’s privilege. Part of the inspiration for the revisionist trend is that the ethical rules regarding killing should be the same for individuals as they are for groups. In other words, the revisionist camp aims to\n See GARY SOLIS, THE LAW OF ARMED CONFLICT 7–8 (2nd edn., Cambridge University Press, 2016) (noting that: “All’s fair in love and war? Hardly!

Just as surely, all is not fair in war.”).\n Id. at 292–300.\n See MICHAEL WALZER, JUST AND UNJUST WARS: A MORAL ARGUMENT WITH HISTORICAL ILLUSTRATIONS 21 (3rd edn., Basic Books, 2000) (suggesting that the “two sorts of judgment are logically independent”).

International Regulation of Warfare\n\nWhatever one thinks about the philosophical legitimacy of these revisionist arguments, even the philosophers do not contend that their arguments are currently represented in international legal doctrine. The revisionist just war philosophers are making arguments about the deep morality of warfare and even some of them concede that there might be legitimate institutional or pragmatic reasons why international law separates *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* into conceptually distinct normative regimes. For example, it might be unworkable to assign to each soldier and to each civilian the task of determining whether a military invasion is justified under *jus ad bellum* before they decide how they should behave. So, the virtue of the current legal regime is that soldiers and civilians alike can fight (or not fight) in a war without having to adjudicate the contentious *jus ad bellum* questions. Whether this separation is consistent with the “deep morality” of warfare or not, it certainly makes life for the professional solider (on both sides) more workable and represents the current state of the legal regulation of warfare. It may even be morally justified as an instrumental matter, because separating the two domains might service the legitimate goal of designing real-world institutions that ensure compliance with rules that are a second-best alternative to the deep morality of war.\n## B. The Basic Rules Regarding Jus ad Bellum\nThe rules regarding *jus ad bellum* are relatively straightforward to articulate, although they are contentious when it comes to their *application*. The use of military force by one state against another state is only justified if taken in self-defense or in accordance with a Security Council authorization. Article 2(4) of the UN Charter prohibits the use of military force for the resolution of international disputes, but article 51 of the UN Charter carves out cases of self-defense from the basic article 2(4) prohibition. Article 51 imposes various requirements for the exercise of self-defense, including the existence of an armed attack against the victim\n *Id.* at 208 (“There are compelling reasons why the laws of war cannot treat the use of violence by Unjust Combatants as criminal.”).\n *Id.* at 208.\n See Janina Dill, *Should International Law Ensure the Moral Acceptability of War?*, 26 LEIDEN J. INT’L. L. 253–70 (2013).\n Article 2(4) of the UN Charter states: “All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.” Article 51 states that “Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. Measures taken by Members in the exercise of\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. Election Interference Is Not Cyber-War\nstate, and a requirement that the Security Council be informed if a state is exercising its legal right of self-defense. Although not explicitly articulated in the text of article 51, international law also imposes additional constraints, including requirements of imminence, necessity, and proportionality. The former requires that the armed attack against the victim state be imminent at the point in time when the victim state uses military force to repel the threat. The latter requirement requires that the defensive force be necessary to stop the threat; if nonmilitary measures are available to resolve the threat, the resort to defensive force is illegitimate (because it is unnecessary at the point in time when it is exercised). Any military response to an attack, undertaken in self-defense pursuant to article 51, would be constrained by the principle of proportionality, meaning that the defensive force must not be disproportionate to the legitimate interest being vindicated by the defensive force.\nThe Security Council is entitled under Chapter VII of the UN Charter to issue a binding resolution calling on member states to use military force to resolve a threat of or breach of international peace and security. Member states are not required to use military force in that situation, but they are permitted to do so; the Security Council resolution transforms what would otherwise potentially be a violation of article 2(4) into a lawful police action to enforce international law. The Security Council is therefore a clearinghouse for decisions regarding the lawfulness of military force, although individual states retain the \"inherent\" right to exercise defensive force even in situations where the Security Council fails to act to authorize military force. The Security Council may also authorize nonmilitary measures under article 41 of the UN Charter. The right to unilateral defense force is particularly important since the Security Council includes five permanent members (China, France, Russia, United States, United Kingdom), each of whom enjoys a veto, that is, the right to veto any resolution coming out of the Security Council.\nthis right of self-defence shall be immediately reported to the Security Council and shall not in any way affect the authority and responsibility of the Security Council under the present Charter to take at any time such action as it deems necessary in order to maintain or restore international peace and security.\"\n For a discussion of these requirements, see generally YORAM DINSTEIN, WAR, AGGRESSION, AND SELF-DEFENSE (Cambridge University Press, 2012).\n For a discussion of the proportionality requirement, see generally MICHAEL A. NEWTON AND LARRY MAY, PROPORTIONALITY IN INTERNATIONAL LAW (Oxford University Press, 2014).\n See art. 42 (\"Should the Security Council consider that measures provided for in Article 41 would be inadequate or have proved to be inadequate, it may take such action by air, sea, or land forces as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security.

International Regulation of Warfare\n\n## C. The Basic Rules Regarding Jus in Bello\nThe rules regarding the conduct of warfare are expressed in major treaty conventions such as the four post-World War II Geneva Conventions, two additional protocols to the Geneva Conventions from 1977, and the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907. These treaty sources can be combined with rules of customary international law that equally regulate the conduct of hostilities. The rules regarding the conduct of warfare can be broadly fit into the following categories: targeting, participation in hostilities, tactics in warfare, and weaponry.\nFor example, the bedrock principle of *jus in bello* is that attacking forces should limit their attacks to enemy combatants, that is, members of enemy military forces or other militia units that meet the requirements of combatancy. Attacking forces are also entitled to attack civilians for such time as those civilians are directly participating in hostilities. It would be incongruous if a state could avoid its nationals being targeted simply by refusing to organize itself into formal military units, hence the exceptional rule that allows targeting of civilians who directly participate in hostilities. Despite this cardinal rule of distinction, civilians may be killed but only as collateral damage. By the phrase “collateral damage,” the law means that the civilians were not the object of the attack but were killed as a side effect of an attack on a lawful military objective such as a military asset or military personnel. So the difference between a violation of the principle of distinction and a case of permissible collateral damage is the attitude of the attacker. If the attacker is aiming at the civilian, the attacker has violated the principle of distinction. On the other hand, if the attacker is aiming at a lawful military objective, but still kills a civilian or a group of civilians, the civilians are considered collateral damage. The attacking force may even envision the civilian deaths, and they should still be counted as collateral damage. However, the *jus in bello* imposes a major constraint on the existence of collateral damage by prohibiting collateral\n This rule is codified in article 51(3) of Additional Protocol I (API) to the General Conventions: “Civilians shall enjoy the protection afforded by this Section, unless and for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities.”\n The principle of distinction is also sometimes referred to as the principle of discrimination. The two are roughly synonymous, though the word “distinction” is more often used by lawyers and “discrimination” is more common among philosophers of war.\n Solis dates the term “collateral damage” to the 1991 Gulf War. See SOLIS, *supra* note 2, at 295; SAHR CONWAY-LANZ, *COLLATERAL DAMAGE* 221 (Routledge, 2006).\n The question of mental intent in the context of collateral damage is somewhat complicated and has produced a series of unfortunate statements from international courts. For a discussion of this issue, see Jens David Ohlin, *Targeting and the Concept of Intent*, 35 MICH. J. INT’L L. 79 (2013).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. Election Interference Is Not Cyber-War\ndamage that is disproportionate or “excessive” to the anticipated value of the military advantage that will be gained from destroying the military target.\nThe *jus in bello* also outlaws particular tactics. Killing by perfidy is outlawed, such as pretending to be a civilian to draw out the enemy or waiving a white flag and pretending to surrender, only to kill the enemy during an ambush. These are “dishonest stratagems” as Kant called them, and impermissible as far back as the Lieber Code. Similarly, the *jus in bello* prohibits tactics that increase the suffering of the enemy (*maux superflus*) but do not produce any additional military benefit. So, in other words, it would be illegal to use a weapon that does not increase lethality but only increases the pain that the enemy will suffer before dying. Similarly, particular weapons may be outlawed by particular treaties or conventions, such as nuclear weapons (for some states that have signed nonproliferation accords), chemical weapons, cluster munitions, and landmines, though in each of these cases (other than chemical weapons) several states have refused to sign on to the conventions because they consider the weapon system in question to be necessary for strategic interests. Finally, attacking forces are not permitted to attack soldiers who are *hors de combat* because they are sick or because they have effectively communicated their surrender. Consequently, summarily executing a group of POWs (without legal process or criminal culpability) would constitute a war crime.\nThe basic structure behind the *jus in bello* is to create a special “war convention,” as Michael Walzer once described it. It creates, in other words, a special framework for the conduct of hostilities. Lawful combatants are granted the combatant’s privilege: in exchange for opening themselves up to the reciprocal risk of killing, combatants may not be prosecuted by the enemy for lawful acts of belligerency. In exchange, combatants are required to limit their attacks to military objects, thus sparing civilians from the burdens of war, as much as possible as would be consistent with the need to pursue the war effort (banning collateral damage entirely would effectively hamper warfare entirely). The requirement to carry arms openly and to avoid perfidious killing – among other prohibitions – install a basic notion of transparency in the law of war. Combatants do not simply fight for themselves as if they were fighting in a duel. Rather, combatants are representatives of the state, killing on the state’s behalf, and therefore combatants and the state “advance and retrograde” together on the field of battle, in Lieber’s\n See API, art. 51(5) (“Among others, the following types of attacks are to be considered as indiscriminate . . . (b) an attack which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.”).\n See API, art. 37(1) (“It is prohibited to kill, injure or capture an adversary by resort to perfidy.

The Emerging Consensus on Cyber-War\nfamous phrase. None of that would be possible without a basic principle of transparency in the application of *jus in bello*, which requires for its operation a tangible and public connection between individual combatants and the state on whose behalf they fight.\n## 2. THE EMERGING CONSENSUS ON CYBER-WAR\nThe last few years have witnessed a tremendous acceleration of work applying the law of war to the context of cyber-attacks. That being said, there is some uncertainty over the application of core law of war principles to cyber-space. There are several reasons for the uncertainty. The first is that there has been little diplomatic effort to codify specific international rules for cyber-attacks. One reason for the reluctance is that many lawyers believe that existing rules of IHL are adequate to the task of regulating state behavior in cyber-space. Second, some states want to preserve flexibility for their operations conducted in the cyber-realm. Third, the secretive nature of cyber-activities hampers the formation of customary rules. Customary international law develops out of state practice (action) and *opinio juris* (performing the legal action from a sense of legal obligation). But many cyber-attacks are conducted in secret, either covertly or clandestinely, and states often refuse to acknowledge their involvement in cyber-attacks. Other states will sometimes criticize those attacks, but in other situations the difficulty with “attribution” will hamper those public criticisms, thus leading to more private criticism through diplomatic channels. This dynamic scuttles or limits the formation of customary norms. However, despite these limitations, international lawyers have worked hard to explain, through soft-law mechanisms, how the law of war applies in cyber-space. One result of this effort, the Tallinn Manual, brought together experts on cyber-law and sought feedback from state governments.\nThis section outlines the state of international law regarding cyber-war: subsection A focuses on the role of the Tallinn Manual in constructing these norms; subsection B on whether cyber-wars are armed conflicts under international law; subsection C on the armed attack requirement for self-defense; and subsection D on the application of *jus in bello* principles to cyber-attacks.\n Lieber Code, art. 20 (“Public war is a state of armed hostility between sovereign nations or governments. It is a law and requisite of civilized existence that men live in political, continuous societies, forming organized units, called states or nations, whose constituents bear, enjoy, suffer, advance and retrograde together, in peace and in war.”).\n See Delbert Tran, *The Law of Attribution: Rules for Attributing the Source of A Cyber-Attack*, 20 YALE J. L. &amp; TECH. 376, 386 (2018) (noting that the “difficulty in tracing the source of a cyber-attack has long plagued discussions of cybersecurity, and much of current scholarship has accepted the traditional wisdom that the technological architecture of the internet makes attribution an exceedingly difficult problem”); Collin S. Allan, *Attribution Issues in Cyberspace*, 13 CHI.-KENT J. INT’L &amp; COMP. L. 55 (2013).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. Election Interference Is Not Cyber-War\n## A. The Role of the Tallinn Manual\nThe Tallinn Manual was initiated by the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, which is located in Tallinn, Estonia. The initiative involved a collaboration of international law and military law experts from across the world, followed by consultation and feedback from governments and their legal advisors. Although the Tallinn Manual is not a source of international law per se, it is relevant to the state of international law for two reasons. First, it may help in the formation of customary international law, as states gravitate towards particular statements of customary rules and norms, providing expression of legal rules for states to either accept or reject through the process of *opinio juris*. Second, the Tallinn Manual is a semi-authoritative statement of how experts believe that the existing law can and should be applied in cyber-space. If there is no need to amend or create new law, but simply a need to apply existing law to activities in cyber-space, then there is no requirement that the application be guided by the stringent rules for the creation of international law.\nThe Tallinn Manual focused on a variety of legal questions, including the applicability of *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* principles to cyber-attacks, and the use of countermeasures to thwart cyber-attacks. Also, the Tallinn Manual discusses violations of sovereignty that fall below the “armed attack” threshold – violations that will be the focus of the next chapter of this book.\n## B. Are Cyber-Wars Real Wars As a Matter of International Law?\nThe first threshold question is whether a cyber-war is a real “war” in the legal sense of that term as used by international lawyers. The answer to that question is yes, depending on the type of damage produced by the conflict, though this answer is a bit controversial. Some legal scholars argue that defining cyber-wars as real “armed conflicts” only functions to give state militaries control over cyber-infrastructure and cyber-governance – questions that necessarily impact civilian life and which ought not to be exclusively managed by state militaries. There is\n See TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE (Michael N. Schmitt et al. (eds.), 2013) [hereinafter cited as “Tallinn Manual”].\n The strictly defined sources of international law are generally outlined in article 38 of the ICJ Statute.\n For our purposes, the Tallinn Manual sections on cyber-war are the most relevant to our analysis.\n For example, the philosopher Larry May has argued that cyber-wars should not be understood as real “armed conflicts” in the way that international lawyers use that term. See Larry May, The Nature of War and the Idea of “Cyberwar,” in Ohlin et al. (eds.), CYBER WAR: LAW AND ETHICS FOR VIRTUAL CONFLICTS 3 (Oxford University Press, 2015) (suggesting that one could look at cyber-attacks as more like embargoes than as armed conflicts).\n See Mary Ellen O’Connell, *Cyber Security without Cyber War*, 17 J. CONFLICT &amp; SEC. L. 187, 209 (2012) (“To date, the problem of Internet security has been the domain of international law scholars with expertise in use of force questions. They have sent the message that the Internet may be protected through military force or the threat of military force, analogizing to Cold War deterrence strategy.”\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. The Emerging Consensus on Cyber-War\nwisdom in this criticism, though it is also the case that some cyber-wars should be considered significant enough to qualify as an armed conflict if they result in physical damage.\nIn terms of the application of international law, there is a widely shared definition for what counts as an armed conflict. International lawyers generally distinguish between international armed conflicts (IACs) between states, and noninternational armed conflicts (NIACs) between a state and a nonstate actor or between two nonstate actors. An IAC is triggered when there is a resort to \"armed force\" by one state against another state.[32] The standard view, though it is not codified in any treaty, is that there is no intensity threshold for this determination. In other words, an IAC exists between two states when one state uses military force against the other, regardless of how much force is used, or for how long it lasts. An IAC might involve a one-time airstrike by one state's air force, bombing targets in the other state, or the IAC might involve a full-scale land invasion that lasts for months or even years.[33] Either way, military force is traditionally thought of as involving some kinetic activity – the crossing of a border with a military asset, or the use of a confederate to destroy installations or buildings within the target state. It is very hard to think of an international armed conflict being triggered without either a border crossing or some physical destruction of at least some kind.\nIn contrast, a NIAC requires the existence of violent hostilities between a state and a nonstate actor that reaches a certain level of scope and intensity. So, for example, the state's use of physical force against a nonstate actor, such as a group of rebels, might not constitute an armed conflict if the state simply fires a few shots and arrests the members of the rebel organization. However, if there are sustained hostilities between the state and the nonstate actor that pass a certain threshold, the situation\nGovernments have followed this modelling, pouring resources into the military for keeping the Internet safe and for taking advantage of what it offers to attack opponents. Doing so has required strained analogies of cyber-attacks to conventional kinetic attacks. The Internet is now far less secure than before there was a Cyber Command or a NATO CCDCOE. It is time, therefore, to turn to cyber disarmament and a focus on peaceful protection of the Internet.\"). See also Christopher J. Finlay, Just War, Cyber War, and the Concept of Violence, 31 PHILOSOPHY &amp; TECHNOLOGY 357-77 (2018) (preferring to conceptualize cyber-attacks under the broader rubric of \"violence\" instead of \"war\"); Ryan Patterson, Silencing the Call to Arms: A Shift Away from Cyber Attacks As Warfare, 48 LOY. L. A.L. REV. 969, 975 (2015) (arguing that \"alternate legal regimes, including domestic law enforcement and the international principle of non-interference, may prove more effective frameworks to govern malicious cyber activities\"). Compare with Yoram Dinstein, Cyber War and International Law: Concluding Remarks at the 2012 Naval War College International Law Conference, 89 INT'L L. STUD. 276, 283 (2013) (\"There is nothing extraordinary in cyber warfare: it is just ordinary warfare with a little bit of extra. Cyber warfare does not merely resemble other forms of warfare: it is warfare. As such, it is directly governed by the jus in bello.\").\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. Election Interference Is Not Cyber-War\nmight graduate from a law enforcement operation to a full-blown NIAC that triggers the application of IHL rules (at least the rules that apply during a NIAC).\nAssuming that these articulations are correct statements about the international legal threshold for armed conflict, most cyber-attacks will not rise to the level of an armed conflict. Although the standard for the creation of an armed conflict is more liberal for international conflicts (IACs) than internal ones (NIACs), because the standard allows any use of force, it is unclear whether a cyber-attack would constitute a “use of force” against another state. On this question there is not universal agreement. At first blush, one can distinguish between three examples of cyber-attacks. In the first, one state uses a cyber-attack to cause damage or to destroy a physical building in the target state. For example, the state uses a cyber-attack to cause an electrical power station to overheat, resulting in an explosion and fire that destroys the power station. The second example would be a cyber-attack that is launched against a computer system in the target state, resulting in the physical destruction of the computer system but no other physical destruction. The third example would be a cyber-attack that penetrates a foreign computer system, resulting in the theft or destruction of information but no physical damage, not even physical damage to the computer system.\nAlthough experts are divided on some of these questions, there is widespread agreement that the first example would constitute a use of force that would trigger the existence of an armed conflict. In that case, a cyber-war would be a “war” in the sense of an “armed conflict” as international lawyers use the term. As the Tallinn Manual stated in its Rule 11, “A cyber operation constitutes a use force when its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force.” In making this determination, international lawyers sometimes look at the “scale and effects” of the force to determine whether it crosses the relevant threshold. In determining whether a cyber-attack constitutes a use of force, the Tallinn Manual suggests looking at the following criteria: severity, immediacy,\n Although customary international law arguably imposes the same (or similar) rules of conduct in both types of armed conflict, major treaties regulating *jus in bello* impose different legal regimes in each type of conflict. For example, the full Geneva Conventions apply during IACs, whereas only one article of the Geneva Conventions – Common article 3 – applies during NIACs.\n Solis, one of the leading American experts on the law of war, describes the standard in the following terms: “A cyber attack, as opposed to a cyber intrusion, constitutes a ‘use of force’ if undertaken by a state’s armed forces, intelligence services, or a private contractor whose conduct is attributable to the state, and its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations that rise to a level of a use of force.” Gary D. Solis, *Cyber Warfare*, 219 MIL. L. REV. 1, 15 (2014).\n Tallinn Manual, *supra* note 27, at 45.\n *Id.* at 46 (noting that “scale and effects” is a shorthand term that captures the quantitative and qualitative factors to be analysed in determining whether a cyber operation qualifies as a use of force”). The use of the “scale and effects” language in the Tallinn Manual is a bit unfortunate because it confuses the ICJ standard for armed attack within the context of self-defense for the standard for determining whether something counts as a use of force, despite the fact that the Tallinn Manual concedes that the definitions for a “use of force” and an “armed attack” are designed to “serve different normative purposes.” *Id.* at 52. That being said, the confusion is not important,\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. The Emerging Consensus on Cyber-War\n\nThe second and third examples are more complicated. Some international lawyers would consider the second example a use of force because it involved the physical destruction of a computer system. The third example is the most difficult, because many lawyers would consider the loss or theft of information to be insufficient to count as a use of force under international law. A small minority of lawyers are more liberal in their interpretation of what counts as a use of force. However, it would seem that the majority has the better of the argument, because it is hard to understand how the mere theft of information could constitute an armed attack. Indeed, it seems to be theft or destruction of information, rather than an armed attack. One might argue that the concept of an armed attack should be amended in today's world of cyber-threats, but indeed the whole point of using this legal trigger is to declare the existence of an armed conflict and trigger the application of IHL, and it is unclear how anything would be improved by triggering the application of IHL every time there is a cross-border cyber-attack. Indeed, one should remember that IHL has both a regulating and licensing function, in that it allows privileged (i.e. lawful) combatants to kill each other with personal legal immunity. So, there are some costs to the application of IHL, and placing states in a constant state of armed conflict simply because of a cyber-attack would do little to resolve international disputes peacefully.\nIn practical terms, what this means for election interference is that most cases of cyber-election interference will not trigger the existence of an armed conflict under international law. If state agents seek to influence an election by surreptitiously posting messages on social media, even if in doing so they pretend to be American citizens, this hardly seems like a \"use of force\" in the military sense of that term. Even if a state uses a cyber-attack to hack election results and change vote tallies, this clearly constitutes a substantial intrusion in the political integrity of another state, though again it is hard to qualify it as a use of force. The changing of the vote tallies would alter – arguably destroy – the legitimacy of the election results, but the problem is that international law views the concept of the use of force through a military lens, while in this case the harm seems decidedly political rather than military.\nbecause all parties agree that a cyber operation can, in theory, constitute a use of force under international law.\n Id. at 48–52 (but noting that the factors are not exhaustive and that \"States may look to others, such as the prevailing political environment, whether the cyber operation portends the future use of military force, the identity of the attacker, any record of cyber operations by the attacker, and the nature of the target (such as critical infrastructure)\").\n Id. at 52 (Rule 12: \"A cyber operation, or threatened cyber operation, constitutes an unlawful threat of force when the threatened action, if carried out, would be an unlawful use of force.\").\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nIn drawing this conclusion, we need to postpone the more general question of whether such interference violates another body of international law and focus for the moment on the narrower question of whether the “war” paradigm is the right way for understanding information operations aimed at undermining the legitimacy of an election. Based on the analysis in this chapter, it is quite clear that the war paradigm is deficient.\nThe one situation where there might be an argument for classifying election interference as a use of force is if the cyber-attack does more than simply penetrate election infrastructure but actually physically destroys it. So, for example, if a state were to launch a cyber-attack that caused election machines to overheat and become inoperable, there is an argument that such a cyber-attack might constitute a use of force. Or, similarly, if a cyber-attack causes the electrical system at a state board of elections to overheat and cause a fire, this too would create the physical manifestation necessary to constitute a use of force. But if the election interference of 2016 has taught us anything, it is that the most potent forms of interference involve no physical damage at all. The target of this interference is not physical locations or the lives of military or civilian personnel; the target is democratic institutions through the strategic deployment of misinformation. Social media campaigns designed to influence an election are not acts of war, though this conclusion should not blind us to the threat they pose to democratic systems. We will need to leave to the next two chapters whether international law has an alternative paradigm to describe the harm caused by these cyber-attacks.\n### C. The Armed Attack Requirement for Self-Defense\nThe prior subsection focused exclusively on the triggering conditions for the existence of an armed conflict (and hence the applicability of IHL). A distinct but related question is what constitutes an “armed attack” under article 51 of the UN Charter. The existence of an armed attack is a condition for the target being permitted to exercise lethal force in response as a defensive measure. It is important to remember that not every violation of international law triggers a right of self-defense in response. Some violations, when they rise to the level of an armed attack, are considered sufficiently serious that the victim state is entitled to unilaterally exercise defensive force even in the absence of Security Council authorization.\nThe armed attack requirement is not subject to the same intensity requirements as required by the use of force analysis by IHL in the context of a NIAC. However, given the similarities between the two tests, international lawyers have generally assumed that an armed attack for purposes of article 51 requires some physical destruction. In the Nicaragua opinion, the ICJ argued that an attack must meet a “scale and effects” criterion in order to qualify as an armed attack -- a standard that has had enormous influence in contemporary international legal and diplomatic practice. The Tallinn Manual endorses the “scale and effects” standard in the\n2. The Emerging Consensus on Cyber-War\ncontext of self-defense, though it concedes that even before the complication of cyber-attacks is added to the mix, the standard is somewhat vague and requires contentious application. Governments likely support an “effects” test for evaluating a cyber-attack because it preserves maximum flexibility for using offensive cyber-attacks in many situations that fall below the relevant “effects” threshold.\nConsequently, a cyber-attack in some circumstances could qualify as an armed attack that triggers the inherent right to self-defense article in article 51. The destruction must be foreseeable but it need not be immediate. For example, if a cyber-attack produces death or physical destruction, even if that consequence is a “downstream” consequence, it might still qualify as an armed attack, as long as the resulting destruction is a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the cyber-attack. One notable example is a cyber-attack against a water-filtration plant that prevents the target state from maintaining the quality of its water-supply; if civilians ultimately get sick or die, even if that occurs weeks or months after the original cyber-attack, this could qualify as an armed attack for purposes of article 51.\nIf a military – that is, kinetic – response is going to be authorized by international law, it makes sense to have a demanding trigger. Consequently, the majority of experts who worked on the Tallinn Manual concluded that an armed attack requires an actual or imminent territorial infringement that will cause physical damage to persons or things. The imminence requirement is a preexisting element of the\n Id. at 55 (concluding that “the parameters of the scale and effects criteria remain unsettled beyond the indication that they need to be grave”).\n See Matthew C. Waxman, Cyber-Attacks and the Use of Force: Back to the Future of Article 2(4), 36 YALE J. INT’L L. 421, 434–5 (2011) (concluding that “the U.S. government probably prefers an effects- or consequences-based interpretation of ‘force’ or ‘armed attack’ with respect to cyber-attacks not only for what it includes (and therefore what the Charter prohibits and what could trigger self-defense rights), but also for what it excludes. Computer-based espionage, intelligence collection, or even some preemptive cyber-operations or countermeasures designed to disable an adversary’s threatening capabilities, for example, would generally not constitute prohibited force because these activities do not produce destructive consequences analogous to a kinetic military attack”).\n Tallinn Manual, supra note 27, at 54 (“The International Group of Experts unanimously concluded that some cyber operations may be sufficiently grave to warrant classifying them as an ‘armed attack’ within the meaning of the Charter.”).\n See Michael Gervais, Cyber Attacks and the Laws of War, 30 BERKELEY J. INT’L L. 525, 538 (2012) (noting that “[c]yber attacks do not always intentionally target the critical infrastructure that they eventually disrupt”). For another defense of the “reasonably foreseeable” standard in this context, see Michael N. Schmitt, Computer Network Attack and the Use of Force in International Law: Thoughts on a Normative Framework, 37 COLUM. J. TRANSNAT’L. L. 885, 916 (1999) (arguing that “the nature of the act’s reasonably foreseeable consequences would be assessed to determine whether they resemble those of armed coercion”).\n However, it is certainly true that “it is very difficult from a practical standpoint to predict whether a cyber attack will lead to kinetic harm or not.” See Stephen Petkis, Rethinking Proportionality in the Cyber Context, 47 GEO. J. INT’L L. 1431, 1449 (2016).\n This example is explored in the Tallinn Manual, supra note 27, at 57.\n Tallinn Manual, supra note 27, at 54 (Rule 13: “A state that is the target of a cyber operation that rises to the level of an armed attack may exercise its inherent right of self-defense. Whether a cyber operation constitutes an armed attack depends on its scale and effects.”).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. Election Interference Is Not Cyber-War\ninternational legal doctrine on self-defense, though how imminence should be understood for a cyber-attack is more difficult than its kinetic analog. For example, an imminent military attack might be manifested in the form of air, sea, and land forces moving into position to launch a strike or invasion. The public nature of these deployments ensures that the imminent requirement can be transparently evaluated by the court of world opinion. But a cyber-attack that is brewing would not be manifested in the same public manner, because the preparatory works would most likely be private, secret, or unknown.\nThe physical damage could be caused by a physical attack or by a cyber-attack, but the resulting damage must be physical in nature. The experts concluded that “it is not the nature (injurious or destructive) of the consequences that matters, but rather the extent of the ensuing effects.” However, it should be noted that a minority of scholars working on the Tallinn Manual concluded that a cyber-attack that destroys “data,” even if it fails to destroy the computer system that houses the data, might in some circumstances constitute an armed attack. A cyber-attack that disrupts the stock exchange and causes financial damage would not produce the requisite physical damage to be considered an armed attack, though there is disagreement on this question, with a minority of scholars suggesting that the negative consequences flowing from such an attack might meet the requirements for an armed attack. Presumably, those scholars who view the “catastrophic effects” of a cyber-attack against a stock market as enough to qualify as an armed attack might also be\n However, some scholars have disputed that cyber-attacks can never be identified when they are still in the imminence window. See Ryan J. Hayward, *Evaluating the “Imminence” of A Cyber Attack for Purposes of Anticipatory Self-Defense*, 117 COLUM. L. REV. 399, 419 (2017) (concluding that “there is ample evidence to believe that investments over the past several years have dramatically improved the United States’ monitoring abilities in this arena”). The Tallinn Manual argues that the right to self-defense in response to an offensive cyber armed attack is limited by two temporal limitations. First, the original cyber-attack must have occurred or must be imminent. Second, the defensive response must be immediately necessary to counter the threat. See Tallinn Manual, *supra* note 27, at 64–5. This second immediacy requirement is especially important in cases of anticipatory self-defense.\n See Herbert S. Lin, *Offensive Cyber Operations and the Use of Force*, 4 J. NAT’L SECURITY L. &amp; POL’Y 63, 73 (2010) (suggesting that “effects rather than the modality of an action are the appropriate starting point for understanding how jus ad bellum and the U.N. Charter apply to offensive cyber operations” and concluding that “[e]ffects-based analysis suggests that the ambiguities are fewest when cyber attacks cause physical damage to property and loss of life in ways that are comparable to kinetic attacks and traditional war, because traditional LOAC provides various relevant precedents and analogies”).\n Tallinn Manual, *supra* note 27, at 56. For example, Lubell argues that it is “at least arguable that computer data is closer to what the drafters wanted to include as objects than to the notion of what they wanted to exclude as aim or purpose.” See Noam Lubell, *Lawful Targets in Cyber Operations: Does the Principle of Distinction Apply?*, 89 INT’L L. STUD. 252, 268 (2013). Lubell points out that data is, in some circumstances, more precious than physical objects; buildings can be rebuilt, but data that is not backed up (or if the backup tapes are destroyed as well) is gone forever.\n See Lubell, *supra* note 49, at 267 (concluding that “[t]he problem that arises, which is relatively unique to cyber operations, is whether data can be considered an object. While there is no definitive answer to this question, the currently prevailing view among LOAC experts appears to hold that in most cases data, for the purposes of LOAC targeting, should not be considered an object.”).\n Tallinn Manual, *supra* note 27, at 56.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. The Emerging Consensus on Cyber-War\nwilling to view similarly a cyber-attack against election infrastructure or some other form of election cyber-interference. However, this conclusion would appear to stretch the concept of “armed attack” well beyond its original meaning, at least when judged against its functional role in the overall ecosystem of *jus ad bellum*.\nSo far our discussion has focused on the requirements for triggering a military response under article 51 after a state suffers a cyber-attack. However, different rules would apply for a right of cyber-defense in response to a first cyber-attack. If both a first cyber-attack and a defensive cyber-response fall below the threshold for armed attacks, then two nations could engage in a tit-for-tat response of increasingly serious cyber-attacks, and none of it will be regulated by either *jus ad bellum* or *jus in bello*. The absence of physical destruction of persons or things will remove the cyber-engagement from the legal regulation of warfare, potentially emboldening states to engage in a wide range of cyber-activities.\nThe question in today’s world is whether states would prefer to continue these cyber-attacks without legal regulation or whether a system of reciprocal constraints on cyber-attacks below the military threshold would be a good idea. Although\n It should also be noted that the downstream “effects” of a cyber-attack could take weeks or months to be fully manifested – a factor which makes the law of war much more difficult to apply to cyber-attacks, rather than conventional military attacks where the effects are more readily ascertainable in the hours and days after the attack. See Stephen Petkis, *Rethinking Proportionality in the Cyber Context*, 47 GEO. J. INT’L L. 1431, 1448 (2016) (concluding that “the principal problem with an ‘effects test’ in the cyber context is that the nature and gravity of a cyber attack can be incredibly difficult to ascertain at the time the attack occurs. Unlike kinetic action, the true ‘effect’ of a cyber intrusion may not be known until weeks, months, or years after it is first discovered”).\n See, e.g., Michael Gervais, *Cyber Attacks and the Laws of War*, 30 BERKELEY J. INT’L L. 525, 536 (2012) (concluding that “in light of the ‘object and purpose’ of the Charter, ‘force’ should be read more narrowly. The express aim of the United Nations is to maintain international peace and security, as well as ‘to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war’. That suggests the notion of force in 1945 was limited to the military instrument.”). Gervais goes on to correctly note that “treating all forms of cyber attack as a use of force would require an implausibly broad reading of Article 2(4) that includes non-physical damage.” *Id.* at 537. But see Schmitt, *supra* note 43, at 919 (asking whether there should be a presumption that computer attacks fall in the use of force box and suggesting that “the security framework of the Charter would be best effected by application of an inclusivity presumption”).\n See Priyanka R. Dev, “Use of Force” and “Armed Attack” Thresholds in Cyber Conflict: The Looming Definitional Gaps and the Growing Need for Formal U.N. Response, 50 TEX. INT’L L.J. 381, 392–93 (2015) (musing that “an alternative solution to better encapsulate non-physical cyber effects, rather than expanding ill-fitted traditional concepts, would be for the international community to create a new threshold for actions that do not meet the traditional use of force threshold but nonetheless constitute a ‘breach of the peace’ under Article 39 of the U.N. Charter”).\n See, e.g., Matthew C. Waxman, *Cyber-Attacks and the Use of Force: Back to the Future of Article 2(4)*, 36 YALE J. INT’L L. 421, 434 (2011) (noting that “in addition to the more traditional military defense and deterrence strategies just described, the U.S. government may also be considering legal interpretations flexible enough to permit its own offensive cyber-operations below a certain threshold or against inchoate hostile cyber-activities”).\n Cyber-attacks that fall below the armed attack threshold would still be subject to international legal regulation, just not under the law of war.

Election Interference Is Not Cyber-War\nthere have been extensive calls for more regulation, perhaps even a new treaty, to govern cyber-space, the lack of serious development of explicit rules suggests that most states are interested in keeping the law open in order to preserve their flexibility going forward. Indeed, states often refuse to even acknowledge publicly when they have perpetrated or been victimized by a cyber-attack – a reticence that hampers the development of legal norms in this area.\n## D. Application of Jus in Bello Principles to Cyber-Attacks\nPrinciples of *jus in bello* apply to cyber-attacks as long as the cyber-attack either triggers an armed conflict or is launched during an armed conflict.^[57]^ Outside the context of an armed conflict, a cyber-attack would be constrained by principles of international human rights law, and general constraints embodied in public international law (including the concept of proportionality), but the more specific rules of *jus in bello* would not apply. But in the context of an armed conflict, there are at least three *jus in bello* rules that are of prime importance to consider: the principle of distinction, the prohibition on excessive collateral damage, and the combatant's privilege.^[58]^ Each will now be considered.\nThe principle of distinction requires attacking forces to limit their attacks to military objectives. A cyber-attack that takes place during an armed conflict would be subject to the same limitations.^[59]^ So, for example, a state launching a cyber-attack would be prohibited from using a cyber-weapon to disable a purely civilian system, such as a school computer system, an electrical power grid providing electricity to a civilian neighborhood, or a computer system associated with a medical-care facility. This prohibition applies not just to attacks against civilian personnel, but also to attacks against civilian installations and civilian infrastructure. This rule would explicitly permit cyber-attacks against military targets, such as a computer system for any military base, missile system, air-defense system, or even an infrastructure system that provides resources exclusively to a military system. So, for example, it would be consistent with the laws of war to use a cyber-attack to disable an oil refinery that provides oil exclusively to a nation's military, with the goal of denying tanks, Humvees, and other military vehicles the fuel that they need to operate.\n^[57]^ See, e.g., Gary D. Solis, *Cyber Warfare*, 219 MIL. L. REV. 1, 2 (2014) (noting that “[w]hether a 500-pound bomb or a computer is used to effect death and destruction, a weapon is a weapon”).\n^[58]^ Strangely, Gary Brown argues that *jus in bello* \"has little of interest to say specifically about cyber warfare\" and \"the places where actual cyber activities and the LOAC intersect are few and, in the scheme of things, not especially relevant.\" Gary D. Brown, *International Law Applies to Cyber Warfare! Now What?*, 46 SW. L. REV. 355, 356 (2017).\n^[59]^ For a discussion of this issue, see Lubell, *supra* note 49, at 252.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. The Emerging Consensus on Cyber-War\nOf course, a civilian target may be destroyed as collateral damage, provided that the collateral damage is not excessive or disproportionate to the military advantage gained by destroying the military target. In the context of a cyber-attack, it might be permissible to destroy a civilian computer system if it is a collateral consequence of destroying a military computer system, which might be the case if the two computer systems are linked together. However, if the destruction of the civilian computer system is disproportionate relative to the military advantage conferred by destroying the military computer system, the collateral damage would be disallowed by *jus in bello*. There is some uncertainty about how to apply the concept of collateral damage to cyber-attacks. Some scholars have argued that the rule against disproportionate collateral damage should apply even when the damage to the civilian system is limited to loss of *functionality* to a computer system that provides service to the civilian population, even if the computer system is not physically destroyed. The general law-of-war impulse to insulate civilians from the burdens of war applies just as much in cyber-space as it does on the kinetic battlefield.\nThe much more difficult application of this rule involves dual-infrastructure targets. Many infrastructure targets, such as power plants, oil refineries, water treatment plants and mining facilities, provide general resources for both civilian and military uses. International lawyers have been perplexed by these targets for many years, and the NATO bombing of Serbia in 1999 threw into sharp relief the legal uncertainty over their status. For example, NATO forces attacked bridges that were used by both civilian and military vehicles, and also attacked TV stations that were owned by the government and used to broadcast nationalist propaganda. Although controversial, the prevailing consensus is that dual-use infrastructure targets need to be considered as both civilian and military at the same time and evaluated on that basis. Consequently, while it might be legitimate to destroy the military-side of a dual-use infrastructure target, the destruction of the civilian part (or the civilian percentage) is only justified if it is not excessive or disproportionate to the military advantage gained by destroying the military part. So, for example, the bridge\n For a discussion of the proportionality analysis related to a cyber-attack, see Jeremy Richmond, *Evolving Battlefields: Does Stuxnet Demonstrate A Need for Modifications to the Law of Armed Conflict?*, 35 FORDHAM INT’L L.J. 842, 891 (2012) (concluding that the Stuxnet cyber-attack against Iran was proportionate because “[g]iven the minimal amount of collateral damage caused by Stuxnet, Stuxnet’s commanders were almost certainly reasonable in their calculations”).\n See, e.g., Eric Talbot Jensen, *Cyber Attacks: Proportionality and Precautions in Attack*, 89 INT’L L. STUD. 198, 206 (2013) (noting that “some have taken the view that damage also encompasses serious interruptions in functionality, such as would require replacing parts or reloading software systems. For example, in the kinetic analogy used above where a cyber attack shut down a communication port but left the rest of the computer unaffected, the computer would still turn on but its actual functionality might be seriously affected. If functionality is considered when determining damage, the kinetic analogy would be of limited value.”).\n See Captain Christopher M. Kovach, *Beyond Skynet: Reconciling Increased Autonomy in Computer-Based Weapons Systems with the Laws of War*, 71 A.F. L. REV. 231, 250 (2014) (noting that “the proliferation of dual-use facilities and systems complicates the ability of cyberweapons to limit their effects solely to lawful targets”).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. Election Interference Is Not Cyber-War\ncan be destroyed if the civilian harm is not disproportionate to the advantage conferred by denying the military use of the bridge. For a cyber-attack, this means that a computer system could be destroyed even if it has some civilian use, but only if that civilian use is not disproportionate to the military advantage. A cyber-attack against a general power grid that supplies power to both the civilian population and the military would be lawful or unlawful depending on the exact proportion of the two uses and the relative harm it would impose on the civilian population weighed against the military value of denying power to the military. The same would hold true for a cyber-attack against an oil refinery.\nThe combatant’s privilege provides immunity to military personnel who fight during an armed conflict: as long as their acts comply with the laws of war, the soldiers cannot be prosecuted by a foreign adversary in a domestic court. The privilege applies to members of armed forces and members of a militia who wear uniforms or a fixed emblem, carry arms openly, have a responsible command structure, and comply with the laws and customs of warfare. In the kinetic context, it is clear what this means. Soldiers should wear uniforms, carry their rifles openly, and comply with the laws of war. Members of the CIA or other civilian agencies who are deployed covertly, without the state acknowledging their link to the forces, are not entitled to the combatant’s privilege and could be prosecuted by the enemy upon capture. For a cyber-warrior working for the U.S. government, it is unclear how these requirements should translate. In theory, the cyber-warrior should be wearing a uniform or fixed emblem, although there is little transparency gain from a hacker’s wearing a uniform as compared to the transparency gain from an infantry soldier wearing a uniform. The problem of remoteness is not unique to cyber-warriors, since missile operators or airmen might never be seen by the enemy either and the general assumption is that these service personnel should wear identifying emblems.\nWhat does it mean for a cyber-warrior to “carry arms openly”? This is genuinely unclear and it is doubtful that there is a nonquestion-begging answer to this question. Military cyber-operations are often unacknowledged in the sense that the U.S. government will not acknowledge its role in an offensive cyber-attack, nor does it release much information about defensive cyber-activities either. To comply with the requirements of carrying arms openly and wearing a fixed emblem, should\n See Duncan B. Hollis, *Why States Need an International Law for Information Operations*, 11 LEWIS &amp; CLARK L.

Election Interference and the Law of War\n\n## 3. ELECTION INTERFERENCE AND THE LAW OF WAR\nBased on the preceding analysis, it is clear that while election interference is certainly destructive, it is not destructive in the way contemplated by the law of war. Consequently, politicians who refer to election interference as an “act of war” almost surely have the legal analysis wrong. Future National Security Advisor John Bolton referred to Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election as an act of war, a “casus belli” that Washington would not and should not accept, and argued that negotiating with Russia was dangerous. Despite their disagreements over how to approach Russia (and their disagreements about Russian election interference), Trump would later appoint Bolton as National Security Advisor. Similarly, Sen. Richard Blumenthal stated: “This was an act of war, in my view.” Blumenthal continued: “I’ve said it in various hearings before this indictment. Interestingly enough the indictment refers to information warfare, that’s the term the Russians use.” Nikki Haley, at the time US Ambassador to the United Nations, stated that “[w]hen a country can come and interfere in another country’s elections, that is warfare,” and she also described election interference as Russia’s “weapon” of choice in its conflict with the United States. Former Vice President and Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney used similar language. Many pundits and political observers referred to election interference as an act of war:\nCall it a different kind of war – asymmetric warfare, or whatever. But it is war. Whatever role Trump played in the attack, whatever he knew or didn’t know about\n As noted above, if a cyber-attack produces physical destruction, it would be regulated by the laws of war. See Thomas C. Wingfield, International Law and Information Operations, in Franklin D. Kramer, Stuart H. Starr, and Larry K. Wentz (eds.), CYBERPOWER AND NATIONAL SECURITY (Potomac Books, 2009) 538 (noting that “[i]t should be immaterial whether a refinery was destroyed by a 2,000-pound bomb or by a line of malicious code in its pressure regulation subroutine; what did matter was the size of the hole left in the ground after the attack”).\n John Bolton, Vladimir Putin Looked Trump in the Eye and Lied to Him; We Negotiate With Russia at Our Peril, THE TELEGRAPH (July 10, 2017).\n Nicholas Rondinone, Blumenthal: Russian Interference is “Act of War,” HARTFORD COURANT (Feb. 24, 2018). Blumenthal also said that: “There was clearly indisputably Russian interference in our last election, an attack on our democracy. Some would regard it, and I believe as well, an act of war.” CNN, Interview with Senator, 2017 WLNR 26117365.\n See, e.g., Associated Press, Trump UN Envoy: Russia’s Election Interference is “Warfare,” Associated Press (Oct. 19, 2017).\n See Morgan Chalfant, Cheney: Russian Election Interference Could be “Act of War,” THE HILL (Mar. 27, 2017).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. Election Interference Is Not Cyber-War\nit previously, Russia took a hostile strike against this country. And it is, so far, winning.\nOr consider the statement from one Democratic lawmaker who said that he had “no doubt” that Russian interference constituted an act of war. Even John McCain referred to it as an act of war. Other politicians referred to the Russian interference as “hybrid warfare” – a category that evokes armed conflict but at least in some usages would be defined as falling below the level of armed conflict. For example, Secretary of Defense Ash Carter said that Russia interfered in “our democratic processes” with hybrid warfare, that is “interference in the internal affairs of nations, short of war.”\nMost scholars who have considered the issue have correctly analyzed that Russian interference falls outside the scope of armed conflict, though each has struggled to articulate a convincing framing device. For example, Herb Lin has stated that:\nIW/IO is a hostile non-kinetic activity, or at least an activity that is conducted between two parties whose interests are not well-aligned. At the same time, IW/IO is not warfare in the Clausewitzian sense (nor in any sense presently recognized under the laws of war or armed conflict); it is better characterized as hostile or adversarial psychological manipulation. IW/IO has connotations of soft power (more properly, a mix of soft power and sharp power): propaganda, persuasion, culture, social forces, confusion, deception.\nOthers have similarly concluded that the interference fell below the threshold of armed conflict. Understood in this way, interference is extremely disruptive but not a subject for *jus in bello* regulation.\nOutsiders (non-lawyers) often assume that the law of war is designed to regulate every infringement of a state’s territorial or political integrity. But that is certainly not the case. The law of war is designed to regulate the use of force and the conduct of\n Michelangelo Signorile, *Russia Committed An Act Of War And Trump Won’t Talk About It*, HUFFINGTON POST (July 16, 2018).\n *Dem Calls Russia Meddling “Act of War,” Urges Cyber Attack on Moscow Banks*, THE HILL (July 17, 2018) (quoting Rep. Steve Cohen as saying “No question about it” when asked if Russian interference in the election constituted an act of war). Cohen also stated: “It was a foreign interference with our basic Democratic values. The underpinnings of Democratic society is elections, and free elections, and they invaded our country.” *Id.*\n See Jesse Hyde, *The Last Statesman: Inside the Diplomatic World of Jon Huntsman*, DESERET NEWS (Nov. 1, 2018) (noting that Sen.

Election Interference and the Law of War\n\nThe most salient examples of election interference involve either the theft and public release of private information or the posting of political views on social media platforms, often with the goal of disguising the true identity, and national origin, of the account holder. In the case of theft-and-release, a state might steal private information about a candidate – such as emails, text messages, private medical information, or confidential employment records from a human resources department – and release the damaging information to the public in order to favor a rival candidate.77 Some of the information might be real and some of the information might be doctored or otherwise misleading. In the case of the second example of election interference, the foreign state might create fake Facebook groups focusing on a particular issue or candidate, in order to drum up excitement for or against a particular candidate, or fake Twitter or Instagram accounts with the same goal in mind. Each of these activities involves foreign interference that arguably interferes with the political process and the political integrity of the target state, but neither involves the kind of physical destruction or territorial infringement that is the sine qua non of armed conflict.\nThere is a strong temptation to reduce all important issues of international law to questions of warfare. Armed conflict is a distinctive moment for international lawyers, full of peril, and the concept of warfare captures the imagination of nonlawyers. Often the critical question (does this conduct violate international law?) gets displaced by the simpler question (is the conduct a war crime?), without first considering whether war is the relevant paradigm or not. But international law is not reducible to the law of war. Public international law is so much richer than just rules regulating the use of force and the conduct of hostilities. We need to resist the temptation to put everything into a war framework. The distinct harm of election interference speaks to broader and more complex questions of political integrity that go well beyond the concept of armed conflict.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. Election Interference Is Not Cyber-War\nThat being said, it is important to recognize the impulse to analyze election interference through the war paradigm. The regulation of warfare is one of the great success stories of international law, because the discourse on warfare, both *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello*, has been wholeheartedly legalized. International lawyers discuss the rules of warfare with a precision that is almost scientific in nature. For a public grasping for certainty and legality, the law of war is an attractive horizon to steer towards. So, it is no wonder that people gravitate to the war paradigm given how successful international lawyers have been in occupying the field. But the war discussion crowds out alternative legal frameworks for understanding election interference, frameworks that focus on the political significance of elections and the way that foreign interference undermines the political integrity of the state.\nThe concept of “sovereignty” is one alternative framework.78 Clearly, a state’s violating the sovereignty of another state is illegal under some circumstances. So, it is intuitively plausible to suggest that election interference violates the sovereignty of the target state whose election is disputed, compromised, or influenced by the outside actor. The next chapter will explore “sovereignty” as a more salient legal category than armed conflict and examine both the benefits and the drawbacks of describing election interference in those terms. One noteworthy complication is the fact that the technical and doctrinal requirements for a legal infringement of sovereignty do not line up with common-sense intuitions about what counts as a violation of sovereignty. Consequently, many behaviors that sound as if they should count as sovereignty violations turn out to be perfectly legal – or at the very least contested – according to established doctrines of public international law. It also does not help that the concept of sovereignty is a cluster concept, housing diverse notions such as physical control over territory, control over a population, and expressions of a polity’s popular will. This produces a lot of cross-talking since not everyone means the same thing when they utter the word “sovereignty.”\nOne argument for focusing on sovereignty is that international law is much broader than the regulation of war. Just because election interference fails to qualify as an armed attack does not mean that the interference is lawful under international law. Similarly, even though election interference does not trigger a right of self-defense, international law might allow other responses to the interference. Under international law, a state is not required to simply suffer violations falling short of an armed attack. Victim states are entitled to use retorsions and countermeasures in an attempt to get the offending state to back off and cease the illegal behavior.\nCountermeasures and retorsions are united by the state’s intention behind their use, which is to induce the law-breaking state into compliance in the future. Countermeasures and retorsions differ in the legal status of the action used to induce\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n3. Election Interference and the Law of War\n\nOf the two, countermeasures are the more controversial because they involve conduct that would otherwise be illegal. However, it should be noted that countermeasures should not include the use of military force, which are governed by the principles of self-defense. Although the issue is somewhat contested, the majority (and better) view is that the doctrine of countermeasures cannot be used as an exception to the requirements of *jus ad bellum*. If a state wishes to use military force, it needs either Security Council authorization or a defensive claim under article 51 of the UN Charter.\nAfter the Russian interference in the 2016 election, President Obama announced sanctions designed to punish the Russian government for election interference and related behavior, including Russian interference in Ukraine.80 For example, on April 1, 2015, President Obama issued an executive order declaring that “the increasing prevalence and severity of malicious cyber-enabled activities originating from, or directed by persons located, in whole or in substantial part, outside the United States constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.”81 On December 28, 2016, Obama amended the earlier executive order and ordered the Treasury Department to freeze the assets of individuals involved in Russian cyber-interference.82\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. Election Interference Is Not Cyber-War\nIn December 2016, the Obama administration also expelled thirty-five Russian diplomats who were described as members of Russian intelligence. In a related move, the Obama administration shut down two Russian diplomatic \"compounds\" that the administration claimed were being used for intelligence collection. Though these compounds were probably connected with domestic intelligence gathering rather than troll farm activity launched from St. Petersburg, the move to shut down the compounds was part of a general package of punitive actions against Moscow. In making this move, Obama stated:\nThese actions are not the sum total of our response to Russia's aggressive activities. We will continue to take a variety of actions at a time and place of our choosing, some of which will not be publicized. In addition to holding Russia accountable for what it has done, the United States and friends and allies around the world must work together to oppose Russia's efforts to undermine established international norms of behavior, and interfere with democratic governance. To that end, my Administration will be providing a report to Congress in the coming days about Russia's efforts to interfere in our election, as well as malicious cyber activity related to our election cycle in previous elections.[83]\nIn addition to these punitive actions, it is possible that the United States also engaged in classified or covert actions that were not publicly disclosed.[84] In particular, the United States reportedly launched a cyber-attack against the Russian government as a proportional countermeasure to the election interference.[85] But the United States was careful not to describe any of its responses as either countermeasures or retorsions. Although this refusal is somewhat perplexing, it may have been connected with Obama's general reluctance to declare Russian interference as \"illegal\" under international law.[86] Describing a punitive action as a countermeasure implies a conclusion both about the illegality of the offending conduct and also the illegality of the punitive measure under nonpunitive circumstances. The United States may have preferred to preserve maximum flexibility regarding its legal position on cyber-attacks. This may\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nConclusion\nhave contributed to the Obama Administration's relative silence on Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n# CONCLUSION\nRussia's interference in the 2016 election may have violated international law, but it was neither an act of war nor was it the opening salvo in a cyber-war between the United States and Russia. But this is not to diminish its significance, or even to diminish its illegality under both U.S. and international law. It may still be illegal, and the sooner that the public recognizes that it does not trigger a right of kinetic response under article 51 of the UN Charter, the sooner a more nuanced discussion can open up about the range of permissible responses under international law, such as retorsions and countermeasures outside the context of the use of force. Political leaders have a range of options at their disposal but selecting among them requires consideration of the vast tools for enforcing international law beyond the use of force.\nTo recap the argument presented in this chapter: The principles governing *jus in bello* and *jus ad bellum* apply with equal force in the realm of cyber-attacks. A cyberattack that causes physical destruction may qualify as an armed attack triggering a right of self-defense under article 51 of the UN Charter, and a cyber-attack that causes physical destruction may constitute a resort to force that triggers the existence of an armed conflict and the application of IHL. But in the absence of physical destruction, cyber-attacks probably fall outside the scope of the laws of war. Cyberwar is a real phenomenon, but in many cases, the \"war\" suffix is, legally speaking, a metaphor. In technical discussions, the term \"war\" is meant to convey the notion of an armed conflict pursued through sustained military engagements. In contrast, most cyber-attacks have more in common with the tools of statecraft than the tools of military science. Election interference falls in the category of statecraft, though it is important to remember that even statecraft is regulated by public international law.\n See, e.g., Jack Crowe, *Rosenstein Calls Out Obama Admin For Failing to \"Publicize\" Russian Election Interference*, NATIONAL REVIEW (April 26, 2019).\n In this sense, Brown is absolutely right when he concludes that \"[l]aw is a critical aspect of discussions about the cyber aspects of privacy rights, espionage, sovereignty, international norms of behavior, and more – but none of these things is within the realm of LOAC.\" Gary D. Brown, *International Law Applies to Cyber Warfare! Now What?*, 46 SW. L. REV. 355, 356 (2017).\n See Prescott, *supra* note 1, at 48 (asserting that \"[b]elow the level of this use of force, cyber operations that result only in direct effects within cyberspace itself would not be considered uses of force regulated by LOAC, even though their indirect effects might have far-reaching and negative impacts upon the nation targeted.\"); Lubell, *supra* note 49, at 259 (concluding that \"[t]here can be plenty of cyber operations that occur outside the context of an armed conflict, such as certain types of cyber espionage between supposedly friendly countries to which the law of armed conflict would not apply\"). Lubell also argues that psychological operations (such as operations that have the goal of disseminating propaganda) \"are not considered to be ones that cause direct harm to the civilian population and, as such, can be excluded from certain restrictions placed on attacks.\" *Id.* at 263.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. Election Interference Is Not Cyber-War\nJust because a tool of statecraft falls below the legal threshold for armed conflict does not necessarily mean that the tool is part of a state's exclusive discretion, or what international lawyers sometimes call its domaine réservé.\nThe next two chapters focus on two competing frameworks for regulating cyber-election interference. Chapter 3 analyzes whether \"sovereignty\" is the correct concept, such that cyber interference might be viewed as an illegal infringement of a state's sovereignty. Among international lawyers, this is the \"preferred\" framework or the \"majority\" approach, though there are significant drawbacks to the approach, and I count myself as a dissenting voice. Then, Chapter 4 analyzes whether \"self-determination\" is a more promising framework, so that cyber interference might be viewed as a violation of a people's collective right of self-determination. This is an uncommon approach not yet adopted by public international lawyers, though they should give this approach a second look. In addition to being doctrinally salient, the concept of self-determination dovetails with our commonsense intuition that election interference is harmful because of its corrosive effect on the machinery of core democratic institutions.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press",

      "flat_text": "## INTRODUCTION\nHistorically, foreign election interference was accomplished through nondigital means. So, for example, a state might drop leaflets on a city urging the residents to take a particular action. Or, the state might broadcast messages over radio or other media. Or, the interfering state might make corrupt deals with local politicians or officials in ways that might constitute meddling. In today's world, however, these prosaic forms of interference have been replaced with their digital counterparts: the use of email hacking and fraudulent social media presence to influence the public and consequently interfere with an election. Because the method of election interference has shifted to the digital domain, there is a strong temptation to view the legality of election interference through the international legal rules governing cyber-attacks. In other words, one common assumption made by commentators is that election interference should be understood as a subcategory or particular instantiation of cyber-attacks. Although the international law governing cyber-activity is still emerging, the greatest clarity in that area stems from the international law regarding cyber-war. The majority view among international lawyers is that the regular rules governing kinetic warfare – that is, physical military movements – also apply to cyber-warfare. So, for example, an attack that would violate the law of war if conducted by planes and tanks would also violate the law of war if the same effects are produced by a cyber-attack launched by a team of hackers acting as state-cyber-combatants.\nWe will discuss this particular argument in greater detail below, but for the moment the key point is that there is a strong temptation to understand election\n For an expression of this point of view, see Jody M. Prescott, *Building the Ethical Cyber Commander and the Law of Armed Conflict*, 40 RUTGERS COMPUTER &amp; TECH. L.J. 42, 47 (2014) (“As nations move toward securing the means to conduct cyber conflict that begins to approach our common understandings of war, a consensus appears to be emerging among international organizations concerned with the implementation of LOAC, and in academia, that LOAC at least applies to those actions in cyberspace that either result in, or are intended to result in, injury to humans and damage to geophysical things.”).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\ninterference through the lens of cyber-war. In other words, some would condemn election interference as illegal under international law because it represents a form of cyber-warfare. Other lawyers and politicians will argue the opposite: that election interference does not violate international law because it does not rise to the level of a cyber-war, as if this is the end of the matter in terms of the legal analysis. What unites these two competing conclusions is the assumption that cyber-warfare is the correct framework for judging the legality of election interference. That assumption is profoundly mistaken.\nThis chapter will explain why the assumption is mistaken and why the cyber-war framework is unhelpful. Although international law is a broad and sweeping body of law, the legal regulation of warfare is one of the most prominent and successful subdisciplines of international law. So, perhaps it is not surprising that lawyers should jump to cyber-war as an attractive framing device. But the framing device is poor and sucks up oxygen from other more compelling frameworks that international law has to offer.\nIn order to explain why cyber-war is a poor fit for understanding election interference, this chapter will first explain the basic principles behind the legal regulation of warfare. Then, in Section 2, this chapter will explain how these principles apply in the context of cyber-attacks. Finally, Section 3 will consider the specific case of election interference to show why it does not constitute an illegal cyber-attack in violation of the law of war. But just because it does not violate the rules regarding cyber-war does not mean that it might not violate some other area of international law. The field of international law is at once broader and deeper than the legal regulation of armed conflict. But only by first pushing aside the most obvious framing device can we move toward more compelling and innovative frameworks for understanding the particular harm posed by foreign election interference. This argument will unfold over the course of the subsequent chapters.\n## INTERNATIONAL REGULATION OF WARFARE\n### The Distinction Between Jus ad Bellum and Jus in Bello\nThe international legal regulation of warfare is based on the foundational distinction between jus ad bellum and jus in bello -- terms that originate with the Just War philosophical tradition. Jus ad bellum regulates the recourse to force, that is, the decision to go to war in the first place. With very few exceptions, states are mostly prohibited from using military force to settle international disputes, but in some situations, the recourse to military force might be justified. In contrast, jus in bello regulates the conduct of hostilities during an armed conflict. So, for example, jus in bello passes judgment on the tactics used during an armed conflict, such as who can be targeted, in what\n2. Election Interference Is Not Cyber-War\ncircumstances, and with what weapons. For example, one of the cardinal rules of *jus in bello* is the rule prohibiting collateral damage that is excessive or disproportionate to the value of the military target. One way of explaining the distinction between *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* is that the former covers macro-questions regarding the legality of the overall war, while the latter covers micro-questions regarding the conduct of individual military operations within that war.\nThe legal domains of *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* are legally and conceptually independent, in the sense that a *jus in bello* analysis does not depend on the outcome of the *jus ad bellum* analysis. In other words, both the aggressor state and the victim state are required to follow the same rules regarding the conduct of warfare. The victim state is not entitled to more liberal rules for the conduct of warfare, just because the victim state is on the receiving end of a *jus ad bellum* violation. Conversely, the aggressor state is not subject to more restrictive conduct rules just because the aggressor state has violated *jus ad bellum* principles. In the conduct of cyber-war, this means that whether a state has violated *jus ad bellum* or not is irrelevant to the question of how the rules of *jus in bello* are applied in the context of cyber-attacks. It is important to keep the macro-level and micro-level questions separate.\nThere has been a recent trend in the philosophical literature to question the canonical separation between *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* principles. These “revisionist just war” arguments have pushed back against the classical Just War Tradition, which always assumed that the *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* domains were conceptually distinct. Under the revisionist line of thinking, philosophers have suggested that, for example, noncombatants on the victim side should be entitled to fight back against an unjust aggression, whereas under the traditional view, noncombatants are prohibited from participating in hostilities and are therefore not entitled to the combatant’s privilege. Part of the inspiration for the revisionist trend is that the ethical rules regarding killing should be the same for individuals as they are for groups. In other words, the revisionist camp aims to\n See GARY SOLIS, THE LAW OF ARMED CONFLICT 7–8 (2nd edn., Cambridge University Press, 2016) (noting that: “All’s fair in love and war? Hardly! Any divorce lawyer will attest that ‘all’ is decidedly not fair in love. Just as surely, all is not fair in war.”).\n Id. at 292–300.\n See MICHAEL WALZER, JUST AND UNJUST WARS: A MORAL ARGUMENT WITH HISTORICAL ILLUSTRATIONS 21 (3rd edn., Basic Books, 2000) (suggesting that the “two sorts of judgment are logically independent”). See also Nathaniel Berman, Privileging Combat? Contemporary Conflict and the Legal Construction of War, 43 COLUM. J. TRANSNAT’L L. 1, 27 (2004) (discussing the “indifference of jus in bello to the relative jus ad bellum merits of the parties”).\n See Jeff McMahan, War as Self-Defense, 18 ETH. &amp; INT’L AFF. 75 (2004).\n See Jeff McMahan, Innocence, Self-Defense and Killing in War, 2 J. POL. PHIL. 193–221 (1994).\n McMahan, supra note 6, at 198 (“According to virtually all accounts of the right of individual self-defense, the Culpable Attacker is not morally permitted to use lethal violence even to defend himself against his initial victim’s self-defensive response.”).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n1. International Regulation of Warfare\n\nWhatever one thinks about the philosophical legitimacy of these revisionist arguments, even the philosophers do not contend that their arguments are currently represented in international legal doctrine. The revisionist just war philosophers are making arguments about the deep morality of warfare and even some of them concede that there might be legitimate institutional or pragmatic reasons why international law separates *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* into conceptually distinct normative regimes. For example, it might be unworkable to assign to each soldier and to each civilian the task of determining whether a military invasion is justified under *jus ad bellum* before they decide how they should behave. So, the virtue of the current legal regime is that soldiers and civilians alike can fight (or not fight) in a war without having to adjudicate the contentious *jus ad bellum* questions. Whether this separation is consistent with the “deep morality” of warfare or not, it certainly makes life for the professional solider (on both sides) more workable and represents the current state of the legal regulation of warfare. It may even be morally justified as an instrumental matter, because separating the two domains might service the legitimate goal of designing real-world institutions that ensure compliance with rules that are a second-best alternative to the deep morality of war.\n## B. The Basic Rules Regarding Jus ad Bellum\nThe rules regarding *jus ad bellum* are relatively straightforward to articulate, although they are contentious when it comes to their *application*. The use of military force by one state against another state is only justified if taken in self-defense or in accordance with a Security Council authorization. Article 2(4) of the UN Charter prohibits the use of military force for the resolution of international disputes, but article 51 of the UN Charter carves out cases of self-defense from the basic article 2(4) prohibition. Article 51 imposes various requirements for the exercise of self-defense, including the existence of an armed attack against the victim\n *Id.* at 208 (“There are compelling reasons why the laws of war cannot treat the use of violence by Unjust Combatants as criminal.”).\n *Id.* at 208.\n See Janina Dill, *Should International Law Ensure the Moral Acceptability of War?*, 26 LEIDEN J. INT’L. L. 253–70 (2013).\n Article 2(4) of the UN Charter states: “All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.” Article 51 states that “Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. Measures taken by Members in the exercise of\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. Election Interference Is Not Cyber-War\nstate, and a requirement that the Security Council be informed if a state is exercising its legal right of self-defense. Although not explicitly articulated in the text of article 51, international law also imposes additional constraints, including requirements of imminence, necessity, and proportionality. The former requires that the armed attack against the victim state be imminent at the point in time when the victim state uses military force to repel the threat. The latter requirement requires that the defensive force be necessary to stop the threat; if nonmilitary measures are available to resolve the threat, the resort to defensive force is illegitimate (because it is unnecessary at the point in time when it is exercised). Any military response to an attack, undertaken in self-defense pursuant to article 51, would be constrained by the principle of proportionality, meaning that the defensive force must not be disproportionate to the legitimate interest being vindicated by the defensive force.\nThe Security Council is entitled under Chapter VII of the UN Charter to issue a binding resolution calling on member states to use military force to resolve a threat of or breach of international peace and security. Member states are not required to use military force in that situation, but they are permitted to do so; the Security Council resolution transforms what would otherwise potentially be a violation of article 2(4) into a lawful police action to enforce international law. The Security Council is therefore a clearinghouse for decisions regarding the lawfulness of military force, although individual states retain the \"inherent\" right to exercise defensive force even in situations where the Security Council fails to act to authorize military force. The Security Council may also authorize nonmilitary measures under article 41 of the UN Charter. The right to unilateral defense force is particularly important since the Security Council includes five permanent members (China, France, Russia, United States, United Kingdom), each of whom enjoys a veto, that is, the right to veto any resolution coming out of the Security Council.\nthis right of self-defence shall be immediately reported to the Security Council and shall not in any way affect the authority and responsibility of the Security Council under the present Charter to take at any time such action as it deems necessary in order to maintain or restore international peace and security.\"\n For a discussion of these requirements, see generally YORAM DINSTEIN, WAR, AGGRESSION, AND SELF-DEFENSE (Cambridge University Press, 2012).\n For a discussion of the proportionality requirement, see generally MICHAEL A. NEWTON AND LARRY MAY, PROPORTIONALITY IN INTERNATIONAL LAW (Oxford University Press, 2014).\n See art. 42 (\"Should the Security Council consider that measures provided for in Article 41 would be inadequate or have proved to be inadequate, it may take such action by air, sea, or land forces as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security. Such action may include demonstrations, blockade, and other operations by air, sea, or land forces of Members of the United Nations.\")\n See art. 51.\n See art. 41 (\"The Security Council may decide what measures not involving the use of armed force are to be employed to give effect to its decisions, and it may call upon the Members of the United Nations to apply such measures. These may include complete or partial interruption of economic relations and of rail, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio, and other means of communication, and the severance of diplomatic relations.\")\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n1. International Regulation of Warfare\n\n## C. The Basic Rules Regarding Jus in Bello\nThe rules regarding the conduct of warfare are expressed in major treaty conventions such as the four post-World War II Geneva Conventions, two additional protocols to the Geneva Conventions from 1977, and the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907. These treaty sources can be combined with rules of customary international law that equally regulate the conduct of hostilities. The rules regarding the conduct of warfare can be broadly fit into the following categories: targeting, participation in hostilities, tactics in warfare, and weaponry.\nFor example, the bedrock principle of *jus in bello* is that attacking forces should limit their attacks to enemy combatants, that is, members of enemy military forces or other militia units that meet the requirements of combatancy. Attacking forces are also entitled to attack civilians for such time as those civilians are directly participating in hostilities. It would be incongruous if a state could avoid its nationals being targeted simply by refusing to organize itself into formal military units, hence the exceptional rule that allows targeting of civilians who directly participate in hostilities. Despite this cardinal rule of distinction, civilians may be killed but only as collateral damage. By the phrase “collateral damage,” the law means that the civilians were not the object of the attack but were killed as a side effect of an attack on a lawful military objective such as a military asset or military personnel. So the difference between a violation of the principle of distinction and a case of permissible collateral damage is the attitude of the attacker. If the attacker is aiming at the civilian, the attacker has violated the principle of distinction. On the other hand, if the attacker is aiming at a lawful military objective, but still kills a civilian or a group of civilians, the civilians are considered collateral damage. The attacking force may even envision the civilian deaths, and they should still be counted as collateral damage. However, the *jus in bello* imposes a major constraint on the existence of collateral damage by prohibiting collateral\n This rule is codified in article 51(3) of Additional Protocol I (API) to the General Conventions: “Civilians shall enjoy the protection afforded by this Section, unless and for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities.”\n The principle of distinction is also sometimes referred to as the principle of discrimination. The two are roughly synonymous, though the word “distinction” is more often used by lawyers and “discrimination” is more common among philosophers of war.\n Solis dates the term “collateral damage” to the 1991 Gulf War. See SOLIS, *supra* note 2, at 295; SAHR CONWAY-LANZ, *COLLATERAL DAMAGE* 221 (Routledge, 2006).\n The question of mental intent in the context of collateral damage is somewhat complicated and has produced a series of unfortunate statements from international courts. For a discussion of this issue, see Jens David Ohlin, *Targeting and the Concept of Intent*, 35 MICH. J. INT’L L. 79 (2013).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. Election Interference Is Not Cyber-War\ndamage that is disproportionate or “excessive” to the anticipated value of the military advantage that will be gained from destroying the military target.\nThe *jus in bello* also outlaws particular tactics. Killing by perfidy is outlawed, such as pretending to be a civilian to draw out the enemy or waiving a white flag and pretending to surrender, only to kill the enemy during an ambush. These are “dishonest stratagems” as Kant called them, and impermissible as far back as the Lieber Code. Similarly, the *jus in bello* prohibits tactics that increase the suffering of the enemy (*maux superflus*) but do not produce any additional military benefit. So, in other words, it would be illegal to use a weapon that does not increase lethality but only increases the pain that the enemy will suffer before dying. Similarly, particular weapons may be outlawed by particular treaties or conventions, such as nuclear weapons (for some states that have signed nonproliferation accords), chemical weapons, cluster munitions, and landmines, though in each of these cases (other than chemical weapons) several states have refused to sign on to the conventions because they consider the weapon system in question to be necessary for strategic interests. Finally, attacking forces are not permitted to attack soldiers who are *hors de combat* because they are sick or because they have effectively communicated their surrender. Consequently, summarily executing a group of POWs (without legal process or criminal culpability) would constitute a war crime.\nThe basic structure behind the *jus in bello* is to create a special “war convention,” as Michael Walzer once described it. It creates, in other words, a special framework for the conduct of hostilities. Lawful combatants are granted the combatant’s privilege: in exchange for opening themselves up to the reciprocal risk of killing, combatants may not be prosecuted by the enemy for lawful acts of belligerency. In exchange, combatants are required to limit their attacks to military objects, thus sparing civilians from the burdens of war, as much as possible as would be consistent with the need to pursue the war effort (banning collateral damage entirely would effectively hamper warfare entirely). The requirement to carry arms openly and to avoid perfidious killing – among other prohibitions – install a basic notion of transparency in the law of war. Combatants do not simply fight for themselves as if they were fighting in a duel. Rather, combatants are representatives of the state, killing on the state’s behalf, and therefore combatants and the state “advance and retrograde” together on the field of battle, in Lieber’s\n See API, art. 51(5) (“Among others, the following types of attacks are to be considered as indiscriminate . . . (b) an attack which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.”).\n See API, art. 37(1) (“It is prohibited to kill, injure or capture an adversary by resort to perfidy. Acts inviting the confidence of an adversary to lead him to believe that he is entitled to, or is obliged to accord, protection under the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, with intent to betray that confidence, shall constitute perfidy . . .”).\n However, it should be noted that “ruses of war are not prohibited.” See API, art. 37(2).\n API, art. 35(2) (“2. It is prohibited to employ weapons, projectiles and material and methods of warfare of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering.”).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. The Emerging Consensus on Cyber-War\nfamous phrase. None of that would be possible without a basic principle of transparency in the application of *jus in bello*, which requires for its operation a tangible and public connection between individual combatants and the state on whose behalf they fight.\n## 2. THE EMERGING CONSENSUS ON CYBER-WAR\nThe last few years have witnessed a tremendous acceleration of work applying the law of war to the context of cyber-attacks. That being said, there is some uncertainty over the application of core law of war principles to cyber-space. There are several reasons for the uncertainty. The first is that there has been little diplomatic effort to codify specific international rules for cyber-attacks. One reason for the reluctance is that many lawyers believe that existing rules of IHL are adequate to the task of regulating state behavior in cyber-space. Second, some states want to preserve flexibility for their operations conducted in the cyber-realm. Third, the secretive nature of cyber-activities hampers the formation of customary rules. Customary international law develops out of state practice (action) and *opinio juris* (performing the legal action from a sense of legal obligation). But many cyber-attacks are conducted in secret, either covertly or clandestinely, and states often refuse to acknowledge their involvement in cyber-attacks. Other states will sometimes criticize those attacks, but in other situations the difficulty with “attribution” will hamper those public criticisms, thus leading to more private criticism through diplomatic channels. This dynamic scuttles or limits the formation of customary norms. However, despite these limitations, international lawyers have worked hard to explain, through soft-law mechanisms, how the law of war applies in cyber-space. One result of this effort, the Tallinn Manual, brought together experts on cyber-law and sought feedback from state governments.\nThis section outlines the state of international law regarding cyber-war: subsection A focuses on the role of the Tallinn Manual in constructing these norms; subsection B on whether cyber-wars are armed conflicts under international law; subsection C on the armed attack requirement for self-defense; and subsection D on the application of *jus in bello* principles to cyber-attacks.\n Lieber Code, art. 20 (“Public war is a state of armed hostility between sovereign nations or governments. It is a law and requisite of civilized existence that men live in political, continuous societies, forming organized units, called states or nations, whose constituents bear, enjoy, suffer, advance and retrograde together, in peace and in war.”).\n See Delbert Tran, *The Law of Attribution: Rules for Attributing the Source of A Cyber-Attack*, 20 YALE J. L. &amp; TECH. 376, 386 (2018) (noting that the “difficulty in tracing the source of a cyber-attack has long plagued discussions of cybersecurity, and much of current scholarship has accepted the traditional wisdom that the technological architecture of the internet makes attribution an exceedingly difficult problem”); Collin S. Allan, *Attribution Issues in Cyberspace*, 13 CHI.-KENT J. INT’L &amp; COMP. L. 55 (2013).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. Election Interference Is Not Cyber-War\n## A. The Role of the Tallinn Manual\nThe Tallinn Manual was initiated by the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, which is located in Tallinn, Estonia. The initiative involved a collaboration of international law and military law experts from across the world, followed by consultation and feedback from governments and their legal advisors. Although the Tallinn Manual is not a source of international law per se, it is relevant to the state of international law for two reasons. First, it may help in the formation of customary international law, as states gravitate towards particular statements of customary rules and norms, providing expression of legal rules for states to either accept or reject through the process of *opinio juris*. Second, the Tallinn Manual is a semi-authoritative statement of how experts believe that the existing law can and should be applied in cyber-space. If there is no need to amend or create new law, but simply a need to apply existing law to activities in cyber-space, then there is no requirement that the application be guided by the stringent rules for the creation of international law.\nThe Tallinn Manual focused on a variety of legal questions, including the applicability of *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* principles to cyber-attacks, and the use of countermeasures to thwart cyber-attacks. Also, the Tallinn Manual discusses violations of sovereignty that fall below the “armed attack” threshold – violations that will be the focus of the next chapter of this book.\n## B. Are Cyber-Wars Real Wars As a Matter of International Law?\nThe first threshold question is whether a cyber-war is a real “war” in the legal sense of that term as used by international lawyers. The answer to that question is yes, depending on the type of damage produced by the conflict, though this answer is a bit controversial. Some legal scholars argue that defining cyber-wars as real “armed conflicts” only functions to give state militaries control over cyber-infrastructure and cyber-governance – questions that necessarily impact civilian life and which ought not to be exclusively managed by state militaries. There is\n See TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE (Michael N. Schmitt et al. (eds.), 2013) [hereinafter cited as “Tallinn Manual”].\n The strictly defined sources of international law are generally outlined in article 38 of the ICJ Statute.\n For our purposes, the Tallinn Manual sections on cyber-war are the most relevant to our analysis.\n For example, the philosopher Larry May has argued that cyber-wars should not be understood as real “armed conflicts” in the way that international lawyers use that term. See Larry May, The Nature of War and the Idea of “Cyberwar,” in Ohlin et al. (eds.), CYBER WAR: LAW AND ETHICS FOR VIRTUAL CONFLICTS 3 (Oxford University Press, 2015) (suggesting that one could look at cyber-attacks as more like embargoes than as armed conflicts).\n See Mary Ellen O’Connell, *Cyber Security without Cyber War*, 17 J. CONFLICT &amp; SEC. L. 187, 209 (2012) (“To date, the problem of Internet security has been the domain of international law scholars with expertise in use of force questions. They have sent the message that the Internet may be protected through military force or the threat of military force, analogizing to Cold War deterrence strategy.”\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. The Emerging Consensus on Cyber-War\nwisdom in this criticism, though it is also the case that some cyber-wars should be considered significant enough to qualify as an armed conflict if they result in physical damage.\nIn terms of the application of international law, there is a widely shared definition for what counts as an armed conflict. International lawyers generally distinguish between international armed conflicts (IACs) between states, and noninternational armed conflicts (NIACs) between a state and a nonstate actor or between two nonstate actors. An IAC is triggered when there is a resort to \"armed force\" by one state against another state.[32] The standard view, though it is not codified in any treaty, is that there is no intensity threshold for this determination. In other words, an IAC exists between two states when one state uses military force against the other, regardless of how much force is used, or for how long it lasts. An IAC might involve a one-time airstrike by one state's air force, bombing targets in the other state, or the IAC might involve a full-scale land invasion that lasts for months or even years.[33] Either way, military force is traditionally thought of as involving some kinetic activity – the crossing of a border with a military asset, or the use of a confederate to destroy installations or buildings within the target state. It is very hard to think of an international armed conflict being triggered without either a border crossing or some physical destruction of at least some kind.\nIn contrast, a NIAC requires the existence of violent hostilities between a state and a nonstate actor that reaches a certain level of scope and intensity. So, for example, the state's use of physical force against a nonstate actor, such as a group of rebels, might not constitute an armed conflict if the state simply fires a few shots and arrests the members of the rebel organization. However, if there are sustained hostilities between the state and the nonstate actor that pass a certain threshold, the situation\nGovernments have followed this modelling, pouring resources into the military for keeping the Internet safe and for taking advantage of what it offers to attack opponents. Doing so has required strained analogies of cyber-attacks to conventional kinetic attacks. The Internet is now far less secure than before there was a Cyber Command or a NATO CCDCOE. It is time, therefore, to turn to cyber disarmament and a focus on peaceful protection of the Internet.\"). See also Christopher J. Finlay, Just War, Cyber War, and the Concept of Violence, 31 PHILOSOPHY &amp; TECHNOLOGY 357-77 (2018) (preferring to conceptualize cyber-attacks under the broader rubric of \"violence\" instead of \"war\"); Ryan Patterson, Silencing the Call to Arms: A Shift Away from Cyber Attacks As Warfare, 48 LOY. L. A.L. REV. 969, 975 (2015) (arguing that \"alternate legal regimes, including domestic law enforcement and the international principle of non-interference, may prove more effective frameworks to govern malicious cyber activities\"). Compare with Yoram Dinstein, Cyber War and International Law: Concluding Remarks at the 2012 Naval War College International Law Conference, 89 INT'L L. STUD. 276, 283 (2013) (\"There is nothing extraordinary in cyber warfare: it is just ordinary warfare with a little bit of extra. Cyber warfare does not merely resemble other forms of warfare: it is warfare. As such, it is directly governed by the jus in bello.\").\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. Election Interference Is Not Cyber-War\nmight graduate from a law enforcement operation to a full-blown NIAC that triggers the application of IHL rules (at least the rules that apply during a NIAC).\nAssuming that these articulations are correct statements about the international legal threshold for armed conflict, most cyber-attacks will not rise to the level of an armed conflict. Although the standard for the creation of an armed conflict is more liberal for international conflicts (IACs) than internal ones (NIACs), because the standard allows any use of force, it is unclear whether a cyber-attack would constitute a “use of force” against another state. On this question there is not universal agreement. At first blush, one can distinguish between three examples of cyber-attacks. In the first, one state uses a cyber-attack to cause damage or to destroy a physical building in the target state. For example, the state uses a cyber-attack to cause an electrical power station to overheat, resulting in an explosion and fire that destroys the power station. The second example would be a cyber-attack that is launched against a computer system in the target state, resulting in the physical destruction of the computer system but no other physical destruction. The third example would be a cyber-attack that penetrates a foreign computer system, resulting in the theft or destruction of information but no physical damage, not even physical damage to the computer system.\nAlthough experts are divided on some of these questions, there is widespread agreement that the first example would constitute a use of force that would trigger the existence of an armed conflict. In that case, a cyber-war would be a “war” in the sense of an “armed conflict” as international lawyers use the term. As the Tallinn Manual stated in its Rule 11, “A cyber operation constitutes a use force when its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force.” In making this determination, international lawyers sometimes look at the “scale and effects” of the force to determine whether it crosses the relevant threshold. In determining whether a cyber-attack constitutes a use of force, the Tallinn Manual suggests looking at the following criteria: severity, immediacy,\n Although customary international law arguably imposes the same (or similar) rules of conduct in both types of armed conflict, major treaties regulating *jus in bello* impose different legal regimes in each type of conflict. For example, the full Geneva Conventions apply during IACs, whereas only one article of the Geneva Conventions – Common article 3 – applies during NIACs.\n Solis, one of the leading American experts on the law of war, describes the standard in the following terms: “A cyber attack, as opposed to a cyber intrusion, constitutes a ‘use of force’ if undertaken by a state’s armed forces, intelligence services, or a private contractor whose conduct is attributable to the state, and its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations that rise to a level of a use of force.” Gary D. Solis, *Cyber Warfare*, 219 MIL. L. REV. 1, 15 (2014).\n Tallinn Manual, *supra* note 27, at 45.\n *Id.* at 46 (noting that “scale and effects” is a shorthand term that captures the quantitative and qualitative factors to be analysed in determining whether a cyber operation qualifies as a use of force”). The use of the “scale and effects” language in the Tallinn Manual is a bit unfortunate because it confuses the ICJ standard for armed attack within the context of self-defense for the standard for determining whether something counts as a use of force, despite the fact that the Tallinn Manual concedes that the definitions for a “use of force” and an “armed attack” are designed to “serve different normative purposes.” *Id.* at 52. That being said, the confusion is not important,\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. The Emerging Consensus on Cyber-War\n\nThe second and third examples are more complicated. Some international lawyers would consider the second example a use of force because it involved the physical destruction of a computer system. The third example is the most difficult, because many lawyers would consider the loss or theft of information to be insufficient to count as a use of force under international law. A small minority of lawyers are more liberal in their interpretation of what counts as a use of force. However, it would seem that the majority has the better of the argument, because it is hard to understand how the mere theft of information could constitute an armed attack. Indeed, it seems to be theft or destruction of information, rather than an armed attack. One might argue that the concept of an armed attack should be amended in today's world of cyber-threats, but indeed the whole point of using this legal trigger is to declare the existence of an armed conflict and trigger the application of IHL, and it is unclear how anything would be improved by triggering the application of IHL every time there is a cross-border cyber-attack. Indeed, one should remember that IHL has both a regulating and licensing function, in that it allows privileged (i.e. lawful) combatants to kill each other with personal legal immunity. So, there are some costs to the application of IHL, and placing states in a constant state of armed conflict simply because of a cyber-attack would do little to resolve international disputes peacefully.\nIn practical terms, what this means for election interference is that most cases of cyber-election interference will not trigger the existence of an armed conflict under international law. If state agents seek to influence an election by surreptitiously posting messages on social media, even if in doing so they pretend to be American citizens, this hardly seems like a \"use of force\" in the military sense of that term. Even if a state uses a cyber-attack to hack election results and change vote tallies, this clearly constitutes a substantial intrusion in the political integrity of another state, though again it is hard to qualify it as a use of force. The changing of the vote tallies would alter – arguably destroy – the legitimacy of the election results, but the problem is that international law views the concept of the use of force through a military lens, while in this case the harm seems decidedly political rather than military.\nbecause all parties agree that a cyber operation can, in theory, constitute a use of force under international law.\n Id. at 48–52 (but noting that the factors are not exhaustive and that \"States may look to others, such as the prevailing political environment, whether the cyber operation portends the future use of military force, the identity of the attacker, any record of cyber operations by the attacker, and the nature of the target (such as critical infrastructure)\").\n Id. at 52 (Rule 12: \"A cyber operation, or threatened cyber operation, constitutes an unlawful threat of force when the threatened action, if carried out, would be an unlawful use of force.\").\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nIn drawing this conclusion, we need to postpone the more general question of whether such interference violates another body of international law and focus for the moment on the narrower question of whether the “war” paradigm is the right way for understanding information operations aimed at undermining the legitimacy of an election. Based on the analysis in this chapter, it is quite clear that the war paradigm is deficient.\nThe one situation where there might be an argument for classifying election interference as a use of force is if the cyber-attack does more than simply penetrate election infrastructure but actually physically destroys it. So, for example, if a state were to launch a cyber-attack that caused election machines to overheat and become inoperable, there is an argument that such a cyber-attack might constitute a use of force. Or, similarly, if a cyber-attack causes the electrical system at a state board of elections to overheat and cause a fire, this too would create the physical manifestation necessary to constitute a use of force. But if the election interference of 2016 has taught us anything, it is that the most potent forms of interference involve no physical damage at all. The target of this interference is not physical locations or the lives of military or civilian personnel; the target is democratic institutions through the strategic deployment of misinformation. Social media campaigns designed to influence an election are not acts of war, though this conclusion should not blind us to the threat they pose to democratic systems. We will need to leave to the next two chapters whether international law has an alternative paradigm to describe the harm caused by these cyber-attacks.\n### C. The Armed Attack Requirement for Self-Defense\nThe prior subsection focused exclusively on the triggering conditions for the existence of an armed conflict (and hence the applicability of IHL). A distinct but related question is what constitutes an “armed attack” under article 51 of the UN Charter. The existence of an armed attack is a condition for the target being permitted to exercise lethal force in response as a defensive measure. It is important to remember that not every violation of international law triggers a right of self-defense in response. Some violations, when they rise to the level of an armed attack, are considered sufficiently serious that the victim state is entitled to unilaterally exercise defensive force even in the absence of Security Council authorization.\nThe armed attack requirement is not subject to the same intensity requirements as required by the use of force analysis by IHL in the context of a NIAC. However, given the similarities between the two tests, international lawyers have generally assumed that an armed attack for purposes of article 51 requires some physical destruction. In the Nicaragua opinion, the ICJ argued that an attack must meet a “scale and effects” criterion in order to qualify as an armed attack -- a standard that has had enormous influence in contemporary international legal and diplomatic practice. The Tallinn Manual endorses the “scale and effects” standard in the\n2. The Emerging Consensus on Cyber-War\ncontext of self-defense, though it concedes that even before the complication of cyber-attacks is added to the mix, the standard is somewhat vague and requires contentious application. Governments likely support an “effects” test for evaluating a cyber-attack because it preserves maximum flexibility for using offensive cyber-attacks in many situations that fall below the relevant “effects” threshold.\nConsequently, a cyber-attack in some circumstances could qualify as an armed attack that triggers the inherent right to self-defense article in article 51. The destruction must be foreseeable but it need not be immediate. For example, if a cyber-attack produces death or physical destruction, even if that consequence is a “downstream” consequence, it might still qualify as an armed attack, as long as the resulting destruction is a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the cyber-attack. One notable example is a cyber-attack against a water-filtration plant that prevents the target state from maintaining the quality of its water-supply; if civilians ultimately get sick or die, even if that occurs weeks or months after the original cyber-attack, this could qualify as an armed attack for purposes of article 51.\nIf a military – that is, kinetic – response is going to be authorized by international law, it makes sense to have a demanding trigger. Consequently, the majority of experts who worked on the Tallinn Manual concluded that an armed attack requires an actual or imminent territorial infringement that will cause physical damage to persons or things. The imminence requirement is a preexisting element of the\n Id. at 55 (concluding that “the parameters of the scale and effects criteria remain unsettled beyond the indication that they need to be grave”).\n See Matthew C. Waxman, Cyber-Attacks and the Use of Force: Back to the Future of Article 2(4), 36 YALE J. INT’L L. 421, 434–5 (2011) (concluding that “the U.S. government probably prefers an effects- or consequences-based interpretation of ‘force’ or ‘armed attack’ with respect to cyber-attacks not only for what it includes (and therefore what the Charter prohibits and what could trigger self-defense rights), but also for what it excludes. Computer-based espionage, intelligence collection, or even some preemptive cyber-operations or countermeasures designed to disable an adversary’s threatening capabilities, for example, would generally not constitute prohibited force because these activities do not produce destructive consequences analogous to a kinetic military attack”).\n Tallinn Manual, supra note 27, at 54 (“The International Group of Experts unanimously concluded that some cyber operations may be sufficiently grave to warrant classifying them as an ‘armed attack’ within the meaning of the Charter.”).\n See Michael Gervais, Cyber Attacks and the Laws of War, 30 BERKELEY J. INT’L L. 525, 538 (2012) (noting that “[c]yber attacks do not always intentionally target the critical infrastructure that they eventually disrupt”). For another defense of the “reasonably foreseeable” standard in this context, see Michael N. Schmitt, Computer Network Attack and the Use of Force in International Law: Thoughts on a Normative Framework, 37 COLUM. J. TRANSNAT’L. L. 885, 916 (1999) (arguing that “the nature of the act’s reasonably foreseeable consequences would be assessed to determine whether they resemble those of armed coercion”).\n However, it is certainly true that “it is very difficult from a practical standpoint to predict whether a cyber attack will lead to kinetic harm or not.” See Stephen Petkis, Rethinking Proportionality in the Cyber Context, 47 GEO. J. INT’L L. 1431, 1449 (2016).\n This example is explored in the Tallinn Manual, supra note 27, at 57.\n Tallinn Manual, supra note 27, at 54 (Rule 13: “A state that is the target of a cyber operation that rises to the level of an armed attack may exercise its inherent right of self-defense. Whether a cyber operation constitutes an armed attack depends on its scale and effects.”).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. Election Interference Is Not Cyber-War\ninternational legal doctrine on self-defense, though how imminence should be understood for a cyber-attack is more difficult than its kinetic analog. For example, an imminent military attack might be manifested in the form of air, sea, and land forces moving into position to launch a strike or invasion. The public nature of these deployments ensures that the imminent requirement can be transparently evaluated by the court of world opinion. But a cyber-attack that is brewing would not be manifested in the same public manner, because the preparatory works would most likely be private, secret, or unknown.\nThe physical damage could be caused by a physical attack or by a cyber-attack, but the resulting damage must be physical in nature. The experts concluded that “it is not the nature (injurious or destructive) of the consequences that matters, but rather the extent of the ensuing effects.” However, it should be noted that a minority of scholars working on the Tallinn Manual concluded that a cyber-attack that destroys “data,” even if it fails to destroy the computer system that houses the data, might in some circumstances constitute an armed attack. A cyber-attack that disrupts the stock exchange and causes financial damage would not produce the requisite physical damage to be considered an armed attack, though there is disagreement on this question, with a minority of scholars suggesting that the negative consequences flowing from such an attack might meet the requirements for an armed attack. Presumably, those scholars who view the “catastrophic effects” of a cyber-attack against a stock market as enough to qualify as an armed attack might also be\n However, some scholars have disputed that cyber-attacks can never be identified when they are still in the imminence window. See Ryan J. Hayward, *Evaluating the “Imminence” of A Cyber Attack for Purposes of Anticipatory Self-Defense*, 117 COLUM. L. REV. 399, 419 (2017) (concluding that “there is ample evidence to believe that investments over the past several years have dramatically improved the United States’ monitoring abilities in this arena”). The Tallinn Manual argues that the right to self-defense in response to an offensive cyber armed attack is limited by two temporal limitations. First, the original cyber-attack must have occurred or must be imminent. Second, the defensive response must be immediately necessary to counter the threat. See Tallinn Manual, *supra* note 27, at 64–5. This second immediacy requirement is especially important in cases of anticipatory self-defense.\n See Herbert S. Lin, *Offensive Cyber Operations and the Use of Force*, 4 J. NAT’L SECURITY L. &amp; POL’Y 63, 73 (2010) (suggesting that “effects rather than the modality of an action are the appropriate starting point for understanding how jus ad bellum and the U.N. Charter apply to offensive cyber operations” and concluding that “[e]ffects-based analysis suggests that the ambiguities are fewest when cyber attacks cause physical damage to property and loss of life in ways that are comparable to kinetic attacks and traditional war, because traditional LOAC provides various relevant precedents and analogies”).\n Tallinn Manual, *supra* note 27, at 56. For example, Lubell argues that it is “at least arguable that computer data is closer to what the drafters wanted to include as objects than to the notion of what they wanted to exclude as aim or purpose.” See Noam Lubell, *Lawful Targets in Cyber Operations: Does the Principle of Distinction Apply?*, 89 INT’L L. STUD. 252, 268 (2013). Lubell points out that data is, in some circumstances, more precious than physical objects; buildings can be rebuilt, but data that is not backed up (or if the backup tapes are destroyed as well) is gone forever.\n See Lubell, *supra* note 49, at 267 (concluding that “[t]he problem that arises, which is relatively unique to cyber operations, is whether data can be considered an object. While there is no definitive answer to this question, the currently prevailing view among LOAC experts appears to hold that in most cases data, for the purposes of LOAC targeting, should not be considered an object.”).\n Tallinn Manual, *supra* note 27, at 56.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. The Emerging Consensus on Cyber-War\nwilling to view similarly a cyber-attack against election infrastructure or some other form of election cyber-interference. However, this conclusion would appear to stretch the concept of “armed attack” well beyond its original meaning, at least when judged against its functional role in the overall ecosystem of *jus ad bellum*.\nSo far our discussion has focused on the requirements for triggering a military response under article 51 after a state suffers a cyber-attack. However, different rules would apply for a right of cyber-defense in response to a first cyber-attack. If both a first cyber-attack and a defensive cyber-response fall below the threshold for armed attacks, then two nations could engage in a tit-for-tat response of increasingly serious cyber-attacks, and none of it will be regulated by either *jus ad bellum* or *jus in bello*. The absence of physical destruction of persons or things will remove the cyber-engagement from the legal regulation of warfare, potentially emboldening states to engage in a wide range of cyber-activities.\nThe question in today’s world is whether states would prefer to continue these cyber-attacks without legal regulation or whether a system of reciprocal constraints on cyber-attacks below the military threshold would be a good idea. Although\n It should also be noted that the downstream “effects” of a cyber-attack could take weeks or months to be fully manifested – a factor which makes the law of war much more difficult to apply to cyber-attacks, rather than conventional military attacks where the effects are more readily ascertainable in the hours and days after the attack. See Stephen Petkis, *Rethinking Proportionality in the Cyber Context*, 47 GEO. J. INT’L L. 1431, 1448 (2016) (concluding that “the principal problem with an ‘effects test’ in the cyber context is that the nature and gravity of a cyber attack can be incredibly difficult to ascertain at the time the attack occurs. Unlike kinetic action, the true ‘effect’ of a cyber intrusion may not be known until weeks, months, or years after it is first discovered”).\n See, e.g., Michael Gervais, *Cyber Attacks and the Laws of War*, 30 BERKELEY J. INT’L L. 525, 536 (2012) (concluding that “in light of the ‘object and purpose’ of the Charter, ‘force’ should be read more narrowly. The express aim of the United Nations is to maintain international peace and security, as well as ‘to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war’. That suggests the notion of force in 1945 was limited to the military instrument.”). Gervais goes on to correctly note that “treating all forms of cyber attack as a use of force would require an implausibly broad reading of Article 2(4) that includes non-physical damage.” *Id.* at 537. But see Schmitt, *supra* note 43, at 919 (asking whether there should be a presumption that computer attacks fall in the use of force box and suggesting that “the security framework of the Charter would be best effected by application of an inclusivity presumption”).\n See Priyanka R.

INT’L L.J. 381, 392–93 (2015) (musing that “an alternative solution to better encapsulate non-physical cyber effects, rather than expanding ill-fitted traditional concepts, would be for the international community to create a new threshold for actions that do not meet the traditional use of force threshold but nonetheless constitute a ‘breach of the peace’ under Article 39 of the U.N. Charter”).\n See, e.g., Matthew C. Waxman, *Cyber-Attacks and the Use of Force: Back to the Future of Article 2(4)*, 36 YALE J. INT’L L. 421, 434 (2011) (noting that “in addition to the more traditional military defense and deterrence strategies just described, the U.S. government may also be considering legal interpretations flexible enough to permit its own offensive cyber-operations below a certain threshold or against inchoate hostile cyber-activities”).\n Cyber-attacks that fall below the armed attack threshold would still be subject to international legal regulation, just not under the law of war.

Election Interference Is Not Cyber-War\nthere have been extensive calls for more regulation, perhaps even a new treaty, to govern cyber-space, the lack of serious development of explicit rules suggests that most states are interested in keeping the law open in order to preserve their flexibility going forward. Indeed, states often refuse to even acknowledge publicly when they have perpetrated or been victimized by a cyber-attack – a reticence that hampers the development of legal norms in this area.\n## D. Application of Jus in Bello Principles to Cyber-Attacks\nPrinciples of *jus in bello* apply to cyber-attacks as long as the cyber-attack either triggers an armed conflict or is launched during an armed conflict.^[57]^ Outside the context of an armed conflict, a cyber-attack would be constrained by principles of international human rights law, and general constraints embodied in public international law (including the concept of proportionality), but the more specific rules of *jus in bello* would not apply. But in the context of an armed conflict, there are at least three *jus in bello* rules that are of prime importance to consider: the principle of distinction, the prohibition on excessive collateral damage, and the combatant's privilege.^[58]^ Each will now be considered.\nThe principle of distinction requires attacking forces to limit their attacks to military objectives. A cyber-attack that takes place during an armed conflict would be subject to the same limitations.^[59]^ So, for example, a state launching a cyber-attack would be prohibited from using a cyber-weapon to disable a purely civilian system, such as a school computer system, an electrical power grid providing electricity to a civilian neighborhood, or a computer system associated with a medical-care facility. This prohibition applies not just to attacks against civilian personnel, but also to attacks against civilian installations and civilian infrastructure. This rule would explicitly permit cyber-attacks against military targets, such as a computer system for any military base, missile system, air-defense system, or even an infrastructure system that provides resources exclusively to a military system. So, for example, it would be consistent with the laws of war to use a cyber-attack to disable an oil refinery that provides oil exclusively to a nation's military, with the goal of denying tanks, Humvees, and other military vehicles the fuel that they need to operate.\n^[57]^ See, e.g., Gary D. Solis, *Cyber Warfare*, 219 MIL. L. REV. 1, 2 (2014) (noting that “[w]hether a 500-pound bomb or a computer is used to effect death and destruction, a weapon is a weapon”).\n^[58]^ Strangely, Gary Brown argues that *jus in bello* \"has little of interest to say specifically about cyber warfare\" and \"the places where actual cyber activities and the LOAC intersect are few and, in the scheme of things, not especially relevant.\" Gary D. Brown, *International Law Applies to Cyber Warfare! Now What?*, 46 SW. L. REV. 355, 356 (2017).\n^[59]^ For a discussion of this issue, see Lubell, *supra* note 49, at 252.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. The Emerging Consensus on Cyber-War\nOf course, a civilian target may be destroyed as collateral damage, provided that the collateral damage is not excessive or disproportionate to the military advantage gained by destroying the military target. In the context of a cyber-attack, it might be permissible to destroy a civilian computer system if it is a collateral consequence of destroying a military computer system, which might be the case if the two computer systems are linked together. However, if the destruction of the civilian computer system is disproportionate relative to the military advantage conferred by destroying the military computer system, the collateral damage would be disallowed by *jus in bello*. There is some uncertainty about how to apply the concept of collateral damage to cyber-attacks. Some scholars have argued that the rule against disproportionate collateral damage should apply even when the damage to the civilian system is limited to loss of *functionality* to a computer system that provides service to the civilian population, even if the computer system is not physically destroyed. The general law-of-war impulse to insulate civilians from the burdens of war applies just as much in cyber-space as it does on the kinetic battlefield.\nThe much more difficult application of this rule involves dual-infrastructure targets. Many infrastructure targets, such as power plants, oil refineries, water treatment plants and mining facilities, provide general resources for both civilian and military uses. International lawyers have been perplexed by these targets for many years, and the NATO bombing of Serbia in 1999 threw into sharp relief the legal uncertainty over their status. For example, NATO forces attacked bridges that were used by both civilian and military vehicles, and also attacked TV stations that were owned by the government and used to broadcast nationalist propaganda. Although controversial, the prevailing consensus is that dual-use infrastructure targets need to be considered as both civilian and military at the same time and evaluated on that basis. Consequently, while it might be legitimate to destroy the military-side of a dual-use infrastructure target, the destruction of the civilian part (or the civilian percentage) is only justified if it is not excessive or disproportionate to the military advantage gained by destroying the military part. So, for example, the bridge\n For a discussion of the proportionality analysis related to a cyber-attack, see Jeremy Richmond, *Evolving Battlefields: Does Stuxnet Demonstrate A Need for Modifications to the Law of Armed Conflict?*, 35 FORDHAM INT’L L.J. 842, 891 (2012) (concluding that the Stuxnet cyber-attack against Iran was proportionate because “[g]iven the minimal amount of collateral damage caused by Stuxnet, Stuxnet’s commanders were almost certainly reasonable in their calculations”).\n See, e.g., Eric Talbot Jensen, *Cyber Attacks: Proportionality and Precautions in Attack*, 89 INT’L L. STUD. 198, 206 (2013) (noting that “some have taken the view that damage also encompasses serious interruptions in functionality, such as would require replacing parts or reloading software systems. For example, in the kinetic analogy used above where a cyber attack shut down a communication port but left the rest of the computer unaffected, the computer would still turn on but its actual functionality might be seriously affected. If functionality is considered when determining damage, the kinetic analogy would be of limited value.”).\n See Captain Christopher M. Kovach, *Beyond Skynet: Reconciling Increased Autonomy in Computer-Based Weapons Systems with the Laws of War*, 71 A.F. L. REV. 231, 250 (2014) (noting that “the proliferation of dual-use facilities and systems complicates the ability of cyberweapons to limit their effects solely to lawful targets”).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. Election Interference Is Not Cyber-War\ncan be destroyed if the civilian harm is not disproportionate to the advantage conferred by denying the military use of the bridge. For a cyber-attack, this means that a computer system could be destroyed even if it has some civilian use, but only if that civilian use is not disproportionate to the military advantage. A cyber-attack against a general power grid that supplies power to both the civilian population and the military would be lawful or unlawful depending on the exact proportion of the two uses and the relative harm it would impose on the civilian population weighed against the military value of denying power to the military. The same would hold true for a cyber-attack against an oil refinery.\nThe combatant’s privilege provides immunity to military personnel who fight during an armed conflict: as long as their acts comply with the laws of war, the soldiers cannot be prosecuted by a foreign adversary in a domestic court. The privilege applies to members of armed forces and members of a militia who wear uniforms or a fixed emblem, carry arms openly, have a responsible command structure, and comply with the laws and customs of warfare. In the kinetic context, it is clear what this means. Soldiers should wear uniforms, carry their rifles openly, and comply with the laws of war. Members of the CIA or other civilian agencies who are deployed covertly, without the state acknowledging their link to the forces, are not entitled to the combatant’s privilege and could be prosecuted by the enemy upon capture. For a cyber-warrior working for the U.S. government, it is unclear how these requirements should translate. In theory, the cyber-warrior should be wearing a uniform or fixed emblem, although there is little transparency gain from a hacker’s wearing a uniform as compared to the transparency gain from an infantry soldier wearing a uniform. The problem of remoteness is not unique to cyber-warriors, since missile operators or airmen might never be seen by the enemy either and the general assumption is that these service personnel should wear identifying emblems.\nWhat does it mean for a cyber-warrior to “carry arms openly”? This is genuinely unclear and it is doubtful that there is a nonquestion-begging answer to this question. Military cyber-operations are often unacknowledged in the sense that the U.S. government will not acknowledge its role in an offensive cyber-attack, nor does it release much information about defensive cyber-activities either. To comply with the requirements of carrying arms openly and wearing a fixed emblem, should\n See Duncan B.

Election Interference and the Law of War\n\n## 3. ELECTION INTERFERENCE AND THE LAW OF WAR\nBased on the preceding analysis, it is clear that while election interference is certainly destructive, it is not destructive in the way contemplated by the law of war. Consequently, politicians who refer to election interference as an “act of war” almost surely have the legal analysis wrong. Future National Security Advisor John Bolton referred to Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election as an act of war, a “casus belli” that Washington would not and should not accept, and argued that negotiating with Russia was dangerous. Despite their disagreements over how to approach Russia (and their disagreements about Russian election interference), Trump would later appoint Bolton as National Security Advisor. Similarly, Sen. Richard Blumenthal stated: “This was an act of war, in my view.” Blumenthal continued: “I’ve said it in various hearings before this indictment. Interestingly enough the indictment refers to information warfare, that’s the term the Russians use.” Nikki Haley, at the time US Ambassador to the United Nations, stated that “[w]hen a country can come and interfere in another country’s elections, that is warfare,” and she also described election interference as Russia’s “weapon” of choice in its conflict with the United States. Former Vice President and Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney used similar language. Many pundits and political observers referred to election interference as an act of war:\nCall it a different kind of war – asymmetric warfare, or whatever. But it is war. Whatever role Trump played in the attack, whatever he knew or didn’t know about\n As noted above, if a cyber-attack produces physical destruction, it would be regulated by the laws of war. See Thomas C. Wingfield, International Law and Information Operations, in Franklin D. Kramer, Stuart H. Starr, and Larry K. Wentz (eds.), CYBERPOWER AND NATIONAL SECURITY (Potomac Books, 2009) 538 (noting that “[i]t should be immaterial whether a refinery was destroyed by a 2,000-pound bomb or by a line of malicious code in its pressure regulation subroutine; what did matter was the size of the hole left in the ground after the attack”).\n John Bolton, Vladimir Putin Looked Trump in the Eye and Lied to Him; We Negotiate With Russia at Our Peril, THE TELEGRAPH (July 10, 2017).\n Nicholas Rondinone, Blumenthal: Russian Interference is “Act of War,” HARTFORD COURANT (Feb. 24, 2018). Blumenthal also said that: “There was clearly indisputably Russian interference in our last election, an attack on our democracy. Some would regard it, and I believe as well, an act of war.” CNN, Interview with Senator, 2017 WLNR 26117365.\n See, e.g., Associated Press, Trump UN Envoy: Russia’s Election Interference is “Warfare,” Associated Press (Oct. 19, 2017).\n See Morgan Chalfant, Cheney: Russian Election Interference Could be “Act of War,” THE HILL (Mar. 27, 2017).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. Election Interference Is Not Cyber-War\nit previously, Russia took a hostile strike against this country. And it is, so far, winning.\nOr consider the statement from one Democratic lawmaker who said that he had “no doubt” that Russian interference constituted an act of war. Even John McCain referred to it as an act of war. Other politicians referred to the Russian interference as “hybrid warfare” – a category that evokes armed conflict but at least in some usages would be defined as falling below the level of armed conflict. For example, Secretary of Defense Ash Carter said that Russia interfered in “our democratic processes” with hybrid warfare, that is “interference in the internal affairs of nations, short of war.”\nMost scholars who have considered the issue have correctly analyzed that Russian interference falls outside the scope of armed conflict, though each has struggled to articulate a convincing framing device. For example, Herb Lin has stated that:\nIW/IO is a hostile non-kinetic activity, or at least an activity that is conducted between two parties whose interests are not well-aligned. At the same time, IW/IO is not warfare in the Clausewitzian sense (nor in any sense presently recognized under the laws of war or armed conflict); it is better characterized as hostile or adversarial psychological manipulation. IW/IO has connotations of soft power (more properly, a mix of soft power and sharp power): propaganda, persuasion, culture, social forces, confusion, deception.\nOthers have similarly concluded that the interference fell below the threshold of armed conflict. Understood in this way, interference is extremely disruptive but not a subject for *jus in bello* regulation.\nOutsiders (non-lawyers) often assume that the law of war is designed to regulate every infringement of a state’s territorial or political integrity. But that is certainly not the case. The law of war is designed to regulate the use of force and the conduct of\n Michelangelo Signorile, *Russia Committed An Act Of War And Trump Won’t Talk About It*, HUFFINGTON POST (July 16, 2018).\n *Dem Calls Russia Meddling “Act of War,” Urges Cyber Attack on Moscow Banks*, THE HILL (July 17, 2018) (quoting Rep. Steve Cohen as saying “No question about it” when asked if Russian interference in the election constituted an act of war). Cohen also stated: “It was a foreign interference with our basic Democratic values. The underpinnings of Democratic society is elections, and free elections, and they invaded our country.” *Id.*\n See Jesse Hyde, *The Last Statesman: Inside the Diplomatic World of Jon Huntsman*, DESERET NEWS (Nov. 1, 2018) (noting that Sen.

Those actions can be tremendously disruptive, as we have seen in examples as wide-ranging as the Sony hack and the reported interference of Russia in U.S. elections.”).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n3. Election Interference and the Law of War\n\nThe most salient examples of election interference involve either the theft and public release of private information or the posting of political views on social media platforms, often with the goal of disguising the true identity, and national origin, of the account holder. In the case of theft-and-release, a state might steal private information about a candidate – such as emails, text messages, private medical information, or confidential employment records from a human resources department – and release the damaging information to the public in order to favor a rival candidate.77 Some of the information might be real and some of the information might be doctored or otherwise misleading. In the case of the second example of election interference, the foreign state might create fake Facebook groups focusing on a particular issue or candidate, in order to drum up excitement for or against a particular candidate, or fake Twitter or Instagram accounts with the same goal in mind. Each of these activities involves foreign interference that arguably interferes with the political process and the political integrity of the target state, but neither involves the kind of physical destruction or territorial infringement that is the sine qua non of armed conflict.\nThere is a strong temptation to reduce all important issues of international law to questions of warfare. Armed conflict is a distinctive moment for international lawyers, full of peril, and the concept of warfare captures the imagination of nonlawyers. Often the critical question (does this conduct violate international law?) gets displaced by the simpler question (is the conduct a war crime?), without first considering whether war is the relevant paradigm or not. But international law is not reducible to the law of war. Public international law is so much richer than just rules regulating the use of force and the conduct of hostilities. We need to resist the temptation to put everything into a war framework. The distinct harm of election interference speaks to broader and more complex questions of political integrity that go well beyond the concept of armed conflict.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. Election Interference Is Not Cyber-War\nThat being said, it is important to recognize the impulse to analyze election interference through the war paradigm. The regulation of warfare is one of the great success stories of international law, because the discourse on warfare, both *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello*, has been wholeheartedly legalized. International lawyers discuss the rules of warfare with a precision that is almost scientific in nature. For a public grasping for certainty and legality, the law of war is an attractive horizon to steer towards. So, it is no wonder that people gravitate to the war paradigm given how successful international lawyers have been in occupying the field. But the war discussion crowds out alternative legal frameworks for understanding election interference, frameworks that focus on the political significance of elections and the way that foreign interference undermines the political integrity of the state.\nThe concept of “sovereignty” is one alternative framework.78 Clearly, a state’s violating the sovereignty of another state is illegal under some circumstances. So, it is intuitively plausible to suggest that election interference violates the sovereignty of the target state whose election is disputed, compromised, or influenced by the outside actor. The next chapter will explore “sovereignty” as a more salient legal category than armed conflict and examine both the benefits and the drawbacks of describing election interference in those terms. One noteworthy complication is the fact that the technical and doctrinal requirements for a legal infringement of sovereignty do not line up with common-sense intuitions about what counts as a violation of sovereignty. Consequently, many behaviors that sound as if they should count as sovereignty violations turn out to be perfectly legal – or at the very least contested – according to established doctrines of public international law. It also does not help that the concept of sovereignty is a cluster concept, housing diverse notions such as physical control over territory, control over a population, and expressions of a polity’s popular will. This produces a lot of cross-talking since not everyone means the same thing when they utter the word “sovereignty.”\nOne argument for focusing on sovereignty is that international law is much broader than the regulation of war. Just because election interference fails to qualify as an armed attack does not mean that the interference is lawful under international law. Similarly, even though election interference does not trigger a right of self-defense, international law might allow other responses to the interference. Under international law, a state is not required to simply suffer violations falling short of an armed attack. Victim states are entitled to use retorsions and countermeasures in an attempt to get the offending state to back off and cease the illegal behavior.\nCountermeasures and retorsions are united by the state’s intention behind their use, which is to induce the law-breaking state into compliance in the future. Countermeasures and retorsions differ in the legal status of the action used to induce\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n3. Election Interference and the Law of War\n\nOf the two, countermeasures are the more controversial because they involve conduct that would otherwise be illegal. However, it should be noted that countermeasures should not include the use of military force, which are governed by the principles of self-defense. Although the issue is somewhat contested, the majority (and better) view is that the doctrine of countermeasures cannot be used as an exception to the requirements of *jus ad bellum*. If a state wishes to use military force, it needs either Security Council authorization or a defensive claim under article 51 of the UN Charter.\nAfter the Russian interference in the 2016 election, President Obama announced sanctions designed to punish the Russian government for election interference and related behavior, including Russian interference in Ukraine.80 For example, on April 1, 2015, President Obama issued an executive order declaring that “the increasing prevalence and severity of malicious cyber-enabled activities originating from, or directed by persons located, in whole or in substantial part, outside the United States constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.”81 On December 28, 2016, Obama amended the earlier executive order and ordered the Treasury Department to freeze the assets of individuals involved in Russian cyber-interference.82\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. Election Interference Is Not Cyber-War\nIn December 2016, the Obama administration also expelled thirty-five Russian diplomats who were described as members of Russian intelligence. In a related move, the Obama administration shut down two Russian diplomatic \"compounds\" that the administration claimed were being used for intelligence collection. Though these compounds were probably connected with domestic intelligence gathering rather than troll farm activity launched from St. Petersburg, the move to shut down the compounds was part of a general package of punitive actions against Moscow. In making this move, Obama stated:\nThese actions are not the sum total of our response to Russia's aggressive activities. We will continue to take a variety of actions at a time and place of our choosing, some of which will not be publicized. In addition to holding Russia accountable for what it has done, the United States and friends and allies around the world must work together to oppose Russia's efforts to undermine established international norms of behavior, and interfere with democratic governance. To that end, my Administration will be providing a report to Congress in the coming days about Russia's efforts to interfere in our election, as well as malicious cyber activity related to our election cycle in previous elections.[83]\nIn addition to these punitive actions, it is possible that the United States also engaged in classified or covert actions that were not publicly disclosed.[84] In particular, the United States reportedly launched a cyber-attack against the Russian government as a proportional countermeasure to the election interference.[85] But the United States was careful not to describe any of its responses as either countermeasures or retorsions. Although this refusal is somewhat perplexing, it may have been connected with Obama's general reluctance to declare Russian interference as \"illegal\" under international law.[86] Describing a punitive action as a countermeasure implies a conclusion both about the illegality of the offending conduct and also the illegality of the punitive measure under nonpunitive circumstances. The United States may have preferred to preserve maximum flexibility regarding its legal position on cyber-attacks. This may\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nConclusion\nhave contributed to the Obama Administration's relative silence on Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n# CONCLUSION\nRussia's interference in the 2016 election may have violated international law, but it was neither an act of war nor was it the opening salvo in a cyber-war between the United States and Russia. But this is not to diminish its significance, or even to diminish its illegality under both U.S. and international law. It may still be illegal, and the sooner that the public recognizes that it does not trigger a right of kinetic response under article 51 of the UN Charter, the sooner a more nuanced discussion can open up about the range of permissible responses under international law, such as retorsions and countermeasures outside the context of the use of force. Political leaders have a range of options at their disposal but selecting among them requires consideration of the vast tools for enforcing international law beyond the use of force.\nTo recap the argument presented in this chapter: The principles governing *jus in bello* and *jus ad bellum* apply with equal force in the realm of cyber-attacks. A cyberattack that causes physical destruction may qualify as an armed attack triggering a right of self-defense under article 51 of the UN Charter, and a cyber-attack that causes physical destruction may constitute a resort to force that triggers the existence of an armed conflict and the application of IHL. But in the absence of physical destruction, cyber-attacks probably fall outside the scope of the laws of war. Cyberwar is a real phenomenon, but in many cases, the \"war\" suffix is, legally speaking, a metaphor. In technical discussions, the term \"war\" is meant to convey the notion of an armed conflict pursued through sustained military engagements. In contrast, most cyber-attacks have more in common with the tools of statecraft than the tools of military science. Election interference falls in the category of statecraft, though it is important to remember that even statecraft is regulated by public international law.\n See, e.g., Jack Crowe, *Rosenstein Calls Out Obama Admin For Failing to \"Publicize\" Russian Election Interference*, NATIONAL REVIEW (April 26, 2019).\n In this sense, Brown is absolutely right when he concludes that \"[l]aw is a critical aspect of discussions about the cyber aspects of privacy rights, espionage, sovereignty, international norms of behavior, and more – but none of these things is within the realm of LOAC.\" Gary D. Brown, *International Law Applies to Cyber Warfare! Now What?*, 46 SW. L. REV. 355, 356 (2017).\n See Prescott, *supra* note 1, at 48 (asserting that \"[b]elow the level of this use of force, cyber operations that result only in direct effects within cyberspace itself would not be considered uses of force regulated by LOAC, even though their indirect effects might have far-reaching and negative impacts upon the nation targeted.\"); Lubell, *supra* note 49, at 259 (concluding that \"[t]here can be plenty of cyber operations that occur outside the context of an armed conflict, such as certain types of cyber espionage between supposedly friendly countries to which the law of armed conflict would not apply\"). Lubell also argues that psychological operations (such as operations that have the goal of disseminating propaganda) \"are not considered to be ones that cause direct harm to the civilian population and, as such, can be excluded from certain restrictions placed on attacks.\" *Id.* at 263.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. Election Interference Is Not Cyber-War\nJust because a tool of statecraft falls below the legal threshold for armed conflict does not necessarily mean that the tool is part of a state's exclusive discretion, or what international lawyers sometimes call its domaine réservé.\nThe next two chapters focus on two competing frameworks for regulating cyber-election interference. Chapter 3 analyzes whether \"sovereignty\" is the correct concept, such that cyber interference might be viewed as an illegal infringement of a state's sovereignty. Among international lawyers, this is the \"preferred\" framework or the \"majority\" approach, though there are significant drawbacks to the approach, and I count myself as a dissenting voice. Then, Chapter 4 analyzes whether \"self-determination\" is a more promising framework, so that cyber interference might be viewed as a violation of a people's collective right of self-determination. This is an uncommon approach not yet adopted by public international lawyers, though they should give this approach a second look. In addition to being doctrinally salient, the concept of self-determination dovetails with our commonsense intuition that election interference is harmful because of its corrosive effect on the machinery of core democratic institutions.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press"

So, for example, a state might drop leaflets on a city urging the residents to take a particular action. Or, the state might broadcast messages over radio or other media. Or, the interfering state might make corrupt deals with local politicians or officials in ways that might constitute meddling. In today's world, however, these prosaic forms of interference have been replaced with their digital counterparts: the use of email hacking and fraudulent social media presence to influence the public and consequently interfere with an election. Because the method of election interference has shifted to the digital domain, there is a strong temptation to view the legality of election interference through the international legal rules governing cyber-attacks. In other words, one common assumption made by commentators is that election interference should be understood as a subcategory or particular instantiation of cyber-attacks. Although the international law governing cyber-activity is still emerging, the greatest clarity in that area stems from the international law regarding cyber-war. The majority view among international lawyers is that the regular rules governing kinetic warfare – that is, physical military movements – also apply to cyber-warfare.¹ So, for example, an attack that would violate the law of war if conducted by planes and tanks would also violate the law of war if the same effects are produced by a cyber-attack launched by a team of hackers acting as state-cyber-combatants.\nWe will discuss this particular argument in greater detail below, but for the moment the key point is that there is a strong temptation to understand election\n¹ For an expression of this point of view, see Jody M. Prescott, *Building the Ethical Cyber Commander and the Law of Armed Conflict*, 40 RUTGERS COMPUTER &amp; TECH. L.J. 42, 47 (2014) (“As nations move toward securing the means to conduct cyber conflict that begins to approach our common understandings of war, a consensus appears to be emerging among international organizations concerned with the implementation of LOAC, and in academia, that LOAC at least applies to those actions in cyberspace that either result in, or are intended to result in, injury to humans and damage to geophysical things.”).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\ninterference through the lens of cyber-war. In other words, some would condemn election interference as illegal under international law because it represents a form of cyber-warfare. Other lawyers and politicians will argue the opposite: that election interference does not violate international law because it does not rise to the level of a cyber-war, as if this is the end of the matter in terms of the legal analysis. What unites these two competing conclusions is the assumption that cyber-warfare is the correct framework for judging the legality of election interference. That assumption is profoundly mistaken.\nThis chapter will explain why the assumption is mistaken and why the cyber-war framework is unhelpful. Although international law is a broad and sweeping body of law, the legal regulation of warfare is one of the most prominent and successful subdisciplines of international law. So, perhaps it is not surprising that lawyers should jump to cyber-war as an attractive framing device. But the framing device is poor and sucks up oxygen from other more compelling frameworks that international law has to offer.\nIn order to explain why cyber-war is a poor fit for understanding election interference, this chapter will first explain the basic principles behind the legal regulation of warfare. Then, in Section 2, this chapter will explain how these principles apply in the context of cyber-attacks. Finally, Section 3 will consider the specific case of election interference to show why it does not constitute an illegal cyber-attack in violation of the law of war. But just because it does not violate the rules regarding cyber-war does not mean that it might not violate some other area of international law. The field of international law is at once broader and deeper than the legal regulation of armed conflict. But only by first pushing aside the most obvious framing device can we move toward more compelling and innovative frameworks for understanding the particular harm posed by foreign election interference. This argument will unfold over the course of the subsequent chapters.\n## INTERNATIONAL REGULATION OF WARFARE\n### The Distinction Between Jus ad Bellum and Jus in Bello\nThe international legal regulation of warfare is based on the foundational distinction between jus ad bellum and jus in bello -- terms that originate with the Just War philosophical tradition. Jus ad bellum regulates the recourse to force, that is, the decision to go to war in the first place. With very few exceptions, states are mostly prohibited from using military force to settle international disputes, but in some situations, the recourse to military force might be justified. In contrast, jus in bello regulates the conduct of hostilities during an armed conflict. So, for example, jus in bello passes judgment on the tactics used during an armed conflict, such as who can be targeted, in what\n2. Election Interference Is Not Cyber-War\ncircumstances, and with what weapons.² For example, one of the cardinal rules of *jus in bello* is the rule prohibiting collateral damage that is excessive or disproportionate to the value of the military target.³ One way of explaining the distinction between *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* is that the former covers macro-questions regarding the legality of the overall war, while the latter covers micro-questions regarding the conduct of individual military operations within that war.\nThe legal domains of *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* are legally and conceptually independent, in the sense that a *jus in bello* analysis does not depend on the outcome of the *jus ad bellum* analysis.⁴ In other words, both the aggressor state and the victim state are required to follow the same rules regarding the conduct of warfare. The victim state is not entitled to more liberal rules for the conduct of warfare, just because the victim state is on the receiving end of a *jus ad bellum* violation. Conversely, the aggressor state is not subject to more restrictive conduct rules just because the aggressor state has violated *jus ad bellum* principles. In the conduct of cyber-war, this means that whether a state has violated *jus ad bellum* or not is irrelevant to the question of how the rules of *jus in bello* are applied in the context of cyber-attacks. It is important to keep the macro-level and micro-level questions separate.\nThere has been a recent trend in the philosophical literature to question the canonical separation between *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* principles. These “revisionist just war” arguments have pushed back against the classical Just War Tradition, which always assumed that the *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* domains were conceptually distinct.⁵ Under the revisionist line of thinking, philosophers have suggested that, for example, noncombatants on the victim side should be entitled to fight back against an unjust aggression, whereas under the traditional view, noncombatants are prohibited from participating in hostilities and are therefore not entitled to the combatant’s privilege.⁶ Part of the inspiration for the revisionist trend is that the ethical rules regarding killing should be the same for individuals as they are for groups.⁷ In other words, the revisionist camp aims to\n² See GARY SOLIS, THE LAW OF ARMED CONFLICT 7–8 (2nd edn., Cambridge University Press, 2016) (noting that: “All’s fair in love and war?

International Regulation of Warfare\n43\nharmonize rules of individual morality with rules for group morality, rather than seeing them as separate modes of ethical conduct. Under principles governing personal self-defense, for example, the victim of an unjust attack is entitled to fight back whereas the aggressor is not entitled to use physical force. Revisionists ask why the same should not be true also in the context of warfare.\nWhatever one thinks about the philosophical legitimacy of these revisionist arguments, even the philosophers do not contend that their arguments are currently represented in international legal doctrine.⁸ The revisionist just war philosophers are making arguments about the deep morality of warfare and even some of them concede that there might be legitimate institutional or pragmatic reasons why international law separates *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* into conceptually distinct normative regimes. For example, it might be unworkable to assign to each soldier and to each civilian the task of determining whether a military invasion is justified under *jus ad bellum* before they decide how they should behave.⁹ So, the virtue of the current legal regime is that soldiers and civilians alike can fight (or not fight) in a war without having to adjudicate the contentious *jus ad bellum* questions. Whether this separation is consistent with the “deep morality” of warfare or not, it certainly makes life for the professional solider (on both sides) more workable and represents the current state of the legal regulation of warfare. It may even be morally justified as an instrumental matter, because separating the two domains might service the legitimate goal of designing real-world institutions that ensure compliance with rules that are a second-best alternative to the deep morality of war.¹⁰\n## B. The Basic Rules Regarding Jus ad Bellum\nThe rules regarding *jus ad bellum* are relatively straightforward to articulate, although they are contentious when it comes to their *application*. The use of military force by one state against another state is only justified if taken in self-defense or in accordance with a Security Council authorization. Article 2(4) of the UN Charter prohibits the use of military force for the resolution of international disputes, but article 51 of the UN Charter carves out cases of self-defense from the basic article 2(4) prohibition.¹¹ Article 51 imposes various requirements for the exercise of self-defense, including the existence of an armed attack against the victim\n⁸ *Id.* at 208 (“There are compelling reasons why the laws of war cannot treat the use of violence by Unjust Combatants as criminal.”).\n⁹ *Id.* at 208.\n¹⁰ See Janina Dill, *Should International Law Ensure the Moral Acceptability of War?*, 26 LEIDEN J. INT’L. L. 253–70 (2013).\n¹¹ Article 2(4) of the UN Charter states: “All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.” Article 51 states that “Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. Measures taken by Members in the exercise of\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. Election Interference Is Not Cyber-War\nstate, and a requirement that the Security Council be informed if a state is exercising its legal right of self-defense. Although not explicitly articulated in the text of article 51, international law also imposes additional constraints, including requirements of imminence, necessity, and proportionality.¹² The former requires that the armed attack against the victim state be imminent at the point in time when the victim state uses military force to repel the threat. The latter requirement requires that the defensive force be necessary to stop the threat; if nonmilitary measures are available to resolve the threat, the resort to defensive force is illegitimate (because it is unnecessary at the point in time when it is exercised). Any military response to an attack, undertaken in self-defense pursuant to article 51, would be constrained by the principle of proportionality, meaning that the defensive force must not be disproportionate to the legitimate interest being vindicated by the defensive force.¹³\nThe Security Council is entitled under Chapter VII of the UN Charter to issue a binding resolution calling on member states to use military force to resolve a threat of or breach of international peace and security.¹⁴ Member states are not required to use military force in that situation, but they are permitted to do so; the Security Council resolution transforms what would otherwise potentially be a violation of article 2(4) into a lawful police action to enforce international law. The Security Council is therefore a clearinghouse for decisions regarding the lawfulness of military force, although individual states retain the \"inherent\" right to exercise defensive force even in situations where the Security Council fails to act to authorize military force.¹⁵ The Security Council may also authorize nonmilitary measures under article 41 of the UN Charter.¹⁶ The right to unilateral defense force is particularly important since the Security Council includes five permanent members (China, France, Russia, United States, United Kingdom), each of whom enjoys a veto, that is, the right to veto any resolution coming out of the Security Council.\nthis right of self-defence shall be immediately reported to the Security Council and shall not in any way affect the authority and responsibility of the Security Council under the present Charter to take at any time such action as it deems necessary in order to maintain or restore international peace and security.\"\n¹² For a discussion of these requirements, see generally YORAM DINSTEIN, WAR, AGGRESSION, AND SELF-DEFENSE (Cambridge University Press, 2012).\n¹³ For a discussion of the proportionality requirement, see generally MICHAEL A. NEWTON AND LARRY MAY, PROPORTIONALITY IN INTERNATIONAL LAW (Oxford University Press, 2014).\n¹⁴ See art. 42 (\"Should the Security Council consider that measures provided for in Article 41 would be inadequate or have proved to be inadequate, it may take such action by air, sea, or land forces as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security.

These may include complete or partial interruption of economic relations and of rail, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio, and other means of communication, and the severance of diplomatic relations.\")\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n1. International Regulation of Warfare\n45\nConsequently, a resolution authorizing the use of force is exceedingly rare and requires universal approval from the world's major powers. Given the possibility for gridlock on the Council, most cases of military force are justified, if at all, under article 51 self-defense.\n## C. The Basic Rules Regarding Jus in Bello\nThe rules regarding the conduct of warfare are expressed in major treaty conventions such as the four post-World War II Geneva Conventions, two additional protocols to the Geneva Conventions from 1977, and the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907. These treaty sources can be combined with rules of customary international law that equally regulate the conduct of hostilities. The rules regarding the conduct of warfare can be broadly fit into the following categories: targeting, participation in hostilities, tactics in warfare, and weaponry.\nFor example, the bedrock principle of *jus in bello* is that attacking forces should limit their attacks to enemy combatants, that is, members of enemy military forces or other militia units that meet the requirements of combatancy. Attacking forces are also entitled to attack civilians for such time as those civilians are directly participating in hostilities.¹⁷ It would be incongruous if a state could avoid its nationals being targeted simply by refusing to organize itself into formal military units, hence the exceptional rule that allows targeting of civilians who directly participate in hostilities. Despite this cardinal rule of distinction, civilians may be killed but only as collateral damage.¹⁸ By the phrase “collateral damage,” the law means that the civilians were not the object of the attack but were killed as a side effect of an attack on a lawful military objective such as a military asset or military personnel.¹⁹ So the difference between a violation of the principle of distinction and a case of permissible collateral damage is the attitude of the attacker. If the attacker is aiming at the civilian, the attacker has violated the principle of distinction. On the other hand, if the attacker is aiming at a lawful military objective, but still kills a civilian or a group of civilians, the civilians are considered collateral damage. The attacking force may even envision the civilian deaths, and they should still be counted as collateral damage.²⁰ However, the *jus in bello* imposes a major constraint on the existence of collateral damage by prohibiting collateral\n¹⁷ This rule is codified in article 51(3) of Additional Protocol I (API) to the General Conventions: “Civilians shall enjoy the protection afforded by this Section, unless and for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities.”\n¹⁸ The principle of distinction is also sometimes referred to as the principle of discrimination. The two are roughly synonymous, though the word “distinction” is more often used by lawyers and “discrimination” is more common among philosophers of war.\n¹⁹ Solis dates the term “collateral damage” to the 1991 Gulf War. See SOLIS, *supra* note 2, at 295; SAHR CONWAY-LANZ, *COLLATERAL DAMAGE* 221 (Routledge, 2006).\n²⁰ The question of mental intent in the context of collateral damage is somewhat complicated and has produced a series of unfortunate statements from international courts. For a discussion of this issue, see Jens David Ohlin, *Targeting and the Concept of Intent*, 35 MICH. J. INT’L L. 79 (2013).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. Election Interference Is Not Cyber-War\ndamage that is disproportionate or “excessive” to the anticipated value of the military advantage that will be gained from destroying the military target.²¹\nThe *jus in bello* also outlaws particular tactics. Killing by perfidy is outlawed, such as pretending to be a civilian to draw out the enemy or waiving a white flag and pretending to surrender, only to kill the enemy during an ambush.²² These are “dishonest stratagems” as Kant called them, and impermissible as far back as the Lieber Code.²³ Similarly, the *jus in bello* prohibits tactics that increase the suffering of the enemy (*maux superflus*) but do not produce any additional military benefit.²⁴ So, in other words, it would be illegal to use a weapon that does not increase lethality but only increases the pain that the enemy will suffer before dying. Similarly, particular weapons may be outlawed by particular treaties or conventions, such as nuclear weapons (for some states that have signed nonproliferation accords), chemical weapons, cluster munitions, and landmines, though in each of these cases (other than chemical weapons) several states have refused to sign on to the conventions because they consider the weapon system in question to be necessary for strategic interests. Finally, attacking forces are not permitted to attack soldiers who are *hors de combat* because they are sick or because they have effectively communicated their surrender. Consequently, summarily executing a group of POWs (without legal process or criminal culpability) would constitute a war crime.\nThe basic structure behind the *jus in bello* is to create a special “war convention,” as Michael Walzer once described it. It creates, in other words, a special framework for the conduct of hostilities. Lawful combatants are granted the combatant’s privilege: in exchange for opening themselves up to the reciprocal risk of killing, combatants may not be prosecuted by the enemy for lawful acts of belligerency. In exchange, combatants are required to limit their attacks to military objects, thus sparing civilians from the burdens of war, as much as possible as would be consistent with the need to pursue the war effort (banning collateral damage entirely would effectively hamper warfare entirely). The requirement to carry arms openly and to avoid perfidious killing – among other prohibitions – install a basic notion of transparency in the law of war. Combatants do not simply fight for themselves as if they were fighting in a duel. Rather, combatants are representatives of the state, killing on the state’s behalf, and therefore combatants and the state “advance and retrograde” together on the field of battle, in Lieber’s\n²¹ See API, art. 51(5) (“Among others, the following types of attacks are to be considered as indiscriminate . . . (b) an attack which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.”).\n²² See API, art. 37(1) (“It is prohibited to kill, injure or capture an adversary by resort to perfidy. Acts inviting the confidence of an adversary to lead him to believe that he is entitled to, or is obliged to accord, protection under the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, with intent to betray that confidence, shall constitute perfidy . . .”).\n²³ However, it should be noted that “ruses of war are not prohibited.” See API, art. 37(2).\n²⁴ API, art. 35(2) (“2. It is prohibited to employ weapons, projectiles and material and methods of warfare of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering.”).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. The Emerging Consensus on Cyber-War\nfamous phrase.²⁵ None of that would be possible without a basic principle of transparency in the application of *jus in bello*, which requires for its operation a tangible and public connection between individual combatants and the state on whose behalf they fight.\n## 2. THE EMERGING CONSENSUS ON CYBER-WAR\nThe last few years have witnessed a tremendous acceleration of work applying the law of war to the context of cyber-attacks. That being said, there is some uncertainty over the application of core law of war principles to cyber-space. There are several reasons for the uncertainty. The first is that there has been little diplomatic effort to codify specific international rules for cyber-attacks. One reason for the reluctance is that many lawyers believe that existing rules of IHL are adequate to the task of regulating state behavior in cyber-space. Second, some states want to preserve flexibility for their operations conducted in the cyber-realm. Third, the secretive nature of cyber-activities hampers the formation of customary rules. Customary international law develops out of state practice (action) and *opinio juris* (performing the legal action from a sense of legal obligation). But many cyber-attacks are conducted in secret, either covertly or clandestinely, and states often refuse to acknowledge their involvement in cyber-attacks. Other states will sometimes criticize those attacks, but in other situations the difficulty with “attribution” will hamper those public criticisms, thus leading to more private criticism through diplomatic channels.²⁶ This dynamic scuttles or limits the formation of customary norms. However, despite these limitations, international lawyers have worked hard to explain, through soft-law mechanisms, how the law of war applies in cyber-space. One result of this effort, the Tallinn Manual, brought together experts on cyber-law and sought feedback from state governments.\nThis section outlines the state of international law regarding cyber-war: subsection A focuses on the role of the Tallinn Manual in constructing these norms; subsection B on whether cyber-wars are armed conflicts under international law; subsection C on the armed attack requirement for self-defense; and subsection D on the application of *jus in bello* principles to cyber-attacks.\n²⁵ Lieber Code, art. 20 (“Public war is a state of armed hostility between sovereign nations or governments. It is a law and requisite of civilized existence that men live in political, continuous societies, forming organized units, called states or nations, whose constituents bear, enjoy, suffer, advance and retrograde together, in peace and in war.”).\n²⁶ See Delbert Tran, *The Law of Attribution: Rules for Attributing the Source of A Cyber-Attack*, 20 YALE J. L. &amp; TECH. 376, 386 (2018) (noting that the “difficulty in tracing the source of a cyber-attack has long plagued discussions of cybersecurity, and much of current scholarship has accepted the traditional wisdom that the technological architecture of the internet makes attribution an exceedingly difficult problem”); Collin S. Allan, *Attribution Issues in Cyberspace*, 13 CHI.-KENT J. INT’L &amp; COMP. L. 55 (2013).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. Election Interference Is Not Cyber-War\n## A. The Role of the Tallinn Manual\nThe Tallinn Manual was initiated by the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, which is located in Tallinn, Estonia.²⁷ The initiative involved a collaboration of international law and military law experts from across the world, followed by consultation and feedback from governments and their legal advisors. Although the Tallinn Manual is not a source of international law per se, it is relevant to the state of international law for two reasons. First, it may help in the formation of customary international law, as states gravitate towards particular statements of customary rules and norms, providing expression of legal rules for states to either accept or reject through the process of *opinio juris*. Second, the Tallinn Manual is a semi-authoritative statement of how experts believe that the existing law can and should be applied in cyber-space. If there is no need to amend or create new law, but simply a need to apply existing law to activities in cyber-space, then there is no requirement that the application be guided by the stringent rules for the creation of international law.²⁸\nThe Tallinn Manual focused on a variety of legal questions, including the applicability of *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* principles to cyber-attacks, and the use of countermeasures to thwart cyber-attacks. Also, the Tallinn Manual discusses violations of sovereignty that fall below the “armed attack” threshold – violations that will be the focus of the next chapter of this book.²⁹\n## B. Are Cyber-Wars Real Wars As a Matter of International Law?\nThe first threshold question is whether a cyber-war is a real “war” in the legal sense of that term as used by international lawyers. The answer to that question is yes, depending on the type of damage produced by the conflict, though this answer is a bit controversial.³⁰ Some legal scholars argue that defining cyber-wars as real “armed conflicts” only functions to give state militaries control over cyber-infrastructure and cyber-governance – questions that necessarily impact civilian life and which ought not to be exclusively managed by state militaries.³¹ There is\n²⁷ See TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE (Michael N. Schmitt et al. (eds.), 2013) [hereinafter cited as “Tallinn Manual”].\n²⁸ The strictly defined sources of international law are generally outlined in article 38 of the ICJ Statute.\n²⁹ For our purposes, the Tallinn Manual sections on cyber-war are the most relevant to our analysis.\n³⁰ For example, the philosopher Larry May has argued that cyber-wars should not be understood as real “armed conflicts” in the way that international lawyers use that term. See Larry May, The Nature of War and the Idea of “Cyberwar,” in Ohlin et al. (eds.), CYBER WAR: LAW AND ETHICS FOR VIRTUAL CONFLICTS 3 (Oxford University Press, 2015) (suggesting that one could look at cyber-attacks as more like embargoes than as armed conflicts).\n³¹ See Mary Ellen O’Connell, *Cyber Security without Cyber War*, 17 J. CONFLICT &amp; SEC. L. 187, 209 (2012) (“To date, the problem of Internet security has been the domain of international law scholars with expertise in use of force questions. They have sent the message that the Internet may be protected through military force or the threat of military force, analogizing to Cold War deterrence strategy.”\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. The Emerging Consensus on Cyber-War\nwisdom in this criticism, though it is also the case that some cyber-wars should be considered significant enough to qualify as an armed conflict if they result in physical damage.\nIn terms of the application of international law, there is a widely shared definition for what counts as an armed conflict. International lawyers generally distinguish between international armed conflicts (IACs) between states, and noninternational armed conflicts (NIACs) between a state and a nonstate actor or between two nonstate actors. An IAC is triggered when there is a resort to \"armed force\" by one state against another state. The standard view, though it is not codified in any treaty, is that there is no intensity threshold for this determination. In other words, an IAC exists between two states when one state uses military force against the other, regardless of how much force is used, or for how long it lasts. An IAC might involve a one-time airstrike by one state's air force, bombing targets in the other state, or the IAC might involve a full-scale land invasion that lasts for months or even years. Either way, military force is traditionally thought of as involving some kinetic activity – the crossing of a border with a military asset, or the use of a confederate to destroy installations or buildings within the target state. It is very hard to think of an international armed conflict being triggered without either a border crossing or some physical destruction of at least some kind.\nIn contrast, a NIAC requires the existence of violent hostilities between a state and a nonstate actor that reaches a certain level of scope and intensity. So, for example, the state's use of physical force against a nonstate actor, such as a group of rebels, might not constitute an armed conflict if the state simply fires a few shots and arrests the members of the rebel organization. However, if there are sustained hostilities between the state and the nonstate actor that pass a certain threshold, the situation\nGovernments have followed this modelling, pouring resources into the military for keeping the Internet safe and for taking advantage of what it offers to attack opponents. Doing so has required strained analogies of cyber-attacks to conventional kinetic attacks. The Internet is now far less secure than before there was a Cyber Command or a NATO CCDCOE. It is time, therefore, to turn to cyber disarmament and a focus on peaceful protection of the Internet.\"). See also Christopher J. Finlay, Just War, Cyber War, and the Concept of Violence, 31 PHILOSOPHY &amp; TECHNOLOGY 357-77 (2018) (preferring to conceptualize cyber-attacks under the broader rubric of \"violence\" instead of \"war\"); Ryan Patterson, Silencing the Call to Arms: A Shift Away from Cyber Attacks As Warfare, 48 LOY.

REV. 969, 975 (2015) (arguing that \"alternate legal regimes, including domestic law enforcement and the international principle of non-interference, may prove more effective frameworks to govern malicious cyber activities\").

STUD. 276, 283 (2013) (\"There is nothing extraordinary in cyber warfare: it is just ordinary warfare with a little bit of extra.

Election Interference Is Not Cyber-War\nmight graduate from a law enforcement operation to a full-blown NIAC that triggers the application of IHL rules (at least the rules that apply during a NIAC).³⁴\nAssuming that these articulations are correct statements about the international legal threshold for armed conflict, most cyber-attacks will not rise to the level of an armed conflict. Although the standard for the creation of an armed conflict is more liberal for international conflicts (IACs) than internal ones (NIACs), because the standard allows any use of force, it is unclear whether a cyber-attack would constitute a “use of force” against another state.³⁵ On this question there is not universal agreement. At first blush, one can distinguish between three examples of cyber-attacks. In the first, one state uses a cyber-attack to cause damage or to destroy a physical building in the target state. For example, the state uses a cyber-attack to cause an electrical power station to overheat, resulting in an explosion and fire that destroys the power station. The second example would be a cyber-attack that is launched against a computer system in the target state, resulting in the physical destruction of the computer system but no other physical destruction. The third example would be a cyber-attack that penetrates a foreign computer system, resulting in the theft or destruction of information but no physical damage, not even physical damage to the computer system.\nAlthough experts are divided on some of these questions, there is widespread agreement that the first example would constitute a use of force that would trigger the existence of an armed conflict. In that case, a cyber-war would be a “war” in the sense of an “armed conflict” as international lawyers use the term. As the Tallinn Manual stated in its Rule 11, “A cyber operation constitutes a use force when its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force.”³⁶ In making this determination, international lawyers sometimes look at the “scale and effects” of the force to determine whether it crosses the relevant threshold.³⁷ In determining whether a cyber-attack constitutes a use of force, the Tallinn Manual suggests looking at the following criteria: severity, immediacy,\n³⁴ Although customary international law arguably imposes the same (or similar) rules of conduct in both types of armed conflict, major treaties regulating *jus in bello* impose different legal regimes in each type of conflict. For example, the full Geneva Conventions apply during IACs, whereas only one article of the Geneva Conventions – Common article 3 – applies during NIACs.\n³⁵ Solis, one of the leading American experts on the law of war, describes the standard in the following terms: “A cyber attack, as opposed to a cyber intrusion, constitutes a ‘use of force’ if undertaken by a state’s armed forces, intelligence services, or a private contractor whose conduct is attributable to the state, and its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations that rise to a level of a use of force.” Gary D. Solis, *Cyber Warfare*, 219 MIL. L. REV. 1, 15 (2014).\n³⁶ Tallinn Manual, *supra* note 27, at 45.\n³⁷ *Id.* at 46 (noting that “scale and effects” is a shorthand term that captures the quantitative and qualitative factors to be analysed in determining whether a cyber operation qualifies as a use of force”). The use of the “scale and effects” language in the Tallinn Manual is a bit unfortunate because it confuses the ICJ standard for armed attack within the context of self-defense for the standard for determining whether something counts as a use of force, despite the fact that the Tallinn Manual concedes that the definitions for a “use of force” and an “armed attack” are designed to “serve different normative purposes.” *Id.* at 52. That being said, the confusion is not important,\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. The Emerging Consensus on Cyber-War\n51\ndirectness, invasiveness, measurability of effects, military character, state involvement, and presumptive legality.³⁸ Even a threatened cyber-operation can constitute a use of force under certain circumstances.³⁹\nThe second and third examples are more complicated. Some international lawyers would consider the second example a use of force because it involved the physical destruction of a computer system. The third example is the most difficult, because many lawyers would consider the loss or theft of information to be insufficient to count as a use of force under international law. A small minority of lawyers are more liberal in their interpretation of what counts as a use of force. However, it would seem that the majority has the better of the argument, because it is hard to understand how the mere theft of information could constitute an armed attack. Indeed, it seems to be theft or destruction of information, rather than an armed attack. One might argue that the concept of an armed attack should be amended in today's world of cyber-threats, but indeed the whole point of using this legal trigger is to declare the existence of an armed conflict and trigger the application of IHL, and it is unclear how anything would be improved by triggering the application of IHL every time there is a cross-border cyber-attack. Indeed, one should remember that IHL has both a regulating and licensing function, in that it allows privileged (i.e. lawful) combatants to kill each other with personal legal immunity. So, there are some costs to the application of IHL, and placing states in a constant state of armed conflict simply because of a cyber-attack would do little to resolve international disputes peacefully.\nIn practical terms, what this means for election interference is that most cases of cyber-election interference will not trigger the existence of an armed conflict under international law. If state agents seek to influence an election by surreptitiously posting messages on social media, even if in doing so they pretend to be American citizens, this hardly seems like a \"use of force\" in the military sense of that term. Even if a state uses a cyber-attack to hack election results and change vote tallies, this clearly constitutes a substantial intrusion in the political integrity of another state, though again it is hard to qualify it as a use of force. The changing of the vote tallies would alter – arguably destroy – the legitimacy of the election results, but the problem is that international law views the concept of the use of force through a military lens, while in this case the harm seems decidedly political rather than military.\nbecause all parties agree that a cyber operation can, in theory, constitute a use of force under international law.\n³⁸ Id. at 48–52 (but noting that the factors are not exhaustive and that \"States may look to others, such as the prevailing political environment, whether the cyber operation portends the future use of military force, the identity of the attacker, any record of cyber operations by the attacker, and the nature of the target (such as critical infrastructure)\").\n³⁹ Id. at 52 (Rule 12: \"A cyber operation, or threatened cyber operation, constitutes an unlawful threat of force when the threatened action, if carried out, would be an unlawful use of force.\").\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nIn drawing this conclusion, we need to postpone the more general question of whether such interference violates another body of international law and focus for the moment on the narrower question of whether the “war” paradigm is the right way for understanding information operations aimed at undermining the legitimacy of an election. Based on the analysis in this chapter, it is quite clear that the war paradigm is deficient.\nThe one situation where there might be an argument for classifying election interference as a use of force is if the cyber-attack does more than simply penetrate election infrastructure but actually physically destroys it. So, for example, if a state were to launch a cyber-attack that caused election machines to overheat and become inoperable, there is an argument that such a cyber-attack might constitute a use of force. Or, similarly, if a cyber-attack causes the electrical system at a state board of elections to overheat and cause a fire, this too would create the physical manifestation necessary to constitute a use of force. But if the election interference of 2016 has taught us anything, it is that the most potent forms of interference involve no physical damage at all. The target of this interference is not physical locations or the lives of military or civilian personnel; the target is democratic institutions through the strategic deployment of misinformation. Social media campaigns designed to influence an election are not acts of war, though this conclusion should not blind us to the threat they pose to democratic systems. We will need to leave to the next two chapters whether international law has an alternative paradigm to describe the harm caused by these cyber-attacks.\n### C. The Armed Attack Requirement for Self-Defense\nThe prior subsection focused exclusively on the triggering conditions for the existence of an armed conflict (and hence the applicability of IHL). A distinct but related question is what constitutes an “armed attack” under article 51 of the UN Charter. The existence of an armed attack is a condition for the target being permitted to exercise lethal force in response as a defensive measure. It is important to remember that not every violation of international law triggers a right of self-defense in response. Some violations, when they rise to the level of an armed attack, are considered sufficiently serious that the victim state is entitled to unilaterally exercise defensive force even in the absence of Security Council authorization.\nThe armed attack requirement is not subject to the same intensity requirements as required by the use of force analysis by IHL in the context of a NIAC. However, given the similarities between the two tests, international lawyers have generally assumed that an armed attack for purposes of article 51 requires some physical destruction. In the Nicaragua opinion, the ICJ argued that an attack must meet a “scale and effects” criterion in order to qualify as an armed attack -- a standard that has had enormous influence in contemporary international legal and diplomatic practice. The Tallinn Manual endorses the “scale and effects” standard in the\n2. The Emerging Consensus on Cyber-War\ncontext of self-defense, though it concedes that even before the complication of cyber-attacks is added to the mix, the standard is somewhat vague and requires contentious application.⁴⁰ Governments likely support an “effects” test for evaluating a cyber-attack because it preserves maximum flexibility for using offensive cyber-attacks in many situations that fall below the relevant “effects” threshold.⁴¹\nConsequently, a cyber-attack in some circumstances could qualify as an armed attack that triggers the inherent right to self-defense article in article 51.⁴² The destruction must be foreseeable but it need not be immediate.⁴³ For example, if a cyber-attack produces death or physical destruction, even if that consequence is a “downstream” consequence, it might still qualify as an armed attack, as long as the resulting destruction is a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the cyber-attack.⁴⁴ One notable example is a cyber-attack against a water-filtration plant that prevents the target state from maintaining the quality of its water-supply; if civilians ultimately get sick or die, even if that occurs weeks or months after the original cyber-attack, this could qualify as an armed attack for purposes of article 51.⁴⁵\nIf a military – that is, kinetic – response is going to be authorized by international law, it makes sense to have a demanding trigger. Consequently, the majority of experts who worked on the Tallinn Manual concluded that an armed attack requires an actual or imminent territorial infringement that will cause physical damage to persons or things.⁴⁶ The imminence requirement is a preexisting element of the\n⁴⁰ Id. at 55 (concluding that “the parameters of the scale and effects criteria remain unsettled beyond the indication that they need to be grave”).\n⁴¹ See Matthew C. Waxman, Cyber-Attacks and the Use of Force: Back to the Future of Article 2(4), 36 YALE J. INT’L L. 421, 434–5 (2011) (concluding that “the U.S. government probably prefers an effects- or consequences-based interpretation of ‘force’ or ‘armed attack’ with respect to cyber-attacks not only for what it includes (and therefore what the Charter prohibits and what could trigger self-defense rights), but also for what it excludes. Computer-based espionage, intelligence collection, or even some preemptive cyber-operations or countermeasures designed to disable an adversary’s threatening capabilities, for example, would generally not constitute prohibited force because these activities do not produce destructive consequences analogous to a kinetic military attack”).\n⁴² Tallinn Manual, supra note 27, at 54 (“The International Group of Experts unanimously concluded that some cyber operations may be sufficiently grave to warrant classifying them as an ‘armed attack’ within the meaning of the Charter.”).\n⁴³ See Michael Gervais, Cyber Attacks and the Laws of War, 30 BERKELEY J. INT’L L. 525, 538 (2012) (noting that “[c]yber attacks do not always intentionally target the critical infrastructure that they eventually disrupt”). For another defense of the “reasonably foreseeable” standard in this context, see Michael N. Schmitt, Computer Network Attack and the Use of Force in International Law: Thoughts on a Normative Framework, 37 COLUM. J. TRANSNAT’L. L. 885, 916 (1999) (arguing that “the nature of the act’s reasonably foreseeable consequences would be assessed to determine whether they resemble those of armed coercion”).\n⁴⁴ However, it is certainly true that “it is very difficult from a practical standpoint to predict whether a cyber attack will lead to kinetic harm or not.” See Stephen Petkis, Rethinking Proportionality in the Cyber Context, 47 GEO. J. INT’L L. 1431, 1449 (2016).\n⁴⁵ This example is explored in the Tallinn Manual, supra note 27, at 57.\n⁴⁶ Tallinn Manual, supra note 27, at 54 (Rule 13: “A state that is the target of a cyber operation that rises to the level of an armed attack may exercise its inherent right of self-defense. Whether a cyber operation constitutes an armed attack depends on its scale and effects.”).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. Election Interference Is Not Cyber-War\ninternational legal doctrine on self-defense, though how imminence should be understood for a cyber-attack is more difficult than its kinetic analog. For example, an imminent military attack might be manifested in the form of air, sea, and land forces moving into position to launch a strike or invasion. The public nature of these deployments ensures that the imminent requirement can be transparently evaluated by the court of world opinion. But a cyber-attack that is brewing would not be manifested in the same public manner, because the preparatory works would most likely be private, secret, or unknown.⁴⁷\nThe physical damage could be caused by a physical attack or by a cyber-attack, but the resulting damage must be physical in nature.⁴⁸ The experts concluded that “it is not the nature (injurious or destructive) of the consequences that matters, but rather the extent of the ensuing effects.”⁴⁹ However, it should be noted that a minority of scholars working on the Tallinn Manual concluded that a cyber-attack that destroys “data,” even if it fails to destroy the computer system that houses the data, might in some circumstances constitute an armed attack.⁵⁰ A cyber-attack that disrupts the stock exchange and causes financial damage would not produce the requisite physical damage to be considered an armed attack, though there is disagreement on this question, with a minority of scholars suggesting that the negative consequences flowing from such an attack might meet the requirements for an armed attack.⁵¹ Presumably, those scholars who view the “catastrophic effects” of a cyber-attack against a stock market as enough to qualify as an armed attack might also be\n⁴⁷ However, some scholars have disputed that cyber-attacks can never be identified when they are still in the imminence window. See Ryan J. Hayward, *Evaluating the “Imminence” of A Cyber Attack for Purposes of Anticipatory Self-Defense*, 117 COLUM. L. REV. 399, 419 (2017) (concluding that “there is ample evidence to believe that investments over the past several years have dramatically improved the United States’ monitoring abilities in this arena”). The Tallinn Manual argues that the right to self-defense in response to an offensive cyber armed attack is limited by two temporal limitations. First, the original cyber-attack must have occurred or must be imminent. Second, the defensive response must be immediately necessary to counter the threat. See Tallinn Manual, *supra* note 27, at 64–5. This second immediacy requirement is especially important in cases of anticipatory self-defense.\n⁴⁸ See Herbert S. Lin, *Offensive Cyber Operations and the Use of Force*, 4 J. NAT’L SECURITY L. &amp; POL’Y 63, 73 (2010) (suggesting that “effects rather than the modality of an action are the appropriate starting point for understanding how jus ad bellum and the U.N. Charter apply to offensive cyber operations” and concluding that “[e]ffects-based analysis suggests that the ambiguities are fewest when cyber attacks cause physical damage to property and loss of life in ways that are comparable to kinetic attacks and traditional war, because traditional LOAC provides various relevant precedents and analogies”).\n⁴⁹ Tallinn Manual, *supra* note 27, at 56. For example, Lubell argues that it is “at least arguable that computer data is closer to what the drafters wanted to include as objects than to the notion of what they wanted to exclude as aim or purpose.” See Noam Lubell, *Lawful Targets in Cyber Operations: Does the Principle of Distinction Apply?*, 89 INT’L L. STUD. 252, 268 (2013). Lubell points out that data is, in some circumstances, more precious than physical objects; buildings can be rebuilt, but data that is not backed up (or if the backup tapes are destroyed as well) is gone forever.\n⁵⁰ See Lubell, *supra* note 49, at 267 (concluding that “[t]he problem that arises, which is relatively unique to cyber operations, is whether data can be considered an object. While there is no definitive answer to this question, the currently prevailing view among LOAC experts appears to hold that in most cases data, for the purposes of LOAC targeting, should not be considered an object.”).\n⁵¹ Tallinn Manual, *supra* note 27, at 56.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. The Emerging Consensus on Cyber-War\nwilling to view similarly a cyber-attack against election infrastructure or some other form of election cyber-interference.⁵² However, this conclusion would appear to stretch the concept of “armed attack” well beyond its original meaning, at least when judged against its functional role in the overall ecosystem of *jus ad bellum*.⁵³\nSo far our discussion has focused on the requirements for triggering a military response under article 51 after a state suffers a cyber-attack. However, different rules would apply for a right of cyber-defense in response to a first cyber-attack. If both a first cyber-attack and a defensive cyber-response fall below the threshold for armed attacks, then two nations could engage in a tit-for-tat response of increasingly serious cyber-attacks, and none of it will be regulated by either *jus ad bellum* or *jus in bello*.⁵⁴ The absence of physical destruction of persons or things will remove the cyber-engagement from the legal regulation of warfare, potentially emboldening states to engage in a wide range of cyber-activities.⁵⁵\nThe question in today’s world is whether states would prefer to continue these cyber-attacks without legal regulation or whether a system of reciprocal constraints on cyber-attacks below the military threshold would be a good idea.⁵⁶ Although\n⁵² It should also be noted that the downstream “effects” of a cyber-attack could take weeks or months to be fully manifested – a factor which makes the law of war much more difficult to apply to cyber-attacks, rather than conventional military attacks where the effects are more readily ascertainable in the hours and days after the attack. See Stephen Petkis, *Rethinking Proportionality in the Cyber Context*, 47 GEO. J. INT’L L. 1431, 1448 (2016) (concluding that “the principal problem with an ‘effects test’ in the cyber context is that the nature and gravity of a cyber attack can be incredibly difficult to ascertain at the time the attack occurs. Unlike kinetic action, the true ‘effect’ of a cyber intrusion may not be known until weeks, months, or years after it is first discovered”).\n⁵³ See, e.g., Michael Gervais, *Cyber Attacks and the Laws of War*, 30 BERKELEY J. INT’L L. 525, 536 (2012) (concluding that “in light of the ‘object and purpose’ of the Charter, ‘force’ should be read more narrowly. The express aim of the United Nations is to maintain international peace and security, as well as ‘to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war’. That suggests the notion of force in 1945 was limited to the military instrument.”). Gervais goes on to correctly note that “treating all forms of cyber attack as a use of force would require an implausibly broad reading of Article 2(4) that includes non-physical damage.” *Id.* at 537. But see Schmitt, *supra* note 43, at 919 (asking whether there should be a presumption that computer attacks fall in the use of force box and suggesting that “the security framework of the Charter would be best effected by application of an inclusivity presumption”).\n⁵⁴ See Priyanka R. Dev, “Use of Force” and “Armed Attack” Thresholds in Cyber Conflict: The Looming Definitional Gaps and the Growing Need for Formal U.N. Response, 50 TEX. INT’L L.J. 381, 392–93 (2015) (musing that “an alternative solution to better encapsulate non-physical cyber effects, rather than expanding ill-fitted traditional concepts, would be for the international community to create a new threshold for actions that do not meet the traditional use of force threshold but nonetheless constitute a ‘breach of the peace’ under Article 39 of the U.N. Charter”).\n⁵⁵ See, e.g., Matthew C. Waxman, *Cyber-Attacks and the Use of Force: Back to the Future of Article 2(4)*, 36 YALE J. INT’L L. 421, 434 (2011) (noting that “in addition to the more traditional military defense and deterrence strategies just described, the U.S. government may also be considering legal interpretations flexible enough to permit its own offensive cyber-operations below a certain threshold or against inchoate hostile cyber-activities”).\n⁵⁶ Cyber-attacks that fall below the armed attack threshold would still be subject to international legal regulation, just not under the law of war. See Daniel J. Ryan et al., *International Cyberlaw: A Normative Approach*, 42 GEO. J.

Election Interference Is Not Cyber-War\nthere have been extensive calls for more regulation, perhaps even a new treaty, to govern cyber-space, the lack of serious development of explicit rules suggests that most states are interested in keeping the law open in order to preserve their flexibility going forward. Indeed, states often refuse to even acknowledge publicly when they have perpetrated or been victimized by a cyber-attack – a reticence that hampers the development of legal norms in this area.\n## D. Application of Jus in Bello Principles to Cyber-Attacks\nPrinciples of *jus in bello* apply to cyber-attacks as long as the cyber-attack either triggers an armed conflict or is launched during an armed conflict.^^ Outside the context of an armed conflict, a cyber-attack would be constrained by principles of international human rights law, and general constraints embodied in public international law (including the concept of proportionality), but the more specific rules of *jus in bello* would not apply. But in the context of an armed conflict, there are at least three *jus in bello* rules that are of prime importance to consider: the principle of distinction, the prohibition on excessive collateral damage, and the combatant's privilege.^^ Each will now be considered.\nThe principle of distinction requires attacking forces to limit their attacks to military objectives. A cyber-attack that takes place during an armed conflict would be subject to the same limitations.^^ So, for example, a state launching a cyber-attack would be prohibited from using a cyber-weapon to disable a purely civilian system, such as a school computer system, an electrical power grid providing electricity to a civilian neighborhood, or a computer system associated with a medical-care facility. This prohibition applies not just to attacks against civilian personnel, but also to attacks against civilian installations and civilian infrastructure. This rule would explicitly permit cyber-attacks against military targets, such as a computer system for any military base, missile system, air-defense system, or even an infrastructure system that provides resources exclusively to a military system. So, for example, it would be consistent with the laws of war to use a cyber-attack to disable an oil refinery that provides oil exclusively to a nation's military, with the goal of denying tanks, Humvees, and other military vehicles the fuel that they need to operate.\n^^ See, e.g., Gary D. Solis, *Cyber Warfare*, 219 MIL. L. REV. 1, 2 (2014) (noting that “[w]hether a 500-pound bomb or a computer is used to effect death and destruction, a weapon is a weapon”).\n^^ Strangely, Gary Brown argues that *jus in bello* \"has little of interest to say specifically about cyber warfare\" and \"the places where actual cyber activities and the LOAC intersect are few and, in the scheme of things, not especially relevant.\" Gary D. Brown, *International Law Applies to Cyber Warfare! Now What?*, 46 SW. L. REV. 355, 356 (2017).\n^^ For a discussion of this issue, see Lubell, *supra* note 49, at 252.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. The Emerging Consensus on Cyber-War\nOf course, a civilian target may be destroyed as collateral damage, provided that the collateral damage is not excessive or disproportionate to the military advantage gained by destroying the military target. In the context of a cyber-attack, it might be permissible to destroy a civilian computer system if it is a collateral consequence of destroying a military computer system, which might be the case if the two computer systems are linked together. However, if the destruction of the civilian computer system is disproportionate relative to the military advantage conferred by destroying the military computer system, the collateral damage would be disallowed by *jus in bello*.⁶⁰ There is some uncertainty about how to apply the concept of collateral damage to cyber-attacks. Some scholars have argued that the rule against disproportionate collateral damage should apply even when the damage to the civilian system is limited to loss of *functionality* to a computer system that provides service to the civilian population, even if the computer system is not physically destroyed.⁶¹ The general law-of-war impulse to insulate civilians from the burdens of war applies just as much in cyber-space as it does on the kinetic battlefield.\nThe much more difficult application of this rule involves dual-infrastructure targets. Many infrastructure targets, such as power plants, oil refineries, water treatment plants and mining facilities, provide general resources for both civilian and military uses.⁶² International lawyers have been perplexed by these targets for many years, and the NATO bombing of Serbia in 1999 threw into sharp relief the legal uncertainty over their status. For example, NATO forces attacked bridges that were used by both civilian and military vehicles, and also attacked TV stations that were owned by the government and used to broadcast nationalist propaganda. Although controversial, the prevailing consensus is that dual-use infrastructure targets need to be considered as both civilian and military at the same time and evaluated on that basis. Consequently, while it might be legitimate to destroy the military-side of a dual-use infrastructure target, the destruction of the civilian part (or the civilian percentage) is only justified if it is not excessive or disproportionate to the military advantage gained by destroying the military part. So, for example, the bridge\n⁶⁰ For a discussion of the proportionality analysis related to a cyber-attack, see Jeremy Richmond, *Evolving Battlefields: Does Stuxnet Demonstrate A Need for Modifications to the Law of Armed Conflict?*, 35 FORDHAM INT’L L.J. 842, 891 (2012) (concluding that the Stuxnet cyber-attack against Iran was proportionate because “[g]iven the minimal amount of collateral damage caused by Stuxnet, Stuxnet’s commanders were almost certainly reasonable in their calculations”).\n⁶¹ See, e.g., Eric Talbot Jensen, *Cyber Attacks: Proportionality and Precautions in Attack*, 89 INT’L L. STUD. 198, 206 (2013) (noting that “some have taken the view that damage also encompasses serious interruptions in functionality, such as would require replacing parts or reloading software systems. For example, in the kinetic analogy used above where a cyber attack shut down a communication port but left the rest of the computer unaffected, the computer would still turn on but its actual functionality might be seriously affected. If functionality is considered when determining damage, the kinetic analogy would be of limited value.”).\n⁶² See Captain Christopher M. Kovach, *Beyond Skynet: Reconciling Increased Autonomy in Computer-Based Weapons Systems with the Laws of War*, 71 A.F. L. REV. 231, 250 (2014) (noting that “the proliferation of dual-use facilities and systems complicates the ability of cyberweapons to limit their effects solely to lawful targets”).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. Election Interference Is Not Cyber-War\ncan be destroyed if the civilian harm is not disproportionate to the advantage conferred by denying the military use of the bridge. For a cyber-attack, this means that a computer system could be destroyed even if it has some civilian use, but only if that civilian use is not disproportionate to the military advantage. A cyber-attack against a general power grid that supplies power to both the civilian population and the military would be lawful or unlawful depending on the exact proportion of the two uses and the relative harm it would impose on the civilian population weighed against the military value of denying power to the military.⁶³ The same would hold true for a cyber-attack against an oil refinery.\nThe combatant’s privilege provides immunity to military personnel who fight during an armed conflict: as long as their acts comply with the laws of war, the soldiers cannot be prosecuted by a foreign adversary in a domestic court. The privilege applies to members of armed forces and members of a militia who wear uniforms or a fixed emblem, carry arms openly, have a responsible command structure, and comply with the laws and customs of warfare. In the kinetic context, it is clear what this means. Soldiers should wear uniforms, carry their rifles openly, and comply with the laws of war. Members of the CIA or other civilian agencies who are deployed covertly, without the state acknowledging their link to the forces, are not entitled to the combatant’s privilege and could be prosecuted by the enemy upon capture. For a cyber-warrior working for the U.S. government, it is unclear how these requirements should translate.⁶⁴ In theory, the cyber-warrior should be wearing a uniform or fixed emblem, although there is little transparency gain from a hacker’s wearing a uniform as compared to the transparency gain from an infantry soldier wearing a uniform. The problem of remoteness is not unique to cyber-warriors, since missile operators or airmen might never be seen by the enemy either and the general assumption is that these service personnel should wear identifying emblems.\nWhat does it mean for a cyber-warrior to “carry arms openly”? This is genuinely unclear and it is doubtful that there is a nonquestion-begging answer to this question. Military cyber-operations are often unacknowledged in the sense that the U.S. government will not acknowledge its role in an offensive cyber-attack, nor does it release much information about defensive cyber-activities either. To comply with the requirements of carrying arms openly and wearing a fixed emblem, should\n⁶³ See Duncan B.

Arguably yes, if the analogy to tanks and airplanes is the appropriate analogy.\n## 3. ELECTION INTERFERENCE AND THE LAW OF WAR\nBased on the preceding analysis, it is clear that while election interference is certainly destructive, it is not destructive in the way contemplated by the law of war.⁶⁵ Consequently, politicians who refer to election interference as an “act of war” almost surely have the legal analysis wrong. Future National Security Advisor John Bolton referred to Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election as an act of war, a “casus belli” that Washington would not and should not accept, and argued that negotiating with Russia was dangerous.⁶⁶ Despite their disagreements over how to approach Russia (and their disagreements about Russian election interference), Trump would later appoint Bolton as National Security Advisor. Similarly, Sen. Richard Blumenthal stated: “This was an act of war, in my view.” Blumenthal continued: “I’ve said it in various hearings before this indictment. Interestingly enough the indictment refers to information warfare, that’s the term the Russians use.”⁶⁷ Nikki Haley, at the time US Ambassador to the United Nations, stated that “[w]hen a country can come and interfere in another country’s elections, that is warfare,” and she also described election interference as Russia’s “weapon” of choice in its conflict with the United States.⁶⁸ Former Vice President and Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney used similar language.⁶⁹ Many pundits and political observers referred to election interference as an act of war:\nCall it a different kind of war – asymmetric warfare, or whatever. But it is war. Whatever role Trump played in the attack, whatever he knew or didn’t know about\n⁶⁵ As noted above, if a cyber-attack produces physical destruction, it would be regulated by the laws of war.

Election Interference Is Not Cyber-War\nit previously, Russia took a hostile strike against this country. And it is, so far, winning.⁷⁰\nOr consider the statement from one Democratic lawmaker who said that he had “no doubt” that Russian interference constituted an act of war.⁷¹ Even John McCain referred to it as an act of war.⁷² Other politicians referred to the Russian interference as “hybrid warfare” – a category that evokes armed conflict but at least in some usages would be defined as falling below the level of armed conflict. For example, Secretary of Defense Ash Carter said that Russia interfered in “our democratic processes” with hybrid warfare, that is “interference in the internal affairs of nations, short of war.”⁷³\nMost scholars who have considered the issue have correctly analyzed that Russian interference falls outside the scope of armed conflict, though each has struggled to articulate a convincing framing device. For example, Herb Lin has stated that:\nIW/IO is a hostile non-kinetic activity, or at least an activity that is conducted between two parties whose interests are not well-aligned. At the same time, IW/IO is not warfare in the Clausewitzian sense (nor in any sense presently recognized under the laws of war or armed conflict); it is better characterized as hostile or adversarial psychological manipulation. IW/IO has connotations of soft power (more properly, a mix of soft power and sharp power): propaganda, persuasion, culture, social forces, confusion, deception.⁷⁴\nOthers have similarly concluded that the interference fell below the threshold of armed conflict.⁷⁵ Understood in this way, interference is extremely disruptive but not a subject for *jus in bello* regulation.⁷⁶\nOutsiders (non-lawyers) often assume that the law of war is designed to regulate every infringement of a state’s territorial or political integrity. But that is certainly not the case.

Election Interference and the Law of War\n61\nhostilities – concepts which are internal to the concept of warfare. In theory, some types of cyber-attacks might fall under the regulation of the law of war, but most cases of election interference would not. The primary reason for this conclusion is that election interference rarely involves physical damage. In cases where data is destroyed, there is a case to be made that we should label such interference as an act of war. The erasure of the data could be accomplished by physically damaging election computers, or by simply erasing the data without physically destroying the hardware where it resides. In the case of a physical destruction, the election interference might be regulated by the law of war, but in all other cases, not.\nThe most salient examples of election interference involve either the theft and public release of private information or the posting of political views on social media platforms, often with the goal of disguising the true identity, and national origin, of the account holder. In the case of theft-and-release, a state might steal private information about a candidate – such as emails, text messages, private medical information, or confidential employment records from a human resources department – and release the damaging information to the public in order to favor a rival candidate.77 Some of the information might be real and some of the information might be doctored or otherwise misleading. In the case of the second example of election interference, the foreign state might create fake Facebook groups focusing on a particular issue or candidate, in order to drum up excitement for or against a particular candidate, or fake Twitter or Instagram accounts with the same goal in mind. Each of these activities involves foreign interference that arguably interferes with the political process and the political integrity of the target state, but neither involves the kind of physical destruction or territorial infringement that is the sine qua non of armed conflict.\nThere is a strong temptation to reduce all important issues of international law to questions of warfare. Armed conflict is a distinctive moment for international lawyers, full of peril, and the concept of warfare captures the imagination of nonlawyers. Often the critical question (does this conduct violate international law?) gets displaced by the simpler question (is the conduct a war crime?), without first considering whether war is the relevant paradigm or not. But international law is not reducible to the law of war. Public international law is so much richer than just rules regulating the use of force and the conduct of hostilities. We need to resist the temptation to put everything into a war framework. The distinct harm of election interference speaks to broader and more complex questions of political integrity that go well beyond the concept of armed conflict.\n77 The Tallinn Manual, supra note 27, at 55 concludes that “acts of cyber intelligence gathering and cyber theft, as well as cyber operations that involve brief or periodic interruption of non-essential cyber services, do not qualify as armed attacks.” It is unclear whether the experts considered the fact that a mere cyber theft, when used for the purpose of election interference, could have an enormous impact on the target state’s political process.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. Election Interference Is Not Cyber-War\nThat being said, it is important to recognize the impulse to analyze election interference through the war paradigm. The regulation of warfare is one of the great success stories of international law, because the discourse on warfare, both *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello*, has been wholeheartedly legalized. International lawyers discuss the rules of warfare with a precision that is almost scientific in nature. For a public grasping for certainty and legality, the law of war is an attractive horizon to steer towards. So, it is no wonder that people gravitate to the war paradigm given how successful international lawyers have been in occupying the field. But the war discussion crowds out alternative legal frameworks for understanding election interference, frameworks that focus on the political significance of elections and the way that foreign interference undermines the political integrity of the state.\nThe concept of “sovereignty” is one alternative framework.78 Clearly, a state’s violating the sovereignty of another state is illegal under some circumstances. So, it is intuitively plausible to suggest that election interference violates the sovereignty of the target state whose election is disputed, compromised, or influenced by the outside actor. The next chapter will explore “sovereignty” as a more salient legal category than armed conflict and examine both the benefits and the drawbacks of describing election interference in those terms. One noteworthy complication is the fact that the technical and doctrinal requirements for a legal infringement of sovereignty do not line up with common-sense intuitions about what counts as a violation of sovereignty. Consequently, many behaviors that sound as if they should count as sovereignty violations turn out to be perfectly legal – or at the very least contested – according to established doctrines of public international law. It also does not help that the concept of sovereignty is a cluster concept, housing diverse notions such as physical control over territory, control over a population, and expressions of a polity’s popular will. This produces a lot of cross-talking since not everyone means the same thing when they utter the word “sovereignty.”\nOne argument for focusing on sovereignty is that international law is much broader than the regulation of war. Just because election interference fails to qualify as an armed attack does not mean that the interference is lawful under international law. Similarly, even though election interference does not trigger a right of self-defense, international law might allow other responses to the interference. Under international law, a state is not required to simply suffer violations falling short of an armed attack. Victim states are entitled to use retorsions and countermeasures in an attempt to get the offending state to back off and cease the illegal behavior.\nCountermeasures and retorsions are united by the state’s intention behind their use, which is to induce the law-breaking state into compliance in the future. Countermeasures and retorsions differ in the legal status of the action used to induce\n78 See Michael N. Schmitt and Liis Vihul, *Respect for Sovereignty in Cyberspace*, 95 TEX. L. REV. 1659, 1647 (2017) (“Treating violations of sovereignty as a primary rule of international law, Tallinn Manual 2.0 seeks to add granularity to the circumstances in which a cyber operation might violate a State’s territorial sovereignty.”).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n3. Election Interference and the Law of War\n63\ncompliance. In the case of a countermeasure, the state that uses the countermeasure is engaging in conduct that is otherwise illegal; because the illegal conduct is used as a countermeasure to induce compliance, it becomes permissible. In contrast, a retorsion involves action that is already lawful and within the lawful discretion of the state. The classic example of a retorsion is recalling an ambassador, closing an embassy or breaking off diplomatic relations with a state. There is no requirement under international law for a state to have diplomatic relations with another state,79 and the state may recall an ambassador for any reason or no reason at all. Similarly, imagine that a state $a$ plans to sell missiles to state $b$, but becomes angry when state $b$ violates international law and refuses to sell the missiles. This would constitute a retorsion because state $a$ was under no obligation to sell the missiles in the first place.\nOf the two, countermeasures are the more controversial because they involve conduct that would otherwise be illegal. However, it should be noted that countermeasures should not include the use of military force, which are governed by the principles of self-defense. Although the issue is somewhat contested, the majority (and better) view is that the doctrine of countermeasures cannot be used as an exception to the requirements of *jus ad bellum*. If a state wishes to use military force, it needs either Security Council authorization or a defensive claim under article 51 of the UN Charter.\nAfter the Russian interference in the 2016 election, President Obama announced sanctions designed to punish the Russian government for election interference and related behavior, including Russian interference in Ukraine.80 For example, on April 1, 2015, President Obama issued an executive order declaring that “the increasing prevalence and severity of malicious cyber-enabled activities originating from, or directed by persons located, in whole or in substantial part, outside the United States constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.”81 On December 28, 2016, Obama amended the earlier executive order and ordered the Treasury Department to freeze the assets of individuals involved in Russian cyber-interference.82\n79 Of course, international law imposes certain restrictions on how ambassadors should be treated if a state is engaging in diplomatic relations with another state, but nothing requires the state to have the diplomatic relations in the first instance.\n80 Christina Lam, *A Slap on the Wrist: Combatting Russia’s Cyber Attack on the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election*, 59 B.C. L. Rev. 2167, 2201 (2018).\n81 See Exec. Order No. 13694, 80 Fed. Reg. 18,077 (Apr. 1, 2015).\n82 See Exec. Order No. 13757 (Dec. 28, 2016). The order was made pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1701, and the National Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1601. The executive order covered the following entities: Main Intelligence Directorate (a.k.a. GRU); Federal Security Service (a.k.a. FSB); Special Technology Center (a.k.a. STLC, Ltd. Special Technology Center St. Petersburg); Zorsecurity (a.k.a. Esage Lab); Autonomous Noncommercial Organization “Professional Association of Designers of Data Processing Systems” (a.k.a. ANO PO KSI). The order also included four Russian named individuals.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. Election Interference Is Not Cyber-War\nIn December 2016, the Obama administration also expelled thirty-five Russian diplomats who were described as members of Russian intelligence. In a related move, the Obama administration shut down two Russian diplomatic \"compounds\" that the administration claimed were being used for intelligence collection. Though these compounds were probably connected with domestic intelligence gathering rather than troll farm activity launched from St. Petersburg, the move to shut down the compounds was part of a general package of punitive actions against Moscow. In making this move, Obama stated:\nThese actions are not the sum total of our response to Russia's aggressive activities. We will continue to take a variety of actions at a time and place of our choosing, some of which will not be publicized. In addition to holding Russia accountable for what it has done, the United States and friends and allies around the world must work together to oppose Russia's efforts to undermine established international norms of behavior, and interfere with democratic governance. To that end, my Administration will be providing a report to Congress in the coming days about Russia's efforts to interfere in our election, as well as malicious cyber activity related to our election cycle in previous elections.\nIn addition to these punitive actions, it is possible that the United States also engaged in classified or covert actions that were not publicly disclosed. In particular, the United States reportedly launched a cyber-attack against the Russian government as a proportional countermeasure to the election interference. But the United States was careful not to describe any of its responses as either countermeasures or retorsions. Although this refusal is somewhat perplexing, it may have been connected with Obama's general reluctance to declare Russian interference as \"illegal\" under international law. Describing a punitive action as a countermeasure implies a conclusion both about the illegality of the offending conduct and also the illegality of the punitive measure under nonpunitive circumstances. The United States may have preferred to preserve maximum flexibility regarding its legal position on cyber-attacks. This may\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nConclusion\nhave contributed to the Obama Administration's relative silence on Russian interference in the 2016 election.⁸⁷\n# CONCLUSION\nRussia's interference in the 2016 election may have violated international law, but it was neither an act of war nor was it the opening salvo in a cyber-war between the United States and Russia. But this is not to diminish its significance, or even to diminish its illegality under both U.S. and international law. It may still be illegal, and the sooner that the public recognizes that it does not trigger a right of kinetic response under article 51 of the UN Charter, the sooner a more nuanced discussion can open up about the range of permissible responses under international law, such as retorsions and countermeasures outside the context of the use of force.⁸⁸ Political leaders have a range of options at their disposal but selecting among them requires consideration of the vast tools for enforcing international law beyond the use of force.\nTo recap the argument presented in this chapter: The principles governing *jus in bello* and *jus ad bellum* apply with equal force in the realm of cyber-attacks. A cyberattack that causes physical destruction may qualify as an armed attack triggering a right of self-defense under article 51 of the UN Charter, and a cyber-attack that causes physical destruction may constitute a resort to force that triggers the existence of an armed conflict and the application of IHL. But in the absence of physical destruction, cyber-attacks probably fall outside the scope of the laws of war.⁸⁹ Cyberwar is a real phenomenon, but in many cases, the \"war\" suffix is, legally speaking, a metaphor. In technical discussions, the term \"war\" is meant to convey the notion of an armed conflict pursued through sustained military engagements. In contrast, most cyber-attacks have more in common with the tools of statecraft than the tools of military science. Election interference falls in the category of statecraft, though it is important to remember that even statecraft is regulated by public international law.\n⁸⁷ See, e.g., Jack Crowe, *Rosenstein Calls Out Obama Admin For Failing to \"Publicize\" Russian Election Interference*, NATIONAL REVIEW (April 26, 2019).\n⁸⁸ In this sense, Brown is absolutely right when he concludes that \"[l]aw is a critical aspect of discussions about the cyber aspects of privacy rights, espionage, sovereignty, international norms of behavior, and more – but none of these things is within the realm of LOAC.\" Gary D. Brown, *International Law Applies to Cyber Warfare! Now What?*, 46 SW. L. REV. 355, 356 (2017).\n⁸⁹ See Prescott, *supra* note 1, at 48 (asserting that \"[b]elow the level of this use of force, cyber operations that result only in direct effects within cyberspace itself would not be considered uses of force regulated by LOAC, even though their indirect effects might have far-reaching and negative impacts upon the nation targeted.\"); Lubell, *supra* note 49, at 259 (concluding that \"[t]here can be plenty of cyber operations that occur outside the context of an armed conflict, such as certain types of cyber espionage between supposedly friendly countries to which the law of armed conflict would not apply\"). Lubell also argues that psychological operations (such as operations that have the goal of disseminating propaganda) \"are not considered to be ones that cause direct harm to the civilian population and, as such, can be excluded from certain restrictions placed on attacks.\" *Id.* at 263.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. Election Interference Is Not Cyber-War\nJust because a tool of statecraft falls below the legal threshold for armed conflict does not necessarily mean that the tool is part of a state's exclusive discretion, or what international lawyers sometimes call its domaine réservé.\nThe next two chapters focus on two competing frameworks for regulating cyber-election interference. Chapter 3 analyzes whether \"sovereignty\" is the correct concept, such that cyber interference might be viewed as an illegal infringement of a state's sovereignty. Among international lawyers, this is the \"preferred\" framework or the \"majority\" approach, though there are significant drawbacks to the approach, and I count myself as a dissenting voice. Then, Chapter 4 analyzes whether \"self-determination\" is a more promising framework, so that cyber interference might be viewed as a violation of a people's collective right of self-determination. This is an uncommon approach not yet adopted by public international lawyers, though they should give this approach a second look. In addition to being doctrinally salient, the concept of self-determination dovetails with our commonsense intuition that election interference is harmful because of its corrosive effect on the machinery of core democratic institutions.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press"

      "flat_text": "## INTRODUCTION\nHistorically, foreign election interference was accomplished through nondigital means. So, for example, a state might drop leaflets on a city urging the residents to take a particular action. Or, the state might broadcast messages over radio or other media. Or, the interfering state might make corrupt deals with local politicians or officials in ways that might constitute meddling. In today's world, however, these prosaic forms of interference have been replaced with their digital counterparts: the use of email hacking and fraudulent social media presence to influence the public and consequently interfere with an election. Because the method of election interference has shifted to the digital domain, there is a strong temptation to view the legality of election interference through the international legal rules governing cyber-attacks. In other words, one common assumption made by commentators is that election interference should be understood as a subcategory or particular instantiation of cyber-attacks. Although the international law governing cyber-activity is still emerging, the greatest clarity in that area stems from the international law regarding cyber-war. The majority view among international lawyers is that the regular rules governing kinetic warfare – that is, physical military movements – also apply to cyber-warfare.¹ So, for example, an attack that would violate the law of war if conducted by planes and tanks would also violate the law of war if the same effects are produced by a cyber-attack launched by a team of hackers acting as state-cyber-combatants.\nWe will discuss this particular argument in greater detail below, but for the moment the key point is that there is a strong temptation to understand election\n¹ For an expression of this point of view, see Jody M. Prescott, *Building the Ethical Cyber Commander and the Law of Armed Conflict*, 40 RUTGERS COMPUTER &amp; TECH. L.J. 42, 47 (2014) (“As nations move toward securing the means to conduct cyber conflict that begins to approach our common understandings of war, a consensus appears to be emerging among international organizations concerned with the implementation of LOAC, and in academia, that LOAC at least applies to those actions in cyberspace that either result in, or are intended to result in, injury to humans and damage to geophysical things.”).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\ninterference through the lens of cyber-war. In other words, some would condemn election interference as illegal under international law because it represents a form of cyber-warfare. Other lawyers and politicians will argue the opposite: that election interference does not violate international law because it does not rise to the level of a cyber-war, as if this is the end of the matter in terms of the legal analysis. What unites these two competing conclusions is the assumption that cyber-warfare is the correct framework for judging the legality of election interference. That assumption is profoundly mistaken.\nThis chapter will explain why the assumption is mistaken and why the cyber-war framework is unhelpful. Although international law is a broad and sweeping body of law, the legal regulation of warfare is one of the most prominent and successful subdisciplines of international law. So, perhaps it is not surprising that lawyers should jump to cyber-war as an attractive framing device. But the framing device is poor and sucks up oxygen from other more compelling frameworks that international law has to offer.\nIn order to explain why cyber-war is a poor fit for understanding election interference, this chapter will first explain the basic principles behind the legal regulation of warfare. Then, in Section 2, this chapter will explain how these principles apply in the context of cyber-attacks. Finally, Section 3 will consider the specific case of election interference to show why it does not constitute an illegal cyber-attack in violation of the law of war. But just because it does not violate the rules regarding cyber-war does not mean that it might not violate some other area of international law. The field of international law is at once broader and deeper than the legal regulation of armed conflict. But only by first pushing aside the most obvious framing device can we move toward more compelling and innovative frameworks for understanding the particular harm posed by foreign election interference. This argument will unfold over the course of the subsequent chapters.\n## INTERNATIONAL REGULATION OF WARFARE\n### The Distinction Between Jus ad Bellum and Jus in Bello\nThe international legal regulation of warfare is based on the foundational distinction between jus ad bellum and jus in bello -- terms that originate with the Just War philosophical tradition. Jus ad bellum regulates the recourse to force, that is, the decision to go to war in the first place. With very few exceptions, states are mostly prohibited from using military force to settle international disputes, but in some situations, the recourse to military force might be justified. In contrast, jus in bello regulates the conduct of hostilities during an armed conflict. So, for example, jus in bello passes judgment on the tactics used during an armed conflict, such as who can be targeted, in what\n\ncircumstances, and with what weapons.² For example, one of the cardinal rules of *jus in bello* is the rule prohibiting collateral damage that is excessive or disproportionate to the value of the military target.³ One way of explaining the distinction between *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* is that the former covers macro-questions regarding the legality of the overall war, while the latter covers micro-questions regarding the conduct of individual military operations within that war.\nThe legal domains of *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* are legally and conceptually independent, in the sense that a *jus in bello* analysis does not depend on the outcome of the *jus ad bellum* analysis.⁴ In other words, both the aggressor state and the victim state are required to follow the same rules regarding the conduct of warfare. The victim state is not entitled to more liberal rules for the conduct of warfare, just because the victim state is on the receiving end of a *jus ad bellum* violation. Conversely, the aggressor state is not subject to more restrictive conduct rules just because the aggressor state has violated *jus ad bellum* principles. In the conduct of cyber-war, this means that whether a state has violated *jus ad bellum* or not is irrelevant to the question of how the rules of *jus in bello* are applied in the context of cyber-attacks. It is important to keep the macro-level and micro-level questions separate.\nThere has been a recent trend in the philosophical literature to question the canonical separation between *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* principles. These “revisionist just war” arguments have pushed back against the classical Just War Tradition, which always assumed that the *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* domains were conceptually distinct.⁵ Under the revisionist line of thinking, philosophers have suggested that, for example, noncombatants on the victim side should be entitled to fight back against an unjust aggression, whereas under the traditional view, noncombatants are prohibited from participating in hostilities and are therefore not entitled to the combatant’s privilege.⁶ Part of the inspiration for the revisionist trend is that the ethical rules regarding killing should be the same for individuals as they are for groups.⁷ In other words, the revisionist camp aims to ² See GARY SOLIS, THE LAW OF ARMED CONFLICT 7–8 (2nd edn., Cambridge University Press, 2016) (noting that: “All’s fair in love and war? Hardly! Any divorce lawyer will attest that ‘all’ is decidedly not fair in love. Just as surely, all is not fair in war.”).\n³ Id. at 292–300.\n⁴ See MICHAEL WALZER, JUST AND UNJUST WARS: A MORAL ARGUMENT WITH HISTORICAL ILLUSTRATIONS 21 (3rd edn., Basic Books, 2000) (suggesting that the “two sorts of judgment are logically independent”). See also Nathaniel Berman, Privileging Combat? Contemporary Conflict and the Legal Construction of War, 43 COLUM. J. TRANSNAT’L L. 1, 27 (2004) (discussing the “indifference of jus in bello to the relative jus ad bellum merits of the parties”).\n⁵ See Jeff McMahan, War as Self-Defense, 18 ETH. &amp; INT’L AFF. 75 (2004).\n⁶ See Jeff McMahan, Innocence, Self-Defense and Killing in War, 2 J. POL. PHIL. 193–221 (1994).\n⁷ McMahan, supra note 6, at 198 (“According to virtually all accounts of the right of individual self-defense, the Culpable Attacker is not morally permitted to use lethal violence even to defend himself against his initial victim’s self-defensive response.”).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press Whatever one thinks about the philosophical legitimacy of these revisionist arguments, even the philosophers do not contend that their arguments are currently represented in international legal doctrine.⁸ The revisionist just war philosophers are making arguments about the deep morality of warfare and even some of them concede that there might be legitimate institutional or pragmatic reasons why international law separates *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* into conceptually distinct normative regimes. For example, it might be unworkable to assign to each soldier and to each civilian the task of determining whether a military invasion is justified under *jus ad bellum* before they decide how they should behave.⁹ So, the virtue of the current legal regime is that soldiers and civilians alike can fight (or not fight) in a war without having to adjudicate the contentious *jus ad bellum* questions. Whether this separation is consistent with the “deep morality” of warfare or not, it certainly makes life for the professional solider (on both sides) more workable and represents the current state of the legal regulation of warfare. It may even be morally justified as an instrumental matter, because separating the two domains might service the legitimate goal of designing real-world institutions that ensure compliance with rules that are a second-best alternative to the deep morality of war.¹⁰ ## B. The Basic Rules Regarding Jus ad Bellum The rules regarding *jus ad bellum* are relatively straightforward to articulate, although they are contentious when it comes to their *application*. The use of military force by one state against another state is only justified if taken in self-defense or in accordance with a Security Council authorization. Article 2(4) of the UN Charter prohibits the use of military force for the resolution of international disputes, but article 51 of the UN Charter carves out cases of self-defense from the basic article 2(4) prohibition.¹¹ Article 51 imposes various requirements for the exercise of self-defense, including the existence of an armed attack against the victim ⁸ *Id.* at 208 (“There are compelling reasons why the laws of war cannot treat the use of violence by Unjust Combatants as criminal.”).\n⁹ *Id.* at 208.\n¹⁰ See Janina Dill, *Should International Law Ensure the Moral Acceptability of War?*, 26 LEIDEN J.

L. 253–70 (2013).\n¹¹ Article 2(4) of the UN Charter states: “All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.” Article 51 states that “Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. Measures taken by Members in the exercise of https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press state, and a requirement that the Security Council be informed if a state is exercising its legal right of self-defense. Although not explicitly articulated in the text of article 51, international law also imposes additional constraints, including requirements of imminence, necessity, and proportionality.¹² The former requires that the armed attack against the victim state be imminent at the point in time when the victim state uses military force to repel the threat. The latter requirement requires that the defensive force be necessary to stop the threat; if nonmilitary measures are available to resolve the threat, the resort to defensive force is illegitimate (because it is unnecessary at the point in time when it is exercised). Any military response to an attack, undertaken in self-defense pursuant to article 51, would be constrained by the principle of proportionality, meaning that the defensive force must not be disproportionate to the legitimate interest being vindicated by the defensive force.¹³ The Security Council is entitled under Chapter VII of the UN Charter to issue a binding resolution calling on member states to use military force to resolve a threat of or breach of international peace and security.¹⁴ Member states are not required to use military force in that situation, but they are permitted to do so; the Security Council resolution transforms what would otherwise potentially be a violation of article 2(4) into a lawful police action to enforce international law. The Security Council is therefore a clearinghouse for decisions regarding the lawfulness of military force, although individual states retain the\"inherent\"right to exercise defensive force even in situations where the Security Council fails to act to authorize military force.¹⁵ The Security Council may also authorize nonmilitary measures under article 41 of the UN Charter.¹⁶ The right to unilateral defense force is particularly important since the Security Council includes five permanent members (China, France, Russia, United States, United Kingdom), each of whom enjoys a veto, that is, the right to veto any resolution coming out of the Security Council.\nthis right of self-defence shall be immediately reported to the Security Council and shall not in any way affect the authority and responsibility of the Security Council under the present Charter to take at any time such action as it deems necessary in order to maintain or restore international peace and security.\"¹² For a discussion of these requirements, see generally YORAM DINSTEIN, WAR, AGGRESSION, AND SELF-DEFENSE (Cambridge University Press, 2012).\n¹³ For a discussion of the proportionality requirement, see generally MICHAEL A.

The Basic Rules Regarding Jus in Bello\nThe rules regarding the conduct of warfare are expressed in major treaty conventions such as the four post-World War II Geneva Conventions, two additional protocols to the Geneva Conventions from 1977, and the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907. These treaty sources can be combined with rules of customary international law that equally regulate the conduct of hostilities. The rules regarding the conduct of warfare can be broadly fit into the following categories: targeting, participation in hostilities, tactics in warfare, and weaponry.\nFor example, the bedrock principle of *jus in bello* is that attacking forces should limit their attacks to enemy combatants, that is, members of enemy military forces or other militia units that meet the requirements of combatancy. Attacking forces are also entitled to attack civilians for such time as those civilians are directly participating in hostilities.¹⁷ It would be incongruous if a state could avoid its nationals being targeted simply by refusing to organize itself into formal military units, hence the exceptional rule that allows targeting of civilians who directly participate in hostilities. Despite this cardinal rule of distinction, civilians may be killed but only as collateral damage.¹⁸ By the phrase “collateral damage,” the law means that the civilians were not the object of the attack but were killed as a side effect of an attack on a lawful military objective such as a military asset or military personnel.¹⁹ So the difference between a violation of the principle of distinction and a case of permissible collateral damage is the attitude of the attacker. If the attacker is aiming at the civilian, the attacker has violated the principle of distinction. On the other hand, if the attacker is aiming at a lawful military objective, but still kills a civilian or a group of civilians, the civilians are considered collateral damage. The attacking force may even envision the civilian deaths, and they should still be counted as collateral damage.²⁰ However, the *jus in bello* imposes a major constraint on the existence of collateral damage by prohibiting collateral\n¹⁷ This rule is codified in article 51(3) of Additional Protocol I (API) to the General Conventions: “Civilians shall enjoy the protection afforded by this Section, unless and for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities.”\n¹⁸ The principle of distinction is also sometimes referred to as the principle of discrimination. The two are roughly synonymous, though the word “distinction” is more often used by lawyers and “discrimination” is more common among philosophers of war.\n¹⁹ Solis dates the term “collateral damage” to the 1991 Gulf War. See SOLIS, *supra* note 2, at 295; SAHR CONWAY-LANZ, *COLLATERAL DAMAGE* 221 .\n²⁰ The question of mental intent in the context of collateral damage is somewhat complicated and has produced a series of unfortunate statements from international courts. For a discussion of this issue, see Jens David Ohlin, *Targeting and the Concept of Intent*, 35 MICH. J. INT’L L. 79 (2013).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\ndamage that is disproportionate or “excessive” to the anticipated value of the military advantage that will be gained from destroying the military target.²¹ The *jus in bello* also outlaws particular tactics. Killing by perfidy is outlawed, such as pretending to be a civilian to draw out the enemy or waiving a white flag and pretending to surrender, only to kill the enemy during an ambush.²² These are “dishonest stratagems” as Kant called them, and impermissible as far back as the Lieber Code.²³ Similarly, the *jus in bello* prohibits tactics that increase the suffering of the enemy (*maux superflus*) but do not produce any additional military benefit.²⁴ So, in other words, it would be illegal to use a weapon that does not increase lethality but only increases the pain that the enemy will suffer before dying. Similarly, particular weapons may be outlawed by particular treaties or conventions, such as nuclear weapons (for some states that have signed nonproliferation accords), chemical weapons, cluster munitions, and landmines, though in each of these cases (other than chemical weapons) several states have refused to sign on to the conventions because they consider the weapon system in question to be necessary for strategic interests. Finally, attacking forces are not permitted to attack soldiers who are *hors de combat* because they are sick or because they have effectively communicated their surrender. Consequently, summarily executing a group of POWs (without legal process or criminal culpability) would constitute a war crime.\nThe basic structure behind the *jus in bello* is to create a special “war convention,” as Michael Walzer once described it. It creates, in other words, a special framework for the conduct of hostilities. Lawful combatants are granted the combatant’s privilege: in exchange for opening themselves up to the reciprocal risk of killing, combatants may not be prosecuted by the enemy for lawful acts of belligerency. In exchange, combatants are required to limit their attacks to military objects, thus sparing civilians from the burdens of war, as much as possible as would be consistent with the need to pursue the war effort (banning collateral damage entirely would effectively hamper warfare entirely). The requirement to carry arms openly and to avoid perfidious killing – among other prohibitions – install a basic notion of transparency in the law of war. Combatants do not simply fight for themselves as if they were fighting in a duel. Rather, combatants are representatives of the state, killing on the state’s behalf, and therefore combatants and the state “advance and retrograde” together on the field of battle, in Lieber’s ²¹ See API, art. 51(5) (“Among others, the following types of attacks are to be considered as indiscriminate... (b) an attack which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.”).\n²² See API, art. 37(1) (“It is prohibited to kill, injure or capture an adversary by resort to perfidy. Acts inviting the confidence of an adversary to lead him to believe that he is entitled to, or is obliged to accord, protection under the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, with intent to betray that confidence, shall constitute perfidy...”).\n²³ However, it should be noted that “ruses of war are not prohibited.” See API, art. 37(2).\n²⁴ API, art. 35(2) (“2. It is prohibited to employ weapons, projectiles and material and methods of warfare of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering.”).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press famous phrase.²⁵ None of that would be possible without a basic principle of transparency in the application of *jus in bello*, which requires for its operation a tangible and public connection between individual combatants and the state on whose behalf they fight.\n## 2. THE EMERGING CONSENSUS ON CYBER-WAR The last few years have witnessed a tremendous acceleration of work applying the law of war to the context of cyber-attacks. That being said, there is some uncertainty over the application of core law of war principles to cyber-space. There are several reasons for the uncertainty. The first is that there has been little diplomatic effort to codify specific international rules for cyber-attacks. One reason for the reluctance is that many lawyers believe that existing rules of IHL are adequate to the task of regulating state behavior in cyber-space. Second, some states want to preserve flexibility for their operations conducted in the cyber-realm. Third, the secretive nature of cyber-activities hampers the formation of customary rules. Customary international law develops out of state practice (action) and *opinio juris* (performing the legal action from a sense of legal obligation). But many cyber-attacks are conducted in secret, either covertly or clandestinely, and states often refuse to acknowledge their involvement in cyber-attacks. Other states will sometimes criticize those attacks, but in other situations the difficulty with “attribution” will hamper those public criticisms, thus leading to more private criticism through diplomatic channels.²⁶ This dynamic scuttles or limits the formation of customary norms. However, despite these limitations, international lawyers have worked hard to explain, through soft-law mechanisms, how the law of war applies in cyber-space. One result of this effort, the Tallinn Manual, brought together experts on cyber-law and sought feedback from state governments.\nThis section outlines the state of international law regarding cyber-war: subsection A focuses on the role of the Tallinn Manual in constructing these norms; subsection B on whether cyber-wars are armed conflicts under international law; subsection C on the armed attack requirement for self-defense; and subsection D on the application of *jus in bello* principles to cyber-attacks.\n²⁵ Lieber Code, art. 20 (“Public war is a state of armed hostility between sovereign nations or governments. It is a law and requisite of civilized existence that men live in political, continuous societies, forming organized units, called states or nations, whose constituents bear, enjoy, suffer, advance and retrograde together, in peace and in war.”).\n²⁶ See Delbert Tran, *The Law of Attribution: Rules for Attributing the Source of A Cyber-Attack*, 20 YALE J. L. &amp; TECH. 376, 386 (2018) (noting that the “difficulty in tracing the source of a cyber-attack has long plagued discussions of cybersecurity, and much of current scholarship has accepted the traditional wisdom that the technological architecture of the internet makes attribution an exceedingly difficult problem”); Collin S. Allan, *Attribution Issues in Cyberspace*, 13 CHI.-KENT J. INT’L &amp; COMP. L. 55 (2013).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n## A. The Role of the Tallinn Manual\nThe Tallinn Manual was initiated by the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, which is located in Tallinn, Estonia.²⁷ The initiative involved a collaboration of international law and military law experts from across the world, followed by consultation and feedback from governments and their legal advisors. Although the Tallinn Manual is not a source of international law per se, it is relevant to the state of international law for two reasons. First, it may help in the formation of customary international law, as states gravitate towards particular statements of customary rules and norms, providing expression of legal rules for states to either accept or reject through the process of *opinio juris*. Second, the Tallinn Manual is a semi-authoritative statement of how experts believe that the existing law can and should be applied in cyber-space. If there is no need to amend or create new law, but simply a need to apply existing law to activities in cyber-space, then there is no requirement that the application be guided by the stringent rules for the creation of international law.²⁸\nThe Tallinn Manual focused on a variety of legal questions, including the applicability of *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* principles to cyber-attacks, and the use of countermeasures to thwart cyber-attacks. Also, the Tallinn Manual discusses violations of sovereignty that fall below the “armed attack” threshold – violations that will be the focus of the next chapter of this book.²⁹\n## B. Are Cyber-Wars Real Wars As a Matter of International Law?\nThe first threshold question is whether a cyber-war is a real “war” in the legal sense of that term as used by international lawyers. The answer to that question is yes, depending on the type of damage produced by the conflict, though this answer is a bit controversial.³⁰ Some legal scholars argue that defining cyber-wars as real “armed conflicts” only functions to give state militaries control over cyber-infrastructure and cyber-governance – questions that necessarily impact civilian life and which ought not to be exclusively managed by state militaries.³¹ There is\n²⁷ See TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE (Michael N. Schmitt et al. (eds.), 2013) [hereinafter cited as “Tallinn Manual”].\n²⁸ The strictly defined sources of international law are generally outlined in article 38 of the ICJ Statute.\n²⁹ For our purposes, the Tallinn Manual sections on cyber-war are the most relevant to our analysis.\n³⁰ For example, the philosopher Larry May has argued that cyber-wars should not be understood as real “armed conflicts” in the way that international lawyers use that term. See Larry May, The Nature of War and the Idea of “Cyberwar,” in Ohlin et al. (eds.), CYBER WAR: LAW AND ETHICS FOR VIRTUAL CONFLICTS 3 (Oxford University Press, 2015) (suggesting that one could look at cyber-attacks as more like embargoes than as armed conflicts).\n³¹ See Mary Ellen O’Connell, *Cyber Security without Cyber War*, 17 J. CONFLICT &amp; SEC. L. 187, 209 (2012) (“To date, the problem of Internet security has been the domain of international law scholars with expertise in use of force questions. They have sent the message that the Internet may be protected through military force or the threat of military force, analogizing to Cold War deterrence strategy.”\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nwisdom in this criticism, though it is also the case that some cyber-wars should be considered significant enough to qualify as an armed conflict if they result in physical damage.\nIn terms of the application of international law, there is a widely shared definition for what counts as an armed conflict. International lawyers generally distinguish between international armed conflicts (IACs) between states, and noninternational armed conflicts (NIACs) between a state and a nonstate actor or between two nonstate actors. An IAC is triggered when there is a resort to\"armed force\"by one state against another state.[32] The standard view, though it is not codified in any treaty, is that there is no intensity threshold for this determination. In other words, an IAC exists between two states when one state uses military force against the other, regardless of how much force is used, or for how long it lasts. An IAC might involve a one-time airstrike by one state's air force, bombing targets in the other state, or the IAC might involve a full-scale land invasion that lasts for months or even years.[33] Either way, military force is traditionally thought of as involving some kinetic activity – the crossing of a border with a military asset, or the use of a confederate to destroy installations or buildings within the target state. It is very hard to think of an international armed conflict being triggered without either a border crossing or some physical destruction of at least some kind.\nIn contrast, a NIAC requires the existence of violent hostilities between a state and a nonstate actor that reaches a certain level of scope and intensity. So, for example, the state's use of physical force against a nonstate actor, such as a group of rebels, might not constitute an armed conflict if the state simply fires a few shots and arrests the members of the rebel organization. However, if there are sustained hostilities between the state and the nonstate actor that pass a certain threshold, the situation Governments have followed this modelling, pouring resources into the military for keeping the Internet safe and for taking advantage of what it offers to attack opponents. Doing so has required strained analogies of cyber-attacks to conventional kinetic attacks. The Internet is now far less secure than before there was a Cyber Command or a NATO CCDCOE. It is time, therefore, to turn to cyber disarmament and a focus on peaceful protection of the Internet.\"). See also Christopher J. Finlay, Just War, Cyber War, and the Concept of Violence, 31 PHILOSOPHY &amp; TECHNOLOGY 357-77 (2018) (preferring to conceptualize cyber-attacks under the broader rubric of\"violence\"instead of\"war\"); Ryan Patterson, Silencing the Call to Arms: A Shift Away from Cyber Attacks As Warfare, 48 LOY. L. A.L. REV. 969, 975 (2015) (arguing that\"alternate legal regimes, including domestic law enforcement and the international principle of non-interference, may prove more effective frameworks to govern malicious cyber activities\"). Compare with Yoram Dinstein, Cyber War and International Law: Concluding Remarks at the 2012 Naval War College International Law Conference, 89 INT'L L. STUD. 276, 283 (2013) (\"There is nothing extraordinary in cyber warfare: it is just ordinary warfare with a little bit of extra. Cyber warfare does not merely resemble other forms of warfare: it is warfare. As such, it is directly governed by the jus in bello.\").\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press might graduate from a law enforcement operation to a full-blown NIAC that triggers the application of IHL rules (at least the rules that apply during a NIAC).³⁴ Assuming that these articulations are correct statements about the international legal threshold for armed conflict, most cyber-attacks will not rise to the level of an armed conflict. Although the standard for the creation of an armed conflict is more liberal for international conflicts (IACs) than internal ones (NIACs), because the standard allows any use of force, it is unclear whether a cyber-attack would constitute a “use of force” against another state.³⁵ On this question there is not universal agreement. At first blush, one can distinguish between three examples of cyber-attacks. In the first, one state uses a cyber-attack to cause damage or to destroy a physical building in the target state. For example, the state uses a cyber-attack to cause an electrical power station to overheat, resulting in an explosion and fire that destroys the power station. The second example would be a cyber-attack that is launched against a computer system in the target state, resulting in the physical destruction of the computer system but no other physical destruction. The third example would be a cyber-attack that penetrates a foreign computer system, resulting in the theft or destruction of information but no physical damage, not even physical damage to the computer system.\nAlthough experts are divided on some of these questions, there is widespread agreement that the first example would constitute a use of force that would trigger the existence of an armed conflict. In that case, a cyber-war would be a “war” in the sense of an “armed conflict” as international lawyers use the term. As the Tallinn Manual stated in its Rule 11, “A cyber operation constitutes a use force when its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force.”³⁶ In making this determination, international lawyers sometimes look at the “scale and effects” of the force to determine whether it crosses the relevant threshold.³⁷ In determining whether a cyber-attack constitutes a use of force, the Tallinn Manual suggests looking at the following criteria: severity, immediacy, ³⁴ Although customary international law arguably imposes the same (or similar) rules of conduct in both types of armed conflict, major treaties regulating *jus in bello* impose different legal regimes in each type of conflict. For example, the full Geneva Conventions apply during IACs, whereas only one article of the Geneva Conventions – Common article 3 – applies during NIACs.\n³⁵ Solis, one of the leading American experts on the law of war, describes the standard in the following terms: “A cyber attack, as opposed to a cyber intrusion, constitutes a ‘use of force’ if undertaken by a state’s armed forces, intelligence services, or a private contractor whose conduct is attributable to the state, and its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations that rise to a level of a use of force.” Gary D. Solis, *Cyber Warfare*, 219 MIL. L. REV. 1, 15 (2014).\n³⁶ Tallinn Manual, *supra* note 27, at 45.\n³⁷ *Id.* at 46 (noting that “scale and effects” is a shorthand term that captures the quantitative and qualitative factors to be analysed in determining whether a cyber operation qualifies as a use of force”). The use of the “scale and effects” language in the Tallinn Manual is a bit unfortunate because it confuses the ICJ standard for armed attack within the context of self-defense for the standard for determining whether something counts as a use of force, despite the fact that the Tallinn Manual concedes that the definitions for a “use of force” and an “armed attack” are designed to “serve different normative purposes.” *Id.* at 52. That being said, the confusion is not important, https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press The second and third examples are more complicated. Some international lawyers would consider the second example a use of force because it involved the physical destruction of a computer system. The third example is the most difficult, because many lawyers would consider the loss or theft of information to be insufficient to count as a use of force under international law. A small minority of lawyers are more liberal in their interpretation of what counts as a use of force. However, it would seem that the majority has the better of the argument, because it is hard to understand how the mere theft of information could constitute an armed attack. Indeed, it seems to be theft or destruction of information, rather than an armed attack. One might argue that the concept of an armed attack should be amended in today's world of cyber-threats, but indeed the whole point of using this legal trigger is to declare the existence of an armed conflict and trigger the application of IHL, and it is unclear how anything would be improved by triggering the application of IHL every time there is a cross-border cyber-attack. Indeed, one should remember that IHL has both a regulating and licensing function, in that it allows privileged (i.e. lawful) combatants to kill each other with personal legal immunity. So, there are some costs to the application of IHL, and placing states in a constant state of armed conflict simply because of a cyber-attack would do little to resolve international disputes peacefully.\nIn practical terms, what this means for election interference is that most cases of cyber-election interference will not trigger the existence of an armed conflict under international law. If state agents seek to influence an election by surreptitiously posting messages on social media, even if in doing so they pretend to be American citizens, this hardly seems like a\"use of force\"in the military sense of that term. Even if a state uses a cyber-attack to hack election results and change vote tallies, this clearly constitutes a substantial intrusion in the political integrity of another state, though again it is hard to qualify it as a use of force. The changing of the vote tallies would alter – arguably destroy – the legitimacy of the election results, but the problem is that international law views the concept of the use of force through a military lens, while in this case the harm seems decidedly political rather than military.\nbecause all parties agree that a cyber operation can, in theory, constitute a use of force under international law.\n³⁸ Id. at 48–52 (but noting that the factors are not exhaustive and that\"States may look to others, such as the prevailing political environment, whether the cyber operation portends the future use of military force, the identity of the attacker, any record of cyber operations by the attacker, and the nature of the target (such as critical infrastructure)\").\n³⁹ Id. at 52 (Rule 12:\"A cyber operation, or threatened cyber operation, constitutes an unlawful threat of force when the threatened action, if carried out, would be an unlawful use of force.\").\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press In drawing this conclusion, we need to postpone the more general question of whether such interference violates another body of international law and focus for the moment on the narrower question of whether the “war” paradigm is the right way for understanding information operations aimed at undermining the legitimacy of an election. Based on the analysis in this chapter, it is quite clear that the war paradigm is deficient.\nThe one situation where there might be an argument for classifying election interference as a use of force is if the cyber-attack does more than simply penetrate election infrastructure but actually physically destroys it. So, for example, if a state were to launch a cyber-attack that caused election machines to overheat and become inoperable, there is an argument that such a cyber-attack might constitute a use of force. Or, similarly, if a cyber-attack causes the electrical system at a state board of elections to overheat and cause a fire, this too would create the physical manifestation necessary to constitute a use of force. But if the election interference of 2016 has taught us anything, it is that the most potent forms of interference involve no physical damage at all. The target of this interference is not physical locations or the lives of military or civilian personnel; the target is democratic institutions through the strategic deployment of misinformation. Social media campaigns designed to influence an election are not acts of war, though this conclusion should not blind us to the threat they pose to democratic systems. We will need to leave to the next two chapters whether international law has an alternative paradigm to describe the harm caused by these cyber-attacks.\n### C. The Armed Attack Requirement for Self-Defense The prior subsection focused exclusively on the triggering conditions for the existence of an armed conflict (and hence the applicability of IHL). A distinct but related question is what constitutes an “armed attack” under article 51 of the UN Charter. The existence of an armed attack is a condition for the target being permitted to exercise lethal force in response as a defensive measure. It is important to remember that not every violation of international law triggers a right of self-defense in response. Some violations, when they rise to the level of an armed attack, are considered sufficiently serious that the victim state is entitled to unilaterally exercise defensive force even in the absence of Security Council authorization.\nThe armed attack requirement is not subject to the same intensity requirements as required by the use of force analysis by IHL in the context of a NIAC. However, given the similarities between the two tests, international lawyers have generally assumed that an armed attack for purposes of article 51 requires some physical destruction. In the Nicaragua opinion, the ICJ argued that an attack must meet a “scale and effects” criterion in order to qualify as an armed attack -- a standard that has had enormous influence in contemporary international legal and diplomatic practice. The Tallinn Manual endorses the “scale and effects” standard in the context of self-defense, though it concedes that even before the complication of cyber-attacks is added to the mix, the standard is somewhat vague and requires contentious application.⁴⁰ Governments likely support an “effects” test for evaluating a cyber-attack because it preserves maximum flexibility for using offensive cyber-attacks in many situations that fall below the relevant “effects” threshold.⁴¹ Consequently, a cyber-attack in some circumstances could qualify as an armed attack that triggers the inherent right to self-defense article in article 51.⁴² The destruction must be foreseeable but it need not be immediate.⁴³ For example, if a cyber-attack produces death or physical destruction, even if that consequence is a “downstream” consequence, it might still qualify as an armed attack, as long as the resulting destruction is a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the cyber-attack.⁴⁴ One notable example is a cyber-attack against a water-filtration plant that prevents the target state from maintaining the quality of its water-supply; if civilians ultimately get sick or die, even if that occurs weeks or months after the original cyber-attack, this could qualify as an armed attack for purposes of article 51.⁴⁵ If a military – that is, kinetic – response is going to be authorized by international law, it makes sense to have a demanding trigger. Consequently, the majority of experts who worked on the Tallinn Manual concluded that an armed attack requires an actual or imminent territorial infringement that will cause physical damage to persons or things.⁴⁶ The imminence requirement is a preexisting element of the ⁴⁰ Id. at 55 (concluding that “the parameters of the scale and effects criteria remain unsettled beyond the indication that they need to be grave”).\n⁴¹ See Matthew C. Waxman, Cyber-Attacks and the Use of Force: Back to the Future of Article 2(4), 36 YALE J. INT’L L. 421, 434–5 (2011) (concluding that “the U.S. government probably prefers an effects- or consequences-based interpretation of ‘force’ or ‘armed attack’ with respect to cyber-attacks not only for what it includes (and therefore what the Charter prohibits and what could trigger self-defense rights), but also for what it excludes. Computer-based espionage, intelligence collection, or even some preemptive cyber-operations or countermeasures designed to disable an adversary’s threatening capabilities, for example, would generally not constitute prohibited force because these activities do not produce destructive consequences analogous to a kinetic military attack”).\n⁴² Tallinn Manual, supra note 27, at 54 (“The International Group of Experts unanimously concluded that some cyber operations may be sufficiently grave to warrant classifying them as an ‘armed attack’ within the meaning of the Charter.”).\n⁴³ See Michael Gervais, Cyber Attacks and the Laws of War, 30 BERKELEY J. INT’L L. 525, 538 (2012) (noting that “[c]yber attacks do not always intentionally target the critical infrastructure that they eventually disrupt”). For another defense of the “reasonably foreseeable” standard in this context, see Michael N. Schmitt, Computer Network Attack and the Use of Force in International Law: Thoughts on a Normative Framework, 37 COLUM. J. TRANSNAT’L. L. 885, 916 (1999) (arguing that “the nature of the act’s reasonably foreseeable consequences would be assessed to determine whether they resemble those of armed coercion”).\n⁴⁴ However, it is certainly true that “it is very difficult from a practical standpoint to predict whether a cyber attack will lead to kinetic harm or not.” See Stephen Petkis, Rethinking Proportionality in the Cyber Context, 47 GEO. J. INT’L L. 1431, 1449 (2016).\n⁴⁵ This example is explored in the Tallinn Manual, supra note 27, at 57.\n⁴⁶ Tallinn Manual, supra note 27, at 54 (Rule 13: “A state that is the target of a cyber operation that rises to the level of an armed attack may exercise its inherent right of self-defense. Whether a cyber operation constitutes an armed attack depends on its scale and effects.”).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press international legal doctrine on self-defense, though how imminence should be understood for a cyber-attack is more difficult than its kinetic analog. For example, an imminent military attack might be manifested in the form of air, sea, and land forces moving into position to launch a strike or invasion. The public nature of these deployments ensures that the imminent requirement can be transparently evaluated by the court of world opinion. But a cyber-attack that is brewing would not be manifested in the same public manner, because the preparatory works would most likely be private, secret, or unknown.⁴⁷ The physical damage could be caused by a physical attack or by a cyber-attack, but the resulting damage must be physical in nature.⁴⁸ The experts concluded that “it is not the nature (injurious or destructive) of the consequences that matters, but rather the extent of the ensuing effects.”⁴⁹ However, it should be noted that a minority of scholars working on the Tallinn Manual concluded that a cyber-attack that destroys “data,” even if it fails to destroy the computer system that houses the data, might in some circumstances constitute an armed attack.⁵⁰ A cyber-attack that disrupts the stock exchange and causes financial damage would not produce the requisite physical damage to be considered an armed attack, though there is disagreement on this question, with a minority of scholars suggesting that the negative consequences flowing from such an attack might meet the requirements for an armed attack.⁵¹ Presumably, those scholars who view the “catastrophic effects” of a cyber-attack against a stock market as enough to qualify as an armed attack might also be ⁴⁷ However, some scholars have disputed that cyber-attacks can never be identified when they are still in the imminence window. See Ryan J. Hayward, *Evaluating the “Imminence” of A Cyber Attack for Purposes of Anticipatory Self-Defense*, 117 COLUM. L. REV. 399, 419 (2017) (concluding that “there is ample evidence to believe that investments over the past several years have dramatically improved the United States’ monitoring abilities in this arena”). The Tallinn Manual argues that the right to self-defense in response to an offensive cyber armed attack is limited by two temporal limitations. First, the original cyber-attack must have occurred or must be imminent. Second, the defensive response must be immediately necessary to counter the threat. See Tallinn Manual, *supra* note 27, at 64–5. This second immediacy requirement is especially important in cases of anticipatory self-defense.\n⁴⁸ See Herbert S. Lin, *Offensive Cyber Operations and the Use of Force*, 4 J. NAT’L SECURITY L. &amp; POL’Y 63, 73 (2010) (suggesting that “effects rather than the modality of an action are the appropriate starting point for understanding how jus ad bellum and the U.N. Charter apply to offensive cyber operations” and concluding that “[e]ffects-based analysis suggests that the ambiguities are fewest when cyber attacks cause physical damage to property and loss of life in ways that are comparable to kinetic attacks and traditional war, because traditional LOAC provides various relevant precedents and analogies”).\n⁴⁹ Tallinn Manual, *supra* note 27, at 56. For example, Lubell argues that it is “at least arguable that computer data is closer to what the drafters wanted to include as objects than to the notion of what they wanted to exclude as aim or purpose.” See Noam Lubell, *Lawful Targets in Cyber Operations: Does the Principle of Distinction Apply?*, 89 INT’L L. STUD. 252, 268 (2013). Lubell points out that data is, in some circumstances, more precious than physical objects; buildings can be rebuilt, but data that is not backed up (or if the backup tapes are destroyed as well) is gone forever.\n⁵⁰ See Lubell, *supra* note 49, at 267 (concluding that “[t]he problem that arises, which is relatively unique to cyber operations, is whether data can be considered an object. While there is no definitive answer to this question, the currently prevailing view among LOAC experts appears to hold that in most cases data, for the purposes of LOAC targeting, should not be considered an object.”).\n⁵¹ Tallinn Manual, *supra* note 27, at 56.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press willing to view similarly a cyber-attack against election infrastructure or some other form of election cyber-interference.⁵² However, this conclusion would appear to stretch the concept of “armed attack” well beyond its original meaning, at least when judged against its functional role in the overall ecosystem of *jus ad bellum*.⁵³ So far our discussion has focused on the requirements for triggering a military response under article 51 after a state suffers a cyber-attack. However, different rules would apply for a right of cyber-defense in response to a first cyber-attack. If both a first cyber-attack and a defensive cyber-response fall below the threshold for armed attacks, then two nations could engage in a tit-for-tat response of increasingly serious cyber-attacks, and none of it will be regulated by either *jus ad bellum* or *jus in bello*.⁵⁴ The absence of physical destruction of persons or things will remove the cyber-engagement from the legal regulation of warfare, potentially emboldening states to engage in a wide range of cyber-activities.⁵⁵ The question in today’s world is whether states would prefer to continue these cyber-attacks without legal regulation or whether a system of reciprocal constraints on cyber-attacks below the military threshold would be a good idea.⁵⁶ Although ⁵² It should also be noted that the downstream “effects” of a cyber-attack could take weeks or months to be fully manifested – a factor which makes the law of war much more difficult to apply to cyber-attacks, rather than conventional military attacks where the effects are more readily ascertainable in the hours and days after the attack. See Stephen Petkis, *Rethinking Proportionality in the Cyber Context*, 47 GEO. J. INT’L L. 1431, 1448 (2016) (concluding that “the principal problem with an ‘effects test’ in the cyber context is that the nature and gravity of a cyber attack can be incredibly difficult to ascertain at the time the attack occurs. Unlike kinetic action, the true ‘effect’ of a cyber intrusion may not be known until weeks, months, or years after it is first discovered”).\n⁵³ See, e.g., Michael Gervais, *Cyber Attacks and the Laws of War*, 30 BERKELEY J. INT’L L. 525, 536 (2012) (concluding that “in light of the ‘object and purpose’ of the Charter, ‘force’ should be read more narrowly. The express aim of the United Nations is to maintain international peace and security, as well as ‘to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war’. That suggests the notion of force in 1945 was limited to the military instrument.”). Gervais goes on to correctly note that “treating all forms of cyber attack as a use of force would require an implausibly broad reading of Article 2(4) that includes non-physical damage.” *Id.* at 537. But see Schmitt, *supra* note 43, at 919 (asking whether there should be a presumption that computer attacks fall in the use of force box and suggesting that “the security framework of the Charter would be best effected by application of an inclusivity presumption”).\n⁵⁴ See Priyanka R.

INT’L L.J. 381, 392–93 (2015) (musing that “an alternative solution to better encapsulate non-physical cyber effects, rather than expanding ill-fitted traditional concepts, would be for the international community to create a new threshold for actions that do not meet the traditional use of force threshold but nonetheless constitute a ‘breach of the peace’ under Article 39 of the U.N. Charter”).\n⁵⁵ See, e.g., Matthew C. Waxman, *Cyber-Attacks and the Use of Force: Back to the Future of Article 2(4)*, 36 YALE J. INT’L L. 421, 434 (2011) (noting that “in addition to the more traditional military defense and deterrence strategies just described, the U.S. government may also be considering legal interpretations flexible enough to permit its own offensive cyber-operations below a certain threshold or against inchoate hostile cyber-activities”).\n⁵⁶ Cyber-attacks that fall below the armed attack threshold would still be subject to international legal regulation, just not under the law of war. See Daniel J. Ryan et al., *International Cyberlaw: A Normative Approach*, 42 GEO. J. INT’L L. 1161, 1181 (2011) (“The term ‘information operations’ may https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press there have been extensive calls for more regulation, perhaps even a new treaty, to govern cyber-space, the lack of serious development of explicit rules suggests that most states are interested in keeping the law open in order to preserve their flexibility going forward. Indeed, states often refuse to even acknowledge publicly when they have perpetrated or been victimized by a cyber-attack – a reticence that hampers the development of legal norms in this area.\n## D. Application of Jus in Bello Principles to Cyber-Attacks Principles of *jus in bello* apply to cyber-attacks as long as the cyber-attack either triggers an armed conflict or is launched during an armed conflict.^[57]^ Outside the context of an armed conflict, a cyber-attack would be constrained by principles of international human rights law, and general constraints embodied in public international law (including the concept of proportionality), but the more specific rules of *jus in bello* would not apply. But in the context of an armed conflict, there are at least three *jus in bello* rules that are of prime importance to consider: the principle of distinction, the prohibition on excessive collateral damage, and the combatant's privilege.^[58]^ Each will now be considered.\nThe principle of distinction requires attacking forces to limit their attacks to military objectives. A cyber-attack that takes place during an armed conflict would be subject to the same limitations.^[59]^ So, for example, a state launching a cyber-attack would be prohibited from using a cyber-weapon to disable a purely civilian system, such as a school computer system, an electrical power grid providing electricity to a civilian neighborhood, or a computer system associated with a medical-care facility. This prohibition applies not just to attacks against civilian personnel, but also to attacks against civilian installations and civilian infrastructure. This rule would explicitly permit cyber-attacks against military targets, such as a computer system for any military base, missile system, air-defense system, or even an infrastructure system that provides resources exclusively to a military system. So, for example, it would be consistent with the laws of war to use a cyber-attack to disable an oil refinery that provides oil exclusively to a nation's military, with the goal of denying tanks, Humvees, and other military vehicles the fuel that they need to operate.\n^[57]^ See, e.g., Gary D. Solis, *Cyber Warfare*, 219 MIL. L. REV. 1, 2 (2014) (noting that “[w]hether a 500-pound bomb or a computer is used to effect death and destruction, a weapon is a weapon”).\n^[58]^ Strangely, Gary Brown argues that *jus in bello*\"has little of interest to say specifically about cyber warfare\"and\"the places where actual cyber activities and the LOAC intersect are few and, in the scheme of things, not especially relevant.\"Gary D. Brown, *International Law Applies to Cyber Warfare! Now What?*, 46 SW. L. REV. 355, 356 (2017).\n^[59]^ For a discussion of this issue, see Lubell, *supra* note 49, at 252.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press Of course, a civilian target may be destroyed as collateral damage, provided that the collateral damage is not excessive or disproportionate to the military advantage gained by destroying the military target. In the context of a cyber-attack, it might be permissible to destroy a civilian computer system if it is a collateral consequence of destroying a military computer system, which might be the case if the two computer systems are linked together. However, if the destruction of the civilian computer system is disproportionate relative to the military advantage conferred by destroying the military computer system, the collateral damage would be disallowed by *jus in bello*.⁶⁰ There is some uncertainty about how to apply the concept of collateral damage to cyber-attacks. Some scholars have argued that the rule against disproportionate collateral damage should apply even when the damage to the civilian system is limited to loss of *functionality* to a computer system that provides service to the civilian population, even if the computer system is not physically destroyed.⁶¹ The general law-of-war impulse to insulate civilians from the burdens of war applies just as much in cyber-space as it does on the kinetic battlefield.\nThe much more difficult application of this rule involves dual-infrastructure targets. Many infrastructure targets, such as power plants, oil refineries, water treatment plants and mining facilities, provide general resources for both civilian and military uses.⁶² International lawyers have been perplexed by these targets for many years, and the NATO bombing of Serbia in 1999 threw into sharp relief the legal uncertainty over their status. For example, NATO forces attacked bridges that were used by both civilian and military vehicles, and also attacked TV stations that were owned by the government and used to broadcast nationalist propaganda. Although controversial, the prevailing consensus is that dual-use infrastructure targets need to be considered as both civilian and military at the same time and evaluated on that basis. Consequently, while it might be legitimate to destroy the military-side of a dual-use infrastructure target, the destruction of the civilian part (or the civilian percentage) is only justified if it is not excessive or disproportionate to the military advantage gained by destroying the military part. So, for example, the bridge ⁶⁰ For a discussion of the proportionality analysis related to a cyber-attack, see Jeremy Richmond, *Evolving Battlefields: Does Stuxnet Demonstrate A Need for Modifications to the Law of Armed Conflict?*, 35 FORDHAM INT’L L.J. 842, 891 (2012) (concluding that the Stuxnet cyber-attack against Iran was proportionate because “[g]iven the minimal amount of collateral damage caused by Stuxnet, Stuxnet’s commanders were almost certainly reasonable in their calculations”).\n⁶¹ See, e.g., Eric Talbot Jensen, *Cyber Attacks: Proportionality and Precautions in Attack*, 89 INT’L L. STUD. 198, 206 (2013) (noting that “some have taken the view that damage also encompasses serious interruptions in functionality, such as would require replacing parts or reloading software systems. For example, in the kinetic analogy used above where a cyber attack shut down a communication port but left the rest of the computer unaffected, the computer would still turn on but its actual functionality might be seriously affected. If functionality is considered when determining damage, the kinetic analogy would be of limited value.”).\n⁶² See Captain Christopher M. Kovach, *Beyond Skynet: Reconciling Increased Autonomy in Computer-Based Weapons Systems with the Laws of War*, 71 A.F. L. REV. 231, 250 (2014) (noting that “the proliferation of dual-use facilities and systems complicates the ability of cyberweapons to limit their effects solely to lawful targets”).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press can be destroyed if the civilian harm is not disproportionate to the advantage conferred by denying the military use of the bridge. For a cyber-attack, this means that a computer system could be destroyed even if it has some civilian use, but only if that civilian use is not disproportionate to the military advantage. A cyber-attack against a general power grid that supplies power to both the civilian population and the military would be lawful or unlawful depending on the exact proportion of the two uses and the relative harm it would impose on the civilian population weighed against the military value of denying power to the military.⁶³ The same would hold true for a cyber-attack against an oil refinery.\nThe combatant’s privilege provides immunity to military personnel who fight during an armed conflict: as long as their acts comply with the laws of war, the soldiers cannot be prosecuted by a foreign adversary in a domestic court. The privilege applies to members of armed forces and members of a militia who wear uniforms or a fixed emblem, carry arms openly, have a responsible command structure, and comply with the laws and customs of warfare. In the kinetic context, it is clear what this means. Soldiers should wear uniforms, carry their rifles openly, and comply with the laws of war. Members of the CIA or other civilian agencies who are deployed covertly, without the state acknowledging their link to the forces, are not entitled to the combatant’s privilege and could be prosecuted by the enemy upon capture. For a cyber-warrior working for the U.S. government, it is unclear how these requirements should translate.⁶⁴ In theory, the cyber-warrior should be wearing a uniform or fixed emblem, although there is little transparency gain from a hacker’s wearing a uniform as compared to the transparency gain from an infantry soldier wearing a uniform. The problem of remoteness is not unique to cyber-warriors, since missile operators or airmen might never be seen by the enemy either and the general assumption is that these service personnel should wear identifying emblems.\nWhat does it mean for a cyber-warrior to “carry arms openly”? This is genuinely unclear and it is doubtful that there is a nonquestion-begging answer to this question. Military cyber-operations are often unacknowledged in the sense that the U.S. government will not acknowledge its role in an offensive cyber-attack, nor does it release much information about defensive cyber-activities either. To comply with the requirements of carrying arms openly and wearing a fixed emblem, should ⁶³ See Duncan B. Hollis, *Why States Need an International Law for Information Operations*, 11 LEWIS &amp; CLARK L.

ELECTION INTERFERENCE AND THE LAW OF WAR\nBased on the preceding analysis, it is clear that while election interference is certainly destructive, it is not destructive in the way contemplated by the law of war.⁶⁵ Consequently, politicians who refer to election interference as an “act of war” almost surely have the legal analysis wrong. Future National Security Advisor John Bolton referred to Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election as an act of war, a “casus belli” that Washington would not and should not accept, and argued that negotiating with Russia was dangerous.⁶⁶ Despite their disagreements over how to approach Russia (and their disagreements about Russian election interference), Trump would later appoint Bolton as National Security Advisor. Similarly, Sen. Richard Blumenthal stated: “This was an act of war, in my view.” Blumenthal continued: “I’ve said it in various hearings before this indictment. Interestingly enough the indictment refers to information warfare, that’s the term the Russians use.”⁶⁷ Nikki Haley, at the time US Ambassador to the United Nations, stated that “[w]hen a country can come and interfere in another country’s elections, that is warfare,” and she also described election interference as Russia’s “weapon” of choice in its conflict with the United States.⁶⁸ Former Vice President and Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney used similar language.⁶⁹ Many pundits and political observers referred to election interference as an act of war:\nCall it a different kind of war – asymmetric warfare, or whatever. But it is war. Whatever role Trump played in the attack, whatever he knew or didn’t know about\n⁶⁵ As noted above, if a cyber-attack produces physical destruction, it would be regulated by the laws of war. See Thomas C. Wingfield, International Law and Information Operations, in Franklin D. Kramer, Stuart H. Starr, and Larry K. Wentz (eds.), CYBERPOWER AND NATIONAL SECURITY (Potomac Books, 2009) 538 (noting that “[i]t should be immaterial whether a refinery was destroyed by a 2,000-pound bomb or by a line of malicious code in its pressure regulation subroutine; what did matter was the size of the hole left in the ground after the attack”).\n⁶⁶ John Bolton, Vladimir Putin Looked Trump in the Eye and Lied to Him; We Negotiate With Russia at Our Peril, THE TELEGRAPH (July 10, 2017).\n⁶⁷ Nicholas Rondinone, Blumenthal: Russian Interference is “Act of War,” HARTFORD COURANT (Feb. 24, 2018). Blumenthal also said that: “There was clearly indisputably Russian interference in our last election, an attack on our democracy. Some would regard it, and I believe as well, an act of war.” CNN, Interview with Senator, 2017 WLNR 26117365.\n⁶⁸ See, e.g., Associated Press, Trump UN Envoy: Russia’s Election Interference is “Warfare,” Associated Press (Oct. 19, 2017).\n⁶⁹ See Morgan Chalfant, Cheney: Russian Election Interference Could be “Act of War,” THE HILL (Mar. 27, 2017).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nit previously, Russia took a hostile strike against this country. And it is, so far, winning.⁷⁰ Or consider the statement from one Democratic lawmaker who said that he had “no doubt” that Russian interference constituted an act of war.⁷¹ Even John McCain referred to it as an act of war.⁷² Other politicians referred to the Russian interference as “hybrid warfare” – a category that evokes armed conflict but at least in some usages would be defined as falling below the level of armed conflict. For example, Secretary of Defense Ash Carter said that Russia interfered in “our democratic processes” with hybrid warfare, that is “interference in the internal affairs of nations, short of war.”⁷³ Most scholars who have considered the issue have correctly analyzed that Russian interference falls outside the scope of armed conflict, though each has struggled to articulate a convincing framing device. For example, Herb Lin has stated that: IW/IO is a hostile non-kinetic activity, or at least an activity that is conducted between two parties whose interests are not well-aligned. At the same time, IW/IO is not warfare in the Clausewitzian sense (nor in any sense presently recognized under the laws of war or armed conflict); it is better characterized as hostile or adversarial psychological manipulation. IW/IO has connotations of soft power (more properly, a mix of soft power and sharp power): propaganda, persuasion, culture, social forces, confusion, deception.⁷⁴ Others have similarly concluded that the interference fell below the threshold of armed conflict.⁷⁵ Understood in this way, interference is extremely disruptive but not a subject for *jus in bello* regulation.⁷⁶ Outsiders (non-lawyers) often assume that the law of war is designed to regulate every infringement of a state’s territorial or political integrity. But that is certainly not the case. The law of war is designed to regulate the use of force and the conduct of ⁷⁰ Michelangelo Signorile, *Russia Committed An Act Of War And Trump Won’t Talk About It*, HUFFINGTON POST (July 16, 2018).\n⁷¹ *Dem Calls Russia Meddling “Act of War,” Urges Cyber Attack on Moscow Banks*, THE HILL (July 17, 2018) (quoting Rep. Steve Cohen as saying “No question about it” when asked if Russian interference in the election constituted an act of war). Cohen also stated: “It was a foreign interference with our basic Democratic values. The underpinnings of Democratic society is elections, and free elections, and they invaded our country.” *Id.* ⁷² See Jesse Hyde, *The Last Statesman: Inside the Diplomatic World of Jon Huntsman*, DESERET NEWS (Nov. 1, 2018) (noting that Sen.

INT’L &amp; COMP. L.J. 17, 21–2 (2018) (“Yet perhaps equally important are legal discussions about cyber actions that fall below that threshold. Those actions can be tremendously disruptive, as we have seen in examples as wide-ranging as the Sony hack and the reported interference of Russia in U.S. elections.”).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press The most salient examples of election interference involve either the theft and public release of private information or the posting of political views on social media platforms, often with the goal of disguising the true identity, and national origin, of the account holder. In the case of theft-and-release, a state might steal private information about a candidate – such as emails, text messages, private medical information, or confidential employment records from a human resources department – and release the damaging information to the public in order to favor a rival candidate.77 Some of the information might be real and some of the information might be doctored or otherwise misleading. In the case of the second example of election interference, the foreign state might create fake Facebook groups focusing on a particular issue or candidate, in order to drum up excitement for or against a particular candidate, or fake Twitter or Instagram accounts with the same goal in mind. Each of these activities involves foreign interference that arguably interferes with the political process and the political integrity of the target state, but neither involves the kind of physical destruction or territorial infringement that is the sine qua non of armed conflict.\nThere is a strong temptation to reduce all important issues of international law to questions of warfare. Armed conflict is a distinctive moment for international lawyers, full of peril, and the concept of warfare captures the imagination of nonlawyers. Often the critical question (does this conduct violate international law?) gets displaced by the simpler question (is the conduct a war crime?), without first considering whether war is the relevant paradigm or not. But international law is not reducible to the law of war. Public international law is so much richer than just rules regulating the use of force and the conduct of hostilities. We need to resist the temptation to put everything into a war framework. The distinct harm of election interference speaks to broader and more complex questions of political integrity that go well beyond the concept of armed conflict.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press That being said, it is important to recognize the impulse to analyze election interference through the war paradigm. The regulation of warfare is one of the great success stories of international law, because the discourse on warfare, both *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello*, has been wholeheartedly legalized. International lawyers discuss the rules of warfare with a precision that is almost scientific in nature. For a public grasping for certainty and legality, the law of war is an attractive horizon to steer towards. So, it is no wonder that people gravitate to the war paradigm given how successful international lawyers have been in occupying the field. But the war discussion crowds out alternative legal frameworks for understanding election interference, frameworks that focus on the political significance of elections and the way that foreign interference undermines the political integrity of the state.\nThe concept of “sovereignty” is one alternative framework.78 Clearly, a state’s violating the sovereignty of another state is illegal under some circumstances. So, it is intuitively plausible to suggest that election interference violates the sovereignty of the target state whose election is disputed, compromised, or influenced by the outside actor. The next chapter will explore “sovereignty” as a more salient legal category than armed conflict and examine both the benefits and the drawbacks of describing election interference in those terms. One noteworthy complication is the fact that the technical and doctrinal requirements for a legal infringement of sovereignty do not line up with common-sense intuitions about what counts as a violation of sovereignty. Consequently, many behaviors that sound as if they should count as sovereignty violations turn out to be perfectly legal – or at the very least contested – according to established doctrines of public international law. It also does not help that the concept of sovereignty is a cluster concept, housing diverse notions such as physical control over territory, control over a population, and expressions of a polity’s popular will. This produces a lot of cross-talking since not everyone means the same thing when they utter the word “sovereignty.”\nOne argument for focusing on sovereignty is that international law is much broader than the regulation of war. Just because election interference fails to qualify as an armed attack does not mean that the interference is lawful under international law. Similarly, even though election interference does not trigger a right of self-defense, international law might allow other responses to the interference. Under international law, a state is not required to simply suffer violations falling short of an armed attack. Victim states are entitled to use retorsions and countermeasures in an attempt to get the offending state to back off and cease the illegal behavior.\nCountermeasures and retorsions are united by the state’s intention behind their use, which is to induce the law-breaking state into compliance in the future. Countermeasures and retorsions differ in the legal status of the action used to induce https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press Of the two, countermeasures are the more controversial because they involve conduct that would otherwise be illegal. However, it should be noted that countermeasures should not include the use of military force, which are governed by the principles of self-defense. Although the issue is somewhat contested, the majority (and better) view is that the doctrine of countermeasures cannot be used as an exception to the requirements of *jus ad bellum*. If a state wishes to use military force, it needs either Security Council authorization or a defensive claim under article 51 of the UN Charter.\nAfter the Russian interference in the 2016 election, President Obama announced sanctions designed to punish the Russian government for election interference and related behavior, including Russian interference in Ukraine.80 For example, on April 1, 2015, President Obama issued an executive order declaring that “the increasing prevalence and severity of malicious cyber-enabled activities originating from, or directed by persons located, in whole or in substantial part, outside the United States constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.”81 On December 28, 2016, Obama amended the earlier executive order and ordered the Treasury Department to freeze the assets of individuals involved in Russian cyber-interference.82 https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press In December 2016, the Obama administration also expelled thirty-five Russian diplomats who were described as members of Russian intelligence. In a related move, the Obama administration shut down two Russian diplomatic\"compounds\"that the administration claimed were being used for intelligence collection. Though these compounds were probably connected with domestic intelligence gathering rather than troll farm activity launched from St. Petersburg, the move to shut down the compounds was part of a general package of punitive actions against Moscow. In making this move, Obama stated: These actions are not the sum total of our response to Russia's aggressive activities. We will continue to take a variety of actions at a time and place of our choosing, some of which will not be publicized. In addition to holding Russia accountable for what it has done, the United States and friends and allies around the world must work together to oppose Russia's efforts to undermine established international norms of behavior, and interfere with democratic governance. To that end, my Administration will be providing a report to Congress in the coming days about Russia's efforts to interfere in our election, as well as malicious cyber activity related to our election cycle in previous elections.[83] In addition to these punitive actions, it is possible that the United States also engaged in classified or covert actions that were not publicly disclosed.[84] In particular, the United States reportedly launched a cyber-attack against the Russian government as a proportional countermeasure to the election interference.[85] But the United States was careful not to describe any of its responses as either countermeasures or retorsions. Although this refusal is somewhat perplexing, it may have been connected with Obama's general reluctance to declare Russian interference as\"illegal\"under international law.[86] Describing a punitive action as a countermeasure implies a conclusion both about the illegality of the offending conduct and also the illegality of the punitive measure under nonpunitive circumstances. The United States may have preferred to preserve maximum flexibility regarding its legal position on cyber-attacks.

But this is not to diminish its significance, or even to diminish its illegality under both U.S. and international law. It may still be illegal, and the sooner that the public recognizes that it does not trigger a right of kinetic response under article 51 of the UN Charter, the sooner a more nuanced discussion can open up about the range of permissible responses under international law, such as retorsions and countermeasures outside the context of the use of force.⁸⁸ Political leaders have a range of options at their disposal but selecting among them requires consideration of the vast tools for enforcing international law beyond the use of force.\nTo recap the argument presented in this chapter: The principles governing *jus in bello* and *jus ad bellum* apply with equal force in the realm of cyber-attacks. A cyberattack that causes physical destruction may qualify as an armed attack triggering a right of self-defense under article 51 of the UN Charter, and a cyber-attack that causes physical destruction may constitute a resort to force that triggers the existence of an armed conflict and the application of IHL. But in the absence of physical destruction, cyber-attacks probably fall outside the scope of the laws of war.⁸⁹ Cyberwar is a real phenomenon, but in many cases, the\"war\"suffix is, legally speaking, a metaphor. In technical discussions, the term\"war\"is meant to convey the notion of an armed conflict pursued through sustained military engagements. In contrast, most cyber-attacks have more in common with the tools of statecraft than the tools of military science. Election interference falls in the category of statecraft, though it is important to remember that even statecraft is regulated by public international law.\n⁸⁷ See, e.g., Jack Crowe, *Rosenstein Calls Out Obama Admin For Failing to\"Publicize\"Russian Election Interference*, NATIONAL REVIEW (April 26, 2019).\n⁸⁸ In this sense, Brown is absolutely right when he concludes that\"[l]aw is a critical aspect of discussions about the cyber aspects of privacy rights, espionage, sovereignty, international norms of behavior, and more – but none of these things is within the realm of LOAC.\"Gary D. Brown, *International Law Applies to Cyber Warfare! Now What?*, 46 SW. L. REV. 355, 356 (2017).\n⁸⁹ See Prescott, *supra* note 1, at 48 (asserting that\"[b]elow the level of this use of force, cyber operations that result only in direct effects within cyberspace itself would not be considered uses of force regulated by LOAC, even though their indirect effects might have far-reaching and negative impacts upon the nation targeted.\"); Lubell, *supra* note 49, at 259 (concluding that\"[t]here can be plenty of cyber operations that occur outside the context of an armed conflict, such as certain types of cyber espionage between supposedly friendly countries to which the law of armed conflict would not apply\"). Lubell also argues that psychological operations (such as operations that have the goal of disseminating propaganda)\"are not considered to be ones that cause direct harm to the civilian population and, as such, can be excluded from certain restrictions placed on attacks.\"*Id.* at 263.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press Just because a tool of statecraft falls below the legal threshold for armed conflict does not necessarily mean that the tool is part of a state's exclusive discretion, or what international lawyers sometimes call its domaine réservé.\nThe next two chapters focus on two competing frameworks for regulating cyber-election interference. Chapter 3 analyzes whether\"sovereignty\"is the correct concept, such that cyber interference might be viewed as an illegal infringement of a state's sovereignty. Among international lawyers, this is the\"preferred\"framework or the\"majority\"approach, though there are significant drawbacks to the approach, and I count myself as a dissenting voice. Then, Chapter 4 analyzes whether\"self-determination\"is a more promising framework, so that cyber interference might be viewed as a violation of a people's collective right of self-determination. This is an uncommon approach not yet adopted by public international lawyers, though they should give this approach a second look. In addition to being doctrinally salient, the concept of self-determination dovetails with our commonsense intuition that election interference is harmful because of its corrosive effect on the machinery of core democratic institutions.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108859561.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press"
