It builds on a number of questionable assumptions about the international history and perception of cyber conflict, the role and strategic direction of information warfare, and the general dynamics of deterrence. Ultimately, it justifies a much more aggressive CYBERCOM mission that ignores the potential for unwanted effects that could prove to be highly destabilising in an already volatile international security environment. Overall, persistent engagement is a very high-risk approach to developing cyber deterrence that is likely to not only trigger new forms of retaliation but also accelerate the already rapid international proliferation of offensive cyber capabilities. In the worst-case scenario, it may even pose a risk to the internet as we know it. Some of the risks associated with the concept could, however, be partially alleviated by reducing its reliance on mixed signals and an excess of public communication.\n# Persistent engagement: theory and criticism\nThe promotion of CYBERCOM to a fully independent combat command in 2018 marked the emancipation of US military cyber capabilities from the intelligence world. While some observers, including the present author, thought that this development might help foster much-needed transparency on cyber capabilities, recent developments have taken a darker turn. Footnote  $^{1}$  Building on an already controversial doctrine of 'active defense in cyberspace', the US Department of Defense (DoD) put forward a new public cyber strategy in 2018 that emphasised the concept of 'defend forward'. Footnote  $^{2}$  According to Jeff Kosseff of the United States Naval Academy, defending forward has three basic components: positioning, warning and influencing. Footnote  $^{3}$  CYBERCOM's vision of persistent engagement, which represents the implementation of the DoD strategy, encompasses all three activities, and while each can be criticised as potentially destabilising to international security, the operation-alisation of the 'influencing' component may be particularly so.\nCYBERCOM's General Paul Nakasone gave an indication of what was to come when, in his Senate confirmation hearings in March 2018, he was asked about deterring Russian and Chinese cyber attacks. 'They do not think that much will happen to them', he responded. 'They do not\nfear us.' He went on to say that, 'As cyberspace develops, the longer that we have inactivity, the longer our adversaries are able to establish their own norms – and I think that is very, very important that we realize that.' Footnote 4 This view was reflected in the DoD cyber strategy of defend forward, leveraging the already well-established 'persistent presence' of CYBERCOM in adversaries' networks into an actual operational mandate to disrupt any emerging attacks and thus to 'persistently engage'. Footnote 5 To accomplish this, Nakasone has indicated that CYBERCOM will not be a 'response force' anymore, but rather a force that engages in operations 'below the level of armed attack' on a running basis. Footnote 6\nOverall, CYBERCOM is being positioned less as a strategic-weapons carrier and a key element of an overall strategic-deterrence capability, and more as a special-operations command. The risk of getting these roles entangled is evident with the reversal of traditional signalling practices, with more talk about usually non-public, covert-action-type roles, and less about potential strategic (that is, 'above the threshold of armed attack') capabilities to be used in wartime. The evolving vision of persistent engagement has largely been communicated through a series of articles and press releases, rather than through official publications and doctrines. Footnote 7 This is in keeping with the strategy's dependence on public signals to communicate intent to adversaries. While a discussion of strategic-warfare capabilities would increase transparency and probably increase stability, the sudden emphasis on public discussion of low-level, peacetime cyber attacks is doing the opposite. As decades of experience with arms control have shown, transparency on strategic weapons helps reduce the scope for misunderstandings, provides for clarity of intent, and helps establish norms of restraint and communication. But public communication of offensive covert action – revealing to the public details of secret attacks conducted against an adversary – generally does the reverse, both fostering norms of aggression and underlining the lack of communication. What is true of the conventional-arms world is doubly so in cyberspace, the eponymous information domain where kinetic cyber warfare (officially 'information operations') has an uneasy but undoubted symbiosis with its non-kinetic cousin, 'information warfare', with its emphasis on propaganda, disinformation and covert influencing. As Nakasone has said, in cyberspace the principle danger is the weaponisation of information. Footnote 8 Unfortunately, the signalling mandated by persistent engagement has extended to over-communication in public – itself an example of weaponised information that diminishes the benefits of the defend-forward strategy, lends legitimacy to information-warfare operations as a form of conflict and simultaneously encourages an already accelerating cyber arms race.\nThe empirical justification of CYBERCOM's new offensive vision has been shaky from the start. The academic underpinnings of persistent engagement were presented in a 2017 article by Richard Harknett and Michael Fischerkeller, which was released just as the former was concluding his stint as CYBERCOM's first resident scholar. Footnote 9 The very title of the article, 'Deterrence Is Not a Credible Strategy for Cyberspace', indicates that the authors thought\nit was possible (and desirable) to frame the strategy as one of ‘non-deterrence’. Their analysis rests on the belief that, as part of an ‘agreed competition’ concept, it would be possible to completely contain cyber conflict within its own domain. This would be non-escalatory due to the invisible hand of ‘tacit bargaining’, through which adversaries would feel out the borders of allowable conflict and come to a stable conflict scenario. According to this logic, not only is there less chance of inadvertent escalation over the threshold of armed conflict when engaging in the cyber domain, but this kind of engagement would also avoid retaliation in other domains, such as diplomacy and trade, or even in physical conflict zones, such as Syria and the Persian Gulf. The authors also seem to suggest that cyber could effectively function as a ‘pressure valve’ for international tensions, concentrating the inevitable tit for tat (the tacit bargaining) of international security to a more controllable and less dangerous environment. Footnote 10\nThe many suppositions of Harknett and Fischerkeller’s article have been roundly criticised. Footnote 11 Although the idea of agreed competition is presented as deriving from Herman Kahn’s idea of ‘agreed battle’, the article never answers the basic question of why an adversary would allow itself to be constrained in a way that clearly favours the United States. Cyber experts Brandon Valeriano and Benjamin Jensen have drawn on a comprehensive historical dataset of cyber operations to argue instead that such operations on their own seldom produce concessions. Normally, they need to be accompanied by other actions, such as diplomatic overtures, to work – an approach which the authors contend the US has employed to great effect in the past, despite Nakasone’s assessment that cyber deterrence has failed. Footnote 12 Overall, few observers would agree that outcomes in cyberspace are as easy to predict as advocates of persistent engagement seem to believe. On the contrary, the basic assumption of diplomacy over at least the last decade is that cyberspace is the domain most prone to misinterpretation and miscalculation. Footnote 13 Finally, there is no clear theory of victory in persistent engagement and no strategic endgame, only the purpose of creating operational advantages in cyberspace. There is no agreement as to what the basic strategic game is, or what constitutes its winning and losing factors.\nMore troublingly, persistent engagement does not articulate a sound reasoning as to why any escalation in cyberspace would produce good outcomes for the United States. Tom Bossert, US President Donald Trump’s first homeland security advisor, has explicitly questioned parts of the strategy. In a June 2018 Wired article, he is quoted as saying, ‘I want to make sure we don’t end up in an escalatory cyber exchange where we lose more than they do’, and as pointing out that ‘in many respects the US economy and infrastructure is far more reliant on digitization and automation than Russia’s, giving the Kremlin an inherent advantage in any future no-holdsbarred cyberwar. He paraphrases former US secretary of defense Ash Carter: “If you’re doused in gasoline, don’t start a match-throwing contest.”’ Footnote 14\nThe entire rationale for the strategy, as outlined by Nakasone himself, relies on a version of cyber history that not all observers will agree with. For instance, Nakasone has said that the US mostly faced an intelligence-gathering threat before 2013, which then escalated into denial-based attacks before moving towards destructive attacks (presumably including information-warfare attacks in 2016) and preparations for armed conflict. Footnote 15 Overlooked by this narrative is any consideration of how the adversary – or even many US friends and allies – would see the causality of these developments. In an alternative narrative, US dominance in persistent-presence espionage was publicly revealed through the intelligence disclosures of 2013, at the same time as the first real cyber weapon, Stuxnet, was attributed to the United States. Among allies in Europe, such as Germany, these revelations were often badly received, and the reaction among neutrals, such as Brazil, was even more negative. Not many European observers would agree with the assessment of persistent engagement's supporters that the US has been 'too passive' in cyberspace. In some cases, a different conclusion can be drawn: that cyber attacks have been responses to US activity. Nakasone has cited Iranian cyber aggression to justify persistent engagement, but Iranian activities can also be framed as responses to US cyber operations, such as Stuxnet and Flame. Footnote 16 The Shamoon malware that Iran used to target Saudi Arabia reused components of the US-attributed Flame malware – effectively directing a US cyber weapon back at one of its allies. Footnote 17 Seen from this perspective, at least some of the increase in cyber-related activity directed against the United States has been a direct result of public disclosures of the advanced state of US cyber capabilities and operations. Instead of producing a deterrent effect, these disclosures seem to have contributed to an increase in cyber tensions. This does not bode well for the principle of persistent engagement as currently expressed.\nBoth the academic theory and the policy statements surrounding persistent engagement have a strained relationship with the overall concept of deterrence, as well as with those of balance of power, proliferation and arms control. Before 2016, modern US deterrence followed a logic that is often expressed as a ladder, from entanglement, norms and resilience to punishment. Footnote 18 Purists may argue that only the last two – the ability to absorb an attack, and the ability to conduct an attack – represent classic deterrence. Footnote 19 Contending that the US strategy of 'denial' or 'resilience' has clearly failed in recent years, they have turned to an existing solution for the problem and radically reinterpreted it. In 2011, the nascent weakness in US cyber-deterrence policy – insofar as this had been formally expressed – had already been identified as a lack of 'credibility' or, in technical terms, a seeming inability to communicate the strength of US cyber capabilities in order to dissuade an adversary. It was the same conundrum made famous by Dr. Strangelove – how can one expect a deterrent effect if the very instrument of deterrence is a secret? In cyber terms, the effect was dubbed the 'Cartwright Conjecture' by Jason Healey after General James Cartwright, the former head of Strategic Command who, in 2011, was already complaining that 'we've got to talk about our offensive capabilities and train to them; to make\nthem credible ... You can't have something that's a secret be a deterrent. Because if you don't know it's there, it doesn't scare you.' Footnote 20 This was by no means an isolated message. Footnote 21 At that time, the strategic capability being communicated was one of overwhelming US intelligence-gathering capabilities.\nWithin the US government, intelligence-gathering capabilities have resolutely been portrayed as neutral, or even defensive, in nature. Yet many allies, as well as private-sector actors within the US itself, do not share this view. A number of foreign leaders – not only of neutral countries, but of friends and allies of the US – have concluded that the United States' ability to maintain a persistent presence on all kinds of networks is tantamount to being able to strike them at will. Never mind that it takes time to prepare complicated strikes across highly segmented networks, or that it can be difficult for CYBERCOM to get campaigns approved through the interagency process – these are problems only the attacker can see. From a defender's point of view, it can be very difficult to differentiate between advanced espionage attempts and imminent acts of war – including by the United States. When US dominance in persistent presence became publicly apparent after 2013, it was only natural that a number of nations – some of them US adversaries, but not all – feared that it would not be long before the US took the simple step from persistent presence to persistent engagement. Although major US initiatives such as the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (launched in 2009 with an estimated budget of $40 billion over five years) were cast as being 'defensive' in nature, the programmes could clearly serve as the foundation for offensive cyber activity: the same sensors and implants intended to provide warning of hostile cyber activity could easily be repurposed for offensive activity. This being the case, and given the historical record of presumed US cyber operations, Nakasone's claims in his 2017 Senate confirmation hearing that the United States has been a passive actor in cyberspace seems disingenuous, at best.\nThe significant increase in all forms of offensive cyber behaviour against the US after 2013 has been described as a deterrence failure. Yet advocates of persistent engagement have been unable to explain why deterrence failed, or to express whether the failure was complete or only partial. There is at least some evidence to suggest that the escalation was due to perceived US strength in cyber, not weakness. Following the work of Valeriano and Jensen, whose dataset indicates that responses to cyber attacks have historically been proportional and not intentionally escalatory, Footnote 22 this could imply that some of the increased activity publicly reported since 2013 may in fact have been responses by US adversaries – responses that have been recalibrated to take into account a much more dominant US position in cyberspace than these adversaries had been aware of.\nEither way, friendly and less friendly nations alike have rushed to compete in an escalating cyber arms race, one which the US may have played a decisive role in accelerating even before the publication of persistent engagement. Footnote 23 The very term 'cyber arms race', while not\nparticularly contentious in itself, is difficult to fully circumscribe. The phenomenon bears little resemblance to historic arms races and cannot be quantified by numbers of weapons systems, as was possible during the missile-gap race of the 1960s or the battleship/dreadnought race of the 1900s. Yet even though it is not even clear exactly what these offensive capabilities entail, there is little disagreement that a number of nations are increasingly seeking them, and that the overall level of destructive cyber attacks is rising. A 2016 study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) estimated that at least 30 nations were actively pursuing offensive cyber capabilities, a number that has likely continued to increase year on year as the number of cyber incidents continues to rise. Footnote 24\nMuch like the United States after 2013, many nations have seen a significant increase in malicious behaviour in cyberspace. The Council on Foreign Relations has reported that, with two notable dips in 2012 and 2016, cyber-espionage activity worldwide increased tenfold from 2009 to 2019. Footnote 25 Much of the damage caused by recent cyber incidents such as the WannaCry and NotPetya ransomware attacks, as well as routing and kinetic-equivalent attacks on media and industry, was concentrated outside of the United States. Paired with a significant increase in psychological, information-warfare activities, this has prompted many of the hardest-hit nations (including Australia, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, among others) to make significant adjustments to their cyber postures, in particular by building offensive capabilities. At the same time, anecdotal information suggests that not even these comparatively advanced nations have fully understood what these new cyber capabilities are actually intended to do – if they are intended to focus on ‘strategic strike’ (for instance against critical infrastructure), ‘battlefield cyber’ (acting as a sort of electronic warfare) or online covert action. Footnote 26 This relative confusion about mission parameters will only be accentuated by the new CYBERCOM vision.\nEarly US signalling in response to the Cartwright Conjecture may have intended to go beyond emphasising American strength in online covert action to illustrate the country's ability to conduct a 'global strike' of overwhelming force in wartime – in essence, framing cyber as a strategic capability, a kind of digital weapon of mass destruction. CYBERCOM's intent differs, however, from the low-level silent professionalism of those engaged in strategic deterrence or the targeted focus of tailored access operations in the intelligence world. The role model for persistent engagement is not strategic command or the intelligence community, but rather special-operations command, whose mission has been to counter the adversary all the time, everywhere.\nGeneral Nakasone has stated that, 'unlike the nuclear realm, where our strategic advantage or power comes from possessing a capability or weapons system, in cyberspace it's the use of cyber capabilities that is strategically consequential'. Footnote 27 Not only does this remark suggest that the United States must use offensive capabilities visibly, but it also implies that other nations have a clear interest in doing so as well. Yet encouraging a permissive norm that implicitly\nfavours cyber aggression as a tool of peacetime statecraft is likely only to expand the already murky grey area of modern conflict, and the difference between covert action and military activity. Footnote 28 A number of significant adverse effects can be expected among a range of countries – US allies and friends, neutrals and US adversaries alike – which are unlikely to be in the US interest.\nFirst-order effects: ‘out of band’ and ‘diagonal’ retaliation Jason Healey and Neil Jenkins have argued that the impact of the new persistent-engagement strategy could be assessed by looking at the number of cyber attacks against the US. A decline in attacks would indicate that the strategy was effective, while an increase would suggest it was ineffective or counterproductive. Footnote 29 This approach seems too simplistic for at least two reasons. Firstly, US adversaries may simply retaliate with non-cyber means, drawing on the example the US has already set. One of the most successful acts of US cyber deterrence was the use of Department of Justice indictments against specific foreign cyber actors. Following the indictment of five Chinese hackers associated with the People's Liberation Army in 2015, a landmark deal was reached between then-president Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping that resulted in a significant decline – by up to 90%, according to a report by the security company FireEye Footnote 30 – in Chinese-attributed intellectual-property theft. Other indictments against Russian and Iranian hackers have followed. US adversaries may seek to devise their own ‘out of band’ responses to US cyber activity, perhaps by drawing on the copious amount of leaked materials on offensive US cyber capabilities now in the public domain. Alternatively, they may respond with more ‘conventional’ means, for instance by increasing their support for the non-US side in adversarial situations such as trade conflicts, maritime disputes and weapons proliferation.\nUS adversaries might also respond ‘diagonally’ by responding with cyber-enabled means that defy the simple characterisation of ‘cyber attack’. The kind of social-media activity associated with Russia’s information-warfare campaign against the United States is but one example of this approach. Other cyber means could potentially be deployed in an even more covert manner, making attribution difficult even with the deployment of the United States’ full range of intelligence-collection measures.\nThe recent spate of cyber-crime attacks directed against state and local governments across the United States may be another example of a diagonal approach to cyber retaliation. From January to July 2019, more than 55 state and local governments in the US were hit by ransomware attacks. Footnote 31 Although there had been no public attribution of these activities to foreign actors by the time this article went to press, some of them used a stolen US cyber exploit, dubbed ‘EternalBlue’. This exploit had been posted for sale by a group calling itself ‘Shadow Brokers’, which some have speculated may be a front for Russian intelligence actors. Footnote 32 When cyber criminals did not immediately respond to the possibilities inherent in this new exploit, the WannaCry and NotPetya campaigns were launched, drawing attention not just to the possibilities\nof EternalBlue, but also to the efficacy of ransomware attacks themselves. Even if the current spate of cyber attacks against state and local governments in the US was not directed by a foreign adversary, it would be relatively easy for governments to encourage such activity in the future, thus inflicting real pain on targets and demonstrating the ability of national cyber defenders to respond to provocations.\nThe underlying enabling factor for this scenario is the poor state of basic national cyber security across the United States. A 2019 report by the US Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that of the 3,000 cybersecurity recommendations that have been made to federal agencies since 2010, more than 1,000 had yet to be implemented. Footnote  $^{33}$  These vulnerabilities also extend to the DoD's own basic war-fighting capabilities. According to a GAO report from 2018, 'almost all the weapons that the DOD tested between 2012 and 2017, including the F-35 jet and missile systems, have \"mission critical\" cyber vulnerabilities and can be \"easily hacked\" using \"relatively simple tools and techniques\". Footnote  $^{34}$  As poor as federal cyber-security efforts are, the situation at the state and local levels is significantly worse: a 2019 survey indicated that there remains a large difference between state and federal cyber-security capabilities. Footnote  $^{35}$  The state and local agencies polled said they had high confidence in their ability to 'prevent' a cyber attack in only  $19\\%$  of cases (compared to  $41\\%$  of federal agencies), and only  $28\\%$  of those canvassed said they would be able to 'recover' (versus  $55\\%$  of federal agencies). The nation's privately held critical infrastructure is more difficult to assess, but is largely considered to be more capable, and the United States' overall cyber-security stance tends to be ranked highly by more politically minded ratings – the International Telecommunications Union, for example, ranked the US overall at number two worldwide. Footnote  $^{36}$  More technical ratings, however, like that of the National Cyber Security Index, give the US a more middling assessment – placing it, for instance, in thirteenth place worldwide. Footnote  $^{37}$  The only good news, if it can be called that, to emerge from these findings is that the poor state of US national cyber security is mirrored by that of Russia and China.\n# Second-order effects: emerging cyber powers and their strategic dilemma\nA major reason for the vulnerable state of US cyber security has to do with scale – large nations have inherently more attack surface to cover, and the US easily has the greatest attack surface of them all. Footnote  $^{38}$  However, the opposite is therefore also true – smaller nations on balance have a much easier task in building national cyber security, and this has significant repercussions for how they play their own game of strategic deterrence. Yet the asymmetric strength of small players has been largely overlooked in most conventional analyses of cyber powers.\nSmaller nations often benefit from increased cooperation between the civilian and military, and state and non-state sectors, and generally face fewer challenges in coordinating emergency measures. Some even have the ability to disconnect from the global internet if necessary. Footnote 39 Smaller countries may also benefit from a more stringent legal and regulatory framework that requires a minimum level of cyber defence, not just from various levels of government but also from the private sector. For nations like, say, the Netherlands, the task of coordinating with 100–300 critical-infrastructure providers, and a comparable number of local and federal government networks, is a completely different task than dealing with many tens of thousands of civilian assets and non-military governmental networks, as in the United States. Footnote 40 A smaller attack surface means fewer critical-infrastructure providers that need to be communicated with, fewer government agency networks that need to be hardened and less scope for friction in a crisis. Essentially, this means that smaller advanced cyber nations have an inherent advantage in pursuing national cyber security compared with very large nations such as the United States, or indeed Russia and China. All things considered, a number of smaller nations might actually do quite well in a force-on-force conflict with a major cyber power. The ability of many smaller nations to potentially absorb cyber blows is no less significant in a wartime scenario than advantageous defensive geography would be in a ground operation. Yet the ‘high ground’ advantage of smaller states in presenting a smaller attack surface in the cyber domain may not have been adequately factored into analysts’ calculations, including those that informed the drafting of persistent engagement. As a corollary to this, smaller nations’ ability to conduct deterrence by punishment – a strategy that persistent engagement has heavily incentivised them to pursue – is not well understood.\nThe nature of the offensive cyber capabilities currently being developed by the ‘next 30’ nations examined in the 2016 CSIS study may not be clear, but there is no reason to believe that they relate only to cyber-crime-style scenarios, such as denial-of-service or even ransomware attacks. Instead, it should be assumed that these cyber powers can ‘turn the lights off’ – that is, launch a strategic strike on the critical infrastructure of an enemy. While it is much easier to temporarily shut down a nation’s infrastructure networks than to damage them beyond repair, ‘temporary’ disruptions can still impose catastrophic costs on a nation’s economy and limit its ability to maintain domestic order. The destructive potential of the next 30 may be orders of magnitude less than that of the United States or a near-peer cyber power, but some of these countries still possess a minimal deterrence capability that, much like the small nuclear arsenals of France, the UK and China, could inflict an unacceptable level of retaliatory punishment on a potential aggressor, no matter their overwhelming technical superiority. While detractors may say that mere cyber attacks should not be compared to the horror of a nuclear exchange, the effects of weeks-long black-outs, the destruction of financial information and the breakdown of most forms of communication should not be underestimated. The next-30 cyber nations may therefore possess something which was previously unavailable to them: not just a strategic-weapons capability – a\nvirtual strike force no less potent than a wing of bombers or ballistic missiles – but also a defensive advantage towards larger foes.\nThe sheer number of nations that may be able to reciprocally threaten a major power could be historically unprecedented. There was briefly a time, in the late 1950s, when it seemed possible that dozens of nations would eventually deploy nuclear weapons; even small countries like Switzerland deliberated the possibility of creating their own nuclear deterrent. Footnote 41 In the end, many of these opted to form alliances with existing nuclear powers instead. Today, persistent engagement may be changing the way such nations provide for their own security. Instead of depending on the protective umbrella of their friends, many now have their own budding deterrence-by-punishment capability in the cyber domain, in addition to having become better able to resist the effects of a strategic cyber strike against themselves. Some are also being incentivised by persistent engagement not only to develop offensive capabilities, but to use them as well. After all, persistent engagement postulates that cyber conflict is not only to be welcomed, but to be engaged in so as to be 'understood'. Any country not carrying out cyber attacks would, like those that did not test nuclear bombs, be excluded from the main table and left without a voice. This is seen as a perverse incentive by those who advocate for non-proliferation and argue that the increased distribution of destructive weapons increases the likelihood not only that one will be used, but that all will be used.\n# Third-order effects: weaponising information and changing the internet\nIn February 2019, it was reported that some unspecified action had been taken by CYBERCOM in November 2018 against the Internet Research Agency, a notorious social-media 'troll factory' headquartered in St Petersburg. The New York Times said that the organisation had been shut down 'for a number of days' as part of an effort to secure the US midterm elections. Footnote 42 Unlike many other parts of the Russian security apparatus, the Internet Research Agency does not seem to engage in 'hacking' – that is, it does not launch its own intrusions. Rather, it is widely accepted that the agency engages only in spreading disinformation, Footnote 43 something that may not even be illegal under international law. CYBERCOM's action against it may well have fallen beneath the 'use of force' or 'armed attack' threshold (a distinction not usually made in the United States anyway), but its public nature implies an acceptance of kinetic-effect cyber attacks – it sent the message that it is okay to hack what you consider 'fake news'.\nIf the targeting of actors that have only a propaganda function (rather than being directly responsible for cyber attacks) becomes normalised, then more conventional media organisations, as well as civil-society and non-governmental organisations, may become admissible targets. Russia might conclude, for example, that foreign support for domestic democracy activists falls\nunder the heading of ‘information and psychological actions aimed at undermining … the homeland’, to borrow language from the 2016 Russian Information Security Doctrine. Footnote 44 Likewise, Beijing might find Chinese-language translations of the New York Times provocative. Footnote 45 International disputes may emerge about ‘bad content’, such as propaganda, social-media campaigns and unkind opinion pieces. Footnote 46 In this way, persistent engagement might encourage the very risk that it was intended to alleviate: the weaponisation of information.\nIn June 2019, the New York Times reported that, at the same time the US was targeting the Information Research Agency, it was also deploying offensive cyber capabilities within the Russian power grid. Footnote 47 A similar intrusion of US power grids – using a malware package known as BlackEnergy – was noticed in 2011 and publicly reported on soon after. A version of BlackEnergy was also used in December 2015 to cause a large-scale blackout in western Ukraine. Footnote 48 These two intrusions, both of them attributed to Russia, ultimately drew attention to themselves, even though there was a blackout only in the 2015 action. In June 2019, however, the United States raised the ante. Rather than ‘allowing’ their own pre-deployment operation to be discovered and reported on by Russian actors, the Americans reported it themselves, stating that since 2018 US malware had been present in the Russian power grid in order to effect a kinetic-equivalent strike if necessary. The intent of this disclosure was likely to make it clear to the Russians that, if necessary, the US was ready to accept a level of ‘mutually assured disruption’. At least as important was the message that CYBERCOM had not abandoned its strategic-warfare role. Yet the United States’ public declaration of its willingness to significantly violate the sovereignty of an adversary in peacetime (something that would not happen when, say, fielding ballistic missiles) seems to present a novel situation for international law. It also provided strong reinforcement for the Russian and Chinese strategic narrative that politics is the extension of warfare, a reversal of Karl von Clausewitz’s famous definition of warfare as an extension of politics. By effectively declaring that the United States considered the pre-deployment of cyber weapons within an adversary’s critical infrastructure as being permissible (rather than simply being ‘caught in the act’, as the Russians were), CYBERCOM took a big step away from the established international legal order that the United States has helped to create. It also implicitly accepted a norm of mutual hostage-taking or ‘mutually assured debilitation’, a huge strategic concession that seems to imply US acceptance of a level of parity with adversaries where previously it could insist on hegemony. Moreover, it implied that CYBERCOM, if not the entire US government, has accepted the core Marxist–Leninist argument that ‘peacetime’ and ‘wartime’ are artificial distinctions.\nIt is clear that persistent engagement poses several direct challenges to the existing international order. For instance, not only does it mandate the forward- or pre-deployment of cyber weapons inside the networks of other countries before a dispute has crossed the threshold of armed conflict, it also suggests that operations beneath this threshold can be justified for any number of\nreasons, including as countermeasures against relatively ‘soft’ disinformation and propaganda activity. There is no reason to suppose that this way of thinking will be confined to the United States – any number of the next-30 cyber powers could also embrace these principles.\nPersistent engagement may also challenge the management, and therefore the shape and form, of the global internet as we know it. Depictions of cyberspace as increasingly violent will accelerate a growing trend to describe the management of the internet in security-related terms. This has been an abiding diplomatic objective of a sizeable faction of states, led by Russia and China, for many years – arguably since 1998. Footnote ⁴⁹ These states have proposed an International Code of Conduct for Information Security ‘, Footnote ⁵⁰ the latest version of which was endorsed by the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation in 2016. The greatest risk the code’s supporters see to their own cyber security is not so much infrastructure-targeting cyber attacks, but rather information warfare intended to achieve the despised outcome of ‘regime change’. For these cyber powers, encouraging diplomatic discussion on ‘countering foreign political influence’ is a key objective.\nTo further this goal, backers of the Code of Conduct have challenged the way the global internet is run. To date, the internet has been managed by a regime comprising multiple government, civil-society and private-sector actors. Footnote ⁵¹ This is known as the multi-stakeholder approach to internet governance, and it has proven to be remarkably resilient, as well as beneficial for the internet’s growth. Yet Code of Conduct supporters wish to replace this multi-stakeholder model with an intergovernmental one. They also wish to ‘securitise’ cyberspace by shifting norms of surveillance, data protection and human rights online, a desire that has been expressed by some Western governments too. In May 2015, Theresa May, then prime minister of the UK, announced that the British government would be taking a much more restrictive approach to user behaviour in cyberspace and to internet freedoms in general in response to a number of terrorist incidents. May was fiercely criticised when she refused to counter accusations that these amounted to Chinese-style internet restrictions. Footnote ⁵²\nAlready, some governments have misused critical internet infrastructure to facilitate their own espionage activity, such as in the 2019 attacks attributed to Iranian actors on the Domain Name System (sometimes described as the ‘telephone book’ of the internet). Footnote ⁵³ There is also interest in connecting the management of the Domain Name System to international efforts intended to counter cyber crime, including the dissemination of ‘bad content’, as variously defined. In this sense, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s argument that changing the management of internet resources is needed to halt the rise in cyber conflict may be gaining ground.\nIf the liberal-democratic argument that the multi-stakeholder model has worked well and served as an effective firebreak against authoritarian desires to control the internet is rejected, then all\nusers – including those in liberal democracies – will be faced with a very different information environment than that of the previous 20 years. In this new environment, all information is likely to be treated as a potential weapon, and thus subject to government intervention and state negotiations. By effectively encouraging cyber conflict, the persistent-engagement vision greatly increases the appeal of the argument that a much stronger government role in achieving ‘cyber peace’ is needed, and that ultimately, this perilous domain needs an intergovernmental model to manage it.\n*\n*\nPersistent engagement may be driving unwanted effects in a number of ways, but the mixed signalling and over-communication the strategy encourages seem particularly at fault. Publicly advocating in favour of the use of offensive cyber means can only be detrimental to international peace and security, and produce an overall increase in cyber conflict. Emerging cyber nations will be incentivised not only to develop offensive cyber capabilities but also to use them – which may lead to the discovery that they can in fact compete with great powers. At the same time, hallowed principles of international order and internet governance may be undermined, to the benefit of countries whose interests may run counter to those of the United States and liberal democracies everywhere.\nA reconsideration of the basic premises of persistent engagement may show that past US deterrence policy was actually effective – as in the case of the US–China deal that produced a decline in Chinese intellectual-property theft. It may also show that the current high level of cyber aggression has resulted from foreign perceptions of US strength, not US weakness. Instead of publicly reinforcing its dominant posture and conflating transparency with propaganda, the United States might be better served by walking more softly in cyberspace even as it retains a big stick.\nAdopting a policy of genuine transparency would have a much-needed stabilising effect by limiting the threat of inadvertent escalation or loss of escalation control. Such a policy should feature multilevel discussions, with varying levels of confidentiality, about strategic cyber capabilities and their command and control, alongside ongoing international discussions on norms of restraint. Footnote 54 The obvious benefits of this approach explain why the United States' closest allies and partners have almost unanimously advocated for it. Any covert cyber activities that impair these discussions, rather than advancing them, should remain just that - covert. Otherwise, mixing signals in the cyber domain is a recipe for serious adverse effects that threaten to undermine the security not just of the United States, but of all liberal democracies and of the internet itself.\n# Acknowledgements\nParts of this article were commissioned as a White Paper for the US Cyberspace Solarium Commission.",

It builds on a number of questionable assumptions about the international history and perception of cyber conflict, the role and strategic direction of information warfare, and the general dynamics of deterrence. Ultimately, it justifies a much more aggressive CYBERCOM mission that ignores the potential for unwanted effects that could prove to be highly destabilising in an already volatile international security environment. Overall, persistent engagement is a very high-risk approach to developing cyber deterrence that is likely to not only trigger new forms of retaliation but also accelerate the already rapid international proliferation of offensive cyber capabilities. In the worst-case scenario, it may even pose a risk to the internet as we know it. Some of the risks associated with the concept could, however, be partially alleviated by reducing its reliance on mixed signals and an excess of public communication.\n# Persistent engagement: theory and criticism\nThe promotion of CYBERCOM to a fully independent combat command in 2018 marked the emancipation of US military cyber capabilities from the intelligence world. While some observers, including the present author, thought that this development might help foster much-needed transparency on cyber capabilities, recent developments have taken a darker turn. Footnote  $^{1}$  Building on an already controversial doctrine of 'active defense in cyberspace', the US Department of Defense (DoD) put forward a new public cyber strategy in 2018 that emphasised the concept of 'defend forward'. Footnote  $^{2}$  According to Jeff Kosseff of the United States Naval Academy, defending forward has three basic components: positioning, warning and influencing. Footnote  $^{3}$  CYBERCOM's vision of persistent engagement, which represents the implementation of the DoD strategy, encompasses all three activities, and while each can be criticised as potentially destabilising to international security, the operation-alisation of the 'influencing' component may be particularly so.\nCYBERCOM's General Paul Nakasone gave an indication of what was to come when, in his Senate confirmation hearings in March 2018, he was asked about deterring Russian and Chinese cyber attacks. 'They do not think that much will happen to them', he responded. 'They do not\nfear us.' He went on to say that, 'As cyberspace develops, the longer that we have inactivity, the longer our adversaries are able to establish their own norms – and I think that is very, very important that we realize that.' Footnote 4 This view was reflected in the DoD cyber strategy of defend forward, leveraging the already well-established 'persistent presence' of CYBERCOM in adversaries' networks into an actual operational mandate to disrupt any emerging attacks and thus to 'persistently engage'. Footnote 5 To accomplish this, Nakasone has indicated that CYBERCOM will not be a 'response force' anymore, but rather a force that engages in operations 'below the level of armed attack' on a running basis. Footnote 6\nOverall, CYBERCOM is being positioned less as a strategic-weapons carrier and a key element of an overall strategic-deterrence capability, and more as a special-operations command. The risk of getting these roles entangled is evident with the reversal of traditional signalling practices, with more talk about usually non-public, covert-action-type roles, and less about potential strategic (that is, 'above the threshold of armed attack') capabilities to be used in wartime. The evolving vision of persistent engagement has largely been communicated through a series of articles and press releases, rather than through official publications and doctrines. Footnote 7 This is in keeping with the strategy's dependence on public signals to communicate intent to adversaries. While a discussion of strategic-warfare capabilities would increase transparency and probably increase stability, the sudden emphasis on public discussion of low-level, peacetime cyber attacks is doing the opposite. As decades of experience with arms control have shown, transparency on strategic weapons helps reduce the scope for misunderstandings, provides for clarity of intent, and helps establish norms of restraint and communication. But public communication of offensive covert action – revealing to the public details of secret attacks conducted against an adversary – generally does the reverse, both fostering norms of aggression and underlining the lack of communication. What is true of the conventional-arms world is doubly so in cyberspace, the eponymous information domain where kinetic cyber warfare (officially 'information operations') has an uneasy but undoubted symbiosis with its non-kinetic cousin, 'information warfare', with its emphasis on propaganda, disinformation and covert influencing. As Nakasone has said, in cyberspace the principle danger is the weaponisation of information. Footnote 8 Unfortunately, the signalling mandated by persistent engagement has extended to over-communication in public – itself an example of weaponised information that diminishes the benefits of the defend-forward strategy, lends legitimacy to information-warfare operations as a form of conflict and simultaneously encourages an already accelerating cyber arms race.\nThe empirical justification of CYBERCOM's new offensive vision has been shaky from the start. The academic underpinnings of persistent engagement were presented in a 2017 article by Richard Harknett and Michael Fischerkeller, which was released just as the former was concluding his stint as CYBERCOM's first resident scholar. Footnote 9 The very title of the article, 'Deterrence Is Not a Credible Strategy for Cyberspace', indicates that the authors thought\nit was possible (and desirable) to frame the strategy as one of ‘non-deterrence’. Their analysis rests on the belief that, as part of an ‘agreed competition’ concept, it would be possible to completely contain cyber conflict within its own domain. This would be non-escalatory due to the invisible hand of ‘tacit bargaining’, through which adversaries would feel out the borders of allowable conflict and come to a stable conflict scenario. According to this logic, not only is there less chance of inadvertent escalation over the threshold of armed conflict when engaging in the cyber domain, but this kind of engagement would also avoid retaliation in other domains, such as diplomacy and trade, or even in physical conflict zones, such as Syria and the Persian Gulf. The authors also seem to suggest that cyber could effectively function as a ‘pressure valve’ for international tensions, concentrating the inevitable tit for tat (the tacit bargaining) of international security to a more controllable and less dangerous environment. Footnote 10\nThe many suppositions of Harknett and Fischerkeller’s article have been roundly criticised. Footnote 11 Although the idea of agreed competition is presented as deriving from Herman Kahn’s idea of ‘agreed battle’, the article never answers the basic question of why an adversary would allow itself to be constrained in a way that clearly favours the United States. Cyber experts Brandon Valeriano and Benjamin Jensen have drawn on a comprehensive historical dataset of cyber operations to argue instead that such operations on their own seldom produce concessions. Normally, they need to be accompanied by other actions, such as diplomatic overtures, to work – an approach which the authors contend the US has employed to great effect in the past, despite Nakasone’s assessment that cyber deterrence has failed. Footnote 12 Overall, few observers would agree that outcomes in cyberspace are as easy to predict as advocates of persistent engagement seem to believe. On the contrary, the basic assumption of diplomacy over at least the last decade is that cyberspace is the domain most prone to misinterpretation and miscalculation. Footnote 13 Finally, there is no clear theory of victory in persistent engagement and no strategic endgame, only the purpose of creating operational advantages in cyberspace. There is no agreement as to what the basic strategic game is, or what constitutes its winning and losing factors.\nMore troublingly, persistent engagement does not articulate a sound reasoning as to why any escalation in cyberspace would produce good outcomes for the United States. Tom Bossert, US President Donald Trump’s first homeland security advisor, has explicitly questioned parts of the strategy. In a June 2018 Wired article, he is quoted as saying, ‘I want to make sure we don’t end up in an escalatory cyber exchange where we lose more than they do’, and as pointing out that ‘in many respects the US economy and infrastructure is far more reliant on digitization and automation than Russia’s, giving the Kremlin an inherent advantage in any future no-holdsbarred cyberwar. He paraphrases former US secretary of defense Ash Carter: “If you’re doused in gasoline, don’t start a match-throwing contest.”’ Footnote 14\nThe entire rationale for the strategy, as outlined by Nakasone himself, relies on a version of cyber history that not all observers will agree with. For instance, Nakasone has said that the US mostly faced an intelligence-gathering threat before 2013, which then escalated into denial-based attacks before moving towards destructive attacks (presumably including information-warfare attacks in 2016) and preparations for armed conflict. Footnote 15 Overlooked by this narrative is any consideration of how the adversary – or even many US friends and allies – would see the causality of these developments. In an alternative narrative, US dominance in persistent-presence espionage was publicly revealed through the intelligence disclosures of 2013, at the same time as the first real cyber weapon, Stuxnet, was attributed to the United States. Among allies in Europe, such as Germany, these revelations were often badly received, and the reaction among neutrals, such as Brazil, was even more negative. Not many European observers would agree with the assessment of persistent engagement's supporters that the US has been 'too passive' in cyberspace. In some cases, a different conclusion can be drawn: that cyber attacks have been responses to US activity. Nakasone has cited Iranian cyber aggression to justify persistent engagement, but Iranian activities can also be framed as responses to US cyber operations, such as Stuxnet and Flame. Footnote 16 The Shamoon malware that Iran used to target Saudi Arabia reused components of the US-attributed Flame malware – effectively directing a US cyber weapon back at one of its allies. Footnote 17 Seen from this perspective, at least some of the increase in cyber-related activity directed against the United States has been a direct result of public disclosures of the advanced state of US cyber capabilities and operations. Instead of producing a deterrent effect, these disclosures seem to have contributed to an increase in cyber tensions. This does not bode well for the principle of persistent engagement as currently expressed.\nBoth the academic theory and the policy statements surrounding persistent engagement have a strained relationship with the overall concept of deterrence, as well as with those of balance of power, proliferation and arms control. Before 2016, modern US deterrence followed a logic that is often expressed as a ladder, from entanglement, norms and resilience to punishment. Footnote 18 Purists may argue that only the last two – the ability to absorb an attack, and the ability to conduct an attack – represent classic deterrence. Footnote 19 Contending that the US strategy of 'denial' or 'resilience' has clearly failed in recent years, they have turned to an existing solution for the problem and radically reinterpreted it. In 2011, the nascent weakness in US cyber-deterrence policy – insofar as this had been formally expressed – had already been identified as a lack of 'credibility' or, in technical terms, a seeming inability to communicate the strength of US cyber capabilities in order to dissuade an adversary. It was the same conundrum made famous by Dr. Strangelove – how can one expect a deterrent effect if the very instrument of deterrence is a secret? In cyber terms, the effect was dubbed the 'Cartwright Conjecture' by Jason Healey after General James Cartwright, the former head of Strategic Command who, in 2011, was already complaining that 'we've got to talk about our offensive capabilities and train to them; to make\nthem credible ... You can't have something that's a secret be a deterrent. Because if you don't know it's there, it doesn't scare you.' Footnote 20 This was by no means an isolated message. Footnote 21 At that time, the strategic capability being communicated was one of overwhelming US intelligence-gathering capabilities.\nWithin the US government, intelligence-gathering capabilities have resolutely been portrayed as neutral, or even defensive, in nature. Yet many allies, as well as private-sector actors within the US itself, do not share this view. A number of foreign leaders – not only of neutral countries, but of friends and allies of the US – have concluded that the United States' ability to maintain a persistent presence on all kinds of networks is tantamount to being able to strike them at will. Never mind that it takes time to prepare complicated strikes across highly segmented networks, or that it can be difficult for CYBERCOM to get campaigns approved through the interagency process – these are problems only the attacker can see. From a defender's point of view, it can be very difficult to differentiate between advanced espionage attempts and imminent acts of war – including by the United States. When US dominance in persistent presence became publicly apparent after 2013, it was only natural that a number of nations – some of them US adversaries, but not all – feared that it would not be long before the US took the simple step from persistent presence to persistent engagement. Although major US initiatives such as the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (launched in 2009 with an estimated budget of $40 billion over five years) were cast as being 'defensive' in nature, the programmes could clearly serve as the foundation for offensive cyber activity: the same sensors and implants intended to provide warning of hostile cyber activity could easily be repurposed for offensive activity. This being the case, and given the historical record of presumed US cyber operations, Nakasone's claims in his 2017 Senate confirmation hearing that the United States has been a passive actor in cyberspace seems disingenuous, at best.\nThe significant increase in all forms of offensive cyber behaviour against the US after 2013 has been described as a deterrence failure. Yet advocates of persistent engagement have been unable to explain why deterrence failed, or to express whether the failure was complete or only partial. There is at least some evidence to suggest that the escalation was due to perceived US strength in cyber, not weakness. Following the work of Valeriano and Jensen, whose dataset indicates that responses to cyber attacks have historically been proportional and not intentionally escalatory, Footnote 22 this could imply that some of the increased activity publicly reported since 2013 may in fact have been responses by US adversaries – responses that have been recalibrated to take into account a much more dominant US position in cyberspace than these adversaries had been aware of.\nEither way, friendly and less friendly nations alike have rushed to compete in an escalating cyber arms race, one which the US may have played a decisive role in accelerating even before the publication of persistent engagement. Footnote 23 The very term 'cyber arms race', while not\nparticularly contentious in itself, is difficult to fully circumscribe. The phenomenon bears little resemblance to historic arms races and cannot be quantified by numbers of weapons systems, as was possible during the missile-gap race of the 1960s or the battleship/dreadnought race of the 1900s. Yet even though it is not even clear exactly what these offensive capabilities entail, there is little disagreement that a number of nations are increasingly seeking them, and that the overall level of destructive cyber attacks is rising. A 2016 study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) estimated that at least 30 nations were actively pursuing offensive cyber capabilities, a number that has likely continued to increase year on year as the number of cyber incidents continues to rise. Footnote 24\nMuch like the United States after 2013, many nations have seen a significant increase in malicious behaviour in cyberspace. The Council on Foreign Relations has reported that, with two notable dips in 2012 and 2016, cyber-espionage activity worldwide increased tenfold from 2009 to 2019. Footnote 25 Much of the damage caused by recent cyber incidents such as the WannaCry and NotPetya ransomware attacks, as well as routing and kinetic-equivalent attacks on media and industry, was concentrated outside of the United States. Paired with a significant increase in psychological, information-warfare activities, this has prompted many of the hardest-hit nations (including Australia, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, among others) to make significant adjustments to their cyber postures, in particular by building offensive capabilities. At the same time, anecdotal information suggests that not even these comparatively advanced nations have fully understood what these new cyber capabilities are actually intended to do – if they are intended to focus on ‘strategic strike’ (for instance against critical infrastructure), ‘battlefield cyber’ (acting as a sort of electronic warfare) or online covert action. Footnote 26 This relative confusion about mission parameters will only be accentuated by the new CYBERCOM vision.\nEarly US signalling in response to the Cartwright Conjecture may have intended to go beyond emphasising American strength in online covert action to illustrate the country's ability to conduct a 'global strike' of overwhelming force in wartime – in essence, framing cyber as a strategic capability, a kind of digital weapon of mass destruction. CYBERCOM's intent differs, however, from the low-level silent professionalism of those engaged in strategic deterrence or the targeted focus of tailored access operations in the intelligence world. The role model for persistent engagement is not strategic command or the intelligence community, but rather special-operations command, whose mission has been to counter the adversary all the time, everywhere.\nGeneral Nakasone has stated that, 'unlike the nuclear realm, where our strategic advantage or power comes from possessing a capability or weapons system, in cyberspace it's the use of cyber capabilities that is strategically consequential'. Footnote 27 Not only does this remark suggest that the United States must use offensive capabilities visibly, but it also implies that other nations have a clear interest in doing so as well. Yet encouraging a permissive norm that implicitly\nfavours cyber aggression as a tool of peacetime statecraft is likely only to expand the already murky grey area of modern conflict, and the difference between covert action and military activity. Footnote 28 A number of significant adverse effects can be expected among a range of countries – US allies and friends, neutrals and US adversaries alike – which are unlikely to be in the US interest.\nFirst-order effects: ‘out of band’ and ‘diagonal’ retaliation Jason Healey and Neil Jenkins have argued that the impact of the new persistent-engagement strategy could be assessed by looking at the number of cyber attacks against the US. A decline in attacks would indicate that the strategy was effective, while an increase would suggest it was ineffective or counterproductive. Footnote 29 This approach seems too simplistic for at least two reasons. Firstly, US adversaries may simply retaliate with non-cyber means, drawing on the example the US has already set. One of the most successful acts of US cyber deterrence was the use of Department of Justice indictments against specific foreign cyber actors. Following the indictment of five Chinese hackers associated with the People's Liberation Army in 2015, a landmark deal was reached between then-president Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping that resulted in a significant decline – by up to 90%, according to a report by the security company FireEye Footnote 30 – in Chinese-attributed intellectual-property theft. Other indictments against Russian and Iranian hackers have followed. US adversaries may seek to devise their own ‘out of band’ responses to US cyber activity, perhaps by drawing on the copious amount of leaked materials on offensive US cyber capabilities now in the public domain. Alternatively, they may respond with more ‘conventional’ means, for instance by increasing their support for the non-US side in adversarial situations such as trade conflicts, maritime disputes and weapons proliferation.\nUS adversaries might also respond ‘diagonally’ by responding with cyber-enabled means that defy the simple characterisation of ‘cyber attack’. The kind of social-media activity associated with Russia’s information-warfare campaign against the United States is but one example of this approach. Other cyber means could potentially be deployed in an even more covert manner, making attribution difficult even with the deployment of the United States’ full range of intelligence-collection measures.\nThe recent spate of cyber-crime attacks directed against state and local governments across the United States may be another example of a diagonal approach to cyber retaliation. From January to July 2019, more than 55 state and local governments in the US were hit by ransomware attacks. Footnote 31 Although there had been no public attribution of these activities to foreign actors by the time this article went to press, some of them used a stolen US cyber exploit, dubbed ‘EternalBlue’. This exploit had been posted for sale by a group calling itself ‘Shadow Brokers’, which some have speculated may be a front for Russian intelligence actors. Footnote 32 When cyber criminals did not immediately respond to the possibilities inherent in this new exploit, the WannaCry and NotPetya campaigns were launched, drawing attention not just to the possibilities\nof EternalBlue, but also to the efficacy of ransomware attacks themselves. Even if the current spate of cyber attacks against state and local governments in the US was not directed by a foreign adversary, it would be relatively easy for governments to encourage such activity in the future, thus inflicting real pain on targets and demonstrating the ability of national cyber defenders to respond to provocations.\nThe underlying enabling factor for this scenario is the poor state of basic national cyber security across the United States. A 2019 report by the US Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that of the 3,000 cybersecurity recommendations that have been made to federal agencies since 2010, more than 1,000 had yet to be implemented. Footnote  $^{33}$  These vulnerabilities also extend to the DoD's own basic war-fighting capabilities. According to a GAO report from 2018, 'almost all the weapons that the DOD tested between 2012 and 2017, including the F-35 jet and missile systems, have \"mission critical\" cyber vulnerabilities and can be \"easily hacked\" using \"relatively simple tools and techniques\". Footnote  $^{34}$  As poor as federal cyber-security efforts are, the situation at the state and local levels is significantly worse: a 2019 survey indicated that there remains a large difference between state and federal cyber-security capabilities. Footnote  $^{35}$  The state and local agencies polled said they had high confidence in their ability to 'prevent' a cyber attack in only  $19\\%$  of cases (compared to  $41\\%$  of federal agencies), and only  $28\\%$  of those canvassed said they would be able to 'recover' (versus  $55\\%$  of federal agencies). The nation's privately held critical infrastructure is more difficult to assess, but is largely considered to be more capable, and the United States' overall cyber-security stance tends to be ranked highly by more politically minded ratings – the International Telecommunications Union, for example, ranked the US overall at number two worldwide. Footnote  $^{36}$  More technical ratings, however, like that of the National Cyber Security Index, give the US a more middling assessment – placing it, for instance, in thirteenth place worldwide. Footnote  $^{37}$  The only good news, if it can be called that, to emerge from these findings is that the poor state of US national cyber security is mirrored by that of Russia and China.\n# Second-order effects: emerging cyber powers and their strategic dilemma\nA major reason for the vulnerable state of US cyber security has to do with scale – large nations have inherently more attack surface to cover, and the US easily has the greatest attack surface of them all. Footnote  $^{38}$  However, the opposite is therefore also true – smaller nations on balance have a much easier task in building national cyber security, and this has significant repercussions for how they play their own game of strategic deterrence. Yet the asymmetric strength of small players has been largely overlooked in most conventional analyses of cyber powers.\nSmaller nations often benefit from increased cooperation between the civilian and military, and state and non-state sectors, and generally face fewer challenges in coordinating emergency measures. Some even have the ability to disconnect from the global internet if necessary. Footnote 39 Smaller countries may also benefit from a more stringent legal and regulatory framework that requires a minimum level of cyber defence, not just from various levels of government but also from the private sector. For nations like, say, the Netherlands, the task of coordinating with 100–300 critical-infrastructure providers, and a comparable number of local and federal government networks, is a completely different task than dealing with many tens of thousands of civilian assets and non-military governmental networks, as in the United States. Footnote 40 A smaller attack surface means fewer critical-infrastructure providers that need to be communicated with, fewer government agency networks that need to be hardened and less scope for friction in a crisis. Essentially, this means that smaller advanced cyber nations have an inherent advantage in pursuing national cyber security compared with very large nations such as the United States, or indeed Russia and China. All things considered, a number of smaller nations might actually do quite well in a force-on-force conflict with a major cyber power. The ability of many smaller nations to potentially absorb cyber blows is no less significant in a wartime scenario than advantageous defensive geography would be in a ground operation. Yet the ‘high ground’ advantage of smaller states in presenting a smaller attack surface in the cyber domain may not have been adequately factored into analysts’ calculations, including those that informed the drafting of persistent engagement. As a corollary to this, smaller nations’ ability to conduct deterrence by punishment – a strategy that persistent engagement has heavily incentivised them to pursue – is not well understood.\nThe nature of the offensive cyber capabilities currently being developed by the ‘next 30’ nations examined in the 2016 CSIS study may not be clear, but there is no reason to believe that they relate only to cyber-crime-style scenarios, such as denial-of-service or even ransomware attacks. Instead, it should be assumed that these cyber powers can ‘turn the lights off’ – that is, launch a strategic strike on the critical infrastructure of an enemy. While it is much easier to temporarily shut down a nation’s infrastructure networks than to damage them beyond repair, ‘temporary’ disruptions can still impose catastrophic costs on a nation’s economy and limit its ability to maintain domestic order. The destructive potential of the next 30 may be orders of magnitude less than that of the United States or a near-peer cyber power, but some of these countries still possess a minimal deterrence capability that, much like the small nuclear arsenals of France, the UK and China, could inflict an unacceptable level of retaliatory punishment on a potential aggressor, no matter their overwhelming technical superiority. While detractors may say that mere cyber attacks should not be compared to the horror of a nuclear exchange, the effects of weeks-long black-outs, the destruction of financial information and the breakdown of most forms of communication should not be underestimated. The next-30 cyber nations may therefore possess something which was previously unavailable to them: not just a strategic-weapons capability – a\nvirtual strike force no less potent than a wing of bombers or ballistic missiles – but also a defensive advantage towards larger foes.\nThe sheer number of nations that may be able to reciprocally threaten a major power could be historically unprecedented. There was briefly a time, in the late 1950s, when it seemed possible that dozens of nations would eventually deploy nuclear weapons; even small countries like Switzerland deliberated the possibility of creating their own nuclear deterrent. Footnote 41 In the end, many of these opted to form alliances with existing nuclear powers instead. Today, persistent engagement may be changing the way such nations provide for their own security. Instead of depending on the protective umbrella of their friends, many now have their own budding deterrence-by-punishment capability in the cyber domain, in addition to having become better able to resist the effects of a strategic cyber strike against themselves. Some are also being incentivised by persistent engagement not only to develop offensive capabilities, but to use them as well. After all, persistent engagement postulates that cyber conflict is not only to be welcomed, but to be engaged in so as to be 'understood'. Any country not carrying out cyber attacks would, like those that did not test nuclear bombs, be excluded from the main table and left without a voice. This is seen as a perverse incentive by those who advocate for non-proliferation and argue that the increased distribution of destructive weapons increases the likelihood not only that one will be used, but that all will be used.\n# Third-order effects: weaponising information and changing the internet\nIn February 2019, it was reported that some unspecified action had been taken by CYBERCOM in November 2018 against the Internet Research Agency, a notorious social-media 'troll factory' headquartered in St Petersburg. The New York Times said that the organisation had been shut down 'for a number of days' as part of an effort to secure the US midterm elections. Footnote 42 Unlike many other parts of the Russian security apparatus, the Internet Research Agency does not seem to engage in 'hacking' – that is, it does not launch its own intrusions. Rather, it is widely accepted that the agency engages only in spreading disinformation, Footnote 43 something that may not even be illegal under international law. CYBERCOM's action against it may well have fallen beneath the 'use of force' or 'armed attack' threshold (a distinction not usually made in the United States anyway), but its public nature implies an acceptance of kinetic-effect cyber attacks – it sent the message that it is okay to hack what you consider 'fake news'.\nIf the targeting of actors that have only a propaganda function (rather than being directly responsible for cyber attacks) becomes normalised, then more conventional media organisations, as well as civil-society and non-governmental organisations, may become admissible targets. Russia might conclude, for example, that foreign support for domestic democracy activists falls\nunder the heading of ‘information and psychological actions aimed at undermining … the homeland’, to borrow language from the 2016 Russian Information Security Doctrine. Footnote 44 Likewise, Beijing might find Chinese-language translations of the New York Times provocative. Footnote 45 International disputes may emerge about ‘bad content’, such as propaganda, social-media campaigns and unkind opinion pieces. Footnote 46 In this way, persistent engagement might encourage the very risk that it was intended to alleviate: the weaponisation of information.\nIn June 2019, the New York Times reported that, at the same time the US was targeting the Information Research Agency, it was also deploying offensive cyber capabilities within the Russian power grid. Footnote 47 A similar intrusion of US power grids – using a malware package known as BlackEnergy – was noticed in 2011 and publicly reported on soon after. A version of BlackEnergy was also used in December 2015 to cause a large-scale blackout in western Ukraine. Footnote 48 These two intrusions, both of them attributed to Russia, ultimately drew attention to themselves, even though there was a blackout only in the 2015 action. In June 2019, however, the United States raised the ante. Rather than ‘allowing’ their own pre-deployment operation to be discovered and reported on by Russian actors, the Americans reported it themselves, stating that since 2018 US malware had been present in the Russian power grid in order to effect a kinetic-equivalent strike if necessary. The intent of this disclosure was likely to make it clear to the Russians that, if necessary, the US was ready to accept a level of ‘mutually assured disruption’. At least as important was the message that CYBERCOM had not abandoned its strategic-warfare role. Yet the United States’ public declaration of its willingness to significantly violate the sovereignty of an adversary in peacetime (something that would not happen when, say, fielding ballistic missiles) seems to present a novel situation for international law. It also provided strong reinforcement for the Russian and Chinese strategic narrative that politics is the extension of warfare, a reversal of Karl von Clausewitz’s famous definition of warfare as an extension of politics. By effectively declaring that the United States considered the pre-deployment of cyber weapons within an adversary’s critical infrastructure as being permissible (rather than simply being ‘caught in the act’, as the Russians were), CYBERCOM took a big step away from the established international legal order that the United States has helped to create. It also implicitly accepted a norm of mutual hostage-taking or ‘mutually assured debilitation’, a huge strategic concession that seems to imply US acceptance of a level of parity with adversaries where previously it could insist on hegemony. Moreover, it implied that CYBERCOM, if not the entire US government, has accepted the core Marxist–Leninist argument that ‘peacetime’ and ‘wartime’ are artificial distinctions.\nIt is clear that persistent engagement poses several direct challenges to the existing international order. For instance, not only does it mandate the forward- or pre-deployment of cyber weapons inside the networks of other countries before a dispute has crossed the threshold of armed conflict, it also suggests that operations beneath this threshold can be justified for any number of\nreasons, including as countermeasures against relatively ‘soft’ disinformation and propaganda activity. There is no reason to suppose that this way of thinking will be confined to the United States – any number of the next-30 cyber powers could also embrace these principles.\nPersistent engagement may also challenge the management, and therefore the shape and form, of the global internet as we know it. Depictions of cyberspace as increasingly violent will accelerate a growing trend to describe the management of the internet in security-related terms. This has been an abiding diplomatic objective of a sizeable faction of states, led by Russia and China, for many years – arguably since 1998. Footnote ⁴⁹ These states have proposed an International Code of Conduct for Information Security ‘, Footnote ⁵⁰ the latest version of which was endorsed by the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation in 2016. The greatest risk the code’s supporters see to their own cyber security is not so much infrastructure-targeting cyber attacks, but rather information warfare intended to achieve the despised outcome of ‘regime change’. For these cyber powers, encouraging diplomatic discussion on ‘countering foreign political influence’ is a key objective.\nTo further this goal, backers of the Code of Conduct have challenged the way the global internet is run. To date, the internet has been managed by a regime comprising multiple government, civil-society and private-sector actors. Footnote ⁵¹ This is known as the multi-stakeholder approach to internet governance, and it has proven to be remarkably resilient, as well as beneficial for the internet’s growth. Yet Code of Conduct supporters wish to replace this multi-stakeholder model with an intergovernmental one. They also wish to ‘securitise’ cyberspace by shifting norms of surveillance, data protection and human rights online, a desire that has been expressed by some Western governments too. In May 2015, Theresa May, then prime minister of the UK, announced that the British government would be taking a much more restrictive approach to user behaviour in cyberspace and to internet freedoms in general in response to a number of terrorist incidents. May was fiercely criticised when she refused to counter accusations that these amounted to Chinese-style internet restrictions. Footnote ⁵²\nAlready, some governments have misused critical internet infrastructure to facilitate their own espionage activity, such as in the 2019 attacks attributed to Iranian actors on the Domain Name System (sometimes described as the ‘telephone book’ of the internet). Footnote ⁵³ There is also interest in connecting the management of the Domain Name System to international efforts intended to counter cyber crime, including the dissemination of ‘bad content’, as variously defined. In this sense, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s argument that changing the management of internet resources is needed to halt the rise in cyber conflict may be gaining ground.\nIf the liberal-democratic argument that the multi-stakeholder model has worked well and served as an effective firebreak against authoritarian desires to control the internet is rejected, then all\nusers – including those in liberal democracies – will be faced with a very different information environment than that of the previous 20 years. In this new environment, all information is likely to be treated as a potential weapon, and thus subject to government intervention and state negotiations. By effectively encouraging cyber conflict, the persistent-engagement vision greatly increases the appeal of the argument that a much stronger government role in achieving ‘cyber peace’ is needed, and that ultimately, this perilous domain needs an intergovernmental model to manage it.\n*\n*\nPersistent engagement may be driving unwanted effects in a number of ways, but the mixed signalling and over-communication the strategy encourages seem particularly at fault. Publicly advocating in favour of the use of offensive cyber means can only be detrimental to international peace and security, and produce an overall increase in cyber conflict. Emerging cyber nations will be incentivised not only to develop offensive cyber capabilities but also to use them – which may lead to the discovery that they can in fact compete with great powers. At the same time, hallowed principles of international order and internet governance may be undermined, to the benefit of countries whose interests may run counter to those of the United States and liberal democracies everywhere.\nA reconsideration of the basic premises of persistent engagement may show that past US deterrence policy was actually effective – as in the case of the US–China deal that produced a decline in Chinese intellectual-property theft. It may also show that the current high level of cyber aggression has resulted from foreign perceptions of US strength, not US weakness. Instead of publicly reinforcing its dominant posture and conflating transparency with propaganda, the United States might be better served by walking more softly in cyberspace even as it retains a big stick.\nAdopting a policy of genuine transparency would have a much-needed stabilising effect by limiting the threat of inadvertent escalation or loss of escalation control. Such a policy should feature multilevel discussions, with varying levels of confidentiality, about strategic cyber capabilities and their command and control, alongside ongoing international discussions on norms of restraint. Footnote 54 The obvious benefits of this approach explain why the United States' closest allies and partners have almost unanimously advocated for it. Any covert cyber activities that impair these discussions, rather than advancing them, should remain just that - covert. Otherwise, mixing signals in the cyber domain is a recipe for serious adverse effects that threaten to undermine the security not just of the United States, but of all liberal democracies and of the internet itself.\n# Acknowledgements\nParts of this article were commissioned as a White Paper for the US Cyberspace Solarium Commission.",

    "# Abstract": "Some risks of 'persistent engagement' could be mitigated by reducing its reliance on mixed signals and public communication.\nPrevious article View issue table of contents Next article\nThe conduct and deployment of the United States Cyber Command's (CYBERCOM) vision of 'persistent engagement' represents a radical and largely unwelcome departure from previous notions of conflict in cyberspace. It builds on a number of questionable assumptions about the international history and perception of cyber conflict, the role and strategic direction of information warfare, and the general dynamics of deterrence. Ultimately, it justifies a much more aggressive CYBERCOM mission that ignores the potential for unwanted effects that could prove to be highly destabilising in an already volatile international security environment. Overall, persistent engagement is a very high-risk approach to developing cyber deterrence that is likely to not only trigger new forms of retaliation but also accelerate the already rapid international proliferation of offensive cyber capabilities. In the worst-case scenario, it may even pose a risk to the internet as we know it. Some of the risks associated with the concept could, however, be partially alleviated by reducing its reliance on mixed signals and an excess of public communication.",
    "# Persistent engagement: theory and criticism": "The promotion of CYBERCOM to a fully independent combat command in 2018 marked the emancipation of US military cyber capabilities from the intelligence world. While some observers, including the present author, thought that this development might help foster much-needed transparency on cyber capabilities, recent developments have taken a darker turn. Footnote  $^{1}$  Building on an already controversial doctrine of 'active defense in cyberspace', the US Department of Defense (DoD) put forward a new public cyber strategy in 2018 that emphasised the concept of 'defend forward'. Footnote  $^{2}$  According to Jeff Kosseff of the United States Naval Academy, defending forward has three basic components: positioning, warning and influencing. Footnote  $^{3}$  CYBERCOM's vision of persistent engagement, which represents the implementation of the DoD strategy, encompasses all three activities, and while each can be criticised as potentially destabilising to international security, the operation-alisation of the 'influencing' component may be particularly so.\nCYBERCOM's General Paul Nakasone gave an indication of what was to come when, in his Senate confirmation hearings in March 2018, he was asked about deterring Russian and Chinese cyber attacks. 'They do not think that much will happen to them', he responded. 'They do not\nfear us.' He went on to say that, 'As cyberspace develops, the longer that we have inactivity, the longer our adversaries are able to establish their own norms – and I think that is very, very important that we realize that.' Footnote 4 This view was reflected in the DoD cyber strategy of defend forward, leveraging the already well-established 'persistent presence' of CYBERCOM in adversaries' networks into an actual operational mandate to disrupt any emerging attacks and thus to 'persistently engage'. Footnote 5 To accomplish this, Nakasone has indicated that CYBERCOM will not be a 'response force' anymore, but rather a force that engages in operations 'below the level of armed attack' on a running basis. Footnote 6\nOverall, CYBERCOM is being positioned less as a strategic-weapons carrier and a key element of an overall strategic-deterrence capability, and more as a special-operations command. The risk of getting these roles entangled is evident with the reversal of traditional signalling practices, with more talk about usually non-public, covert-action-type roles, and less about potential strategic (that is, 'above the threshold of armed attack') capabilities to be used in wartime. The evolving vision of persistent engagement has largely been communicated through a series of articles and press releases, rather than through official publications and doctrines. Footnote 7 This is in keeping with the strategy's dependence on public signals to communicate intent to adversaries. While a discussion of strategic-warfare capabilities would increase transparency and probably increase stability, the sudden emphasis on public discussion of low-level, peacetime cyber attacks is doing the opposite. As decades of experience with arms control have shown, transparency on strategic weapons helps reduce the scope for misunderstandings, provides for clarity of intent, and helps establish norms of restraint and communication. But public communication of offensive covert action – revealing to the public details of secret attacks conducted against an adversary – generally does the reverse, both fostering norms of aggression and underlining the lack of communication. What is true of the conventional-arms world is doubly so in cyberspace, the eponymous information domain where kinetic cyber warfare (officially 'information operations') has an uneasy but undoubted symbiosis with its non-kinetic cousin, 'information warfare', with its emphasis on propaganda, disinformation and covert influencing. As Nakasone has said, in cyberspace the principle danger is the weaponisation of information. Footnote 8 Unfortunately, the signalling mandated by persistent engagement has extended to over-communication in public – itself an example of weaponised information that diminishes the benefits of the defend-forward strategy, lends legitimacy to information-warfare operations as a form of conflict and simultaneously encourages an already accelerating cyber arms race.\nThe empirical justification of CYBERCOM's new offensive vision has been shaky from the start. The academic underpinnings of persistent engagement were presented in a 2017 article by Richard Harknett and Michael Fischerkeller, which was released just as the former was concluding his stint as CYBERCOM's first resident scholar. Footnote 9 The very title of the article, 'Deterrence Is Not a Credible Strategy for Cyberspace', indicates that the authors thought\nit was possible (and desirable) to frame the strategy as one of ‘non-deterrence’. Their analysis rests on the belief that, as part of an ‘agreed competition’ concept, it would be possible to completely contain cyber conflict within its own domain. This would be non-escalatory due to the invisible hand of ‘tacit bargaining’, through which adversaries would feel out the borders of allowable conflict and come to a stable conflict scenario. According to this logic, not only is there less chance of inadvertent escalation over the threshold of armed conflict when engaging in the cyber domain, but this kind of engagement would also avoid retaliation in other domains, such as diplomacy and trade, or even in physical conflict zones, such as Syria and the Persian Gulf. The authors also seem to suggest that cyber could effectively function as a ‘pressure valve’ for international tensions, concentrating the inevitable tit for tat (the tacit bargaining) of international security to a more controllable and less dangerous environment. Footnote 10\nThe many suppositions of Harknett and Fischerkeller’s article have been roundly criticised. Footnote 11 Although the idea of agreed competition is presented as deriving from Herman Kahn’s idea of ‘agreed battle’, the article never answers the basic question of why an adversary would allow itself to be constrained in a way that clearly favours the United States. Cyber experts Brandon Valeriano and Benjamin Jensen have drawn on a comprehensive historical dataset of cyber operations to argue instead that such operations on their own seldom produce concessions. Normally, they need to be accompanied by other actions, such as diplomatic overtures, to work – an approach which the authors contend the US has employed to great effect in the past, despite Nakasone’s assessment that cyber deterrence has failed. Footnote 12 Overall, few observers would agree that outcomes in cyberspace are as easy to predict as advocates of persistent engagement seem to believe. On the contrary, the basic assumption of diplomacy over at least the last decade is that cyberspace is the domain most prone to misinterpretation and miscalculation. Footnote 13 Finally, there is no clear theory of victory in persistent engagement and no strategic endgame, only the purpose of creating operational advantages in cyberspace. There is no agreement as to what the basic strategic game is, or what constitutes its winning and losing factors.\nMore troublingly, persistent engagement does not articulate a sound reasoning as to why any escalation in cyberspace would produce good outcomes for the United States. Tom Bossert, US President Donald Trump’s first homeland security advisor, has explicitly questioned parts of the strategy. In a June 2018 Wired article, he is quoted as saying, ‘I want to make sure we don’t end up in an escalatory cyber exchange where we lose more than they do’, and as pointing out that ‘in many respects the US economy and infrastructure is far more reliant on digitization and automation than Russia’s, giving the Kremlin an inherent advantage in any future no-holdsbarred cyberwar. He paraphrases former US secretary of defense Ash Carter: “If you’re doused in gasoline, don’t start a match-throwing contest.”’ Footnote 14\nThe entire rationale for the strategy, as outlined by Nakasone himself, relies on a version of cyber history that not all observers will agree with. For instance, Nakasone has said that the US mostly faced an intelligence-gathering threat before 2013, which then escalated into denial-based attacks before moving towards destructive attacks (presumably including information-warfare attacks in 2016) and preparations for armed conflict. Footnote 15 Overlooked by this narrative is any consideration of how the adversary – or even many US friends and allies – would see the causality of these developments. In an alternative narrative, US dominance in persistent-presence espionage was publicly revealed through the intelligence disclosures of 2013, at the same time as the first real cyber weapon, Stuxnet, was attributed to the United States. Among allies in Europe, such as Germany, these revelations were often badly received, and the reaction among neutrals, such as Brazil, was even more negative. Not many European observers would agree with the assessment of persistent engagement's supporters that the US has been 'too passive' in cyberspace. In some cases, a different conclusion can be drawn: that cyber attacks have been responses to US activity. Nakasone has cited Iranian cyber aggression to justify persistent engagement, but Iranian activities can also be framed as responses to US cyber operations, such as Stuxnet and Flame. Footnote 16 The Shamoon malware that Iran used to target Saudi Arabia reused components of the US-attributed Flame malware – effectively directing a US cyber weapon back at one of its allies. Footnote 17 Seen from this perspective, at least some of the increase in cyber-related activity directed against the United States has been a direct result of public disclosures of the advanced state of US cyber capabilities and operations. Instead of producing a deterrent effect, these disclosures seem to have contributed to an increase in cyber tensions. This does not bode well for the principle of persistent engagement as currently expressed.\nBoth the academic theory and the policy statements surrounding persistent engagement have a strained relationship with the overall concept of deterrence, as well as with those of balance of power, proliferation and arms control. Before 2016, modern US deterrence followed a logic that is often expressed as a ladder, from entanglement, norms and resilience to punishment. Footnote 18 Purists may argue that only the last two – the ability to absorb an attack, and the ability to conduct an attack – represent classic deterrence. Footnote 19 Contending that the US strategy of 'denial' or 'resilience' has clearly failed in recent years, they have turned to an existing solution for the problem and radically reinterpreted it. In 2011, the nascent weakness in US cyber-deterrence policy – insofar as this had been formally expressed – had already been identified as a lack of 'credibility' or, in technical terms, a seeming inability to communicate the strength of US cyber capabilities in order to dissuade an adversary. It was the same conundrum made famous by Dr. Strangelove – how can one expect a deterrent effect if the very instrument of deterrence is a secret? In cyber terms, the effect was dubbed the 'Cartwright Conjecture' by Jason Healey after General James Cartwright, the former head of Strategic Command who, in 2011, was already complaining that 'we've got to talk about our offensive capabilities and train to them; to make\nthem credible ... You can't have something that's a secret be a deterrent. Because if you don't know it's there, it doesn't scare you.' Footnote 20 This was by no means an isolated message. Footnote 21 At that time, the strategic capability being communicated was one of overwhelming US intelligence-gathering capabilities.\nWithin the US government, intelligence-gathering capabilities have resolutely been portrayed as neutral, or even defensive, in nature. Yet many allies, as well as private-sector actors within the US itself, do not share this view. A number of foreign leaders – not only of neutral countries, but of friends and allies of the US – have concluded that the United States' ability to maintain a persistent presence on all kinds of networks is tantamount to being able to strike them at will. Never mind that it takes time to prepare complicated strikes across highly segmented networks, or that it can be difficult for CYBERCOM to get campaigns approved through the interagency process – these are problems only the attacker can see. From a defender's point of view, it can be very difficult to differentiate between advanced espionage attempts and imminent acts of war – including by the United States. When US dominance in persistent presence became publicly apparent after 2013, it was only natural that a number of nations – some of them US adversaries, but not all – feared that it would not be long before the US took the simple step from persistent presence to persistent engagement. Although major US initiatives such as the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (launched in 2009 with an estimated budget of $40 billion over five years) were cast as being 'defensive' in nature, the programmes could clearly serve as the foundation for offensive cyber activity: the same sensors and implants intended to provide warning of hostile cyber activity could easily be repurposed for offensive activity. This being the case, and given the historical record of presumed US cyber operations, Nakasone's claims in his 2017 Senate confirmation hearing that the United States has been a passive actor in cyberspace seems disingenuous, at best.\nThe significant increase in all forms of offensive cyber behaviour against the US after 2013 has been described as a deterrence failure. Yet advocates of persistent engagement have been unable to explain why deterrence failed, or to express whether the failure was complete or only partial. There is at least some evidence to suggest that the escalation was due to perceived US strength in cyber, not weakness. Following the work of Valeriano and Jensen, whose dataset indicates that responses to cyber attacks have historically been proportional and not intentionally escalatory, Footnote 22 this could imply that some of the increased activity publicly reported since 2013 may in fact have been responses by US adversaries – responses that have been recalibrated to take into account a much more dominant US position in cyberspace than these adversaries had been aware of.\nEither way, friendly and less friendly nations alike have rushed to compete in an escalating cyber arms race, one which the US may have played a decisive role in accelerating even before the publication of persistent engagement. Footnote 23 The very term 'cyber arms race', while not\nparticularly contentious in itself, is difficult to fully circumscribe. The phenomenon bears little resemblance to historic arms races and cannot be quantified by numbers of weapons systems, as was possible during the missile-gap race of the 1960s or the battleship/dreadnought race of the 1900s. Yet even though it is not even clear exactly what these offensive capabilities entail, there is little disagreement that a number of nations are increasingly seeking them, and that the overall level of destructive cyber attacks is rising. A 2016 study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) estimated that at least 30 nations were actively pursuing offensive cyber capabilities, a number that has likely continued to increase year on year as the number of cyber incidents continues to rise. Footnote 24\nMuch like the United States after 2013, many nations have seen a significant increase in malicious behaviour in cyberspace. The Council on Foreign Relations has reported that, with two notable dips in 2012 and 2016, cyber-espionage activity worldwide increased tenfold from 2009 to 2019. Footnote 25 Much of the damage caused by recent cyber incidents such as the WannaCry and NotPetya ransomware attacks, as well as routing and kinetic-equivalent attacks on media and industry, was concentrated outside of the United States. Paired with a significant increase in psychological, information-warfare activities, this has prompted many of the hardest-hit nations (including Australia, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, among others) to make significant adjustments to their cyber postures, in particular by building offensive capabilities. At the same time, anecdotal information suggests that not even these comparatively advanced nations have fully understood what these new cyber capabilities are actually intended to do – if they are intended to focus on ‘strategic strike’ (for instance against critical infrastructure), ‘battlefield cyber’ (acting as a sort of electronic warfare) or online covert action. Footnote 26 This relative confusion about mission parameters will only be accentuated by the new CYBERCOM vision.\nEarly US signalling in response to the Cartwright Conjecture may have intended to go beyond emphasising American strength in online covert action to illustrate the country's ability to conduct a 'global strike' of overwhelming force in wartime – in essence, framing cyber as a strategic capability, a kind of digital weapon of mass destruction. CYBERCOM's intent differs, however, from the low-level silent professionalism of those engaged in strategic deterrence or the targeted focus of tailored access operations in the intelligence world. The role model for persistent engagement is not strategic command or the intelligence community, but rather special-operations command, whose mission has been to counter the adversary all the time, everywhere.\nGeneral Nakasone has stated that, 'unlike the nuclear realm, where our strategic advantage or power comes from possessing a capability or weapons system, in cyberspace it's the use of cyber capabilities that is strategically consequential'. Footnote 27 Not only does this remark suggest that the United States must use offensive capabilities visibly, but it also implies that other nations have a clear interest in doing so as well. Yet encouraging a permissive norm that implicitly\nfavours cyber aggression as a tool of peacetime statecraft is likely only to expand the already murky grey area of modern conflict, and the difference between covert action and military activity. Footnote 28 A number of significant adverse effects can be expected among a range of countries – US allies and friends, neutrals and US adversaries alike – which are unlikely to be in the US interest.\nFirst-order effects: ‘out of band’ and ‘diagonal’ retaliation Jason Healey and Neil Jenkins have argued that the impact of the new persistent-engagement strategy could be assessed by looking at the number of cyber attacks against the US. A decline in attacks would indicate that the strategy was effective, while an increase would suggest it was ineffective or counterproductive. Footnote 29 This approach seems too simplistic for at least two reasons. Firstly, US adversaries may simply retaliate with non-cyber means, drawing on the example the US has already set. One of the most successful acts of US cyber deterrence was the use of Department of Justice indictments against specific foreign cyber actors. Following the indictment of five Chinese hackers associated with the People's Liberation Army in 2015, a landmark deal was reached between then-president Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping that resulted in a significant decline – by up to 90%, according to a report by the security company FireEye Footnote 30 – in Chinese-attributed intellectual-property theft. Other indictments against Russian and Iranian hackers have followed. US adversaries may seek to devise their own ‘out of band’ responses to US cyber activity, perhaps by drawing on the copious amount of leaked materials on offensive US cyber capabilities now in the public domain. Alternatively, they may respond with more ‘conventional’ means, for instance by increasing their support for the non-US side in adversarial situations such as trade conflicts, maritime disputes and weapons proliferation.\nUS adversaries might also respond ‘diagonally’ by responding with cyber-enabled means that defy the simple characterisation of ‘cyber attack’. The kind of social-media activity associated with Russia’s information-warfare campaign against the United States is but one example of this approach. Other cyber means could potentially be deployed in an even more covert manner, making attribution difficult even with the deployment of the United States’ full range of intelligence-collection measures.\nThe recent spate of cyber-crime attacks directed against state and local governments across the United States may be another example of a diagonal approach to cyber retaliation. From January to July 2019, more than 55 state and local governments in the US were hit by ransomware attacks. Footnote 31 Although there had been no public attribution of these activities to foreign actors by the time this article went to press, some of them used a stolen US cyber exploit, dubbed ‘EternalBlue’. This exploit had been posted for sale by a group calling itself ‘Shadow Brokers’, which some have speculated may be a front for Russian intelligence actors. Footnote 32 When cyber criminals did not immediately respond to the possibilities inherent in this new exploit, the WannaCry and NotPetya campaigns were launched, drawing attention not just to the possibilities\nof EternalBlue, but also to the efficacy of ransomware attacks themselves. Even if the current spate of cyber attacks against state and local governments in the US was not directed by a foreign adversary, it would be relatively easy for governments to encourage such activity in the future, thus inflicting real pain on targets and demonstrating the ability of national cyber defenders to respond to provocations.\nThe underlying enabling factor for this scenario is the poor state of basic national cyber security across the United States. A 2019 report by the US Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that of the 3,000 cybersecurity recommendations that have been made to federal agencies since 2010, more than 1,000 had yet to be implemented. Footnote  $^{33}$  These vulnerabilities also extend to the DoD's own basic war-fighting capabilities. According to a GAO report from 2018, 'almost all the weapons that the DOD tested between 2012 and 2017, including the F-35 jet and missile systems, have \"mission critical\" cyber vulnerabilities and can be \"easily hacked\" using \"relatively simple tools and techniques\". Footnote  $^{34}$  As poor as federal cyber-security efforts are, the situation at the state and local levels is significantly worse: a 2019 survey indicated that there remains a large difference between state and federal cyber-security capabilities. Footnote  $^{35}$  The state and local agencies polled said they had high confidence in their ability to 'prevent' a cyber attack in only  $19\\%$  of cases (compared to  $41\\%$  of federal agencies), and only  $28\\%$  of those canvassed said they would be able to 'recover' (versus  $55\\%$  of federal agencies). The nation's privately held critical infrastructure is more difficult to assess, but is largely considered to be more capable, and the United States' overall cyber-security stance tends to be ranked highly by more politically minded ratings – the International Telecommunications Union, for example, ranked the US overall at number two worldwide. Footnote  $^{36}$  More technical ratings, however, like that of the National Cyber Security Index, give the US a more middling assessment – placing it, for instance, in thirteenth place worldwide. Footnote  $^{37}$  The only good news, if it can be called that, to emerge from these findings is that the poor state of US national cyber security is mirrored by that of Russia and China.",
    "# Second-order effects: emerging cyber powers and their strategic dilemma": "A major reason for the vulnerable state of US cyber security has to do with scale – large nations have inherently more attack surface to cover, and the US easily has the greatest attack surface of them all. Footnote  $^{38}$  However, the opposite is therefore also true – smaller nations on balance have a much easier task in building national cyber security, and this has significant repercussions for how they play their own game of strategic deterrence. Yet the asymmetric strength of small players has been largely overlooked in most conventional analyses of cyber powers.\nSmaller nations often benefit from increased cooperation between the civilian and military, and state and non-state sectors, and generally face fewer challenges in coordinating emergency measures. Some even have the ability to disconnect from the global internet if necessary. Footnote 39 Smaller countries may also benefit from a more stringent legal and regulatory framework that requires a minimum level of cyber defence, not just from various levels of government but also from the private sector. For nations like, say, the Netherlands, the task of coordinating with 100–300 critical-infrastructure providers, and a comparable number of local and federal government networks, is a completely different task than dealing with many tens of thousands of civilian assets and non-military governmental networks, as in the United States. Footnote 40 A smaller attack surface means fewer critical-infrastructure providers that need to be communicated with, fewer government agency networks that need to be hardened and less scope for friction in a crisis. Essentially, this means that smaller advanced cyber nations have an inherent advantage in pursuing national cyber security compared with very large nations such as the United States, or indeed Russia and China. All things considered, a number of smaller nations might actually do quite well in a force-on-force conflict with a major cyber power. The ability of many smaller nations to potentially absorb cyber blows is no less significant in a wartime scenario than advantageous defensive geography would be in a ground operation. Yet the ‘high ground’ advantage of smaller states in presenting a smaller attack surface in the cyber domain may not have been adequately factored into analysts’ calculations, including those that informed the drafting of persistent engagement. As a corollary to this, smaller nations’ ability to conduct deterrence by punishment – a strategy that persistent engagement has heavily incentivised them to pursue – is not well understood.\nThe nature of the offensive cyber capabilities currently being developed by the ‘next 30’ nations examined in the 2016 CSIS study may not be clear, but there is no reason to believe that they relate only to cyber-crime-style scenarios, such as denial-of-service or even ransomware attacks. Instead, it should be assumed that these cyber powers can ‘turn the lights off’ – that is, launch a strategic strike on the critical infrastructure of an enemy. While it is much easier to temporarily shut down a nation’s infrastructure networks than to damage them beyond repair, ‘temporary’ disruptions can still impose catastrophic costs on a nation’s economy and limit its ability to maintain domestic order. The destructive potential of the next 30 may be orders of magnitude less than that of the United States or a near-peer cyber power, but some of these countries still possess a minimal deterrence capability that, much like the small nuclear arsenals of France, the UK and China, could inflict an unacceptable level of retaliatory punishment on a potential aggressor, no matter their overwhelming technical superiority. While detractors may say that mere cyber attacks should not be compared to the horror of a nuclear exchange, the effects of weeks-long black-outs, the destruction of financial information and the breakdown of most forms of communication should not be underestimated. The next-30 cyber nations may therefore possess something which was previously unavailable to them: not just a strategic-weapons capability – a\nvirtual strike force no less potent than a wing of bombers or ballistic missiles – but also a defensive advantage towards larger foes.\nThe sheer number of nations that may be able to reciprocally threaten a major power could be historically unprecedented. There was briefly a time, in the late 1950s, when it seemed possible that dozens of nations would eventually deploy nuclear weapons; even small countries like Switzerland deliberated the possibility of creating their own nuclear deterrent. Footnote 41 In the end, many of these opted to form alliances with existing nuclear powers instead. Today, persistent engagement may be changing the way such nations provide for their own security. Instead of depending on the protective umbrella of their friends, many now have their own budding deterrence-by-punishment capability in the cyber domain, in addition to having become better able to resist the effects of a strategic cyber strike against themselves. Some are also being incentivised by persistent engagement not only to develop offensive capabilities, but to use them as well. After all, persistent engagement postulates that cyber conflict is not only to be welcomed, but to be engaged in so as to be 'understood'. Any country not carrying out cyber attacks would, like those that did not test nuclear bombs, be excluded from the main table and left without a voice. This is seen as a perverse incentive by those who advocate for non-proliferation and argue that the increased distribution of destructive weapons increases the likelihood not only that one will be used, but that all will be used.",
    "# Third-order effects: weaponising information and changing the internet": "In February 2019, it was reported that some unspecified action had been taken by CYBERCOM in November 2018 against the Internet Research Agency, a notorious social-media 'troll factory' headquartered in St Petersburg. The New York Times said that the organisation had been shut down 'for a number of days' as part of an effort to secure the US midterm elections. Footnote 42 Unlike many other parts of the Russian security apparatus, the Internet Research Agency does not seem to engage in 'hacking' – that is, it does not launch its own intrusions. Rather, it is widely accepted that the agency engages only in spreading disinformation, Footnote 43 something that may not even be illegal under international law. CYBERCOM's action against it may well have fallen beneath the 'use of force' or 'armed attack' threshold (a distinction not usually made in the United States anyway), but its public nature implies an acceptance of kinetic-effect cyber attacks – it sent the message that it is okay to hack what you consider 'fake news'.\nIf the targeting of actors that have only a propaganda function (rather than being directly responsible for cyber attacks) becomes normalised, then more conventional media organisations, as well as civil-society and non-governmental organisations, may become admissible targets. Russia might conclude, for example, that foreign support for domestic democracy activists falls\nunder the heading of ‘information and psychological actions aimed at undermining … the homeland’, to borrow language from the 2016 Russian Information Security Doctrine. Footnote 44 Likewise, Beijing might find Chinese-language translations of the New York Times provocative. Footnote 45 International disputes may emerge about ‘bad content’, such as propaganda, social-media campaigns and unkind opinion pieces. Footnote 46 In this way, persistent engagement might encourage the very risk that it was intended to alleviate: the weaponisation of information.\nIn June 2019, the New York Times reported that, at the same time the US was targeting the Information Research Agency, it was also deploying offensive cyber capabilities within the Russian power grid. Footnote 47 A similar intrusion of US power grids – using a malware package known as BlackEnergy – was noticed in 2011 and publicly reported on soon after. A version of BlackEnergy was also used in December 2015 to cause a large-scale blackout in western Ukraine. Footnote 48 These two intrusions, both of them attributed to Russia, ultimately drew attention to themselves, even though there was a blackout only in the 2015 action. In June 2019, however, the United States raised the ante. Rather than ‘allowing’ their own pre-deployment operation to be discovered and reported on by Russian actors, the Americans reported it themselves, stating that since 2018 US malware had been present in the Russian power grid in order to effect a kinetic-equivalent strike if necessary. The intent of this disclosure was likely to make it clear to the Russians that, if necessary, the US was ready to accept a level of ‘mutually assured disruption’. At least as important was the message that CYBERCOM had not abandoned its strategic-warfare role. Yet the United States’ public declaration of its willingness to significantly violate the sovereignty of an adversary in peacetime (something that would not happen when, say, fielding ballistic missiles) seems to present a novel situation for international law. It also provided strong reinforcement for the Russian and Chinese strategic narrative that politics is the extension of warfare, a reversal of Karl von Clausewitz’s famous definition of warfare as an extension of politics. By effectively declaring that the United States considered the pre-deployment of cyber weapons within an adversary’s critical infrastructure as being permissible (rather than simply being ‘caught in the act’, as the Russians were), CYBERCOM took a big step away from the established international legal order that the United States has helped to create. It also implicitly accepted a norm of mutual hostage-taking or ‘mutually assured debilitation’, a huge strategic concession that seems to imply US acceptance of a level of parity with adversaries where previously it could insist on hegemony. Moreover, it implied that CYBERCOM, if not the entire US government, has accepted the core Marxist–Leninist argument that ‘peacetime’ and ‘wartime’ are artificial distinctions.\nIt is clear that persistent engagement poses several direct challenges to the existing international order. For instance, not only does it mandate the forward- or pre-deployment of cyber weapons inside the networks of other countries before a dispute has crossed the threshold of armed conflict, it also suggests that operations beneath this threshold can be justified for any number of\nreasons, including as countermeasures against relatively ‘soft’ disinformation and propaganda activity. There is no reason to suppose that this way of thinking will be confined to the United States – any number of the next-30 cyber powers could also embrace these principles.\nPersistent engagement may also challenge the management, and therefore the shape and form, of the global internet as we know it. Depictions of cyberspace as increasingly violent will accelerate a growing trend to describe the management of the internet in security-related terms. This has been an abiding diplomatic objective of a sizeable faction of states, led by Russia and China, for many years – arguably since 1998. Footnote ⁴⁹ These states have proposed an International Code of Conduct for Information Security ‘, Footnote ⁵⁰ the latest version of which was endorsed by the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation in 2016. The greatest risk the code’s supporters see to their own cyber security is not so much infrastructure-targeting cyber attacks, but rather information warfare intended to achieve the despised outcome of ‘regime change’. For these cyber powers, encouraging diplomatic discussion on ‘countering foreign political influence’ is a key objective.\nTo further this goal, backers of the Code of Conduct have challenged the way the global internet is run. To date, the internet has been managed by a regime comprising multiple government, civil-society and private-sector actors. Footnote ⁵¹ This is known as the multi-stakeholder approach to internet governance, and it has proven to be remarkably resilient, as well as beneficial for the internet’s growth. Yet Code of Conduct supporters wish to replace this multi-stakeholder model with an intergovernmental one. They also wish to ‘securitise’ cyberspace by shifting norms of surveillance, data protection and human rights online, a desire that has been expressed by some Western governments too. In May 2015, Theresa May, then prime minister of the UK, announced that the British government would be taking a much more restrictive approach to user behaviour in cyberspace and to internet freedoms in general in response to a number of terrorist incidents. May was fiercely criticised when she refused to counter accusations that these amounted to Chinese-style internet restrictions. Footnote ⁵²\nAlready, some governments have misused critical internet infrastructure to facilitate their own espionage activity, such as in the 2019 attacks attributed to Iranian actors on the Domain Name System (sometimes described as the ‘telephone book’ of the internet). Footnote ⁵³ There is also interest in connecting the management of the Domain Name System to international efforts intended to counter cyber crime, including the dissemination of ‘bad content’, as variously defined. In this sense, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s argument that changing the management of internet resources is needed to halt the rise in cyber conflict may be gaining ground.\nIf the liberal-democratic argument that the multi-stakeholder model has worked well and served as an effective firebreak against authoritarian desires to control the internet is rejected, then all\nusers – including those in liberal democracies – will be faced with a very different information environment than that of the previous 20 years. In this new environment, all information is likely to be treated as a potential weapon, and thus subject to government intervention and state negotiations. By effectively encouraging cyber conflict, the persistent-engagement vision greatly increases the appeal of the argument that a much stronger government role in achieving ‘cyber peace’ is needed, and that ultimately, this perilous domain needs an intergovernmental model to manage it.\n*\n*\nPersistent engagement may be driving unwanted effects in a number of ways, but the mixed signalling and over-communication the strategy encourages seem particularly at fault. Publicly advocating in favour of the use of offensive cyber means can only be detrimental to international peace and security, and produce an overall increase in cyber conflict. Emerging cyber nations will be incentivised not only to develop offensive cyber capabilities but also to use them – which may lead to the discovery that they can in fact compete with great powers. At the same time, hallowed principles of international order and internet governance may be undermined, to the benefit of countries whose interests may run counter to those of the United States and liberal democracies everywhere.\nA reconsideration of the basic premises of persistent engagement may show that past US deterrence policy was actually effective – as in the case of the US–China deal that produced a decline in Chinese intellectual-property theft. It may also show that the current high level of cyber aggression has resulted from foreign perceptions of US strength, not US weakness. Instead of publicly reinforcing its dominant posture and conflating transparency with propaganda, the United States might be better served by walking more softly in cyberspace even as it retains a big stick.\nAdopting a policy of genuine transparency would have a much-needed stabilising effect by limiting the threat of inadvertent escalation or loss of escalation control. Such a policy should feature multilevel discussions, with varying levels of confidentiality, about strategic cyber capabilities and their command and control, alongside ongoing international discussions on norms of restraint. Footnote 54 The obvious benefits of this approach explain why the United States' closest allies and partners have almost unanimously advocated for it. Any covert cyber activities that impair these discussions, rather than advancing them, should remain just that - covert. Otherwise, mixing signals in the cyber domain is a recipe for serious adverse effects that threaten to undermine the security not just of the United States, but of all liberal democracies and of the internet itself.",

It builds on a number of questionable assumptions about the international history and perception of cyber conflict, the role and strategic direction of information warfare, and the general dynamics of deterrence. Ultimately, it justifies a much more aggressive CYBERCOM mission that ignores the potential for unwanted effects that could prove to be highly destabilising in an already volatile international security environment. Overall, persistent engagement is a very high-risk approach to developing cyber deterrence that is likely to not only trigger new forms of retaliation but also accelerate the already rapid international proliferation of offensive cyber capabilities. In the worst-case scenario, it may even pose a risk to the internet as we know it. Some of the risks associated with the concept could, however, be partially alleviated by reducing its reliance on mixed signals and an excess of public communication.\n# Persistent engagement: theory and criticism\nThe promotion of CYBERCOM to a fully independent combat command in 2018 marked the emancipation of US military cyber capabilities from the intelligence world. While some observers, including the present author, thought that this development might help foster much-needed transparency on cyber capabilities, recent developments have taken a darker turn. Footnote  $^{1}$  Building on an already controversial doctrine of 'active defense in cyberspace', the US Department of Defense (DoD) put forward a new public cyber strategy in 2018 that emphasised the concept of 'defend forward'. Footnote  $^{2}$  According to Jeff Kosseff of the United States Naval Academy, defending forward has three basic components: positioning, warning and influencing. Footnote  $^{3}$  CYBERCOM's vision of persistent engagement, which represents the implementation of the DoD strategy, encompasses all three activities, and while each can be criticised as potentially destabilising to international security, the operation-alisation of the 'influencing' component may be particularly so.\nCYBERCOM's General Paul Nakasone gave an indication of what was to come when, in his Senate confirmation hearings in March 2018, he was asked about deterring Russian and Chinese cyber attacks. 'They do not think that much will happen to them', he responded. 'They do not\nfear us.' He went on to say that, 'As cyberspace develops, the longer that we have inactivity, the longer our adversaries are able to establish their own norms – and I think that is very, very important that we realize that.' Footnote 4 This view was reflected in the DoD cyber strategy of defend forward, leveraging the already well-established 'persistent presence' of CYBERCOM in adversaries' networks into an actual operational mandate to disrupt any emerging attacks and thus to 'persistently engage'. Footnote 5 To accomplish this, Nakasone has indicated that CYBERCOM will not be a 'response force' anymore, but rather a force that engages in operations 'below the level of armed attack' on a running basis. Footnote 6\nOverall, CYBERCOM is being positioned less as a strategic-weapons carrier and a key element of an overall strategic-deterrence capability, and more as a special-operations command. The risk of getting these roles entangled is evident with the reversal of traditional signalling practices, with more talk about usually non-public, covert-action-type roles, and less about potential strategic (that is, 'above the threshold of armed attack') capabilities to be used in wartime. The evolving vision of persistent engagement has largely been communicated through a series of articles and press releases, rather than through official publications and doctrines. Footnote 7 This is in keeping with the strategy's dependence on public signals to communicate intent to adversaries. While a discussion of strategic-warfare capabilities would increase transparency and probably increase stability, the sudden emphasis on public discussion of low-level, peacetime cyber attacks is doing the opposite. As decades of experience with arms control have shown, transparency on strategic weapons helps reduce the scope for misunderstandings, provides for clarity of intent, and helps establish norms of restraint and communication. But public communication of offensive covert action – revealing to the public details of secret attacks conducted against an adversary – generally does the reverse, both fostering norms of aggression and underlining the lack of communication. What is true of the conventional-arms world is doubly so in cyberspace, the eponymous information domain where kinetic cyber warfare (officially 'information operations') has an uneasy but undoubted symbiosis with its non-kinetic cousin, 'information warfare', with its emphasis on propaganda, disinformation and covert influencing. As Nakasone has said, in cyberspace the principle danger is the weaponisation of information. Footnote 8 Unfortunately, the signalling mandated by persistent engagement has extended to over-communication in public – itself an example of weaponised information that diminishes the benefits of the defend-forward strategy, lends legitimacy to information-warfare operations as a form of conflict and simultaneously encourages an already accelerating cyber arms race.\nThe empirical justification of CYBERCOM's new offensive vision has been shaky from the start. The academic underpinnings of persistent engagement were presented in a 2017 article by Richard Harknett and Michael Fischerkeller, which was released just as the former was concluding his stint as CYBERCOM's first resident scholar. Footnote 9 The very title of the article, 'Deterrence Is Not a Credible Strategy for Cyberspace', indicates that the authors thought\nit was possible (and desirable) to frame the strategy as one of ‘non-deterrence’. Their analysis rests on the belief that, as part of an ‘agreed competition’ concept, it would be possible to completely contain cyber conflict within its own domain. This would be non-escalatory due to the invisible hand of ‘tacit bargaining’, through which adversaries would feel out the borders of allowable conflict and come to a stable conflict scenario. According to this logic, not only is there less chance of inadvertent escalation over the threshold of armed conflict when engaging in the cyber domain, but this kind of engagement would also avoid retaliation in other domains, such as diplomacy and trade, or even in physical conflict zones, such as Syria and the Persian Gulf. The authors also seem to suggest that cyber could effectively function as a ‘pressure valve’ for international tensions, concentrating the inevitable tit for tat (the tacit bargaining) of international security to a more controllable and less dangerous environment. Footnote 10\nThe many suppositions of Harknett and Fischerkeller’s article have been roundly criticised. Footnote 11 Although the idea of agreed competition is presented as deriving from Herman Kahn’s idea of ‘agreed battle’, the article never answers the basic question of why an adversary would allow itself to be constrained in a way that clearly favours the United States. Cyber experts Brandon Valeriano and Benjamin Jensen have drawn on a comprehensive historical dataset of cyber operations to argue instead that such operations on their own seldom produce concessions. Normally, they need to be accompanied by other actions, such as diplomatic overtures, to work – an approach which the authors contend the US has employed to great effect in the past, despite Nakasone’s assessment that cyber deterrence has failed. Footnote 12 Overall, few observers would agree that outcomes in cyberspace are as easy to predict as advocates of persistent engagement seem to believe. On the contrary, the basic assumption of diplomacy over at least the last decade is that cyberspace is the domain most prone to misinterpretation and miscalculation. Footnote 13 Finally, there is no clear theory of victory in persistent engagement and no strategic endgame, only the purpose of creating operational advantages in cyberspace. There is no agreement as to what the basic strategic game is, or what constitutes its winning and losing factors.\nMore troublingly, persistent engagement does not articulate a sound reasoning as to why any escalation in cyberspace would produce good outcomes for the United States. Tom Bossert, US President Donald Trump’s first homeland security advisor, has explicitly questioned parts of the strategy. In a June 2018 Wired article, he is quoted as saying, ‘I want to make sure we don’t end up in an escalatory cyber exchange where we lose more than they do’, and as pointing out that ‘in many respects the US economy and infrastructure is far more reliant on digitization and automation than Russia’s, giving the Kremlin an inherent advantage in any future no-holdsbarred cyberwar. He paraphrases former US secretary of defense Ash Carter: “If you’re doused in gasoline, don’t start a match-throwing contest.”’ Footnote 14\nThe entire rationale for the strategy, as outlined by Nakasone himself, relies on a version of cyber history that not all observers will agree with. For instance, Nakasone has said that the US mostly faced an intelligence-gathering threat before 2013, which then escalated into denial-based attacks before moving towards destructive attacks (presumably including information-warfare attacks in 2016) and preparations for armed conflict. Footnote 15 Overlooked by this narrative is any consideration of how the adversary – or even many US friends and allies – would see the causality of these developments. In an alternative narrative, US dominance in persistent-presence espionage was publicly revealed through the intelligence disclosures of 2013, at the same time as the first real cyber weapon, Stuxnet, was attributed to the United States. Among allies in Europe, such as Germany, these revelations were often badly received, and the reaction among neutrals, such as Brazil, was even more negative. Not many European observers would agree with the assessment of persistent engagement's supporters that the US has been 'too passive' in cyberspace. In some cases, a different conclusion can be drawn: that cyber attacks have been responses to US activity. Nakasone has cited Iranian cyber aggression to justify persistent engagement, but Iranian activities can also be framed as responses to US cyber operations, such as Stuxnet and Flame. Footnote 16 The Shamoon malware that Iran used to target Saudi Arabia reused components of the US-attributed Flame malware – effectively directing a US cyber weapon back at one of its allies. Footnote 17 Seen from this perspective, at least some of the increase in cyber-related activity directed against the United States has been a direct result of public disclosures of the advanced state of US cyber capabilities and operations. Instead of producing a deterrent effect, these disclosures seem to have contributed to an increase in cyber tensions. This does not bode well for the principle of persistent engagement as currently expressed.\nBoth the academic theory and the policy statements surrounding persistent engagement have a strained relationship with the overall concept of deterrence, as well as with those of balance of power, proliferation and arms control. Before 2016, modern US deterrence followed a logic that is often expressed as a ladder, from entanglement, norms and resilience to punishment. Footnote 18 Purists may argue that only the last two – the ability to absorb an attack, and the ability to conduct an attack – represent classic deterrence. Footnote 19 Contending that the US strategy of 'denial' or 'resilience' has clearly failed in recent years, they have turned to an existing solution for the problem and radically reinterpreted it. In 2011, the nascent weakness in US cyber-deterrence policy – insofar as this had been formally expressed – had already been identified as a lack of 'credibility' or, in technical terms, a seeming inability to communicate the strength of US cyber capabilities in order to dissuade an adversary. It was the same conundrum made famous by Dr. Strangelove – how can one expect a deterrent effect if the very instrument of deterrence is a secret? In cyber terms, the effect was dubbed the 'Cartwright Conjecture' by Jason Healey after General James Cartwright, the former head of Strategic Command who, in 2011, was already complaining that 'we've got to talk about our offensive capabilities and train to them; to make\nthem credible ... You can't have something that's a secret be a deterrent. Because if you don't know it's there, it doesn't scare you.' Footnote 20 This was by no means an isolated message. Footnote 21 At that time, the strategic capability being communicated was one of overwhelming US intelligence-gathering capabilities.\nWithin the US government, intelligence-gathering capabilities have resolutely been portrayed as neutral, or even defensive, in nature. Yet many allies, as well as private-sector actors within the US itself, do not share this view. A number of foreign leaders – not only of neutral countries, but of friends and allies of the US – have concluded that the United States' ability to maintain a persistent presence on all kinds of networks is tantamount to being able to strike them at will. Never mind that it takes time to prepare complicated strikes across highly segmented networks, or that it can be difficult for CYBERCOM to get campaigns approved through the interagency process – these are problems only the attacker can see. From a defender's point of view, it can be very difficult to differentiate between advanced espionage attempts and imminent acts of war – including by the United States. When US dominance in persistent presence became publicly apparent after 2013, it was only natural that a number of nations – some of them US adversaries, but not all – feared that it would not be long before the US took the simple step from persistent presence to persistent engagement. Although major US initiatives such as the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (launched in 2009 with an estimated budget of $40 billion over five years) were cast as being 'defensive' in nature, the programmes could clearly serve as the foundation for offensive cyber activity: the same sensors and implants intended to provide warning of hostile cyber activity could easily be repurposed for offensive activity. This being the case, and given the historical record of presumed US cyber operations, Nakasone's claims in his 2017 Senate confirmation hearing that the United States has been a passive actor in cyberspace seems disingenuous, at best.\nThe significant increase in all forms of offensive cyber behaviour against the US after 2013 has been described as a deterrence failure. Yet advocates of persistent engagement have been unable to explain why deterrence failed, or to express whether the failure was complete or only partial. There is at least some evidence to suggest that the escalation was due to perceived US strength in cyber, not weakness. Following the work of Valeriano and Jensen, whose dataset indicates that responses to cyber attacks have historically been proportional and not intentionally escalatory, Footnote 22 this could imply that some of the increased activity publicly reported since 2013 may in fact have been responses by US adversaries – responses that have been recalibrated to take into account a much more dominant US position in cyberspace than these adversaries had been aware of.\nEither way, friendly and less friendly nations alike have rushed to compete in an escalating cyber arms race, one which the US may have played a decisive role in accelerating even before the publication of persistent engagement. Footnote 23 The very term 'cyber arms race', while not\nparticularly contentious in itself, is difficult to fully circumscribe. The phenomenon bears little resemblance to historic arms races and cannot be quantified by numbers of weapons systems, as was possible during the missile-gap race of the 1960s or the battleship/dreadnought race of the 1900s. Yet even though it is not even clear exactly what these offensive capabilities entail, there is little disagreement that a number of nations are increasingly seeking them, and that the overall level of destructive cyber attacks is rising. A 2016 study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) estimated that at least 30 nations were actively pursuing offensive cyber capabilities, a number that has likely continued to increase year on year as the number of cyber incidents continues to rise. Footnote 24\nMuch like the United States after 2013, many nations have seen a significant increase in malicious behaviour in cyberspace. The Council on Foreign Relations has reported that, with two notable dips in 2012 and 2016, cyber-espionage activity worldwide increased tenfold from 2009 to 2019. Footnote 25 Much of the damage caused by recent cyber incidents such as the WannaCry and NotPetya ransomware attacks, as well as routing and kinetic-equivalent attacks on media and industry, was concentrated outside of the United States. Paired with a significant increase in psychological, information-warfare activities, this has prompted many of the hardest-hit nations (including Australia, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, among others) to make significant adjustments to their cyber postures, in particular by building offensive capabilities. At the same time, anecdotal information suggests that not even these comparatively advanced nations have fully understood what these new cyber capabilities are actually intended to do – if they are intended to focus on ‘strategic strike’ (for instance against critical infrastructure), ‘battlefield cyber’ (acting as a sort of electronic warfare) or online covert action. Footnote 26 This relative confusion about mission parameters will only be accentuated by the new CYBERCOM vision.\nEarly US signalling in response to the Cartwright Conjecture may have intended to go beyond emphasising American strength in online covert action to illustrate the country's ability to conduct a 'global strike' of overwhelming force in wartime – in essence, framing cyber as a strategic capability, a kind of digital weapon of mass destruction. CYBERCOM's intent differs, however, from the low-level silent professionalism of those engaged in strategic deterrence or the targeted focus of tailored access operations in the intelligence world. The role model for persistent engagement is not strategic command or the intelligence community, but rather special-operations command, whose mission has been to counter the adversary all the time, everywhere.\nGeneral Nakasone has stated that, 'unlike the nuclear realm, where our strategic advantage or power comes from possessing a capability or weapons system, in cyberspace it's the use of cyber capabilities that is strategically consequential'. Footnote 27 Not only does this remark suggest that the United States must use offensive capabilities visibly, but it also implies that other nations have a clear interest in doing so as well. Yet encouraging a permissive norm that implicitly\nfavours cyber aggression as a tool of peacetime statecraft is likely only to expand the already murky grey area of modern conflict, and the difference between covert action and military activity. Footnote 28 A number of significant adverse effects can be expected among a range of countries – US allies and friends, neutrals and US adversaries alike – which are unlikely to be in the US interest.\nFirst-order effects: ‘out of band’ and ‘diagonal’ retaliation Jason Healey and Neil Jenkins have argued that the impact of the new persistent-engagement strategy could be assessed by looking at the number of cyber attacks against the US. A decline in attacks would indicate that the strategy was effective, while an increase would suggest it was ineffective or counterproductive. Footnote 29 This approach seems too simplistic for at least two reasons. Firstly, US adversaries may simply retaliate with non-cyber means, drawing on the example the US has already set. One of the most successful acts of US cyber deterrence was the use of Department of Justice indictments against specific foreign cyber actors. Following the indictment of five Chinese hackers associated with the People's Liberation Army in 2015, a landmark deal was reached between then-president Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping that resulted in a significant decline – by up to 90%, according to a report by the security company FireEye Footnote 30 – in Chinese-attributed intellectual-property theft. Other indictments against Russian and Iranian hackers have followed. US adversaries may seek to devise their own ‘out of band’ responses to US cyber activity, perhaps by drawing on the copious amount of leaked materials on offensive US cyber capabilities now in the public domain. Alternatively, they may respond with more ‘conventional’ means, for instance by increasing their support for the non-US side in adversarial situations such as trade conflicts, maritime disputes and weapons proliferation.\nUS adversaries might also respond ‘diagonally’ by responding with cyber-enabled means that defy the simple characterisation of ‘cyber attack’. The kind of social-media activity associated with Russia’s information-warfare campaign against the United States is but one example of this approach. Other cyber means could potentially be deployed in an even more covert manner, making attribution difficult even with the deployment of the United States’ full range of intelligence-collection measures.\nThe recent spate of cyber-crime attacks directed against state and local governments across the United States may be another example of a diagonal approach to cyber retaliation. From January to July 2019, more than 55 state and local governments in the US were hit by ransomware attacks. Footnote 31 Although there had been no public attribution of these activities to foreign actors by the time this article went to press, some of them used a stolen US cyber exploit, dubbed ‘EternalBlue’. This exploit had been posted for sale by a group calling itself ‘Shadow Brokers’, which some have speculated may be a front for Russian intelligence actors. Footnote 32 When cyber criminals did not immediately respond to the possibilities inherent in this new exploit, the WannaCry and NotPetya campaigns were launched, drawing attention not just to the possibilities\nof EternalBlue, but also to the efficacy of ransomware attacks themselves. Even if the current spate of cyber attacks against state and local governments in the US was not directed by a foreign adversary, it would be relatively easy for governments to encourage such activity in the future, thus inflicting real pain on targets and demonstrating the ability of national cyber defenders to respond to provocations.\nThe underlying enabling factor for this scenario is the poor state of basic national cyber security across the United States. A 2019 report by the US Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that of the 3,000 cybersecurity recommendations that have been made to federal agencies since 2010, more than 1,000 had yet to be implemented. Footnote  $^{33}$  These vulnerabilities also extend to the DoD's own basic war-fighting capabilities. According to a GAO report from 2018, 'almost all the weapons that the DOD tested between 2012 and 2017, including the F-35 jet and missile systems, have \"mission critical\" cyber vulnerabilities and can be \"easily hacked\" using \"relatively simple tools and techniques\". Footnote  $^{34}$  As poor as federal cyber-security efforts are, the situation at the state and local levels is significantly worse: a 2019 survey indicated that there remains a large difference between state and federal cyber-security capabilities. Footnote  $^{35}$  The state and local agencies polled said they had high confidence in their ability to 'prevent' a cyber attack in only  $19\\%$  of cases (compared to  $41\\%$  of federal agencies), and only  $28\\%$  of those canvassed said they would be able to 'recover' (versus  $55\\%$  of federal agencies). The nation's privately held critical infrastructure is more difficult to assess, but is largely considered to be more capable, and the United States' overall cyber-security stance tends to be ranked highly by more politically minded ratings – the International Telecommunications Union, for example, ranked the US overall at number two worldwide. Footnote  $^{36}$  More technical ratings, however, like that of the National Cyber Security Index, give the US a more middling assessment – placing it, for instance, in thirteenth place worldwide. Footnote  $^{37}$  The only good news, if it can be called that, to emerge from these findings is that the poor state of US national cyber security is mirrored by that of Russia and China.\n# Second-order effects: emerging cyber powers and their strategic dilemma\nA major reason for the vulnerable state of US cyber security has to do with scale – large nations have inherently more attack surface to cover, and the US easily has the greatest attack surface of them all. Footnote  $^{38}$  However, the opposite is therefore also true – smaller nations on balance have a much easier task in building national cyber security, and this has significant repercussions for how they play their own game of strategic deterrence. Yet the asymmetric strength of small players has been largely overlooked in most conventional analyses of cyber powers.\nSmaller nations often benefit from increased cooperation between the civilian and military, and state and non-state sectors, and generally face fewer challenges in coordinating emergency measures. Some even have the ability to disconnect from the global internet if necessary. Footnote 39 Smaller countries may also benefit from a more stringent legal and regulatory framework that requires a minimum level of cyber defence, not just from various levels of government but also from the private sector. For nations like, say, the Netherlands, the task of coordinating with 100–300 critical-infrastructure providers, and a comparable number of local and federal government networks, is a completely different task than dealing with many tens of thousands of civilian assets and non-military governmental networks, as in the United States. Footnote 40 A smaller attack surface means fewer critical-infrastructure providers that need to be communicated with, fewer government agency networks that need to be hardened and less scope for friction in a crisis. Essentially, this means that smaller advanced cyber nations have an inherent advantage in pursuing national cyber security compared with very large nations such as the United States, or indeed Russia and China. All things considered, a number of smaller nations might actually do quite well in a force-on-force conflict with a major cyber power. The ability of many smaller nations to potentially absorb cyber blows is no less significant in a wartime scenario than advantageous defensive geography would be in a ground operation. Yet the ‘high ground’ advantage of smaller states in presenting a smaller attack surface in the cyber domain may not have been adequately factored into analysts’ calculations, including those that informed the drafting of persistent engagement. As a corollary to this, smaller nations’ ability to conduct deterrence by punishment – a strategy that persistent engagement has heavily incentivised them to pursue – is not well understood.\nThe nature of the offensive cyber capabilities currently being developed by the ‘next 30’ nations examined in the 2016 CSIS study may not be clear, but there is no reason to believe that they relate only to cyber-crime-style scenarios, such as denial-of-service or even ransomware attacks. Instead, it should be assumed that these cyber powers can ‘turn the lights off’ – that is, launch a strategic strike on the critical infrastructure of an enemy. While it is much easier to temporarily shut down a nation’s infrastructure networks than to damage them beyond repair, ‘temporary’ disruptions can still impose catastrophic costs on a nation’s economy and limit its ability to maintain domestic order. The destructive potential of the next 30 may be orders of magnitude less than that of the United States or a near-peer cyber power, but some of these countries still possess a minimal deterrence capability that, much like the small nuclear arsenals of France, the UK and China, could inflict an unacceptable level of retaliatory punishment on a potential aggressor, no matter their overwhelming technical superiority. While detractors may say that mere cyber attacks should not be compared to the horror of a nuclear exchange, the effects of weeks-long black-outs, the destruction of financial information and the breakdown of most forms of communication should not be underestimated. The next-30 cyber nations may therefore possess something which was previously unavailable to them: not just a strategic-weapons capability – a\nvirtual strike force no less potent than a wing of bombers or ballistic missiles – but also a defensive advantage towards larger foes.\nThe sheer number of nations that may be able to reciprocally threaten a major power could be historically unprecedented. There was briefly a time, in the late 1950s, when it seemed possible that dozens of nations would eventually deploy nuclear weapons; even small countries like Switzerland deliberated the possibility of creating their own nuclear deterrent. Footnote 41 In the end, many of these opted to form alliances with existing nuclear powers instead. Today, persistent engagement may be changing the way such nations provide for their own security. Instead of depending on the protective umbrella of their friends, many now have their own budding deterrence-by-punishment capability in the cyber domain, in addition to having become better able to resist the effects of a strategic cyber strike against themselves. Some are also being incentivised by persistent engagement not only to develop offensive capabilities, but to use them as well. After all, persistent engagement postulates that cyber conflict is not only to be welcomed, but to be engaged in so as to be 'understood'. Any country not carrying out cyber attacks would, like those that did not test nuclear bombs, be excluded from the main table and left without a voice. This is seen as a perverse incentive by those who advocate for non-proliferation and argue that the increased distribution of destructive weapons increases the likelihood not only that one will be used, but that all will be used.\n# Third-order effects: weaponising information and changing the internet\nIn February 2019, it was reported that some unspecified action had been taken by CYBERCOM in November 2018 against the Internet Research Agency, a notorious social-media 'troll factory' headquartered in St Petersburg. The New York Times said that the organisation had been shut down 'for a number of days' as part of an effort to secure the US midterm elections. Footnote 42 Unlike many other parts of the Russian security apparatus, the Internet Research Agency does not seem to engage in 'hacking' – that is, it does not launch its own intrusions. Rather, it is widely accepted that the agency engages only in spreading disinformation, Footnote 43 something that may not even be illegal under international law. CYBERCOM's action against it may well have fallen beneath the 'use of force' or 'armed attack' threshold (a distinction not usually made in the United States anyway), but its public nature implies an acceptance of kinetic-effect cyber attacks – it sent the message that it is okay to hack what you consider 'fake news'.\nIf the targeting of actors that have only a propaganda function (rather than being directly responsible for cyber attacks) becomes normalised, then more conventional media organisations, as well as civil-society and non-governmental organisations, may become admissible targets. Russia might conclude, for example, that foreign support for domestic democracy activists falls\nunder the heading of ‘information and psychological actions aimed at undermining … the homeland’, to borrow language from the 2016 Russian Information Security Doctrine. Footnote 44 Likewise, Beijing might find Chinese-language translations of the New York Times provocative. Footnote 45 International disputes may emerge about ‘bad content’, such as propaganda, social-media campaigns and unkind opinion pieces. Footnote 46 In this way, persistent engagement might encourage the very risk that it was intended to alleviate: the weaponisation of information.\nIn June 2019, the New York Times reported that, at the same time the US was targeting the Information Research Agency, it was also deploying offensive cyber capabilities within the Russian power grid. Footnote 47 A similar intrusion of US power grids – using a malware package known as BlackEnergy – was noticed in 2011 and publicly reported on soon after. A version of BlackEnergy was also used in December 2015 to cause a large-scale blackout in western Ukraine. Footnote 48 These two intrusions, both of them attributed to Russia, ultimately drew attention to themselves, even though there was a blackout only in the 2015 action. In June 2019, however, the United States raised the ante. Rather than ‘allowing’ their own pre-deployment operation to be discovered and reported on by Russian actors, the Americans reported it themselves, stating that since 2018 US malware had been present in the Russian power grid in order to effect a kinetic-equivalent strike if necessary. The intent of this disclosure was likely to make it clear to the Russians that, if necessary, the US was ready to accept a level of ‘mutually assured disruption’. At least as important was the message that CYBERCOM had not abandoned its strategic-warfare role. Yet the United States’ public declaration of its willingness to significantly violate the sovereignty of an adversary in peacetime (something that would not happen when, say, fielding ballistic missiles) seems to present a novel situation for international law. It also provided strong reinforcement for the Russian and Chinese strategic narrative that politics is the extension of warfare, a reversal of Karl von Clausewitz’s famous definition of warfare as an extension of politics. By effectively declaring that the United States considered the pre-deployment of cyber weapons within an adversary’s critical infrastructure as being permissible (rather than simply being ‘caught in the act’, as the Russians were), CYBERCOM took a big step away from the established international legal order that the United States has helped to create. It also implicitly accepted a norm of mutual hostage-taking or ‘mutually assured debilitation’, a huge strategic concession that seems to imply US acceptance of a level of parity with adversaries where previously it could insist on hegemony. Moreover, it implied that CYBERCOM, if not the entire US government, has accepted the core Marxist–Leninist argument that ‘peacetime’ and ‘wartime’ are artificial distinctions.\nIt is clear that persistent engagement poses several direct challenges to the existing international order. For instance, not only does it mandate the forward- or pre-deployment of cyber weapons inside the networks of other countries before a dispute has crossed the threshold of armed conflict, it also suggests that operations beneath this threshold can be justified for any number of\nreasons, including as countermeasures against relatively ‘soft’ disinformation and propaganda activity. There is no reason to suppose that this way of thinking will be confined to the United States – any number of the next-30 cyber powers could also embrace these principles.\nPersistent engagement may also challenge the management, and therefore the shape and form, of the global internet as we know it. Depictions of cyberspace as increasingly violent will accelerate a growing trend to describe the management of the internet in security-related terms. This has been an abiding diplomatic objective of a sizeable faction of states, led by Russia and China, for many years – arguably since 1998. Footnote ⁴⁹ These states have proposed an International Code of Conduct for Information Security ‘, Footnote ⁵⁰ the latest version of which was endorsed by the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation in 2016. The greatest risk the code’s supporters see to their own cyber security is not so much infrastructure-targeting cyber attacks, but rather information warfare intended to achieve the despised outcome of ‘regime change’. For these cyber powers, encouraging diplomatic discussion on ‘countering foreign political influence’ is a key objective.\nTo further this goal, backers of the Code of Conduct have challenged the way the global internet is run. To date, the internet has been managed by a regime comprising multiple government, civil-society and private-sector actors. Footnote ⁵¹ This is known as the multi-stakeholder approach to internet governance, and it has proven to be remarkably resilient, as well as beneficial for the internet’s growth. Yet Code of Conduct supporters wish to replace this multi-stakeholder model with an intergovernmental one. They also wish to ‘securitise’ cyberspace by shifting norms of surveillance, data protection and human rights online, a desire that has been expressed by some Western governments too. In May 2015, Theresa May, then prime minister of the UK, announced that the British government would be taking a much more restrictive approach to user behaviour in cyberspace and to internet freedoms in general in response to a number of terrorist incidents. May was fiercely criticised when she refused to counter accusations that these amounted to Chinese-style internet restrictions. Footnote ⁵²\nAlready, some governments have misused critical internet infrastructure to facilitate their own espionage activity, such as in the 2019 attacks attributed to Iranian actors on the Domain Name System (sometimes described as the ‘telephone book’ of the internet). Footnote ⁵³ There is also interest in connecting the management of the Domain Name System to international efforts intended to counter cyber crime, including the dissemination of ‘bad content’, as variously defined. In this sense, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s argument that changing the management of internet resources is needed to halt the rise in cyber conflict may be gaining ground.\nIf the liberal-democratic argument that the multi-stakeholder model has worked well and served as an effective firebreak against authoritarian desires to control the internet is rejected, then all\nusers – including those in liberal democracies – will be faced with a very different information environment than that of the previous 20 years. In this new environment, all information is likely to be treated as a potential weapon, and thus subject to government intervention and state negotiations. By effectively encouraging cyber conflict, the persistent-engagement vision greatly increases the appeal of the argument that a much stronger government role in achieving ‘cyber peace’ is needed, and that ultimately, this perilous domain needs an intergovernmental model to manage it.\n*\n*\nPersistent engagement may be driving unwanted effects in a number of ways, but the mixed signalling and over-communication the strategy encourages seem particularly at fault. Publicly advocating in favour of the use of offensive cyber means can only be detrimental to international peace and security, and produce an overall increase in cyber conflict. Emerging cyber nations will be incentivised not only to develop offensive cyber capabilities but also to use them – which may lead to the discovery that they can in fact compete with great powers. At the same time, hallowed principles of international order and internet governance may be undermined, to the benefit of countries whose interests may run counter to those of the United States and liberal democracies everywhere.\nA reconsideration of the basic premises of persistent engagement may show that past US deterrence policy was actually effective – as in the case of the US–China deal that produced a decline in Chinese intellectual-property theft. It may also show that the current high level of cyber aggression has resulted from foreign perceptions of US strength, not US weakness. Instead of publicly reinforcing its dominant posture and conflating transparency with propaganda, the United States might be better served by walking more softly in cyberspace even as it retains a big stick.\nAdopting a policy of genuine transparency would have a much-needed stabilising effect by limiting the threat of inadvertent escalation or loss of escalation control. Such a policy should feature multilevel discussions, with varying levels of confidentiality, about strategic cyber capabilities and their command and control, alongside ongoing international discussions on norms of restraint. Footnote 54 The obvious benefits of this approach explain why the United States' closest allies and partners have almost unanimously advocated for it. Any covert cyber activities that impair these discussions, rather than advancing them, should remain just that - covert. Otherwise, mixing signals in the cyber domain is a recipe for serious adverse effects that threaten to undermine the security not just of the United States, but of all liberal democracies and of the internet itself.\n# Acknowledgements\nParts of this article were commissioned as a White Paper for the US Cyberspace Solarium Commission.",

      "flat_text": "# Abstract\nSome risks of 'persistent engagement' could be mitigated by reducing its reliance on mixed signals and public communication.\nPrevious article View issue table of contents Next article\nThe conduct and deployment of the United States Cyber Command's (CYBERCOM) vision of 'persistent engagement' represents a radical and largely unwelcome departure from previous notions of conflict in cyberspace. It builds on a number of questionable assumptions about the international history and perception of cyber conflict, the role and strategic direction of information warfare, and the general dynamics of deterrence. Ultimately, it justifies a much more aggressive CYBERCOM mission that ignores the potential for unwanted effects that could prove to be highly destabilising in an already volatile international security environment. Overall, persistent engagement is a very high-risk approach to developing cyber deterrence that is likely to not only trigger new forms of retaliation but also accelerate the already rapid international proliferation of offensive cyber capabilities. In the worst-case scenario, it may even pose a risk to the internet as we know it. Some of the risks associated with the concept could, however, be partially alleviated by reducing its reliance on mixed signals and an excess of public communication.\n# Persistent engagement: theory and criticism\nThe promotion of CYBERCOM to a fully independent combat command in 2018 marked the emancipation of US military cyber capabilities from the intelligence world. While some observers, including the present author, thought that this development might help foster much-needed transparency on cyber capabilities, recent developments have taken a darker turn. Footnote  $^{1}$  Building on an already controversial doctrine of 'active defense in cyberspace', the US Department of Defense (DoD) put forward a new public cyber strategy in 2018 that emphasised the concept of 'defend forward'. Footnote  $^{2}$  According to Jeff Kosseff of the United States Naval Academy, defending forward has three basic components: positioning, warning and influencing. Footnote  $^{3}$  CYBERCOM's vision of persistent engagement, which represents the implementation of the DoD strategy, encompasses all three activities, and while each can be criticised as potentially destabilising to international security, the operation-alisation of the 'influencing' component may be particularly so.\nCYBERCOM's General Paul Nakasone gave an indication of what was to come when, in his Senate confirmation hearings in March 2018, he was asked about deterring Russian and Chinese cyber attacks. 'They do not think that much will happen to them', he responded. 'They do not\nfear us.' He went on to say that, 'As cyberspace develops, the longer that we have inactivity, the longer our adversaries are able to establish their own norms – and I think that is very, very important that we realize that.' Footnote 4 This view was reflected in the DoD cyber strategy of defend forward, leveraging the already well-established 'persistent presence' of CYBERCOM in adversaries' networks into an actual operational mandate to disrupt any emerging attacks and thus to 'persistently engage'. Footnote 5 To accomplish this, Nakasone has indicated that CYBERCOM will not be a 'response force' anymore, but rather a force that engages in operations 'below the level of armed attack' on a running basis. Footnote 6\nOverall, CYBERCOM is being positioned less as a strategic-weapons carrier and a key element of an overall strategic-deterrence capability, and more as a special-operations command. The risk of getting these roles entangled is evident with the reversal of traditional signalling practices, with more talk about usually non-public, covert-action-type roles, and less about potential strategic (that is, 'above the threshold of armed attack') capabilities to be used in wartime. The evolving vision of persistent engagement has largely been communicated through a series of articles and press releases, rather than through official publications and doctrines. Footnote 7 This is in keeping with the strategy's dependence on public signals to communicate intent to adversaries. While a discussion of strategic-warfare capabilities would increase transparency and probably increase stability, the sudden emphasis on public discussion of low-level, peacetime cyber attacks is doing the opposite. As decades of experience with arms control have shown, transparency on strategic weapons helps reduce the scope for misunderstandings, provides for clarity of intent, and helps establish norms of restraint and communication. But public communication of offensive covert action – revealing to the public details of secret attacks conducted against an adversary – generally does the reverse, both fostering norms of aggression and underlining the lack of communication. What is true of the conventional-arms world is doubly so in cyberspace, the eponymous information domain where kinetic cyber warfare (officially 'information operations') has an uneasy but undoubted symbiosis with its non-kinetic cousin, 'information warfare', with its emphasis on propaganda, disinformation and covert influencing. As Nakasone has said, in cyberspace the principle danger is the weaponisation of information. Footnote 8 Unfortunately, the signalling mandated by persistent engagement has extended to over-communication in public – itself an example of weaponised information that diminishes the benefits of the defend-forward strategy, lends legitimacy to information-warfare operations as a form of conflict and simultaneously encourages an already accelerating cyber arms race.\nThe empirical justification of CYBERCOM's new offensive vision has been shaky from the start. The academic underpinnings of persistent engagement were presented in a 2017 article by Richard Harknett and Michael Fischerkeller, which was released just as the former was concluding his stint as CYBERCOM's first resident scholar. Footnote 9 The very title of the article, 'Deterrence Is Not a Credible Strategy for Cyberspace', indicates that the authors thought\nit was possible (and desirable) to frame the strategy as one of ‘non-deterrence’. Their analysis rests on the belief that, as part of an ‘agreed competition’ concept, it would be possible to completely contain cyber conflict within its own domain. This would be non-escalatory due to the invisible hand of ‘tacit bargaining’, through which adversaries would feel out the borders of allowable conflict and come to a stable conflict scenario. According to this logic, not only is there less chance of inadvertent escalation over the threshold of armed conflict when engaging in the cyber domain, but this kind of engagement would also avoid retaliation in other domains, such as diplomacy and trade, or even in physical conflict zones, such as Syria and the Persian Gulf. The authors also seem to suggest that cyber could effectively function as a ‘pressure valve’ for international tensions, concentrating the inevitable tit for tat (the tacit bargaining) of international security to a more controllable and less dangerous environment. Footnote 10\nThe many suppositions of Harknett and Fischerkeller’s article have been roundly criticised. Footnote 11 Although the idea of agreed competition is presented as deriving from Herman Kahn’s idea of ‘agreed battle’, the article never answers the basic question of why an adversary would allow itself to be constrained in a way that clearly favours the United States. Cyber experts Brandon Valeriano and Benjamin Jensen have drawn on a comprehensive historical dataset of cyber operations to argue instead that such operations on their own seldom produce concessions. Normally, they need to be accompanied by other actions, such as diplomatic overtures, to work – an approach which the authors contend the US has employed to great effect in the past, despite Nakasone’s assessment that cyber deterrence has failed. Footnote 12 Overall, few observers would agree that outcomes in cyberspace are as easy to predict as advocates of persistent engagement seem to believe. On the contrary, the basic assumption of diplomacy over at least the last decade is that cyberspace is the domain most prone to misinterpretation and miscalculation. Footnote 13 Finally, there is no clear theory of victory in persistent engagement and no strategic endgame, only the purpose of creating operational advantages in cyberspace. There is no agreement as to what the basic strategic game is, or what constitutes its winning and losing factors.\nMore troublingly, persistent engagement does not articulate a sound reasoning as to why any escalation in cyberspace would produce good outcomes for the United States. Tom Bossert, US President Donald Trump’s first homeland security advisor, has explicitly questioned parts of the strategy. In a June 2018 Wired article, he is quoted as saying, ‘I want to make sure we don’t end up in an escalatory cyber exchange where we lose more than they do’, and as pointing out that ‘in many respects the US economy and infrastructure is far more reliant on digitization and automation than Russia’s, giving the Kremlin an inherent advantage in any future no-holdsbarred cyberwar. He paraphrases former US secretary of defense Ash Carter: “If you’re doused in gasoline, don’t start a match-throwing contest.”’ Footnote 14\nThe entire rationale for the strategy, as outlined by Nakasone himself, relies on a version of cyber history that not all observers will agree with. For instance, Nakasone has said that the US mostly faced an intelligence-gathering threat before 2013, which then escalated into denial-based attacks before moving towards destructive attacks (presumably including information-warfare attacks in 2016) and preparations for armed conflict. Footnote 15 Overlooked by this narrative is any consideration of how the adversary – or even many US friends and allies – would see the causality of these developments. In an alternative narrative, US dominance in persistent-presence espionage was publicly revealed through the intelligence disclosures of 2013, at the same time as the first real cyber weapon, Stuxnet, was attributed to the United States. Among allies in Europe, such as Germany, these revelations were often badly received, and the reaction among neutrals, such as Brazil, was even more negative. Not many European observers would agree with the assessment of persistent engagement's supporters that the US has been 'too passive' in cyberspace. In some cases, a different conclusion can be drawn: that cyber attacks have been responses to US activity. Nakasone has cited Iranian cyber aggression to justify persistent engagement, but Iranian activities can also be framed as responses to US cyber operations, such as Stuxnet and Flame. Footnote 16 The Shamoon malware that Iran used to target Saudi Arabia reused components of the US-attributed Flame malware – effectively directing a US cyber weapon back at one of its allies. Footnote 17 Seen from this perspective, at least some of the increase in cyber-related activity directed against the United States has been a direct result of public disclosures of the advanced state of US cyber capabilities and operations. Instead of producing a deterrent effect, these disclosures seem to have contributed to an increase in cyber tensions. This does not bode well for the principle of persistent engagement as currently expressed.\nBoth the academic theory and the policy statements surrounding persistent engagement have a strained relationship with the overall concept of deterrence, as well as with those of balance of power, proliferation and arms control. Before 2016, modern US deterrence followed a logic that is often expressed as a ladder, from entanglement, norms and resilience to punishment. Footnote 18 Purists may argue that only the last two – the ability to absorb an attack, and the ability to conduct an attack – represent classic deterrence. Footnote 19 Contending that the US strategy of 'denial' or 'resilience' has clearly failed in recent years, they have turned to an existing solution for the problem and radically reinterpreted it. In 2011, the nascent weakness in US cyber-deterrence policy – insofar as this had been formally expressed – had already been identified as a lack of 'credibility' or, in technical terms, a seeming inability to communicate the strength of US cyber capabilities in order to dissuade an adversary. It was the same conundrum made famous by Dr. Strangelove – how can one expect a deterrent effect if the very instrument of deterrence is a secret? In cyber terms, the effect was dubbed the 'Cartwright Conjecture' by Jason Healey after General James Cartwright, the former head of Strategic Command who, in 2011, was already complaining that 'we've got to talk about our offensive capabilities and train to them; to make\nthem credible ... You can't have something that's a secret be a deterrent. Because if you don't know it's there, it doesn't scare you.' Footnote 20 This was by no means an isolated message. Footnote 21 At that time, the strategic capability being communicated was one of overwhelming US intelligence-gathering capabilities.\nWithin the US government, intelligence-gathering capabilities have resolutely been portrayed as neutral, or even defensive, in nature. Yet many allies, as well as private-sector actors within the US itself, do not share this view. A number of foreign leaders – not only of neutral countries, but of friends and allies of the US – have concluded that the United States' ability to maintain a persistent presence on all kinds of networks is tantamount to being able to strike them at will. Never mind that it takes time to prepare complicated strikes across highly segmented networks, or that it can be difficult for CYBERCOM to get campaigns approved through the interagency process – these are problems only the attacker can see. From a defender's point of view, it can be very difficult to differentiate between advanced espionage attempts and imminent acts of war – including by the United States. When US dominance in persistent presence became publicly apparent after 2013, it was only natural that a number of nations – some of them US adversaries, but not all – feared that it would not be long before the US took the simple step from persistent presence to persistent engagement. Although major US initiatives such as the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (launched in 2009 with an estimated budget of $40 billion over five years) were cast as being 'defensive' in nature, the programmes could clearly serve as the foundation for offensive cyber activity: the same sensors and implants intended to provide warning of hostile cyber activity could easily be repurposed for offensive activity. This being the case, and given the historical record of presumed US cyber operations, Nakasone's claims in his 2017 Senate confirmation hearing that the United States has been a passive actor in cyberspace seems disingenuous, at best.\nThe significant increase in all forms of offensive cyber behaviour against the US after 2013 has been described as a deterrence failure. Yet advocates of persistent engagement have been unable to explain why deterrence failed, or to express whether the failure was complete or only partial. There is at least some evidence to suggest that the escalation was due to perceived US strength in cyber, not weakness. Following the work of Valeriano and Jensen, whose dataset indicates that responses to cyber attacks have historically been proportional and not intentionally escalatory, Footnote 22 this could imply that some of the increased activity publicly reported since 2013 may in fact have been responses by US adversaries – responses that have been recalibrated to take into account a much more dominant US position in cyberspace than these adversaries had been aware of.\nEither way, friendly and less friendly nations alike have rushed to compete in an escalating cyber arms race, one which the US may have played a decisive role in accelerating even before the publication of persistent engagement. Footnote 23 The very term 'cyber arms race', while not\nparticularly contentious in itself, is difficult to fully circumscribe. The phenomenon bears little resemblance to historic arms races and cannot be quantified by numbers of weapons systems, as was possible during the missile-gap race of the 1960s or the battleship/dreadnought race of the 1900s. Yet even though it is not even clear exactly what these offensive capabilities entail, there is little disagreement that a number of nations are increasingly seeking them, and that the overall level of destructive cyber attacks is rising. A 2016 study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) estimated that at least 30 nations were actively pursuing offensive cyber capabilities, a number that has likely continued to increase year on year as the number of cyber incidents continues to rise. Footnote 24\nMuch like the United States after 2013, many nations have seen a significant increase in malicious behaviour in cyberspace. The Council on Foreign Relations has reported that, with two notable dips in 2012 and 2016, cyber-espionage activity worldwide increased tenfold from 2009 to 2019. Footnote 25 Much of the damage caused by recent cyber incidents such as the WannaCry and NotPetya ransomware attacks, as well as routing and kinetic-equivalent attacks on media and industry, was concentrated outside of the United States. Paired with a significant increase in psychological, information-warfare activities, this has prompted many of the hardest-hit nations (including Australia, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, among others) to make significant adjustments to their cyber postures, in particular by building offensive capabilities. At the same time, anecdotal information suggests that not even these comparatively advanced nations have fully understood what these new cyber capabilities are actually intended to do – if they are intended to focus on ‘strategic strike’ (for instance against critical infrastructure), ‘battlefield cyber’ (acting as a sort of electronic warfare) or online covert action. Footnote 26 This relative confusion about mission parameters will only be accentuated by the new CYBERCOM vision.\nEarly US signalling in response to the Cartwright Conjecture may have intended to go beyond emphasising American strength in online covert action to illustrate the country's ability to conduct a 'global strike' of overwhelming force in wartime – in essence, framing cyber as a strategic capability, a kind of digital weapon of mass destruction. CYBERCOM's intent differs, however, from the low-level silent professionalism of those engaged in strategic deterrence or the targeted focus of tailored access operations in the intelligence world. The role model for persistent engagement is not strategic command or the intelligence community, but rather special-operations command, whose mission has been to counter the adversary all the time, everywhere.\nGeneral Nakasone has stated that, 'unlike the nuclear realm, where our strategic advantage or power comes from possessing a capability or weapons system, in cyberspace it's the use of cyber capabilities that is strategically consequential'. Footnote 27 Not only does this remark suggest that the United States must use offensive capabilities visibly, but it also implies that other nations have a clear interest in doing so as well. Yet encouraging a permissive norm that implicitly\nfavours cyber aggression as a tool of peacetime statecraft is likely only to expand the already murky grey area of modern conflict, and the difference between covert action and military activity. Footnote 28 A number of significant adverse effects can be expected among a range of countries – US allies and friends, neutrals and US adversaries alike – which are unlikely to be in the US interest.\nFirst-order effects: ‘out of band’ and ‘diagonal’ retaliation Jason Healey and Neil Jenkins have argued that the impact of the new persistent-engagement strategy could be assessed by looking at the number of cyber attacks against the US. A decline in attacks would indicate that the strategy was effective, while an increase would suggest it was ineffective or counterproductive. Footnote 29 This approach seems too simplistic for at least two reasons. Firstly, US adversaries may simply retaliate with non-cyber means, drawing on the example the US has already set. One of the most successful acts of US cyber deterrence was the use of Department of Justice indictments against specific foreign cyber actors. Following the indictment of five Chinese hackers associated with the People's Liberation Army in 2015, a landmark deal was reached between then-president Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping that resulted in a significant decline – by up to 90%, according to a report by the security company FireEye Footnote 30 – in Chinese-attributed intellectual-property theft. Other indictments against Russian and Iranian hackers have followed. US adversaries may seek to devise their own ‘out of band’ responses to US cyber activity, perhaps by drawing on the copious amount of leaked materials on offensive US cyber capabilities now in the public domain. Alternatively, they may respond with more ‘conventional’ means, for instance by increasing their support for the non-US side in adversarial situations such as trade conflicts, maritime disputes and weapons proliferation.\nUS adversaries might also respond ‘diagonally’ by responding with cyber-enabled means that defy the simple characterisation of ‘cyber attack’. The kind of social-media activity associated with Russia’s information-warfare campaign against the United States is but one example of this approach. Other cyber means could potentially be deployed in an even more covert manner, making attribution difficult even with the deployment of the United States’ full range of intelligence-collection measures.\nThe recent spate of cyber-crime attacks directed against state and local governments across the United States may be another example of a diagonal approach to cyber retaliation. From January to July 2019, more than 55 state and local governments in the US were hit by ransomware attacks. Footnote 31 Although there had been no public attribution of these activities to foreign actors by the time this article went to press, some of them used a stolen US cyber exploit, dubbed ‘EternalBlue’. This exploit had been posted for sale by a group calling itself ‘Shadow Brokers’, which some have speculated may be a front for Russian intelligence actors. Footnote 32 When cyber criminals did not immediately respond to the possibilities inherent in this new exploit, the WannaCry and NotPetya campaigns were launched, drawing attention not just to the possibilities\nof EternalBlue, but also to the efficacy of ransomware attacks themselves. Even if the current spate of cyber attacks against state and local governments in the US was not directed by a foreign adversary, it would be relatively easy for governments to encourage such activity in the future, thus inflicting real pain on targets and demonstrating the ability of national cyber defenders to respond to provocations.\nThe underlying enabling factor for this scenario is the poor state of basic national cyber security across the United States. A 2019 report by the US Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that of the 3,000 cybersecurity recommendations that have been made to federal agencies since 2010, more than 1,000 had yet to be implemented. Footnote  $^{33}$  These vulnerabilities also extend to the DoD's own basic war-fighting capabilities. According to a GAO report from 2018, 'almost all the weapons that the DOD tested between 2012 and 2017, including the F-35 jet and missile systems, have \"mission critical\" cyber vulnerabilities and can be \"easily hacked\" using \"relatively simple tools and techniques\". Footnote  $^{34}$  As poor as federal cyber-security efforts are, the situation at the state and local levels is significantly worse: a 2019 survey indicated that there remains a large difference between state and federal cyber-security capabilities. Footnote  $^{35}$  The state and local agencies polled said they had high confidence in their ability to 'prevent' a cyber attack in only  $19\\%$  of cases (compared to  $41\\%$  of federal agencies), and only  $28\\%$  of those canvassed said they would be able to 'recover' (versus  $55\\%$  of federal agencies). The nation's privately held critical infrastructure is more difficult to assess, but is largely considered to be more capable, and the United States' overall cyber-security stance tends to be ranked highly by more politically minded ratings – the International Telecommunications Union, for example, ranked the US overall at number two worldwide. Footnote  $^{36}$  More technical ratings, however, like that of the National Cyber Security Index, give the US a more middling assessment – placing it, for instance, in thirteenth place worldwide. Footnote  $^{37}$  The only good news, if it can be called that, to emerge from these findings is that the poor state of US national cyber security is mirrored by that of Russia and China.\n# Second-order effects: emerging cyber powers and their strategic dilemma\nA major reason for the vulnerable state of US cyber security has to do with scale – large nations have inherently more attack surface to cover, and the US easily has the greatest attack surface of them all. Footnote  $^{38}$  However, the opposite is therefore also true – smaller nations on balance have a much easier task in building national cyber security, and this has significant repercussions for how they play their own game of strategic deterrence. Yet the asymmetric strength of small players has been largely overlooked in most conventional analyses of cyber powers.\nSmaller nations often benefit from increased cooperation between the civilian and military, and state and non-state sectors, and generally face fewer challenges in coordinating emergency measures. Some even have the ability to disconnect from the global internet if necessary. Footnote 39 Smaller countries may also benefit from a more stringent legal and regulatory framework that requires a minimum level of cyber defence, not just from various levels of government but also from the private sector. For nations like, say, the Netherlands, the task of coordinating with 100–300 critical-infrastructure providers, and a comparable number of local and federal government networks, is a completely different task than dealing with many tens of thousands of civilian assets and non-military governmental networks, as in the United States. Footnote 40 A smaller attack surface means fewer critical-infrastructure providers that need to be communicated with, fewer government agency networks that need to be hardened and less scope for friction in a crisis. Essentially, this means that smaller advanced cyber nations have an inherent advantage in pursuing national cyber security compared with very large nations such as the United States, or indeed Russia and China. All things considered, a number of smaller nations might actually do quite well in a force-on-force conflict with a major cyber power. The ability of many smaller nations to potentially absorb cyber blows is no less significant in a wartime scenario than advantageous defensive geography would be in a ground operation. Yet the ‘high ground’ advantage of smaller states in presenting a smaller attack surface in the cyber domain may not have been adequately factored into analysts’ calculations, including those that informed the drafting of persistent engagement. As a corollary to this, smaller nations’ ability to conduct deterrence by punishment – a strategy that persistent engagement has heavily incentivised them to pursue – is not well understood.\nThe nature of the offensive cyber capabilities currently being developed by the ‘next 30’ nations examined in the 2016 CSIS study may not be clear, but there is no reason to believe that they relate only to cyber-crime-style scenarios, such as denial-of-service or even ransomware attacks. Instead, it should be assumed that these cyber powers can ‘turn the lights off’ – that is, launch a strategic strike on the critical infrastructure of an enemy. While it is much easier to temporarily shut down a nation’s infrastructure networks than to damage them beyond repair, ‘temporary’ disruptions can still impose catastrophic costs on a nation’s economy and limit its ability to maintain domestic order. The destructive potential of the next 30 may be orders of magnitude less than that of the United States or a near-peer cyber power, but some of these countries still possess a minimal deterrence capability that, much like the small nuclear arsenals of France, the UK and China, could inflict an unacceptable level of retaliatory punishment on a potential aggressor, no matter their overwhelming technical superiority. While detractors may say that mere cyber attacks should not be compared to the horror of a nuclear exchange, the effects of weeks-long black-outs, the destruction of financial information and the breakdown of most forms of communication should not be underestimated. The next-30 cyber nations may therefore possess something which was previously unavailable to them: not just a strategic-weapons capability – a\nvirtual strike force no less potent than a wing of bombers or ballistic missiles – but also a defensive advantage towards larger foes.\nThe sheer number of nations that may be able to reciprocally threaten a major power could be historically unprecedented. There was briefly a time, in the late 1950s, when it seemed possible that dozens of nations would eventually deploy nuclear weapons; even small countries like Switzerland deliberated the possibility of creating their own nuclear deterrent. Footnote 41 In the end, many of these opted to form alliances with existing nuclear powers instead. Today, persistent engagement may be changing the way such nations provide for their own security. Instead of depending on the protective umbrella of their friends, many now have their own budding deterrence-by-punishment capability in the cyber domain, in addition to having become better able to resist the effects of a strategic cyber strike against themselves. Some are also being incentivised by persistent engagement not only to develop offensive capabilities, but to use them as well. After all, persistent engagement postulates that cyber conflict is not only to be welcomed, but to be engaged in so as to be 'understood'. Any country not carrying out cyber attacks would, like those that did not test nuclear bombs, be excluded from the main table and left without a voice. This is seen as a perverse incentive by those who advocate for non-proliferation and argue that the increased distribution of destructive weapons increases the likelihood not only that one will be used, but that all will be used.\n# Third-order effects: weaponising information and changing the internet\nIn February 2019, it was reported that some unspecified action had been taken by CYBERCOM in November 2018 against the Internet Research Agency, a notorious social-media 'troll factory' headquartered in St Petersburg. The New York Times said that the organisation had been shut down 'for a number of days' as part of an effort to secure the US midterm elections. Footnote 42 Unlike many other parts of the Russian security apparatus, the Internet Research Agency does not seem to engage in 'hacking' – that is, it does not launch its own intrusions. Rather, it is widely accepted that the agency engages only in spreading disinformation, Footnote 43 something that may not even be illegal under international law. CYBERCOM's action against it may well have fallen beneath the 'use of force' or 'armed attack' threshold (a distinction not usually made in the United States anyway), but its public nature implies an acceptance of kinetic-effect cyber attacks – it sent the message that it is okay to hack what you consider 'fake news'.\nIf the targeting of actors that have only a propaganda function (rather than being directly responsible for cyber attacks) becomes normalised, then more conventional media organisations, as well as civil-society and non-governmental organisations, may become admissible targets. Russia might conclude, for example, that foreign support for domestic democracy activists falls\nunder the heading of ‘information and psychological actions aimed at undermining … the homeland’, to borrow language from the 2016 Russian Information Security Doctrine. Footnote 44 Likewise, Beijing might find Chinese-language translations of the New York Times provocative. Footnote 45 International disputes may emerge about ‘bad content’, such as propaganda, social-media campaigns and unkind opinion pieces. Footnote 46 In this way, persistent engagement might encourage the very risk that it was intended to alleviate: the weaponisation of information.\nIn June 2019, the New York Times reported that, at the same time the US was targeting the Information Research Agency, it was also deploying offensive cyber capabilities within the Russian power grid. Footnote 47 A similar intrusion of US power grids – using a malware package known as BlackEnergy – was noticed in 2011 and publicly reported on soon after. A version of BlackEnergy was also used in December 2015 to cause a large-scale blackout in western Ukraine. Footnote 48 These two intrusions, both of them attributed to Russia, ultimately drew attention to themselves, even though there was a blackout only in the 2015 action. In June 2019, however, the United States raised the ante. Rather than ‘allowing’ their own pre-deployment operation to be discovered and reported on by Russian actors, the Americans reported it themselves, stating that since 2018 US malware had been present in the Russian power grid in order to effect a kinetic-equivalent strike if necessary. The intent of this disclosure was likely to make it clear to the Russians that, if necessary, the US was ready to accept a level of ‘mutually assured disruption’. At least as important was the message that CYBERCOM had not abandoned its strategic-warfare role. Yet the United States’ public declaration of its willingness to significantly violate the sovereignty of an adversary in peacetime (something that would not happen when, say, fielding ballistic missiles) seems to present a novel situation for international law. It also provided strong reinforcement for the Russian and Chinese strategic narrative that politics is the extension of warfare, a reversal of Karl von Clausewitz’s famous definition of warfare as an extension of politics. By effectively declaring that the United States considered the pre-deployment of cyber weapons within an adversary’s critical infrastructure as being permissible (rather than simply being ‘caught in the act’, as the Russians were), CYBERCOM took a big step away from the established international legal order that the United States has helped to create. It also implicitly accepted a norm of mutual hostage-taking or ‘mutually assured debilitation’, a huge strategic concession that seems to imply US acceptance of a level of parity with adversaries where previously it could insist on hegemony. Moreover, it implied that CYBERCOM, if not the entire US government, has accepted the core Marxist–Leninist argument that ‘peacetime’ and ‘wartime’ are artificial distinctions.\nIt is clear that persistent engagement poses several direct challenges to the existing international order. For instance, not only does it mandate the forward- or pre-deployment of cyber weapons inside the networks of other countries before a dispute has crossed the threshold of armed conflict, it also suggests that operations beneath this threshold can be justified for any number of\nreasons, including as countermeasures against relatively ‘soft’ disinformation and propaganda activity. There is no reason to suppose that this way of thinking will be confined to the United States – any number of the next-30 cyber powers could also embrace these principles.\nPersistent engagement may also challenge the management, and therefore the shape and form, of the global internet as we know it. Depictions of cyberspace as increasingly violent will accelerate a growing trend to describe the management of the internet in security-related terms. This has been an abiding diplomatic objective of a sizeable faction of states, led by Russia and China, for many years – arguably since 1998. Footnote ⁴⁹ These states have proposed an International Code of Conduct for Information Security ‘, Footnote ⁵⁰ the latest version of which was endorsed by the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation in 2016. The greatest risk the code’s supporters see to their own cyber security is not so much infrastructure-targeting cyber attacks, but rather information warfare intended to achieve the despised outcome of ‘regime change’. For these cyber powers, encouraging diplomatic discussion on ‘countering foreign political influence’ is a key objective.\nTo further this goal, backers of the Code of Conduct have challenged the way the global internet is run. To date, the internet has been managed by a regime comprising multiple government, civil-society and private-sector actors. Footnote ⁵¹ This is known as the multi-stakeholder approach to internet governance, and it has proven to be remarkably resilient, as well as beneficial for the internet’s growth. Yet Code of Conduct supporters wish to replace this multi-stakeholder model with an intergovernmental one. They also wish to ‘securitise’ cyberspace by shifting norms of surveillance, data protection and human rights online, a desire that has been expressed by some Western governments too. In May 2015, Theresa May, then prime minister of the UK, announced that the British government would be taking a much more restrictive approach to user behaviour in cyberspace and to internet freedoms in general in response to a number of terrorist incidents. May was fiercely criticised when she refused to counter accusations that these amounted to Chinese-style internet restrictions. Footnote ⁵²\nAlready, some governments have misused critical internet infrastructure to facilitate their own espionage activity, such as in the 2019 attacks attributed to Iranian actors on the Domain Name System (sometimes described as the ‘telephone book’ of the internet). Footnote ⁵³ There is also interest in connecting the management of the Domain Name System to international efforts intended to counter cyber crime, including the dissemination of ‘bad content’, as variously defined. In this sense, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s argument that changing the management of internet resources is needed to halt the rise in cyber conflict may be gaining ground.\nIf the liberal-democratic argument that the multi-stakeholder model has worked well and served as an effective firebreak against authoritarian desires to control the internet is rejected, then all\nusers – including those in liberal democracies – will be faced with a very different information environment than that of the previous 20 years. In this new environment, all information is likely to be treated as a potential weapon, and thus subject to government intervention and state negotiations. By effectively encouraging cyber conflict, the persistent-engagement vision greatly increases the appeal of the argument that a much stronger government role in achieving ‘cyber peace’ is needed, and that ultimately, this perilous domain needs an intergovernmental model to manage it.\n*\n*\nPersistent engagement may be driving unwanted effects in a number of ways, but the mixed signalling and over-communication the strategy encourages seem particularly at fault. Publicly advocating in favour of the use of offensive cyber means can only be detrimental to international peace and security, and produce an overall increase in cyber conflict. Emerging cyber nations will be incentivised not only to develop offensive cyber capabilities but also to use them – which may lead to the discovery that they can in fact compete with great powers. At the same time, hallowed principles of international order and internet governance may be undermined, to the benefit of countries whose interests may run counter to those of the United States and liberal democracies everywhere.\nA reconsideration of the basic premises of persistent engagement may show that past US deterrence policy was actually effective – as in the case of the US–China deal that produced a decline in Chinese intellectual-property theft. It may also show that the current high level of cyber aggression has resulted from foreign perceptions of US strength, not US weakness. Instead of publicly reinforcing its dominant posture and conflating transparency with propaganda, the United States might be better served by walking more softly in cyberspace even as it retains a big stick.\nAdopting a policy of genuine transparency would have a much-needed stabilising effect by limiting the threat of inadvertent escalation or loss of escalation control. Such a policy should feature multilevel discussions, with varying levels of confidentiality, about strategic cyber capabilities and their command and control, alongside ongoing international discussions on norms of restraint. Footnote 54 The obvious benefits of this approach explain why the United States' closest allies and partners have almost unanimously advocated for it. Any covert cyber activities that impair these discussions, rather than advancing them, should remain just that - covert. Otherwise, mixing signals in the cyber domain is a recipe for serious adverse effects that threaten to undermine the security not just of the United States, but of all liberal democracies and of the internet itself.\n# Acknowledgements\nParts of this article were commissioned as a White Paper for the US Cyberspace Solarium Commission."

      "flat_text": "# Abstract\nSome risks of 'persistent engagement' could be mitigated by reducing its reliance on mixed signals and public communication.\nPrevious article View issue table of contents Next article\nThe conduct and deployment of the United States Cyber Command's (CYBERCOM) vision of 'persistent engagement' represents a radical and largely unwelcome departure from previous notions of conflict in cyberspace. It builds on a number of questionable assumptions about the international history and perception of cyber conflict, the role and strategic direction of information warfare, and the general dynamics of deterrence. Ultimately, it justifies a much more aggressive CYBERCOM mission that ignores the potential for unwanted effects that could prove to be highly destabilising in an already volatile international security environment. Overall, persistent engagement is a very high-risk approach to developing cyber deterrence that is likely to not only trigger new forms of retaliation but also accelerate the already rapid international proliferation of offensive cyber capabilities. In the worst-case scenario, it may even pose a risk to the internet as we know it. Some of the risks associated with the concept could, however, be partially alleviated by reducing its reliance on mixed signals and an excess of public communication.\n# Persistent engagement: theory and criticism\nThe promotion of CYBERCOM to a fully independent combat command in 2018 marked the emancipation of US military cyber capabilities from the intelligence world. While some observers, including the present author, thought that this development might help foster much-needed transparency on cyber capabilities, recent developments have taken a darker turn. Footnote  $^{1}$  Building on an already controversial doctrine of 'active defense in cyberspace', the US Department of Defense (DoD) put forward a new public cyber strategy in 2018 that emphasised the concept of 'defend forward'. Footnote  $^{2}$  According to Jeff Kosseff of the United States Naval Academy, defending forward has three basic components: positioning, warning and influencing. Footnote  $^{3}$  CYBERCOM's vision of persistent engagement, which represents the implementation of the DoD strategy, encompasses all three activities, and while each can be criticised as potentially destabilising to international security, the operation-alisation of the 'influencing' component may be particularly so.\nCYBERCOM's General Paul Nakasone gave an indication of what was to come when, in his Senate confirmation hearings in March 2018, he was asked about deterring Russian and Chinese cyber attacks. 'They do not think that much will happen to them', he responded. 'They do not\nfear us.' He went on to say that, 'As cyberspace develops, the longer that we have inactivity, the longer our adversaries are able to establish their own norms – and I think that is very, very important that we realize that.' Footnote 4 This view was reflected in the DoD cyber strategy of defend forward, leveraging the already well-established 'persistent presence' of CYBERCOM in adversaries' networks into an actual operational mandate to disrupt any emerging attacks and thus to 'persistently engage'. Footnote 5 To accomplish this, Nakasone has indicated that CYBERCOM will not be a 'response force' anymore, but rather a force that engages in operations 'below the level of armed attack' on a running basis. Footnote 6\nOverall, CYBERCOM is being positioned less as a strategic-weapons carrier and a key element of an overall strategic-deterrence capability, and more as a special-operations command. The risk of getting these roles entangled is evident with the reversal of traditional signalling practices, with more talk about usually non-public, covert-action-type roles, and less about potential strategic (that is, 'above the threshold of armed attack') capabilities to be used in wartime. The evolving vision of persistent engagement has largely been communicated through a series of articles and press releases, rather than through official publications and doctrines. Footnote 7 This is in keeping with the strategy's dependence on public signals to communicate intent to adversaries. While a discussion of strategic-warfare capabilities would increase transparency and probably increase stability, the sudden emphasis on public discussion of low-level, peacetime cyber attacks is doing the opposite. As decades of experience with arms control have shown, transparency on strategic weapons helps reduce the scope for misunderstandings, provides for clarity of intent, and helps establish norms of restraint and communication. But public communication of offensive covert action – revealing to the public details of secret attacks conducted against an adversary – generally does the reverse, both fostering norms of aggression and underlining the lack of communication. What is true of the conventional-arms world is doubly so in cyberspace, the eponymous information domain where kinetic cyber warfare (officially 'information operations') has an uneasy but undoubted symbiosis with its non-kinetic cousin, 'information warfare', with its emphasis on propaganda, disinformation and covert influencing. As Nakasone has said, in cyberspace the principle danger is the weaponisation of information. Footnote 8 Unfortunately, the signalling mandated by persistent engagement has extended to over-communication in public – itself an example of weaponised information that diminishes the benefits of the defend-forward strategy, lends legitimacy to information-warfare operations as a form of conflict and simultaneously encourages an already accelerating cyber arms race.\nThe empirical justification of CYBERCOM's new offensive vision has been shaky from the start. The academic underpinnings of persistent engagement were presented in a 2017 article by Richard Harknett and Michael Fischerkeller, which was released just as the former was concluding his stint as CYBERCOM's first resident scholar. Footnote 9 The very title of the article, 'Deterrence Is Not a Credible Strategy for Cyberspace', indicates that the authors thought\nit was possible (and desirable) to frame the strategy as one of ‘non-deterrence’. Their analysis rests on the belief that, as part of an ‘agreed competition’ concept, it would be possible to completely contain cyber conflict within its own domain. This would be non-escalatory due to the invisible hand of ‘tacit bargaining’, through which adversaries would feel out the borders of allowable conflict and come to a stable conflict scenario. According to this logic, not only is there less chance of inadvertent escalation over the threshold of armed conflict when engaging in the cyber domain, but this kind of engagement would also avoid retaliation in other domains, such as diplomacy and trade, or even in physical conflict zones, such as Syria and the Persian Gulf. The authors also seem to suggest that cyber could effectively function as a ‘pressure valve’ for international tensions, concentrating the inevitable tit for tat (the tacit bargaining) of international security to a more controllable and less dangerous environment. Footnote 10\nThe many suppositions of Harknett and Fischerkeller’s article have been roundly criticised. Footnote 11 Although the idea of agreed competition is presented as deriving from Herman Kahn’s idea of ‘agreed battle’, the article never answers the basic question of why an adversary would allow itself to be constrained in a way that clearly favours the United States. Cyber experts Brandon Valeriano and Benjamin Jensen have drawn on a comprehensive historical dataset of cyber operations to argue instead that such operations on their own seldom produce concessions. Normally, they need to be accompanied by other actions, such as diplomatic overtures, to work – an approach which the authors contend the US has employed to great effect in the past, despite Nakasone’s assessment that cyber deterrence has failed. Footnote 12 Overall, few observers would agree that outcomes in cyberspace are as easy to predict as advocates of persistent engagement seem to believe. On the contrary, the basic assumption of diplomacy over at least the last decade is that cyberspace is the domain most prone to misinterpretation and miscalculation. Footnote 13 Finally, there is no clear theory of victory in persistent engagement and no strategic endgame, only the purpose of creating operational advantages in cyberspace. There is no agreement as to what the basic strategic game is, or what constitutes its winning and losing factors.\nMore troublingly, persistent engagement does not articulate a sound reasoning as to why any escalation in cyberspace would produce good outcomes for the United States. Tom Bossert, US President Donald Trump’s first homeland security advisor, has explicitly questioned parts of the strategy. In a June 2018 Wired article, he is quoted as saying, ‘I want to make sure we don’t end up in an escalatory cyber exchange where we lose more than they do’, and as pointing out that ‘in many respects the US economy and infrastructure is far more reliant on digitization and automation than Russia’s, giving the Kremlin an inherent advantage in any future no-holdsbarred cyberwar. He paraphrases former US secretary of defense Ash Carter: “If you’re doused in gasoline, don’t start a match-throwing contest.”’ Footnote 14\nThe entire rationale for the strategy, as outlined by Nakasone himself, relies on a version of cyber history that not all observers will agree with. For instance, Nakasone has said that the US mostly faced an intelligence-gathering threat before 2013, which then escalated into denial-based attacks before moving towards destructive attacks (presumably including information-warfare attacks in 2016) and preparations for armed conflict. Footnote 15 Overlooked by this narrative is any consideration of how the adversary – or even many US friends and allies – would see the causality of these developments. In an alternative narrative, US dominance in persistent-presence espionage was publicly revealed through the intelligence disclosures of 2013, at the same time as the first real cyber weapon, Stuxnet, was attributed to the United States. Among allies in Europe, such as Germany, these revelations were often badly received, and the reaction among neutrals, such as Brazil, was even more negative. Not many European observers would agree with the assessment of persistent engagement's supporters that the US has been 'too passive' in cyberspace. In some cases, a different conclusion can be drawn: that cyber attacks have been responses to US activity. Nakasone has cited Iranian cyber aggression to justify persistent engagement, but Iranian activities can also be framed as responses to US cyber operations, such as Stuxnet and Flame. Footnote 16 The Shamoon malware that Iran used to target Saudi Arabia reused components of the US-attributed Flame malware – effectively directing a US cyber weapon back at one of its allies. Footnote 17 Seen from this perspective, at least some of the increase in cyber-related activity directed against the United States has been a direct result of public disclosures of the advanced state of US cyber capabilities and operations. Instead of producing a deterrent effect, these disclosures seem to have contributed to an increase in cyber tensions. This does not bode well for the principle of persistent engagement as currently expressed.\nBoth the academic theory and the policy statements surrounding persistent engagement have a strained relationship with the overall concept of deterrence, as well as with those of balance of power, proliferation and arms control. Before 2016, modern US deterrence followed a logic that is often expressed as a ladder, from entanglement, norms and resilience to punishment. Footnote 18 Purists may argue that only the last two – the ability to absorb an attack, and the ability to conduct an attack – represent classic deterrence. Footnote 19 Contending that the US strategy of 'denial' or 'resilience' has clearly failed in recent years, they have turned to an existing solution for the problem and radically reinterpreted it. In 2011, the nascent weakness in US cyber-deterrence policy – insofar as this had been formally expressed – had already been identified as a lack of 'credibility' or, in technical terms, a seeming inability to communicate the strength of US cyber capabilities in order to dissuade an adversary. It was the same conundrum made famous by Dr. Strangelove – how can one expect a deterrent effect if the very instrument of deterrence is a secret? In cyber terms, the effect was dubbed the 'Cartwright Conjecture' by Jason Healey after General James Cartwright, the former head of Strategic Command who, in 2011, was already complaining that 'we've got to talk about our offensive capabilities and train to them; to make\nthem credible ... You can't have something that's a secret be a deterrent. Because if you don't know it's there, it doesn't scare you.' Footnote 20 This was by no means an isolated message. Footnote 21 At that time, the strategic capability being communicated was one of overwhelming US intelligence-gathering capabilities.\nWithin the US government, intelligence-gathering capabilities have resolutely been portrayed as neutral, or even defensive, in nature. Yet many allies, as well as private-sector actors within the US itself, do not share this view. A number of foreign leaders – not only of neutral countries, but of friends and allies of the US – have concluded that the United States' ability to maintain a persistent presence on all kinds of networks is tantamount to being able to strike them at will. Never mind that it takes time to prepare complicated strikes across highly segmented networks, or that it can be difficult for CYBERCOM to get campaigns approved through the interagency process – these are problems only the attacker can see. From a defender's point of view, it can be very difficult to differentiate between advanced espionage attempts and imminent acts of war – including by the United States. When US dominance in persistent presence became publicly apparent after 2013, it was only natural that a number of nations – some of them US adversaries, but not all – feared that it would not be long before the US took the simple step from persistent presence to persistent engagement. Although major US initiatives such as the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (launched in 2009 with an estimated budget of $40 billion over five years) were cast as being 'defensive' in nature, the programmes could clearly serve as the foundation for offensive cyber activity: the same sensors and implants intended to provide warning of hostile cyber activity could easily be repurposed for offensive activity. This being the case, and given the historical record of presumed US cyber operations, Nakasone's claims in his 2017 Senate confirmation hearing that the United States has been a passive actor in cyberspace seems disingenuous, at best.\nThe significant increase in all forms of offensive cyber behaviour against the US after 2013 has been described as a deterrence failure. Yet advocates of persistent engagement have been unable to explain why deterrence failed, or to express whether the failure was complete or only partial. There is at least some evidence to suggest that the escalation was due to perceived US strength in cyber, not weakness. Following the work of Valeriano and Jensen, whose dataset indicates that responses to cyber attacks have historically been proportional and not intentionally escalatory, Footnote 22 this could imply that some of the increased activity publicly reported since 2013 may in fact have been responses by US adversaries – responses that have been recalibrated to take into account a much more dominant US position in cyberspace than these adversaries had been aware of.\nEither way, friendly and less friendly nations alike have rushed to compete in an escalating cyber arms race, one which the US may have played a decisive role in accelerating even before the publication of persistent engagement. Footnote 23 The very term 'cyber arms race', while not\nparticularly contentious in itself, is difficult to fully circumscribe. The phenomenon bears little resemblance to historic arms races and cannot be quantified by numbers of weapons systems, as was possible during the missile-gap race of the 1960s or the battleship/dreadnought race of the 1900s. Yet even though it is not even clear exactly what these offensive capabilities entail, there is little disagreement that a number of nations are increasingly seeking them, and that the overall level of destructive cyber attacks is rising. A 2016 study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) estimated that at least 30 nations were actively pursuing offensive cyber capabilities, a number that has likely continued to increase year on year as the number of cyber incidents continues to rise. Footnote 24\nMuch like the United States after 2013, many nations have seen a significant increase in malicious behaviour in cyberspace. The Council on Foreign Relations has reported that, with two notable dips in 2012 and 2016, cyber-espionage activity worldwide increased tenfold from 2009 to 2019. Footnote 25 Much of the damage caused by recent cyber incidents such as the WannaCry and NotPetya ransomware attacks, as well as routing and kinetic-equivalent attacks on media and industry, was concentrated outside of the United States. Paired with a significant increase in psychological, information-warfare activities, this has prompted many of the hardest-hit nations (including Australia, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, among others) to make significant adjustments to their cyber postures, in particular by building offensive capabilities. At the same time, anecdotal information suggests that not even these comparatively advanced nations have fully understood what these new cyber capabilities are actually intended to do – if they are intended to focus on ‘strategic strike’ (for instance against critical infrastructure), ‘battlefield cyber’ (acting as a sort of electronic warfare) or online covert action. Footnote 26 This relative confusion about mission parameters will only be accentuated by the new CYBERCOM vision.\nEarly US signalling in response to the Cartwright Conjecture may have intended to go beyond emphasising American strength in online covert action to illustrate the country's ability to conduct a 'global strike' of overwhelming force in wartime – in essence, framing cyber as a strategic capability, a kind of digital weapon of mass destruction. CYBERCOM's intent differs, however, from the low-level silent professionalism of those engaged in strategic deterrence or the targeted focus of tailored access operations in the intelligence world. The role model for persistent engagement is not strategic command or the intelligence community, but rather special-operations command, whose mission has been to counter the adversary all the time, everywhere.\nGeneral Nakasone has stated that, 'unlike the nuclear realm, where our strategic advantage or power comes from possessing a capability or weapons system, in cyberspace it's the use of cyber capabilities that is strategically consequential'. Footnote 27 Not only does this remark suggest that the United States must use offensive capabilities visibly, but it also implies that other nations have a clear interest in doing so as well. Yet encouraging a permissive norm that implicitly\nfavours cyber aggression as a tool of peacetime statecraft is likely only to expand the already murky grey area of modern conflict, and the difference between covert action and military activity. Footnote 28 A number of significant adverse effects can be expected among a range of countries – US allies and friends, neutrals and US adversaries alike – which are unlikely to be in the US interest.\nFirst-order effects: ‘out of band’ and ‘diagonal’ retaliation Jason Healey and Neil Jenkins have argued that the impact of the new persistent-engagement strategy could be assessed by looking at the number of cyber attacks against the US. A decline in attacks would indicate that the strategy was effective, while an increase would suggest it was ineffective or counterproductive. Footnote 29 This approach seems too simplistic for at least two reasons. Firstly, US adversaries may simply retaliate with non-cyber means, drawing on the example the US has already set. One of the most successful acts of US cyber deterrence was the use of Department of Justice indictments against specific foreign cyber actors. Following the indictment of five Chinese hackers associated with the People's Liberation Army in 2015, a landmark deal was reached between then-president Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping that resulted in a significant decline – by up to 90%, according to a report by the security company FireEye Footnote 30 – in Chinese-attributed intellectual-property theft. Other indictments against Russian and Iranian hackers have followed. US adversaries may seek to devise their own ‘out of band’ responses to US cyber activity, perhaps by drawing on the copious amount of leaked materials on offensive US cyber capabilities now in the public domain. Alternatively, they may respond with more ‘conventional’ means, for instance by increasing their support for the non-US side in adversarial situations such as trade conflicts, maritime disputes and weapons proliferation.\nUS adversaries might also respond ‘diagonally’ by responding with cyber-enabled means that defy the simple characterisation of ‘cyber attack’. The kind of social-media activity associated with Russia’s information-warfare campaign against the United States is but one example of this approach. Other cyber means could potentially be deployed in an even more covert manner, making attribution difficult even with the deployment of the United States’ full range of intelligence-collection measures.\nThe recent spate of cyber-crime attacks directed against state and local governments across the United States may be another example of a diagonal approach to cyber retaliation. From January to July 2019, more than 55 state and local governments in the US were hit by ransomware attacks. Footnote 31 Although there had been no public attribution of these activities to foreign actors by the time this article went to press, some of them used a stolen US cyber exploit, dubbed ‘EternalBlue’. This exploit had been posted for sale by a group calling itself ‘Shadow Brokers’, which some have speculated may be a front for Russian intelligence actors. Footnote 32 When cyber criminals did not immediately respond to the possibilities inherent in this new exploit, the WannaCry and NotPetya campaigns were launched, drawing attention not just to the possibilities\nof EternalBlue, but also to the efficacy of ransomware attacks themselves. Even if the current spate of cyber attacks against state and local governments in the US was not directed by a foreign adversary, it would be relatively easy for governments to encourage such activity in the future, thus inflicting real pain on targets and demonstrating the ability of national cyber defenders to respond to provocations.\nThe underlying enabling factor for this scenario is the poor state of basic national cyber security across the United States. A 2019 report by the US Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that of the 3,000 cybersecurity recommendations that have been made to federal agencies since 2010, more than 1,000 had yet to be implemented. Footnote  $^{33}$  These vulnerabilities also extend to the DoD's own basic war-fighting capabilities. According to a GAO report from 2018, 'almost all the weapons that the DOD tested between 2012 and 2017, including the F-35 jet and missile systems, have \"mission critical\" cyber vulnerabilities and can be \"easily hacked\" using \"relatively simple tools and techniques\". Footnote  $^{34}$  As poor as federal cyber-security efforts are, the situation at the state and local levels is significantly worse: a 2019 survey indicated that there remains a large difference between state and federal cyber-security capabilities. Footnote  $^{35}$  The state and local agencies polled said they had high confidence in their ability to 'prevent' a cyber attack in only  $19\\%$  of cases (compared to  $41\\%$  of federal agencies), and only  $28\\%$  of those canvassed said they would be able to 'recover' (versus  $55\\%$  of federal agencies). The nation's privately held critical infrastructure is more difficult to assess, but is largely considered to be more capable, and the United States' overall cyber-security stance tends to be ranked highly by more politically minded ratings – the International Telecommunications Union, for example, ranked the US overall at number two worldwide. Footnote  $^{36}$  More technical ratings, however, like that of the National Cyber Security Index, give the US a more middling assessment – placing it, for instance, in thirteenth place worldwide. Footnote  $^{37}$  The only good news, if it can be called that, to emerge from these findings is that the poor state of US national cyber security is mirrored by that of Russia and China.\n# Second-order effects: emerging cyber powers and their strategic dilemma\nA major reason for the vulnerable state of US cyber security has to do with scale – large nations have inherently more attack surface to cover, and the US easily has the greatest attack surface of them all. Footnote  $^{38}$  However, the opposite is therefore also true – smaller nations on balance have a much easier task in building national cyber security, and this has significant repercussions for how they play their own game of strategic deterrence. Yet the asymmetric strength of small players has been largely overlooked in most conventional analyses of cyber powers.\nSmaller nations often benefit from increased cooperation between the civilian and military, and state and non-state sectors, and generally face fewer challenges in coordinating emergency measures. Some even have the ability to disconnect from the global internet if necessary. Footnote 39 Smaller countries may also benefit from a more stringent legal and regulatory framework that requires a minimum level of cyber defence, not just from various levels of government but also from the private sector. For nations like, say, the Netherlands, the task of coordinating with 100–300 critical-infrastructure providers, and a comparable number of local and federal government networks, is a completely different task than dealing with many tens of thousands of civilian assets and non-military governmental networks, as in the United States. Footnote 40 A smaller attack surface means fewer critical-infrastructure providers that need to be communicated with, fewer government agency networks that need to be hardened and less scope for friction in a crisis. Essentially, this means that smaller advanced cyber nations have an inherent advantage in pursuing national cyber security compared with very large nations such as the United States, or indeed Russia and China. All things considered, a number of smaller nations might actually do quite well in a force-on-force conflict with a major cyber power. The ability of many smaller nations to potentially absorb cyber blows is no less significant in a wartime scenario than advantageous defensive geography would be in a ground operation. Yet the ‘high ground’ advantage of smaller states in presenting a smaller attack surface in the cyber domain may not have been adequately factored into analysts’ calculations, including those that informed the drafting of persistent engagement. As a corollary to this, smaller nations’ ability to conduct deterrence by punishment – a strategy that persistent engagement has heavily incentivised them to pursue – is not well understood.\nThe nature of the offensive cyber capabilities currently being developed by the ‘next 30’ nations examined in the 2016 CSIS study may not be clear, but there is no reason to believe that they relate only to cyber-crime-style scenarios, such as denial-of-service or even ransomware attacks. Instead, it should be assumed that these cyber powers can ‘turn the lights off’ – that is, launch a strategic strike on the critical infrastructure of an enemy. While it is much easier to temporarily shut down a nation’s infrastructure networks than to damage them beyond repair, ‘temporary’ disruptions can still impose catastrophic costs on a nation’s economy and limit its ability to maintain domestic order. The destructive potential of the next 30 may be orders of magnitude less than that of the United States or a near-peer cyber power, but some of these countries still possess a minimal deterrence capability that, much like the small nuclear arsenals of France, the UK and China, could inflict an unacceptable level of retaliatory punishment on a potential aggressor, no matter their overwhelming technical superiority. While detractors may say that mere cyber attacks should not be compared to the horror of a nuclear exchange, the effects of weeks-long black-outs, the destruction of financial information and the breakdown of most forms of communication should not be underestimated. The next-30 cyber nations may therefore possess something which was previously unavailable to them: not just a strategic-weapons capability – a\nvirtual strike force no less potent than a wing of bombers or ballistic missiles – but also a defensive advantage towards larger foes.\nThe sheer number of nations that may be able to reciprocally threaten a major power could be historically unprecedented. There was briefly a time, in the late 1950s, when it seemed possible that dozens of nations would eventually deploy nuclear weapons; even small countries like Switzerland deliberated the possibility of creating their own nuclear deterrent. Footnote 41 In the end, many of these opted to form alliances with existing nuclear powers instead. Today, persistent engagement may be changing the way such nations provide for their own security. Instead of depending on the protective umbrella of their friends, many now have their own budding deterrence-by-punishment capability in the cyber domain, in addition to having become better able to resist the effects of a strategic cyber strike against themselves. Some are also being incentivised by persistent engagement not only to develop offensive capabilities, but to use them as well. After all, persistent engagement postulates that cyber conflict is not only to be welcomed, but to be engaged in so as to be 'understood'. Any country not carrying out cyber attacks would, like those that did not test nuclear bombs, be excluded from the main table and left without a voice. This is seen as a perverse incentive by those who advocate for non-proliferation and argue that the increased distribution of destructive weapons increases the likelihood not only that one will be used, but that all will be used.\n# Third-order effects: weaponising information and changing the internet\nIn February 2019, it was reported that some unspecified action had been taken by CYBERCOM in November 2018 against the Internet Research Agency, a notorious social-media 'troll factory' headquartered in St Petersburg. The New York Times said that the organisation had been shut down 'for a number of days' as part of an effort to secure the US midterm elections. Footnote 42 Unlike many other parts of the Russian security apparatus, the Internet Research Agency does not seem to engage in 'hacking' – that is, it does not launch its own intrusions. Rather, it is widely accepted that the agency engages only in spreading disinformation, Footnote 43 something that may not even be illegal under international law. CYBERCOM's action against it may well have fallen beneath the 'use of force' or 'armed attack' threshold (a distinction not usually made in the United States anyway), but its public nature implies an acceptance of kinetic-effect cyber attacks – it sent the message that it is okay to hack what you consider 'fake news'.\nIf the targeting of actors that have only a propaganda function (rather than being directly responsible for cyber attacks) becomes normalised, then more conventional media organisations, as well as civil-society and non-governmental organisations, may become admissible targets. Russia might conclude, for example, that foreign support for domestic democracy activists falls\nunder the heading of ‘information and psychological actions aimed at undermining … the homeland’, to borrow language from the 2016 Russian Information Security Doctrine. Footnote 44 Likewise, Beijing might find Chinese-language translations of the New York Times provocative. Footnote 45 International disputes may emerge about ‘bad content’, such as propaganda, social-media campaigns and unkind opinion pieces. Footnote 46 In this way, persistent engagement might encourage the very risk that it was intended to alleviate: the weaponisation of information.\nIn June 2019, the New York Times reported that, at the same time the US was targeting the Information Research Agency, it was also deploying offensive cyber capabilities within the Russian power grid. Footnote 47 A similar intrusion of US power grids – using a malware package known as BlackEnergy – was noticed in 2011 and publicly reported on soon after. A version of BlackEnergy was also used in December 2015 to cause a large-scale blackout in western Ukraine. Footnote 48 These two intrusions, both of them attributed to Russia, ultimately drew attention to themselves, even though there was a blackout only in the 2015 action. In June 2019, however, the United States raised the ante. Rather than ‘allowing’ their own pre-deployment operation to be discovered and reported on by Russian actors, the Americans reported it themselves, stating that since 2018 US malware had been present in the Russian power grid in order to effect a kinetic-equivalent strike if necessary. The intent of this disclosure was likely to make it clear to the Russians that, if necessary, the US was ready to accept a level of ‘mutually assured disruption’. At least as important was the message that CYBERCOM had not abandoned its strategic-warfare role. Yet the United States’ public declaration of its willingness to significantly violate the sovereignty of an adversary in peacetime (something that would not happen when, say, fielding ballistic missiles) seems to present a novel situation for international law. It also provided strong reinforcement for the Russian and Chinese strategic narrative that politics is the extension of warfare, a reversal of Karl von Clausewitz’s famous definition of warfare as an extension of politics. By effectively declaring that the United States considered the pre-deployment of cyber weapons within an adversary’s critical infrastructure as being permissible (rather than simply being ‘caught in the act’, as the Russians were), CYBERCOM took a big step away from the established international legal order that the United States has helped to create. It also implicitly accepted a norm of mutual hostage-taking or ‘mutually assured debilitation’, a huge strategic concession that seems to imply US acceptance of a level of parity with adversaries where previously it could insist on hegemony. Moreover, it implied that CYBERCOM, if not the entire US government, has accepted the core Marxist–Leninist argument that ‘peacetime’ and ‘wartime’ are artificial distinctions.\nIt is clear that persistent engagement poses several direct challenges to the existing international order. For instance, not only does it mandate the forward- or pre-deployment of cyber weapons inside the networks of other countries before a dispute has crossed the threshold of armed conflict, it also suggests that operations beneath this threshold can be justified for any number of\nreasons, including as countermeasures against relatively ‘soft’ disinformation and propaganda activity. There is no reason to suppose that this way of thinking will be confined to the United States – any number of the next-30 cyber powers could also embrace these principles.\nPersistent engagement may also challenge the management, and therefore the shape and form, of the global internet as we know it. Depictions of cyberspace as increasingly violent will accelerate a growing trend to describe the management of the internet in security-related terms. This has been an abiding diplomatic objective of a sizeable faction of states, led by Russia and China, for many years – arguably since 1998. Footnote ⁴⁹ These states have proposed an International Code of Conduct for Information Security ‘, Footnote ⁵⁰ the latest version of which was endorsed by the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation in 2016. The greatest risk the code’s supporters see to their own cyber security is not so much infrastructure-targeting cyber attacks, but rather information warfare intended to achieve the despised outcome of ‘regime change’. For these cyber powers, encouraging diplomatic discussion on ‘countering foreign political influence’ is a key objective.\nTo further this goal, backers of the Code of Conduct have challenged the way the global internet is run. To date, the internet has been managed by a regime comprising multiple government, civil-society and private-sector actors. Footnote ⁵¹ This is known as the multi-stakeholder approach to internet governance, and it has proven to be remarkably resilient, as well as beneficial for the internet’s growth. Yet Code of Conduct supporters wish to replace this multi-stakeholder model with an intergovernmental one. They also wish to ‘securitise’ cyberspace by shifting norms of surveillance, data protection and human rights online, a desire that has been expressed by some Western governments too. In May 2015, Theresa May, then prime minister of the UK, announced that the British government would be taking a much more restrictive approach to user behaviour in cyberspace and to internet freedoms in general in response to a number of terrorist incidents. May was fiercely criticised when she refused to counter accusations that these amounted to Chinese-style internet restrictions. Footnote ⁵²\nAlready, some governments have misused critical internet infrastructure to facilitate their own espionage activity, such as in the 2019 attacks attributed to Iranian actors on the Domain Name System (sometimes described as the ‘telephone book’ of the internet). Footnote ⁵³ There is also interest in connecting the management of the Domain Name System to international efforts intended to counter cyber crime, including the dissemination of ‘bad content’, as variously defined. In this sense, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s argument that changing the management of internet resources is needed to halt the rise in cyber conflict may be gaining ground.\nIf the liberal-democratic argument that the multi-stakeholder model has worked well and served as an effective firebreak against authoritarian desires to control the internet is rejected, then all\nusers – including those in liberal democracies – will be faced with a very different information environment than that of the previous 20 years. In this new environment, all information is likely to be treated as a potential weapon, and thus subject to government intervention and state negotiations. By effectively encouraging cyber conflict, the persistent-engagement vision greatly increases the appeal of the argument that a much stronger government role in achieving ‘cyber peace’ is needed, and that ultimately, this perilous domain needs an intergovernmental model to manage it.\n*\n*\nPersistent engagement may be driving unwanted effects in a number of ways, but the mixed signalling and over-communication the strategy encourages seem particularly at fault. Publicly advocating in favour of the use of offensive cyber means can only be detrimental to international peace and security, and produce an overall increase in cyber conflict. Emerging cyber nations will be incentivised not only to develop offensive cyber capabilities but also to use them – which may lead to the discovery that they can in fact compete with great powers. At the same time, hallowed principles of international order and internet governance may be undermined, to the benefit of countries whose interests may run counter to those of the United States and liberal democracies everywhere.\nA reconsideration of the basic premises of persistent engagement may show that past US deterrence policy was actually effective – as in the case of the US–China deal that produced a decline in Chinese intellectual-property theft. It may also show that the current high level of cyber aggression has resulted from foreign perceptions of US strength, not US weakness. Instead of publicly reinforcing its dominant posture and conflating transparency with propaganda, the United States might be better served by walking more softly in cyberspace even as it retains a big stick.\nAdopting a policy of genuine transparency would have a much-needed stabilising effect by limiting the threat of inadvertent escalation or loss of escalation control. Such a policy should feature multilevel discussions, with varying levels of confidentiality, about strategic cyber capabilities and their command and control, alongside ongoing international discussions on norms of restraint. Footnote 54 The obvious benefits of this approach explain why the United States' closest allies and partners have almost unanimously advocated for it. Any covert cyber activities that impair these discussions, rather than advancing them, should remain just that - covert. Otherwise, mixing signals in the cyber domain is a recipe for serious adverse effects that threaten to undermine the security not just of the United States, but of all liberal democracies and of the internet itself.\n# Acknowledgements\nParts of this article were commissioned as a White Paper for the US Cyberspace Solarium Commission."

      "flat_text": "# Abstract\nSome risks of 'persistent engagement' could be mitigated by reducing its reliance on mixed signals and public communication.\nPrevious article View issue table of contents Next article\nThe conduct and deployment of the United States Cyber Command's (CYBERCOM) vision of 'persistent engagement' represents a radical and largely unwelcome departure from previous notions of conflict in cyberspace. It builds on a number of questionable assumptions about the international history and perception of cyber conflict, the role and strategic direction of information warfare, and the general dynamics of deterrence. Ultimately, it justifies a much more aggressive CYBERCOM mission that ignores the potential for unwanted effects that could prove to be highly destabilising in an already volatile international security environment. Overall, persistent engagement is a very high-risk approach to developing cyber deterrence that is likely to not only trigger new forms of retaliation but also accelerate the already rapid international proliferation of offensive cyber capabilities. In the worst-case scenario, it may even pose a risk to the internet as we know it. Some of the risks associated with the concept could, however, be partially alleviated by reducing its reliance on mixed signals and an excess of public communication.\n# Persistent engagement: theory and criticism\nThe promotion of CYBERCOM to a fully independent combat command in 2018 marked the emancipation of US military cyber capabilities from the intelligence world. While some observers, including the present author, thought that this development might help foster much-needed transparency on cyber capabilities, recent developments have taken a darker turn. Footnote  $^{1}$  Building on an already controversial doctrine of 'active defense in cyberspace', the US Department of Defense (DoD) put forward a new public cyber strategy in 2018 that emphasised the concept of 'defend forward'. Footnote  $^{2}$  According to Jeff Kosseff of the United States Naval Academy, defending forward has three basic components: positioning, warning and influencing. Footnote  $^{3}$  CYBERCOM's vision of persistent engagement, which represents the implementation of the DoD strategy, encompasses all three activities, and while each can be criticised as potentially destabilising to international security, the operation-alisation of the 'influencing' component may be particularly so.\nCYBERCOM's General Paul Nakasone gave an indication of what was to come when, in his Senate confirmation hearings in March 2018, he was asked about deterring Russian and Chinese cyber attacks. 'They do not think that much will happen to them', he responded. 'They do not\nfear us.' He went on to say that, 'As cyberspace develops, the longer that we have inactivity, the longer our adversaries are able to establish their own norms – and I think that is very, very important that we realize that.' Footnote 4 This view was reflected in the DoD cyber strategy of defend forward, leveraging the already well-established 'persistent presence' of CYBERCOM in adversaries' networks into an actual operational mandate to disrupt any emerging attacks and thus to 'persistently engage'. Footnote 5 To accomplish this, Nakasone has indicated that CYBERCOM will not be a 'response force' anymore, but rather a force that engages in operations 'below the level of armed attack' on a running basis. Footnote 6\nOverall, CYBERCOM is being positioned less as a strategic-weapons carrier and a key element of an overall strategic-deterrence capability, and more as a special-operations command. The risk of getting these roles entangled is evident with the reversal of traditional signalling practices, with more talk about usually non-public, covert-action-type roles, and less about potential strategic (that is, 'above the threshold of armed attack') capabilities to be used in wartime. The evolving vision of persistent engagement has largely been communicated through a series of articles and press releases, rather than through official publications and doctrines. Footnote 7 This is in keeping with the strategy's dependence on public signals to communicate intent to adversaries. While a discussion of strategic-warfare capabilities would increase transparency and probably increase stability, the sudden emphasis on public discussion of low-level, peacetime cyber attacks is doing the opposite. As decades of experience with arms control have shown, transparency on strategic weapons helps reduce the scope for misunderstandings, provides for clarity of intent, and helps establish norms of restraint and communication. But public communication of offensive covert action – revealing to the public details of secret attacks conducted against an adversary – generally does the reverse, both fostering norms of aggression and underlining the lack of communication. What is true of the conventional-arms world is doubly so in cyberspace, the eponymous information domain where kinetic cyber warfare (officially 'information operations') has an uneasy but undoubted symbiosis with its non-kinetic cousin, 'information warfare', with its emphasis on propaganda, disinformation and covert influencing. As Nakasone has said, in cyberspace the principle danger is the weaponisation of information. Footnote 8 Unfortunately, the signalling mandated by persistent engagement has extended to over-communication in public – itself an example of weaponised information that diminishes the benefits of the defend-forward strategy, lends legitimacy to information-warfare operations as a form of conflict and simultaneously encourages an already accelerating cyber arms race.\nThe empirical justification of CYBERCOM's new offensive vision has been shaky from the start. The academic underpinnings of persistent engagement were presented in a 2017 article by Richard Harknett and Michael Fischerkeller, which was released just as the former was concluding his stint as CYBERCOM's first resident scholar. Footnote 9 The very title of the article, 'Deterrence Is Not a Credible Strategy for Cyberspace', indicates that the authors thought\nit was possible (and desirable) to frame the strategy as one of ‘non-deterrence’. Their analysis rests on the belief that, as part of an ‘agreed competition’ concept, it would be possible to completely contain cyber conflict within its own domain. This would be non-escalatory due to the invisible hand of ‘tacit bargaining’, through which adversaries would feel out the borders of allowable conflict and come to a stable conflict scenario. According to this logic, not only is there less chance of inadvertent escalation over the threshold of armed conflict when engaging in the cyber domain, but this kind of engagement would also avoid retaliation in other domains, such as diplomacy and trade, or even in physical conflict zones, such as Syria and the Persian Gulf. The authors also seem to suggest that cyber could effectively function as a ‘pressure valve’ for international tensions, concentrating the inevitable tit for tat (the tacit bargaining) of international security to a more controllable and less dangerous environment. Footnote 10\nThe many suppositions of Harknett and Fischerkeller’s article have been roundly criticised. Footnote 11 Although the idea of agreed competition is presented as deriving from Herman Kahn’s idea of ‘agreed battle’, the article never answers the basic question of why an adversary would allow itself to be constrained in a way that clearly favours the United States. Cyber experts Brandon Valeriano and Benjamin Jensen have drawn on a comprehensive historical dataset of cyber operations to argue instead that such operations on their own seldom produce concessions. Normally, they need to be accompanied by other actions, such as diplomatic overtures, to work – an approach which the authors contend the US has employed to great effect in the past, despite Nakasone’s assessment that cyber deterrence has failed. Footnote 12 Overall, few observers would agree that outcomes in cyberspace are as easy to predict as advocates of persistent engagement seem to believe. On the contrary, the basic assumption of diplomacy over at least the last decade is that cyberspace is the domain most prone to misinterpretation and miscalculation. Footnote 13 Finally, there is no clear theory of victory in persistent engagement and no strategic endgame, only the purpose of creating operational advantages in cyberspace. There is no agreement as to what the basic strategic game is, or what constitutes its winning and losing factors.\nMore troublingly, persistent engagement does not articulate a sound reasoning as to why any escalation in cyberspace would produce good outcomes for the United States. Tom Bossert, US President Donald Trump’s first homeland security advisor, has explicitly questioned parts of the strategy. In a June 2018 Wired article, he is quoted as saying, ‘I want to make sure we don’t end up in an escalatory cyber exchange where we lose more than they do’, and as pointing out that ‘in many respects the US economy and infrastructure is far more reliant on digitization and automation than Russia’s, giving the Kremlin an inherent advantage in any future no-holdsbarred cyberwar. He paraphrases former US secretary of defense Ash Carter: “If you’re doused in gasoline, don’t start a match-throwing contest.”’ Footnote 14\nThe entire rationale for the strategy, as outlined by Nakasone himself, relies on a version of cyber history that not all observers will agree with. For instance, Nakasone has said that the US mostly faced an intelligence-gathering threat before 2013, which then escalated into denial-based attacks before moving towards destructive attacks (presumably including information-warfare attacks in 2016) and preparations for armed conflict. Footnote 15 Overlooked by this narrative is any consideration of how the adversary – or even many US friends and allies – would see the causality of these developments. In an alternative narrative, US dominance in persistent-presence espionage was publicly revealed through the intelligence disclosures of 2013, at the same time as the first real cyber weapon, Stuxnet, was attributed to the United States. Among allies in Europe, such as Germany, these revelations were often badly received, and the reaction among neutrals, such as Brazil, was even more negative. Not many European observers would agree with the assessment of persistent engagement's supporters that the US has been 'too passive' in cyberspace. In some cases, a different conclusion can be drawn: that cyber attacks have been responses to US activity. Nakasone has cited Iranian cyber aggression to justify persistent engagement, but Iranian activities can also be framed as responses to US cyber operations, such as Stuxnet and Flame. Footnote 16 The Shamoon malware that Iran used to target Saudi Arabia reused components of the US-attributed Flame malware – effectively directing a US cyber weapon back at one of its allies. Footnote 17 Seen from this perspective, at least some of the increase in cyber-related activity directed against the United States has been a direct result of public disclosures of the advanced state of US cyber capabilities and operations. Instead of producing a deterrent effect, these disclosures seem to have contributed to an increase in cyber tensions. This does not bode well for the principle of persistent engagement as currently expressed.\nBoth the academic theory and the policy statements surrounding persistent engagement have a strained relationship with the overall concept of deterrence, as well as with those of balance of power, proliferation and arms control. Before 2016, modern US deterrence followed a logic that is often expressed as a ladder, from entanglement, norms and resilience to punishment. Footnote 18 Purists may argue that only the last two – the ability to absorb an attack, and the ability to conduct an attack – represent classic deterrence. Footnote 19 Contending that the US strategy of 'denial' or 'resilience' has clearly failed in recent years, they have turned to an existing solution for the problem and radically reinterpreted it. In 2011, the nascent weakness in US cyber-deterrence policy – insofar as this had been formally expressed – had already been identified as a lack of 'credibility' or, in technical terms, a seeming inability to communicate the strength of US cyber capabilities in order to dissuade an adversary. It was the same conundrum made famous by Dr. Strangelove – how can one expect a deterrent effect if the very instrument of deterrence is a secret? In cyber terms, the effect was dubbed the 'Cartwright Conjecture' by Jason Healey after General James Cartwright, the former head of Strategic Command who, in 2011, was already complaining that 'we've got to talk about our offensive capabilities and train to them; to make\nthem credible ... You can't have something that's a secret be a deterrent. Because if you don't know it's there, it doesn't scare you.' Footnote 20 This was by no means an isolated message. Footnote 21 At that time, the strategic capability being communicated was one of overwhelming US intelligence-gathering capabilities.\nWithin the US government, intelligence-gathering capabilities have resolutely been portrayed as neutral, or even defensive, in nature. Yet many allies, as well as private-sector actors within the US itself, do not share this view. A number of foreign leaders – not only of neutral countries, but of friends and allies of the US – have concluded that the United States' ability to maintain a persistent presence on all kinds of networks is tantamount to being able to strike them at will. Never mind that it takes time to prepare complicated strikes across highly segmented networks, or that it can be difficult for CYBERCOM to get campaigns approved through the interagency process – these are problems only the attacker can see. From a defender's point of view, it can be very difficult to differentiate between advanced espionage attempts and imminent acts of war – including by the United States. When US dominance in persistent presence became publicly apparent after 2013, it was only natural that a number of nations – some of them US adversaries, but not all – feared that it would not be long before the US took the simple step from persistent presence to persistent engagement. Although major US initiatives such as the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (launched in 2009 with an estimated budget of $40 billion over five years) were cast as being 'defensive' in nature, the programmes could clearly serve as the foundation for offensive cyber activity: the same sensors and implants intended to provide warning of hostile cyber activity could easily be repurposed for offensive activity. This being the case, and given the historical record of presumed US cyber operations, Nakasone's claims in his 2017 Senate confirmation hearing that the United States has been a passive actor in cyberspace seems disingenuous, at best.\nThe significant increase in all forms of offensive cyber behaviour against the US after 2013 has been described as a deterrence failure. Yet advocates of persistent engagement have been unable to explain why deterrence failed, or to express whether the failure was complete or only partial. There is at least some evidence to suggest that the escalation was due to perceived US strength in cyber, not weakness. Following the work of Valeriano and Jensen, whose dataset indicates that responses to cyber attacks have historically been proportional and not intentionally escalatory, Footnote 22 this could imply that some of the increased activity publicly reported since 2013 may in fact have been responses by US adversaries – responses that have been recalibrated to take into account a much more dominant US position in cyberspace than these adversaries had been aware of.\nEither way, friendly and less friendly nations alike have rushed to compete in an escalating cyber arms race, one which the US may have played a decisive role in accelerating even before the publication of persistent engagement. Footnote 23 The very term 'cyber arms race', while not\nparticularly contentious in itself, is difficult to fully circumscribe. The phenomenon bears little resemblance to historic arms races and cannot be quantified by numbers of weapons systems, as was possible during the missile-gap race of the 1960s or the battleship/dreadnought race of the 1900s. Yet even though it is not even clear exactly what these offensive capabilities entail, there is little disagreement that a number of nations are increasingly seeking them, and that the overall level of destructive cyber attacks is rising. A 2016 study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) estimated that at least 30 nations were actively pursuing offensive cyber capabilities, a number that has likely continued to increase year on year as the number of cyber incidents continues to rise. Footnote 24\nMuch like the United States after 2013, many nations have seen a significant increase in malicious behaviour in cyberspace. The Council on Foreign Relations has reported that, with two notable dips in 2012 and 2016, cyber-espionage activity worldwide increased tenfold from 2009 to 2019. Footnote 25 Much of the damage caused by recent cyber incidents such as the WannaCry and NotPetya ransomware attacks, as well as routing and kinetic-equivalent attacks on media and industry, was concentrated outside of the United States. Paired with a significant increase in psychological, information-warfare activities, this has prompted many of the hardest-hit nations (including Australia, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, among others) to make significant adjustments to their cyber postures, in particular by building offensive capabilities. At the same time, anecdotal information suggests that not even these comparatively advanced nations have fully understood what these new cyber capabilities are actually intended to do – if they are intended to focus on ‘strategic strike’ (for instance against critical infrastructure), ‘battlefield cyber’ (acting as a sort of electronic warfare) or online covert action. Footnote 26 This relative confusion about mission parameters will only be accentuated by the new CYBERCOM vision.\nEarly US signalling in response to the Cartwright Conjecture may have intended to go beyond emphasising American strength in online covert action to illustrate the country's ability to conduct a 'global strike' of overwhelming force in wartime – in essence, framing cyber as a strategic capability, a kind of digital weapon of mass destruction. CYBERCOM's intent differs, however, from the low-level silent professionalism of those engaged in strategic deterrence or the targeted focus of tailored access operations in the intelligence world. The role model for persistent engagement is not strategic command or the intelligence community, but rather special-operations command, whose mission has been to counter the adversary all the time, everywhere.\nGeneral Nakasone has stated that, 'unlike the nuclear realm, where our strategic advantage or power comes from possessing a capability or weapons system, in cyberspace it's the use of cyber capabilities that is strategically consequential'. Footnote 27 Not only does this remark suggest that the United States must use offensive capabilities visibly, but it also implies that other nations have a clear interest in doing so as well. Yet encouraging a permissive norm that implicitly\nfavours cyber aggression as a tool of peacetime statecraft is likely only to expand the already murky grey area of modern conflict, and the difference between covert action and military activity. Footnote 28 A number of significant adverse effects can be expected among a range of countries – US allies and friends, neutrals and US adversaries alike – which are unlikely to be in the US interest.\nFirst-order effects: ‘out of band’ and ‘diagonal’ retaliation Jason Healey and Neil Jenkins have argued that the impact of the new persistent-engagement strategy could be assessed by looking at the number of cyber attacks against the US. A decline in attacks would indicate that the strategy was effective, while an increase would suggest it was ineffective or counterproductive. Footnote 29 This approach seems too simplistic for at least two reasons. Firstly, US adversaries may simply retaliate with non-cyber means, drawing on the example the US has already set. One of the most successful acts of US cyber deterrence was the use of Department of Justice indictments against specific foreign cyber actors. Following the indictment of five Chinese hackers associated with the People's Liberation Army in 2015, a landmark deal was reached between then-president Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping that resulted in a significant decline – by up to 90%, according to a report by the security company FireEye Footnote 30 – in Chinese-attributed intellectual-property theft. Other indictments against Russian and Iranian hackers have followed. US adversaries may seek to devise their own ‘out of band’ responses to US cyber activity, perhaps by drawing on the copious amount of leaked materials on offensive US cyber capabilities now in the public domain. Alternatively, they may respond with more ‘conventional’ means, for instance by increasing their support for the non-US side in adversarial situations such as trade conflicts, maritime disputes and weapons proliferation.\nUS adversaries might also respond ‘diagonally’ by responding with cyber-enabled means that defy the simple characterisation of ‘cyber attack’. The kind of social-media activity associated with Russia’s information-warfare campaign against the United States is but one example of this approach. Other cyber means could potentially be deployed in an even more covert manner, making attribution difficult even with the deployment of the United States’ full range of intelligence-collection measures.\nThe recent spate of cyber-crime attacks directed against state and local governments across the United States may be another example of a diagonal approach to cyber retaliation. From January to July 2019, more than 55 state and local governments in the US were hit by ransomware attacks. Footnote 31 Although there had been no public attribution of these activities to foreign actors by the time this article went to press, some of them used a stolen US cyber exploit, dubbed ‘EternalBlue’. This exploit had been posted for sale by a group calling itself ‘Shadow Brokers’, which some have speculated may be a front for Russian intelligence actors. Footnote 32 When cyber criminals did not immediately respond to the possibilities inherent in this new exploit, the WannaCry and NotPetya campaigns were launched, drawing attention not just to the possibilities\nof EternalBlue, but also to the efficacy of ransomware attacks themselves. Even if the current spate of cyber attacks against state and local governments in the US was not directed by a foreign adversary, it would be relatively easy for governments to encourage such activity in the future, thus inflicting real pain on targets and demonstrating the ability of national cyber defenders to respond to provocations.\nThe underlying enabling factor for this scenario is the poor state of basic national cyber security across the United States. A 2019 report by the US Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that of the 3,000 cybersecurity recommendations that have been made to federal agencies since 2010, more than 1,000 had yet to be implemented. Footnote  $^{33}$  These vulnerabilities also extend to the DoD's own basic war-fighting capabilities. According to a GAO report from 2018, 'almost all the weapons that the DOD tested between 2012 and 2017, including the F-35 jet and missile systems, have \"mission critical\" cyber vulnerabilities and can be \"easily hacked\" using \"relatively simple tools and techniques\". Footnote  $^{34}$  As poor as federal cyber-security efforts are, the situation at the state and local levels is significantly worse: a 2019 survey indicated that there remains a large difference between state and federal cyber-security capabilities. Footnote  $^{35}$  The state and local agencies polled said they had high confidence in their ability to 'prevent' a cyber attack in only  $19\\%$  of cases (compared to  $41\\%$  of federal agencies), and only  $28\\%$  of those canvassed said they would be able to 'recover' (versus  $55\\%$  of federal agencies). The nation's privately held critical infrastructure is more difficult to assess, but is largely considered to be more capable, and the United States' overall cyber-security stance tends to be ranked highly by more politically minded ratings – the International Telecommunications Union, for example, ranked the US overall at number two worldwide. Footnote  $^{36}$  More technical ratings, however, like that of the National Cyber Security Index, give the US a more middling assessment – placing it, for instance, in thirteenth place worldwide. Footnote  $^{37}$  The only good news, if it can be called that, to emerge from these findings is that the poor state of US national cyber security is mirrored by that of Russia and China.\n# Second-order effects: emerging cyber powers and their strategic dilemma\nA major reason for the vulnerable state of US cyber security has to do with scale – large nations have inherently more attack surface to cover, and the US easily has the greatest attack surface of them all. Footnote  $^{38}$  However, the opposite is therefore also true – smaller nations on balance have a much easier task in building national cyber security, and this has significant repercussions for how they play their own game of strategic deterrence. Yet the asymmetric strength of small players has been largely overlooked in most conventional analyses of cyber powers.\nSmaller nations often benefit from increased cooperation between the civilian and military, and state and non-state sectors, and generally face fewer challenges in coordinating emergency measures. Some even have the ability to disconnect from the global internet if necessary. Footnote 39 Smaller countries may also benefit from a more stringent legal and regulatory framework that requires a minimum level of cyber defence, not just from various levels of government but also from the private sector. For nations like, say, the Netherlands, the task of coordinating with 100–300 critical-infrastructure providers, and a comparable number of local and federal government networks, is a completely different task than dealing with many tens of thousands of civilian assets and non-military governmental networks, as in the United States. Footnote 40 A smaller attack surface means fewer critical-infrastructure providers that need to be communicated with, fewer government agency networks that need to be hardened and less scope for friction in a crisis. Essentially, this means that smaller advanced cyber nations have an inherent advantage in pursuing national cyber security compared with very large nations such as the United States, or indeed Russia and China. All things considered, a number of smaller nations might actually do quite well in a force-on-force conflict with a major cyber power. The ability of many smaller nations to potentially absorb cyber blows is no less significant in a wartime scenario than advantageous defensive geography would be in a ground operation. Yet the ‘high ground’ advantage of smaller states in presenting a smaller attack surface in the cyber domain may not have been adequately factored into analysts’ calculations, including those that informed the drafting of persistent engagement. As a corollary to this, smaller nations’ ability to conduct deterrence by punishment – a strategy that persistent engagement has heavily incentivised them to pursue – is not well understood.\nThe nature of the offensive cyber capabilities currently being developed by the ‘next 30’ nations examined in the 2016 CSIS study may not be clear, but there is no reason to believe that they relate only to cyber-crime-style scenarios, such as denial-of-service or even ransomware attacks. Instead, it should be assumed that these cyber powers can ‘turn the lights off’ – that is, launch a strategic strike on the critical infrastructure of an enemy. While it is much easier to temporarily shut down a nation’s infrastructure networks than to damage them beyond repair, ‘temporary’ disruptions can still impose catastrophic costs on a nation’s economy and limit its ability to maintain domestic order. The destructive potential of the next 30 may be orders of magnitude less than that of the United States or a near-peer cyber power, but some of these countries still possess a minimal deterrence capability that, much like the small nuclear arsenals of France, the UK and China, could inflict an unacceptable level of retaliatory punishment on a potential aggressor, no matter their overwhelming technical superiority. While detractors may say that mere cyber attacks should not be compared to the horror of a nuclear exchange, the effects of weeks-long black-outs, the destruction of financial information and the breakdown of most forms of communication should not be underestimated. The next-30 cyber nations may therefore possess something which was previously unavailable to them: not just a strategic-weapons capability – a\nvirtual strike force no less potent than a wing of bombers or ballistic missiles – but also a defensive advantage towards larger foes.\nThe sheer number of nations that may be able to reciprocally threaten a major power could be historically unprecedented. There was briefly a time, in the late 1950s, when it seemed possible that dozens of nations would eventually deploy nuclear weapons; even small countries like Switzerland deliberated the possibility of creating their own nuclear deterrent. Footnote 41 In the end, many of these opted to form alliances with existing nuclear powers instead. Today, persistent engagement may be changing the way such nations provide for their own security. Instead of depending on the protective umbrella of their friends, many now have their own budding deterrence-by-punishment capability in the cyber domain, in addition to having become better able to resist the effects of a strategic cyber strike against themselves. Some are also being incentivised by persistent engagement not only to develop offensive capabilities, but to use them as well. After all, persistent engagement postulates that cyber conflict is not only to be welcomed, but to be engaged in so as to be 'understood'. Any country not carrying out cyber attacks would, like those that did not test nuclear bombs, be excluded from the main table and left without a voice. This is seen as a perverse incentive by those who advocate for non-proliferation and argue that the increased distribution of destructive weapons increases the likelihood not only that one will be used, but that all will be used.\n# Third-order effects: weaponising information and changing the internet\nIn February 2019, it was reported that some unspecified action had been taken by CYBERCOM in November 2018 against the Internet Research Agency, a notorious social-media 'troll factory' headquartered in St Petersburg. The New York Times said that the organisation had been shut down 'for a number of days' as part of an effort to secure the US midterm elections. Footnote 42 Unlike many other parts of the Russian security apparatus, the Internet Research Agency does not seem to engage in 'hacking' – that is, it does not launch its own intrusions. Rather, it is widely accepted that the agency engages only in spreading disinformation, Footnote 43 something that may not even be illegal under international law. CYBERCOM's action against it may well have fallen beneath the 'use of force' or 'armed attack' threshold (a distinction not usually made in the United States anyway), but its public nature implies an acceptance of kinetic-effect cyber attacks – it sent the message that it is okay to hack what you consider 'fake news'.\nIf the targeting of actors that have only a propaganda function (rather than being directly responsible for cyber attacks) becomes normalised, then more conventional media organisations, as well as civil-society and non-governmental organisations, may become admissible targets. Russia might conclude, for example, that foreign support for domestic democracy activists falls\nunder the heading of ‘information and psychological actions aimed at undermining … the homeland’, to borrow language from the 2016 Russian Information Security Doctrine. Footnote 44 Likewise, Beijing might find Chinese-language translations of the New York Times provocative. Footnote 45 International disputes may emerge about ‘bad content’, such as propaganda, social-media campaigns and unkind opinion pieces. Footnote 46 In this way, persistent engagement might encourage the very risk that it was intended to alleviate: the weaponisation of information.\nIn June 2019, the New York Times reported that, at the same time the US was targeting the Information Research Agency, it was also deploying offensive cyber capabilities within the Russian power grid. Footnote 47 A similar intrusion of US power grids – using a malware package known as BlackEnergy – was noticed in 2011 and publicly reported on soon after. A version of BlackEnergy was also used in December 2015 to cause a large-scale blackout in western Ukraine. Footnote 48 These two intrusions, both of them attributed to Russia, ultimately drew attention to themselves, even though there was a blackout only in the 2015 action. In June 2019, however, the United States raised the ante. Rather than ‘allowing’ their own pre-deployment operation to be discovered and reported on by Russian actors, the Americans reported it themselves, stating that since 2018 US malware had been present in the Russian power grid in order to effect a kinetic-equivalent strike if necessary. The intent of this disclosure was likely to make it clear to the Russians that, if necessary, the US was ready to accept a level of ‘mutually assured disruption’. At least as important was the message that CYBERCOM had not abandoned its strategic-warfare role. Yet the United States’ public declaration of its willingness to significantly violate the sovereignty of an adversary in peacetime (something that would not happen when, say, fielding ballistic missiles) seems to present a novel situation for international law. It also provided strong reinforcement for the Russian and Chinese strategic narrative that politics is the extension of warfare, a reversal of Karl von Clausewitz’s famous definition of warfare as an extension of politics. By effectively declaring that the United States considered the pre-deployment of cyber weapons within an adversary’s critical infrastructure as being permissible (rather than simply being ‘caught in the act’, as the Russians were), CYBERCOM took a big step away from the established international legal order that the United States has helped to create. It also implicitly accepted a norm of mutual hostage-taking or ‘mutually assured debilitation’, a huge strategic concession that seems to imply US acceptance of a level of parity with adversaries where previously it could insist on hegemony. Moreover, it implied that CYBERCOM, if not the entire US government, has accepted the core Marxist–Leninist argument that ‘peacetime’ and ‘wartime’ are artificial distinctions.\nIt is clear that persistent engagement poses several direct challenges to the existing international order. For instance, not only does it mandate the forward- or pre-deployment of cyber weapons inside the networks of other countries before a dispute has crossed the threshold of armed conflict, it also suggests that operations beneath this threshold can be justified for any number of\nreasons, including as countermeasures against relatively ‘soft’ disinformation and propaganda activity. There is no reason to suppose that this way of thinking will be confined to the United States – any number of the next-30 cyber powers could also embrace these principles.\nPersistent engagement may also challenge the management, and therefore the shape and form, of the global internet as we know it. Depictions of cyberspace as increasingly violent will accelerate a growing trend to describe the management of the internet in security-related terms. This has been an abiding diplomatic objective of a sizeable faction of states, led by Russia and China, for many years – arguably since 1998. Footnote ⁴⁹ These states have proposed an International Code of Conduct for Information Security ‘, Footnote ⁵⁰ the latest version of which was endorsed by the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation in 2016. The greatest risk the code’s supporters see to their own cyber security is not so much infrastructure-targeting cyber attacks, but rather information warfare intended to achieve the despised outcome of ‘regime change’. For these cyber powers, encouraging diplomatic discussion on ‘countering foreign political influence’ is a key objective.\nTo further this goal, backers of the Code of Conduct have challenged the way the global internet is run. To date, the internet has been managed by a regime comprising multiple government, civil-society and private-sector actors. Footnote ⁵¹ This is known as the multi-stakeholder approach to internet governance, and it has proven to be remarkably resilient, as well as beneficial for the internet’s growth. Yet Code of Conduct supporters wish to replace this multi-stakeholder model with an intergovernmental one. They also wish to ‘securitise’ cyberspace by shifting norms of surveillance, data protection and human rights online, a desire that has been expressed by some Western governments too. In May 2015, Theresa May, then prime minister of the UK, announced that the British government would be taking a much more restrictive approach to user behaviour in cyberspace and to internet freedoms in general in response to a number of terrorist incidents. May was fiercely criticised when she refused to counter accusations that these amounted to Chinese-style internet restrictions. Footnote ⁵²\nAlready, some governments have misused critical internet infrastructure to facilitate their own espionage activity, such as in the 2019 attacks attributed to Iranian actors on the Domain Name System (sometimes described as the ‘telephone book’ of the internet). Footnote ⁵³ There is also interest in connecting the management of the Domain Name System to international efforts intended to counter cyber crime, including the dissemination of ‘bad content’, as variously defined. In this sense, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s argument that changing the management of internet resources is needed to halt the rise in cyber conflict may be gaining ground.\nIf the liberal-democratic argument that the multi-stakeholder model has worked well and served as an effective firebreak against authoritarian desires to control the internet is rejected, then all\nusers – including those in liberal democracies – will be faced with a very different information environment than that of the previous 20 years. In this new environment, all information is likely to be treated as a potential weapon, and thus subject to government intervention and state negotiations. By effectively encouraging cyber conflict, the persistent-engagement vision greatly increases the appeal of the argument that a much stronger government role in achieving ‘cyber peace’ is needed, and that ultimately, this perilous domain needs an intergovernmental model to manage it.\n*\n*\nPersistent engagement may be driving unwanted effects in a number of ways, but the mixed signalling and over-communication the strategy encourages seem particularly at fault. Publicly advocating in favour of the use of offensive cyber means can only be detrimental to international peace and security, and produce an overall increase in cyber conflict. Emerging cyber nations will be incentivised not only to develop offensive cyber capabilities but also to use them – which may lead to the discovery that they can in fact compete with great powers. At the same time, hallowed principles of international order and internet governance may be undermined, to the benefit of countries whose interests may run counter to those of the United States and liberal democracies everywhere.\nA reconsideration of the basic premises of persistent engagement may show that past US deterrence policy was actually effective – as in the case of the US–China deal that produced a decline in Chinese intellectual-property theft. It may also show that the current high level of cyber aggression has resulted from foreign perceptions of US strength, not US weakness. Instead of publicly reinforcing its dominant posture and conflating transparency with propaganda, the United States might be better served by walking more softly in cyberspace even as it retains a big stick.\nAdopting a policy of genuine transparency would have a much-needed stabilising effect by limiting the threat of inadvertent escalation or loss of escalation control. Such a policy should feature multilevel discussions, with varying levels of confidentiality, about strategic cyber capabilities and their command and control, alongside ongoing international discussions on norms of restraint. Footnote 54 The obvious benefits of this approach explain why the United States' closest allies and partners have almost unanimously advocated for it. Any covert cyber activities that impair these discussions, rather than advancing them, should remain just that - covert. Otherwise, mixing signals in the cyber domain is a recipe for serious adverse effects that threaten to undermine the security not just of the United States, but of all liberal democracies and of the internet itself.\n# Acknowledgements\nParts of this article were commissioned as a White Paper for the US Cyberspace Solarium Commission."

While some observers, including the present author, thought that this development might help foster much-needed transparency on cyber capabilities, recent developments have taken a darker turn. Footnote  $^{1}$  Building on an already controversial doctrine of 'active defense in cyberspace', the US Department of Defense (DoD) put forward a new public cyber strategy in 2018 that emphasised the concept of 'defend forward'. Footnote  $^{2}$  According to Jeff Kosseff of the United States Naval Academy, defending forward has three basic components: positioning, warning and influencing. Footnote  $^{3}$  CYBERCOM's vision of persistent engagement, which represents the implementation of the DoD strategy, encompasses all three activities, and while each can be criticised as potentially destabilising to international security, the operation-alisation of the 'influencing' component may be particularly so.\nCYBERCOM's General Paul Nakasone gave an indication of what was to come when, in his Senate confirmation hearings in March 2018, he was asked about deterring Russian and Chinese cyber attacks. 'They do not think that much will happen to them', he responded. 'They do not\nfear us.' He went on to say that, 'As cyberspace develops, the longer that we have inactivity, the longer our adversaries are able to establish their own norms – and I think that is very, very important that we realize that.' Footnote 4 This view was reflected in the DoD cyber strategy of defend forward, leveraging the already well-established 'persistent presence' of CYBERCOM in adversaries' networks into an actual operational mandate to disrupt any emerging attacks and thus to 'persistently engage'. Footnote 5 To accomplish this, Nakasone has indicated that CYBERCOM will not be a 'response force' anymore, but rather a force that engages in operations 'below the level of armed attack' on a running basis. Footnote 6\nOverall, CYBERCOM is being positioned less as a strategic-weapons carrier and a key element of an overall strategic-deterrence capability, and more as a special-operations command. The risk of getting these roles entangled is evident with the reversal of traditional signalling practices, with more talk about usually non-public, covert-action-type roles, and less about potential strategic (that is, 'above the threshold of armed attack') capabilities to be used in wartime. The evolving vision of persistent engagement has largely been communicated through a series of articles and press releases, rather than through official publications and doctrines. Footnote 7 This is in keeping with the strategy's dependence on public signals to communicate intent to adversaries. While a discussion of strategic-warfare capabilities would increase transparency and probably increase stability, the sudden emphasis on public discussion of low-level, peacetime cyber attacks is doing the opposite. As decades of experience with arms control have shown, transparency on strategic weapons helps reduce the scope for misunderstandings, provides for clarity of intent, and helps establish norms of restraint and communication. But public communication of offensive covert action – revealing to the public details of secret attacks conducted against an adversary – generally does the reverse, both fostering norms of aggression and underlining the lack of communication. What is true of the conventional-arms world is doubly so in cyberspace, the eponymous information domain where kinetic cyber warfare (officially 'information operations') has an uneasy but undoubted symbiosis with its non-kinetic cousin, 'information warfare', with its emphasis on propaganda, disinformation and covert influencing. As Nakasone has said, in cyberspace the principle danger is the weaponisation of information. Footnote 8 Unfortunately, the signalling mandated by persistent engagement has extended to over-communication in public – itself an example of weaponised information that diminishes the benefits of the defend-forward strategy, lends legitimacy to information-warfare operations as a form of conflict and simultaneously encourages an already accelerating cyber arms race.\nThe empirical justification of CYBERCOM's new offensive vision has been shaky from the start. The academic underpinnings of persistent engagement were presented in a 2017 article by Richard Harknett and Michael Fischerkeller, which was released just as the former was concluding his stint as CYBERCOM's first resident scholar. Footnote 9 The very title of the article, 'Deterrence Is Not a Credible Strategy for Cyberspace', indicates that the authors thought\nit was possible (and desirable) to frame the strategy as one of ‘non-deterrence’. Their analysis rests on the belief that, as part of an ‘agreed competition’ concept, it would be possible to completely contain cyber conflict within its own domain. This would be non-escalatory due to the invisible hand of ‘tacit bargaining’, through which adversaries would feel out the borders of allowable conflict and come to a stable conflict scenario. According to this logic, not only is there less chance of inadvertent escalation over the threshold of armed conflict when engaging in the cyber domain, but this kind of engagement would also avoid retaliation in other domains, such as diplomacy and trade, or even in physical conflict zones, such as Syria and the Persian Gulf. The authors also seem to suggest that cyber could effectively function as a ‘pressure valve’ for international tensions, concentrating the inevitable tit for tat (the tacit bargaining) of international security to a more controllable and less dangerous environment. Footnote 10\nThe many suppositions of Harknett and Fischerkeller’s article have been roundly criticised. Footnote 11 Although the idea of agreed competition is presented as deriving from Herman Kahn’s idea of ‘agreed battle’, the article never answers the basic question of why an adversary would allow itself to be constrained in a way that clearly favours the United States. Cyber experts Brandon Valeriano and Benjamin Jensen have drawn on a comprehensive historical dataset of cyber operations to argue instead that such operations on their own seldom produce concessions. Normally, they need to be accompanied by other actions, such as diplomatic overtures, to work – an approach which the authors contend the US has employed to great effect in the past, despite Nakasone’s assessment that cyber deterrence has failed. Footnote 12 Overall, few observers would agree that outcomes in cyberspace are as easy to predict as advocates of persistent engagement seem to believe. On the contrary, the basic assumption of diplomacy over at least the last decade is that cyberspace is the domain most prone to misinterpretation and miscalculation. Footnote 13 Finally, there is no clear theory of victory in persistent engagement and no strategic endgame, only the purpose of creating operational advantages in cyberspace. There is no agreement as to what the basic strategic game is, or what constitutes its winning and losing factors.\nMore troublingly, persistent engagement does not articulate a sound reasoning as to why any escalation in cyberspace would produce good outcomes for the United States. Tom Bossert, US President Donald Trump’s first homeland security advisor, has explicitly questioned parts of the strategy. In a June 2018 Wired article, he is quoted as saying, ‘I want to make sure we don’t end up in an escalatory cyber exchange where we lose more than they do’, and as pointing out that ‘in many respects the US economy and infrastructure is far more reliant on digitization and automation than Russia’s, giving the Kremlin an inherent advantage in any future no-holdsbarred cyberwar. He paraphrases former US secretary of defense Ash Carter: “If you’re doused in gasoline, don’t start a match-throwing contest.”’ Footnote 14\nThe entire rationale for the strategy, as outlined by Nakasone himself, relies on a version of cyber history that not all observers will agree with. For instance, Nakasone has said that the US mostly faced an intelligence-gathering threat before 2013, which then escalated into denial-based attacks before moving towards destructive attacks (presumably including information-warfare attacks in 2016) and preparations for armed conflict. Footnote 15 Overlooked by this narrative is any consideration of how the adversary – or even many US friends and allies – would see the causality of these developments. In an alternative narrative, US dominance in persistent-presence espionage was publicly revealed through the intelligence disclosures of 2013, at the same time as the first real cyber weapon, Stuxnet, was attributed to the United States. Among allies in Europe, such as Germany, these revelations were often badly received, and the reaction among neutrals, such as Brazil, was even more negative. Not many European observers would agree with the assessment of persistent engagement's supporters that the US has been 'too passive' in cyberspace. In some cases, a different conclusion can be drawn: that cyber attacks have been responses to US activity. Nakasone has cited Iranian cyber aggression to justify persistent engagement, but Iranian activities can also be framed as responses to US cyber operations, such as Stuxnet and Flame. Footnote 16 The Shamoon malware that Iran used to target Saudi Arabia reused components of the US-attributed Flame malware – effectively directing a US cyber weapon back at one of its allies. Footnote 17 Seen from this perspective, at least some of the increase in cyber-related activity directed against the United States has been a direct result of public disclosures of the advanced state of US cyber capabilities and operations. Instead of producing a deterrent effect, these disclosures seem to have contributed to an increase in cyber tensions. This does not bode well for the principle of persistent engagement as currently expressed.\nBoth the academic theory and the policy statements surrounding persistent engagement have a strained relationship with the overall concept of deterrence, as well as with those of balance of power, proliferation and arms control. Before 2016, modern US deterrence followed a logic that is often expressed as a ladder, from entanglement, norms and resilience to punishment. Footnote 18 Purists may argue that only the last two – the ability to absorb an attack, and the ability to conduct an attack – represent classic deterrence. Footnote 19 Contending that the US strategy of 'denial' or 'resilience' has clearly failed in recent years, they have turned to an existing solution for the problem and radically reinterpreted it. In 2011, the nascent weakness in US cyber-deterrence policy – insofar as this had been formally expressed – had already been identified as a lack of 'credibility' or, in technical terms, a seeming inability to communicate the strength of US cyber capabilities in order to dissuade an adversary. It was the same conundrum made famous by Dr. Strangelove – how can one expect a deterrent effect if the very instrument of deterrence is a secret? In cyber terms, the effect was dubbed the 'Cartwright Conjecture' by Jason Healey after General James Cartwright, the former head of Strategic Command who, in 2011, was already complaining that 'we've got to talk about our offensive capabilities and train to them; to make\nthem credible ... You can't have something that's a secret be a deterrent. Because if you don't know it's there, it doesn't scare you.' Footnote 20 This was by no means an isolated message. Footnote 21 At that time, the strategic capability being communicated was one of overwhelming US intelligence-gathering capabilities.\nWithin the US government, intelligence-gathering capabilities have resolutely been portrayed as neutral, or even defensive, in nature. Yet many allies, as well as private-sector actors within the US itself, do not share this view. A number of foreign leaders – not only of neutral countries, but of friends and allies of the US – have concluded that the United States' ability to maintain a persistent presence on all kinds of networks is tantamount to being able to strike them at will. Never mind that it takes time to prepare complicated strikes across highly segmented networks, or that it can be difficult for CYBERCOM to get campaigns approved through the interagency process – these are problems only the attacker can see. From a defender's point of view, it can be very difficult to differentiate between advanced espionage attempts and imminent acts of war – including by the United States. When US dominance in persistent presence became publicly apparent after 2013, it was only natural that a number of nations – some of them US adversaries, but not all – feared that it would not be long before the US took the simple step from persistent presence to persistent engagement. Although major US initiatives such as the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (launched in 2009 with an estimated budget of $40 billion over five years) were cast as being 'defensive' in nature, the programmes could clearly serve as the foundation for offensive cyber activity: the same sensors and implants intended to provide warning of hostile cyber activity could easily be repurposed for offensive activity. This being the case, and given the historical record of presumed US cyber operations, Nakasone's claims in his 2017 Senate confirmation hearing that the United States has been a passive actor in cyberspace seems disingenuous, at best.\nThe significant increase in all forms of offensive cyber behaviour against the US after 2013 has been described as a deterrence failure. Yet advocates of persistent engagement have been unable to explain why deterrence failed, or to express whether the failure was complete or only partial. There is at least some evidence to suggest that the escalation was due to perceived US strength in cyber, not weakness. Following the work of Valeriano and Jensen, whose dataset indicates that responses to cyber attacks have historically been proportional and not intentionally escalatory, Footnote 22 this could imply that some of the increased activity publicly reported since 2013 may in fact have been responses by US adversaries – responses that have been recalibrated to take into account a much more dominant US position in cyberspace than these adversaries had been aware of.\nEither way, friendly and less friendly nations alike have rushed to compete in an escalating cyber arms race, one which the US may have played a decisive role in accelerating even before the publication of persistent engagement. Footnote 23 The very term 'cyber arms race', while not\nparticularly contentious in itself, is difficult to fully circumscribe. The phenomenon bears little resemblance to historic arms races and cannot be quantified by numbers of weapons systems, as was possible during the missile-gap race of the 1960s or the battleship/dreadnought race of the 1900s. Yet even though it is not even clear exactly what these offensive capabilities entail, there is little disagreement that a number of nations are increasingly seeking them, and that the overall level of destructive cyber attacks is rising. A 2016 study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) estimated that at least 30 nations were actively pursuing offensive cyber capabilities, a number that has likely continued to increase year on year as the number of cyber incidents continues to rise. Footnote 24\nMuch like the United States after 2013, many nations have seen a significant increase in malicious behaviour in cyberspace. The Council on Foreign Relations has reported that, with two notable dips in 2012 and 2016, cyber-espionage activity worldwide increased tenfold from 2009 to 2019. Footnote 25 Much of the damage caused by recent cyber incidents such as the WannaCry and NotPetya ransomware attacks, as well as routing and kinetic-equivalent attacks on media and industry, was concentrated outside of the United States. Paired with a significant increase in psychological, information-warfare activities, this has prompted many of the hardest-hit nations (including Australia, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, among others) to make significant adjustments to their cyber postures, in particular by building offensive capabilities. At the same time, anecdotal information suggests that not even these comparatively advanced nations have fully understood what these new cyber capabilities are actually intended to do – if they are intended to focus on ‘strategic strike’ (for instance against critical infrastructure), ‘battlefield cyber’ (acting as a sort of electronic warfare) or online covert action. Footnote 26 This relative confusion about mission parameters will only be accentuated by the new CYBERCOM vision.\nEarly US signalling in response to the Cartwright Conjecture may have intended to go beyond emphasising American strength in online covert action to illustrate the country's ability to conduct a 'global strike' of overwhelming force in wartime – in essence, framing cyber as a strategic capability, a kind of digital weapon of mass destruction. CYBERCOM's intent differs, however, from the low-level silent professionalism of those engaged in strategic deterrence or the targeted focus of tailored access operations in the intelligence world. The role model for persistent engagement is not strategic command or the intelligence community, but rather special-operations command, whose mission has been to counter the adversary all the time, everywhere.\nGeneral Nakasone has stated that, 'unlike the nuclear realm, where our strategic advantage or power comes from possessing a capability or weapons system, in cyberspace it's the use of cyber capabilities that is strategically consequential'. Footnote 27 Not only does this remark suggest that the United States must use offensive capabilities visibly, but it also implies that other nations have a clear interest in doing so as well. Yet encouraging a permissive norm that implicitly\nfavours cyber aggression as a tool of peacetime statecraft is likely only to expand the already murky grey area of modern conflict, and the difference between covert action and military activity. Footnote 28 A number of significant adverse effects can be expected among a range of countries – US allies and friends, neutrals and US adversaries alike – which are unlikely to be in the US interest.\nFirst-order effects: ‘out of band’ and ‘diagonal’ retaliation Jason Healey and Neil Jenkins have argued that the impact of the new persistent-engagement strategy could be assessed by looking at the number of cyber attacks against the US. A decline in attacks would indicate that the strategy was effective, while an increase would suggest it was ineffective or counterproductive. Footnote 29 This approach seems too simplistic for at least two reasons. Firstly, US adversaries may simply retaliate with non-cyber means, drawing on the example the US has already set. One of the most successful acts of US cyber deterrence was the use of Department of Justice indictments against specific foreign cyber actors. Following the indictment of five Chinese hackers associated with the People's Liberation Army in 2015, a landmark deal was reached between then-president Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping that resulted in a significant decline – by up to 90%, according to a report by the security company FireEye Footnote 30 – in Chinese-attributed intellectual-property theft. Other indictments against Russian and Iranian hackers have followed. US adversaries may seek to devise their own ‘out of band’ responses to US cyber activity, perhaps by drawing on the copious amount of leaked materials on offensive US cyber capabilities now in the public domain. Alternatively, they may respond with more ‘conventional’ means, for instance by increasing their support for the non-US side in adversarial situations such as trade conflicts, maritime disputes and weapons proliferation.\nUS adversaries might also respond ‘diagonally’ by responding with cyber-enabled means that defy the simple characterisation of ‘cyber attack’. The kind of social-media activity associated with Russia’s information-warfare campaign against the United States is but one example of this approach. Other cyber means could potentially be deployed in an even more covert manner, making attribution difficult even with the deployment of the United States’ full range of intelligence-collection measures.\nThe recent spate of cyber-crime attacks directed against state and local governments across the United States may be another example of a diagonal approach to cyber retaliation. From January to July 2019, more than 55 state and local governments in the US were hit by ransomware attacks. Footnote 31 Although there had been no public attribution of these activities to foreign actors by the time this article went to press, some of them used a stolen US cyber exploit, dubbed ‘EternalBlue’. This exploit had been posted for sale by a group calling itself ‘Shadow Brokers’, which some have speculated may be a front for Russian intelligence actors. Footnote 32 When cyber criminals did not immediately respond to the possibilities inherent in this new exploit, the WannaCry and NotPetya campaigns were launched, drawing attention not just to the possibilities\nof EternalBlue, but also to the efficacy of ransomware attacks themselves. Even if the current spate of cyber attacks against state and local governments in the US was not directed by a foreign adversary, it would be relatively easy for governments to encourage such activity in the future, thus inflicting real pain on targets and demonstrating the ability of national cyber defenders to respond to provocations.\nThe underlying enabling factor for this scenario is the poor state of basic national cyber security across the United States. A 2019 report by the US Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that of the 3,000 cybersecurity recommendations that have been made to federal agencies since 2010, more than 1,000 had yet to be implemented. Footnote  $^{33}$  These vulnerabilities also extend to the DoD's own basic war-fighting capabilities. According to a GAO report from 2018, 'almost all the weapons that the DOD tested between 2012 and 2017, including the F-35 jet and missile systems, have \"mission critical\" cyber vulnerabilities and can be \"easily hacked\" using \"relatively simple tools and techniques\". Footnote  $^{34}$  As poor as federal cyber-security efforts are, the situation at the state and local levels is significantly worse: a 2019 survey indicated that there remains a large difference between state and federal cyber-security capabilities. Footnote  $^{35}$  The state and local agencies polled said they had high confidence in their ability to 'prevent' a cyber attack in only  $19\\%$  of cases (compared to  $41\\%$  of federal agencies), and only  $28\\%$  of those canvassed said they would be able to 'recover' (versus  $55\\%$  of federal agencies). The nation's privately held critical infrastructure is more difficult to assess, but is largely considered to be more capable, and the United States' overall cyber-security stance tends to be ranked highly by more politically minded ratings – the International Telecommunications Union, for example, ranked the US overall at number two worldwide. Footnote  $^{36}$  More technical ratings, however, like that of the National Cyber Security Index, give the US a more middling assessment – placing it, for instance, in thirteenth place worldwide. Footnote  $^{37}$  The only good news, if it can be called that, to emerge from these findings is that the poor state of US national cyber security is mirrored by that of Russia and China.\n\n---\n\n## # Third-order effects: weaponising information and changing the internet\n\nIn February 2019, it was reported that some unspecified action had been taken by CYBERCOM in November 2018 against the Internet Research Agency, a notorious social-media 'troll factory' headquartered in St Petersburg. The New York Times said that the organisation had been shut down 'for a number of days' as part of an effort to secure the US midterm elections. Footnote 42 Unlike many other parts of the Russian security apparatus, the Internet Research Agency does not seem to engage in 'hacking' – that is, it does not launch its own intrusions. Rather, it is widely accepted that the agency engages only in spreading disinformation, Footnote 43 something that may not even be illegal under international law. CYBERCOM's action against it may well have fallen beneath the 'use of force' or 'armed attack' threshold (a distinction not usually made in the United States anyway), but its public nature implies an acceptance of kinetic-effect cyber attacks – it sent the message that it is okay to hack what you consider 'fake news'.\nIf the targeting of actors that have only a propaganda function (rather than being directly responsible for cyber attacks) becomes normalised, then more conventional media organisations, as well as civil-society and non-governmental organisations, may become admissible targets. Russia might conclude, for example, that foreign support for domestic democracy activists falls\nunder the heading of ‘information and psychological actions aimed at undermining … the homeland’, to borrow language from the 2016 Russian Information Security Doctrine. Footnote 44 Likewise, Beijing might find Chinese-language translations of the New York Times provocative. Footnote 45 International disputes may emerge about ‘bad content’, such as propaganda, social-media campaigns and unkind opinion pieces. Footnote 46 In this way, persistent engagement might encourage the very risk that it was intended to alleviate: the weaponisation of information.\nIn June 2019, the New York Times reported that, at the same time the US was targeting the Information Research Agency, it was also deploying offensive cyber capabilities within the Russian power grid. Footnote 47 A similar intrusion of US power grids – using a malware package known as BlackEnergy – was noticed in 2011 and publicly reported on soon after. A version of BlackEnergy was also used in December 2015 to cause a large-scale blackout in western Ukraine. Footnote 48 These two intrusions, both of them attributed to Russia, ultimately drew attention to themselves, even though there was a blackout only in the 2015 action. In June 2019, however, the United States raised the ante. Rather than ‘allowing’ their own pre-deployment operation to be discovered and reported on by Russian actors, the Americans reported it themselves, stating that since 2018 US malware had been present in the Russian power grid in order to effect a kinetic-equivalent strike if necessary. The intent of this disclosure was likely to make it clear to the Russians that, if necessary, the US was ready to accept a level of ‘mutually assured disruption’. At least as important was the message that CYBERCOM had not abandoned its strategic-warfare role. Yet the United States’ public declaration of its willingness to significantly violate the sovereignty of an adversary in peacetime (something that would not happen when, say, fielding ballistic missiles) seems to present a novel situation for international law. It also provided strong reinforcement for the Russian and Chinese strategic narrative that politics is the extension of warfare, a reversal of Karl von Clausewitz’s famous definition of warfare as an extension of politics. By effectively declaring that the United States considered the pre-deployment of cyber weapons within an adversary’s critical infrastructure as being permissible (rather than simply being ‘caught in the act’, as the Russians were), CYBERCOM took a big step away from the established international legal order that the United States has helped to create. It also implicitly accepted a norm of mutual hostage-taking or ‘mutually assured debilitation’, a huge strategic concession that seems to imply US acceptance of a level of parity with adversaries where previously it could insist on hegemony. Moreover, it implied that CYBERCOM, if not the entire US government, has accepted the core Marxist–Leninist argument that ‘peacetime’ and ‘wartime’ are artificial distinctions.\nIt is clear that persistent engagement poses several direct challenges to the existing international order. For instance, not only does it mandate the forward- or pre-deployment of cyber weapons inside the networks of other countries before a dispute has crossed the threshold of armed conflict, it also suggests that operations beneath this threshold can be justified for any number of\nreasons, including as countermeasures against relatively ‘soft’ disinformation and propaganda activity. There is no reason to suppose that this way of thinking will be confined to the United States – any number of the next-30 cyber powers could also embrace these principles.\nPersistent engagement may also challenge the management, and therefore the shape and form, of the global internet as we know it. Depictions of cyberspace as increasingly violent will accelerate a growing trend to describe the management of the internet in security-related terms. This has been an abiding diplomatic objective of a sizeable faction of states, led by Russia and China, for many years – arguably since 1998. Footnote ⁴⁹ These states have proposed an International Code of Conduct for Information Security ‘, Footnote ⁵⁰ the latest version of which was endorsed by the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation in 2016. The greatest risk the code’s supporters see to their own cyber security is not so much infrastructure-targeting cyber attacks, but rather information warfare intended to achieve the despised outcome of ‘regime change’. For these cyber powers, encouraging diplomatic discussion on ‘countering foreign political influence’ is a key objective.\nTo further this goal, backers of the Code of Conduct have challenged the way the global internet is run. To date, the internet has been managed by a regime comprising multiple government, civil-society and private-sector actors. Footnote ⁵¹ This is known as the multi-stakeholder approach to internet governance, and it has proven to be remarkably resilient, as well as beneficial for the internet’s growth. Yet Code of Conduct supporters wish to replace this multi-stakeholder model with an intergovernmental one. They also wish to ‘securitise’ cyberspace by shifting norms of surveillance, data protection and human rights online, a desire that has been expressed by some Western governments too. In May 2015, Theresa May, then prime minister of the UK, announced that the British government would be taking a much more restrictive approach to user behaviour in cyberspace and to internet freedoms in general in response to a number of terrorist incidents. May was fiercely criticised when she refused to counter accusations that these amounted to Chinese-style internet restrictions. Footnote ⁵²\nAlready, some governments have misused critical internet infrastructure to facilitate their own espionage activity, such as in the 2019 attacks attributed to Iranian actors on the Domain Name System (sometimes described as the ‘telephone book’ of the internet). Footnote ⁵³ There is also interest in connecting the management of the Domain Name System to international efforts intended to counter cyber crime, including the dissemination of ‘bad content’, as variously defined. In this sense, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s argument that changing the management of internet resources is needed to halt the rise in cyber conflict may be gaining ground.\nIf the liberal-democratic argument that the multi-stakeholder model has worked well and served as an effective firebreak against authoritarian desires to control the internet is rejected, then all\nusers – including those in liberal democracies – will be faced with a very different information environment than that of the previous 20 years. In this new environment, all information is likely to be treated as a potential weapon, and thus subject to government intervention and state negotiations. By effectively encouraging cyber conflict, the persistent-engagement vision greatly increases the appeal of the argument that a much stronger government role in achieving ‘cyber peace’ is needed, and that ultimately, this perilous domain needs an intergovernmental model to manage it.\n*\n*\nPersistent engagement may be driving unwanted effects in a number of ways, but the mixed signalling and over-communication the strategy encourages seem particularly at fault. Publicly advocating in favour of the use of offensive cyber means can only be detrimental to international peace and security, and produce an overall increase in cyber conflict. Emerging cyber nations will be incentivised not only to develop offensive cyber capabilities but also to use them – which may lead to the discovery that they can in fact compete with great powers. At the same time, hallowed principles of international order and internet governance may be undermined, to the benefit of countries whose interests may run counter to those of the United States and liberal democracies everywhere.\nA reconsideration of the basic premises of persistent engagement may show that past US deterrence policy was actually effective – as in the case of the US–China deal that produced a decline in Chinese intellectual-property theft. It may also show that the current high level of cyber aggression has resulted from foreign perceptions of US strength, not US weakness. Instead of publicly reinforcing its dominant posture and conflating transparency with propaganda, the United States might be better served by walking more softly in cyberspace even as it retains a big stick.\nAdopting a policy of genuine transparency would have a much-needed stabilising effect by limiting the threat of inadvertent escalation or loss of escalation control. Such a policy should feature multilevel discussions, with varying levels of confidentiality, about strategic cyber capabilities and their command and control, alongside ongoing international discussions on norms of restraint. Footnote 54 The obvious benefits of this approach explain why the United States' closest allies and partners have almost unanimously advocated for it. Any covert cyber activities that impair these discussions, rather than advancing them, should remain just that - covert. Otherwise, mixing signals in the cyber domain is a recipe for serious adverse effects that threaten to undermine the security not just of the United States, but of all liberal democracies and of the internet itself.",

    "# Abstract\n\nSome risks of 'persistent engagement' could be mitigated by reducing its reliance on mixed signals and public communication.\n\nPrevious article View issue table of contents Next article\n\nThe conduct and deployment of the United States Cyber Command's (CYBERCOM) vision of 'persistent engagement' represents a radical and largely unwelcome departure from previous notions of conflict in cyberspace. It builds on a number of questionable assumptions about the international history and perception of cyber conflict, the role and strategic direction of information warfare, and the general dynamics of deterrence. Ultimately, it justifies a much more aggressive CYBERCOM mission that ignores the potential for unwanted effects that could prove to be highly destabilising in an already volatile international security environment. Overall, persistent engagement is a very high-risk approach to developing cyber deterrence that is likely to not only trigger new forms of retaliation but also accelerate the already rapid international proliferation of offensive cyber capabilities. In the worst-case scenario, it may even pose a risk to the internet as we know it. Some of the risks associated with the concept could, however, be partially alleviated by reducing its reliance on mixed signals and an excess of public communication.\n\n# Persistent engagement: theory and criticism\n\nThe promotion of CYBERCOM to a fully independent combat command in 2018 marked the emancipation of US military cyber capabilities from the intelligence world. While some observers, including the present author, thought that this development might help foster much-needed transparency on cyber capabilities, recent developments have taken a darker turn. Footnote  $^{1}$  Building on an already controversial doctrine of 'active defense in cyberspace', the US Department of Defense (DoD) put forward a new public cyber strategy in 2018 that emphasised the concept of 'defend forward'. Footnote  $^{2}$  According to Jeff Kosseff of the United States Naval Academy, defending forward has three basic components: positioning, warning and influencing. Footnote  $^{3}$  CYBERCOM's vision of persistent engagement, which represents the implementation of the DoD strategy, encompasses all three activities, and while each can be criticised as potentially destabilising to international security, the operation-alisation of the 'influencing' component may be particularly so.\n\nCYBERCOM's General Paul Nakasone gave an indication of what was to come when, in his Senate confirmation hearings in March 2018, he was asked about deterring Russian and Chinese cyber attacks. 'They do not think that much will happen to them', he responded. 'They do not",
    "fear us.' He went on to say that, 'As cyberspace develops, the longer that we have inactivity, the longer our adversaries are able to establish their own norms – and I think that is very, very important that we realize that.' Footnote 4 This view was reflected in the DoD cyber strategy of defend forward, leveraging the already well-established 'persistent presence' of CYBERCOM in adversaries' networks into an actual operational mandate to disrupt any emerging attacks and thus to 'persistently engage'. Footnote 5 To accomplish this, Nakasone has indicated that CYBERCOM will not be a 'response force' anymore, but rather a force that engages in operations 'below the level of armed attack' on a running basis. Footnote 6\n\nOverall, CYBERCOM is being positioned less as a strategic-weapons carrier and a key element of an overall strategic-deterrence capability, and more as a special-operations command. The risk of getting these roles entangled is evident with the reversal of traditional signalling practices, with more talk about usually non-public, covert-action-type roles, and less about potential strategic (that is, 'above the threshold of armed attack') capabilities to be used in wartime. The evolving vision of persistent engagement has largely been communicated through a series of articles and press releases, rather than through official publications and doctrines. Footnote 7 This is in keeping with the strategy's dependence on public signals to communicate intent to adversaries. While a discussion of strategic-warfare capabilities would increase transparency and probably increase stability, the sudden emphasis on public discussion of low-level, peacetime cyber attacks is doing the opposite. As decades of experience with arms control have shown, transparency on strategic weapons helps reduce the scope for misunderstandings, provides for clarity of intent, and helps establish norms of restraint and communication. But public communication of offensive covert action – revealing to the public details of secret attacks conducted against an adversary – generally does the reverse, both fostering norms of aggression and underlining the lack of communication. What is true of the conventional-arms world is doubly so in cyberspace, the eponymous information domain where kinetic cyber warfare (officially 'information operations') has an uneasy but undoubted symbiosis with its non-kinetic cousin, 'information warfare', with its emphasis on propaganda, disinformation and covert influencing. As Nakasone has said, in cyberspace the principle danger is the weaponisation of information. Footnote 8 Unfortunately, the signalling mandated by persistent engagement has extended to over-communication in public – itself an example of weaponised information that diminishes the benefits of the defend-forward strategy, lends legitimacy to information-warfare operations as a form of conflict and simultaneously encourages an already accelerating cyber arms race.\n\nThe empirical justification of CYBERCOM's new offensive vision has been shaky from the start. The academic underpinnings of persistent engagement were presented in a 2017 article by Richard Harknett and Michael Fischerkeller, which was released just as the former was concluding his stint as CYBERCOM's first resident scholar. Footnote 9 The very title of the article, 'Deterrence Is Not a Credible Strategy for Cyberspace', indicates that the authors thought",
    "it was possible (and desirable) to frame the strategy as one of ‘non-deterrence’. Their analysis rests on the belief that, as part of an ‘agreed competition’ concept, it would be possible to completely contain cyber conflict within its own domain. This would be non-escalatory due to the invisible hand of ‘tacit bargaining’, through which adversaries would feel out the borders of allowable conflict and come to a stable conflict scenario. According to this logic, not only is there less chance of inadvertent escalation over the threshold of armed conflict when engaging in the cyber domain, but this kind of engagement would also avoid retaliation in other domains, such as diplomacy and trade, or even in physical conflict zones, such as Syria and the Persian Gulf. The authors also seem to suggest that cyber could effectively function as a ‘pressure valve’ for international tensions, concentrating the inevitable tit for tat (the tacit bargaining) of international security to a more controllable and less dangerous environment. Footnote 10\n\nThe many suppositions of Harknett and Fischerkeller’s article have been roundly criticised. Footnote 11 Although the idea of agreed competition is presented as deriving from Herman Kahn’s idea of ‘agreed battle’, the article never answers the basic question of why an adversary would allow itself to be constrained in a way that clearly favours the United States. Cyber experts Brandon Valeriano and Benjamin Jensen have drawn on a comprehensive historical dataset of cyber operations to argue instead that such operations on their own seldom produce concessions. Normally, they need to be accompanied by other actions, such as diplomatic overtures, to work – an approach which the authors contend the US has employed to great effect in the past, despite Nakasone’s assessment that cyber deterrence has failed. Footnote 12 Overall, few observers would agree that outcomes in cyberspace are as easy to predict as advocates of persistent engagement seem to believe. On the contrary, the basic assumption of diplomacy over at least the last decade is that cyberspace is the domain most prone to misinterpretation and miscalculation. Footnote 13 Finally, there is no clear theory of victory in persistent engagement and no strategic endgame, only the purpose of creating operational advantages in cyberspace. There is no agreement as to what the basic strategic game is, or what constitutes its winning and losing factors.\n\nMore troublingly, persistent engagement does not articulate a sound reasoning as to why any escalation in cyberspace would produce good outcomes for the United States. Tom Bossert, US President Donald Trump’s first homeland security advisor, has explicitly questioned parts of the strategy. In a June 2018 Wired article, he is quoted as saying, ‘I want to make sure we don’t end up in an escalatory cyber exchange where we lose more than they do’, and as pointing out that ‘in many respects the US economy and infrastructure is far more reliant on digitization and automation than Russia’s, giving the Kremlin an inherent advantage in any future no-holdsbarred cyberwar. He paraphrases former US secretary of defense Ash Carter: “If you’re doused in gasoline, don’t start a match-throwing contest.”’ Footnote 14",
    "The entire rationale for the strategy, as outlined by Nakasone himself, relies on a version of cyber history that not all observers will agree with. For instance, Nakasone has said that the US mostly faced an intelligence-gathering threat before 2013, which then escalated into denial-based attacks before moving towards destructive attacks (presumably including information-warfare attacks in 2016) and preparations for armed conflict. Footnote 15 Overlooked by this narrative is any consideration of how the adversary – or even many US friends and allies – would see the causality of these developments. In an alternative narrative, US dominance in persistent-presence espionage was publicly revealed through the intelligence disclosures of 2013, at the same time as the first real cyber weapon, Stuxnet, was attributed to the United States. Among allies in Europe, such as Germany, these revelations were often badly received, and the reaction among neutrals, such as Brazil, was even more negative. Not many European observers would agree with the assessment of persistent engagement's supporters that the US has been 'too passive' in cyberspace. In some cases, a different conclusion can be drawn: that cyber attacks have been responses to US activity. Nakasone has cited Iranian cyber aggression to justify persistent engagement, but Iranian activities can also be framed as responses to US cyber operations, such as Stuxnet and Flame. Footnote 16 The Shamoon malware that Iran used to target Saudi Arabia reused components of the US-attributed Flame malware – effectively directing a US cyber weapon back at one of its allies. Footnote 17 Seen from this perspective, at least some of the increase in cyber-related activity directed against the United States has been a direct result of public disclosures of the advanced state of US cyber capabilities and operations. Instead of producing a deterrent effect, these disclosures seem to have contributed to an increase in cyber tensions. This does not bode well for the principle of persistent engagement as currently expressed.\n\nBoth the academic theory and the policy statements surrounding persistent engagement have a strained relationship with the overall concept of deterrence, as well as with those of balance of power, proliferation and arms control. Before 2016, modern US deterrence followed a logic that is often expressed as a ladder, from entanglement, norms and resilience to punishment. Footnote 18 Purists may argue that only the last two – the ability to absorb an attack, and the ability to conduct an attack – represent classic deterrence. Footnote 19 Contending that the US strategy of 'denial' or 'resilience' has clearly failed in recent years, they have turned to an existing solution for the problem and radically reinterpreted it. In 2011, the nascent weakness in US cyber-deterrence policy – insofar as this had been formally expressed – had already been identified as a lack of 'credibility' or, in technical terms, a seeming inability to communicate the strength of US cyber capabilities in order to dissuade an adversary. It was the same conundrum made famous by Dr. Strangelove – how can one expect a deterrent effect if the very instrument of deterrence is a secret? In cyber terms, the effect was dubbed the 'Cartwright Conjecture' by Jason Healey after General James Cartwright, the former head of Strategic Command who, in 2011, was already complaining that 'we've got to talk about our offensive capabilities and train to them; to make",
    "them credible ... You can't have something that's a secret be a deterrent. Because if you don't know it's there, it doesn't scare you.' Footnote 20 This was by no means an isolated message. Footnote 21 At that time, the strategic capability being communicated was one of overwhelming US intelligence-gathering capabilities.\n\nWithin the US government, intelligence-gathering capabilities have resolutely been portrayed as neutral, or even defensive, in nature. Yet many allies, as well as private-sector actors within the US itself, do not share this view. A number of foreign leaders – not only of neutral countries, but of friends and allies of the US – have concluded that the United States' ability to maintain a persistent presence on all kinds of networks is tantamount to being able to strike them at will. Never mind that it takes time to prepare complicated strikes across highly segmented networks, or that it can be difficult for CYBERCOM to get campaigns approved through the interagency process – these are problems only the attacker can see. From a defender's point of view, it can be very difficult to differentiate between advanced espionage attempts and imminent acts of war – including by the United States. When US dominance in persistent presence became publicly apparent after 2013, it was only natural that a number of nations – some of them US adversaries, but not all – feared that it would not be long before the US took the simple step from persistent presence to persistent engagement. Although major US initiatives such as the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (launched in 2009 with an estimated budget of $40 billion over five years) were cast as being 'defensive' in nature, the programmes could clearly serve as the foundation for offensive cyber activity: the same sensors and implants intended to provide warning of hostile cyber activity could easily be repurposed for offensive activity. This being the case, and given the historical record of presumed US cyber operations, Nakasone's claims in his 2017 Senate confirmation hearing that the United States has been a passive actor in cyberspace seems disingenuous, at best.\n\nThe significant increase in all forms of offensive cyber behaviour against the US after 2013 has been described as a deterrence failure. Yet advocates of persistent engagement have been unable to explain why deterrence failed, or to express whether the failure was complete or only partial. There is at least some evidence to suggest that the escalation was due to perceived US strength in cyber, not weakness. Following the work of Valeriano and Jensen, whose dataset indicates that responses to cyber attacks have historically been proportional and not intentionally escalatory, Footnote 22 this could imply that some of the increased activity publicly reported since 2013 may in fact have been responses by US adversaries – responses that have been recalibrated to take into account a much more dominant US position in cyberspace than these adversaries had been aware of.\n\nEither way, friendly and less friendly nations alike have rushed to compete in an escalating cyber arms race, one which the US may have played a decisive role in accelerating even before the publication of persistent engagement. Footnote 23 The very term 'cyber arms race', while not",
    "particularly contentious in itself, is difficult to fully circumscribe. The phenomenon bears little resemblance to historic arms races and cannot be quantified by numbers of weapons systems, as was possible during the missile-gap race of the 1960s or the battleship/dreadnought race of the 1900s. Yet even though it is not even clear exactly what these offensive capabilities entail, there is little disagreement that a number of nations are increasingly seeking them, and that the overall level of destructive cyber attacks is rising. A 2016 study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) estimated that at least 30 nations were actively pursuing offensive cyber capabilities, a number that has likely continued to increase year on year as the number of cyber incidents continues to rise. Footnote 24\n\nMuch like the United States after 2013, many nations have seen a significant increase in malicious behaviour in cyberspace. The Council on Foreign Relations has reported that, with two notable dips in 2012 and 2016, cyber-espionage activity worldwide increased tenfold from 2009 to 2019. Footnote 25 Much of the damage caused by recent cyber incidents such as the WannaCry and NotPetya ransomware attacks, as well as routing and kinetic-equivalent attacks on media and industry, was concentrated outside of the United States. Paired with a significant increase in psychological, information-warfare activities, this has prompted many of the hardest-hit nations (including Australia, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, among others) to make significant adjustments to their cyber postures, in particular by building offensive capabilities. At the same time, anecdotal information suggests that not even these comparatively advanced nations have fully understood what these new cyber capabilities are actually intended to do – if they are intended to focus on ‘strategic strike’ (for instance against critical infrastructure), ‘battlefield cyber’ (acting as a sort of electronic warfare) or online covert action. Footnote 26 This relative confusion about mission parameters will only be accentuated by the new CYBERCOM vision.\n\nEarly US signalling in response to the Cartwright Conjecture may have intended to go beyond emphasising American strength in online covert action to illustrate the country's ability to conduct a 'global strike' of overwhelming force in wartime – in essence, framing cyber as a strategic capability, a kind of digital weapon of mass destruction. CYBERCOM's intent differs, however, from the low-level silent professionalism of those engaged in strategic deterrence or the targeted focus of tailored access operations in the intelligence world. The role model for persistent engagement is not strategic command or the intelligence community, but rather special-operations command, whose mission has been to counter the adversary all the time, everywhere.\n\nGeneral Nakasone has stated that, 'unlike the nuclear realm, where our strategic advantage or power comes from possessing a capability or weapons system, in cyberspace it's the use of cyber capabilities that is strategically consequential'. Footnote 27 Not only does this remark suggest that the United States must use offensive capabilities visibly, but it also implies that other nations have a clear interest in doing so as well. Yet encouraging a permissive norm that implicitly",
    "favours cyber aggression as a tool of peacetime statecraft is likely only to expand the already murky grey area of modern conflict, and the difference between covert action and military activity. Footnote 28 A number of significant adverse effects can be expected among a range of countries – US allies and friends, neutrals and US adversaries alike – which are unlikely to be in the US interest.\n\nFirst-order effects: ‘out of band’ and ‘diagonal’ retaliation Jason Healey and Neil Jenkins have argued that the impact of the new persistent-engagement strategy could be assessed by looking at the number of cyber attacks against the US. A decline in attacks would indicate that the strategy was effective, while an increase would suggest it was ineffective or counterproductive. Footnote 29 This approach seems too simplistic for at least two reasons. Firstly, US adversaries may simply retaliate with non-cyber means, drawing on the example the US has already set. One of the most successful acts of US cyber deterrence was the use of Department of Justice indictments against specific foreign cyber actors. Following the indictment of five Chinese hackers associated with the People's Liberation Army in 2015, a landmark deal was reached between then-president Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping that resulted in a significant decline – by up to 90%, according to a report by the security company FireEye Footnote 30 – in Chinese-attributed intellectual-property theft. Other indictments against Russian and Iranian hackers have followed. US adversaries may seek to devise their own ‘out of band’ responses to US cyber activity, perhaps by drawing on the copious amount of leaked materials on offensive US cyber capabilities now in the public domain. Alternatively, they may respond with more ‘conventional’ means, for instance by increasing their support for the non-US side in adversarial situations such as trade conflicts, maritime disputes and weapons proliferation.\n\nUS adversaries might also respond ‘diagonally’ by responding with cyber-enabled means that defy the simple characterisation of ‘cyber attack’. The kind of social-media activity associated with Russia’s information-warfare campaign against the United States is but one example of this approach. Other cyber means could potentially be deployed in an even more covert manner, making attribution difficult even with the deployment of the United States’ full range of intelligence-collection measures.\n\nThe recent spate of cyber-crime attacks directed against state and local governments across the United States may be another example of a diagonal approach to cyber retaliation. From January to July 2019, more than 55 state and local governments in the US were hit by ransomware attacks. Footnote 31 Although there had been no public attribution of these activities to foreign actors by the time this article went to press, some of them used a stolen US cyber exploit, dubbed ‘EternalBlue’. This exploit had been posted for sale by a group calling itself ‘Shadow Brokers’, which some have speculated may be a front for Russian intelligence actors. Footnote 32 When cyber criminals did not immediately respond to the possibilities inherent in this new exploit, the WannaCry and NotPetya campaigns were launched, drawing attention not just to the possibilities",
    "of EternalBlue, but also to the efficacy of ransomware attacks themselves. Even if the current spate of cyber attacks against state and local governments in the US was not directed by a foreign adversary, it would be relatively easy for governments to encourage such activity in the future, thus inflicting real pain on targets and demonstrating the ability of national cyber defenders to respond to provocations.\n\nThe underlying enabling factor for this scenario is the poor state of basic national cyber security across the United States. A 2019 report by the US Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that of the 3,000 cybersecurity recommendations that have been made to federal agencies since 2010, more than 1,000 had yet to be implemented. Footnote  $^{33}$  These vulnerabilities also extend to the DoD's own basic war-fighting capabilities. According to a GAO report from 2018, 'almost all the weapons that the DOD tested between 2012 and 2017, including the F-35 jet and missile systems, have \"mission critical\" cyber vulnerabilities and can be \"easily hacked\" using \"relatively simple tools and techniques\". Footnote  $^{34}$  As poor as federal cyber-security efforts are, the situation at the state and local levels is significantly worse: a 2019 survey indicated that there remains a large difference between state and federal cyber-security capabilities. Footnote  $^{35}$  The state and local agencies polled said they had high confidence in their ability to 'prevent' a cyber attack in only  $19\\%$  of cases (compared to  $41\\%$  of federal agencies), and only  $28\\%$  of those canvassed said they would be able to 'recover' (versus  $55\\%$  of federal agencies). The nation's privately held critical infrastructure is more difficult to assess, but is largely considered to be more capable, and the United States' overall cyber-security stance tends to be ranked highly by more politically minded ratings – the International Telecommunications Union, for example, ranked the US overall at number two worldwide. Footnote  $^{36}$  More technical ratings, however, like that of the National Cyber Security Index, give the US a more middling assessment – placing it, for instance, in thirteenth place worldwide. Footnote  $^{37}$  The only good news, if it can be called that, to emerge from these findings is that the poor state of US national cyber security is mirrored by that of Russia and China.\n\n# Second-order effects: emerging cyber powers and their strategic dilemma\n\nA major reason for the vulnerable state of US cyber security has to do with scale – large nations have inherently more attack surface to cover, and the US easily has the greatest attack surface of them all. Footnote  $^{38}$  However, the opposite is therefore also true – smaller nations on balance have a much easier task in building national cyber security, and this has significant repercussions for how they play their own game of strategic deterrence. Yet the asymmetric strength of small players has been largely overlooked in most conventional analyses of cyber powers.",
    "Smaller nations often benefit from increased cooperation between the civilian and military, and state and non-state sectors, and generally face fewer challenges in coordinating emergency measures. Some even have the ability to disconnect from the global internet if necessary. Footnote 39 Smaller countries may also benefit from a more stringent legal and regulatory framework that requires a minimum level of cyber defence, not just from various levels of government but also from the private sector. For nations like, say, the Netherlands, the task of coordinating with 100–300 critical-infrastructure providers, and a comparable number of local and federal government networks, is a completely different task than dealing with many tens of thousands of civilian assets and non-military governmental networks, as in the United States. Footnote 40 A smaller attack surface means fewer critical-infrastructure providers that need to be communicated with, fewer government agency networks that need to be hardened and less scope for friction in a crisis. Essentially, this means that smaller advanced cyber nations have an inherent advantage in pursuing national cyber security compared with very large nations such as the United States, or indeed Russia and China. All things considered, a number of smaller nations might actually do quite well in a force-on-force conflict with a major cyber power. The ability of many smaller nations to potentially absorb cyber blows is no less significant in a wartime scenario than advantageous defensive geography would be in a ground operation. Yet the ‘high ground’ advantage of smaller states in presenting a smaller attack surface in the cyber domain may not have been adequately factored into analysts’ calculations, including those that informed the drafting of persistent engagement. As a corollary to this, smaller nations’ ability to conduct deterrence by punishment – a strategy that persistent engagement has heavily incentivised them to pursue – is not well understood.\n\nThe nature of the offensive cyber capabilities currently being developed by the ‘next 30’ nations examined in the 2016 CSIS study may not be clear, but there is no reason to believe that they relate only to cyber-crime-style scenarios, such as denial-of-service or even ransomware attacks. Instead, it should be assumed that these cyber powers can ‘turn the lights off’ – that is, launch a strategic strike on the critical infrastructure of an enemy. While it is much easier to temporarily shut down a nation’s infrastructure networks than to damage them beyond repair, ‘temporary’ disruptions can still impose catastrophic costs on a nation’s economy and limit its ability to maintain domestic order. The destructive potential of the next 30 may be orders of magnitude less than that of the United States or a near-peer cyber power, but some of these countries still possess a minimal deterrence capability that, much like the small nuclear arsenals of France, the UK and China, could inflict an unacceptable level of retaliatory punishment on a potential aggressor, no matter their overwhelming technical superiority. While detractors may say that mere cyber attacks should not be compared to the horror of a nuclear exchange, the effects of weeks-long black-outs, the destruction of financial information and the breakdown of most forms of communication should not be underestimated. The next-30 cyber nations may therefore possess something which was previously unavailable to them: not just a strategic-weapons capability – a",
    "virtual strike force no less potent than a wing of bombers or ballistic missiles – but also a defensive advantage towards larger foes.\n\nThe sheer number of nations that may be able to reciprocally threaten a major power could be historically unprecedented. There was briefly a time, in the late 1950s, when it seemed possible that dozens of nations would eventually deploy nuclear weapons; even small countries like Switzerland deliberated the possibility of creating their own nuclear deterrent. Footnote 41 In the end, many of these opted to form alliances with existing nuclear powers instead. Today, persistent engagement may be changing the way such nations provide for their own security. Instead of depending on the protective umbrella of their friends, many now have their own budding deterrence-by-punishment capability in the cyber domain, in addition to having become better able to resist the effects of a strategic cyber strike against themselves. Some are also being incentivised by persistent engagement not only to develop offensive capabilities, but to use them as well. After all, persistent engagement postulates that cyber conflict is not only to be welcomed, but to be engaged in so as to be 'understood'. Any country not carrying out cyber attacks would, like those that did not test nuclear bombs, be excluded from the main table and left without a voice. This is seen as a perverse incentive by those who advocate for non-proliferation and argue that the increased distribution of destructive weapons increases the likelihood not only that one will be used, but that all will be used.\n\n# Third-order effects: weaponising information and changing the internet\n\nIn February 2019, it was reported that some unspecified action had been taken by CYBERCOM in November 2018 against the Internet Research Agency, a notorious social-media 'troll factory' headquartered in St Petersburg. The New York Times said that the organisation had been shut down 'for a number of days' as part of an effort to secure the US midterm elections. Footnote 42 Unlike many other parts of the Russian security apparatus, the Internet Research Agency does not seem to engage in 'hacking' – that is, it does not launch its own intrusions. Rather, it is widely accepted that the agency engages only in spreading disinformation, Footnote 43 something that may not even be illegal under international law. CYBERCOM's action against it may well have fallen beneath the 'use of force' or 'armed attack' threshold (a distinction not usually made in the United States anyway), but its public nature implies an acceptance of kinetic-effect cyber attacks – it sent the message that it is okay to hack what you consider 'fake news'.\n\nIf the targeting of actors that have only a propaganda function (rather than being directly responsible for cyber attacks) becomes normalised, then more conventional media organisations, as well as civil-society and non-governmental organisations, may become admissible targets. Russia might conclude, for example, that foreign support for domestic democracy activists falls",
    "under the heading of ‘information and psychological actions aimed at undermining … the homeland’, to borrow language from the 2016 Russian Information Security Doctrine. Footnote 44 Likewise, Beijing might find Chinese-language translations of the New York Times provocative. Footnote 45 International disputes may emerge about ‘bad content’, such as propaganda, social-media campaigns and unkind opinion pieces. Footnote 46 In this way, persistent engagement might encourage the very risk that it was intended to alleviate: the weaponisation of information.\n\nIn June 2019, the New York Times reported that, at the same time the US was targeting the Information Research Agency, it was also deploying offensive cyber capabilities within the Russian power grid. Footnote 47 A similar intrusion of US power grids – using a malware package known as BlackEnergy – was noticed in 2011 and publicly reported on soon after. A version of BlackEnergy was also used in December 2015 to cause a large-scale blackout in western Ukraine. Footnote 48 These two intrusions, both of them attributed to Russia, ultimately drew attention to themselves, even though there was a blackout only in the 2015 action. In June 2019, however, the United States raised the ante. Rather than ‘allowing’ their own pre-deployment operation to be discovered and reported on by Russian actors, the Americans reported it themselves, stating that since 2018 US malware had been present in the Russian power grid in order to effect a kinetic-equivalent strike if necessary. The intent of this disclosure was likely to make it clear to the Russians that, if necessary, the US was ready to accept a level of ‘mutually assured disruption’. At least as important was the message that CYBERCOM had not abandoned its strategic-warfare role. Yet the United States’ public declaration of its willingness to significantly violate the sovereignty of an adversary in peacetime (something that would not happen when, say, fielding ballistic missiles) seems to present a novel situation for international law. It also provided strong reinforcement for the Russian and Chinese strategic narrative that politics is the extension of warfare, a reversal of Karl von Clausewitz’s famous definition of warfare as an extension of politics. By effectively declaring that the United States considered the pre-deployment of cyber weapons within an adversary’s critical infrastructure as being permissible (rather than simply being ‘caught in the act’, as the Russians were), CYBERCOM took a big step away from the established international legal order that the United States has helped to create. It also implicitly accepted a norm of mutual hostage-taking or ‘mutually assured debilitation’, a huge strategic concession that seems to imply US acceptance of a level of parity with adversaries where previously it could insist on hegemony. Moreover, it implied that CYBERCOM, if not the entire US government, has accepted the core Marxist–Leninist argument that ‘peacetime’ and ‘wartime’ are artificial distinctions.\n\nIt is clear that persistent engagement poses several direct challenges to the existing international order. For instance, not only does it mandate the forward- or pre-deployment of cyber weapons inside the networks of other countries before a dispute has crossed the threshold of armed conflict, it also suggests that operations beneath this threshold can be justified for any number of",
    "reasons, including as countermeasures against relatively ‘soft’ disinformation and propaganda activity. There is no reason to suppose that this way of thinking will be confined to the United States – any number of the next-30 cyber powers could also embrace these principles.\n\nPersistent engagement may also challenge the management, and therefore the shape and form, of the global internet as we know it. Depictions of cyberspace as increasingly violent will accelerate a growing trend to describe the management of the internet in security-related terms. This has been an abiding diplomatic objective of a sizeable faction of states, led by Russia and China, for many years – arguably since 1998. Footnote ⁴⁹ These states have proposed an International Code of Conduct for Information Security ‘, Footnote ⁵⁰ the latest version of which was endorsed by the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation in 2016. The greatest risk the code’s supporters see to their own cyber security is not so much infrastructure-targeting cyber attacks, but rather information warfare intended to achieve the despised outcome of ‘regime change’. For these cyber powers, encouraging diplomatic discussion on ‘countering foreign political influence’ is a key objective.\n\nTo further this goal, backers of the Code of Conduct have challenged the way the global internet is run. To date, the internet has been managed by a regime comprising multiple government, civil-society and private-sector actors. Footnote ⁵¹ This is known as the multi-stakeholder approach to internet governance, and it has proven to be remarkably resilient, as well as beneficial for the internet’s growth. Yet Code of Conduct supporters wish to replace this multi-stakeholder model with an intergovernmental one. They also wish to ‘securitise’ cyberspace by shifting norms of surveillance, data protection and human rights online, a desire that has been expressed by some Western governments too. In May 2015, Theresa May, then prime minister of the UK, announced that the British government would be taking a much more restrictive approach to user behaviour in cyberspace and to internet freedoms in general in response to a number of terrorist incidents. May was fiercely criticised when she refused to counter accusations that these amounted to Chinese-style internet restrictions. Footnote ⁵²\n\nAlready, some governments have misused critical internet infrastructure to facilitate their own espionage activity, such as in the 2019 attacks attributed to Iranian actors on the Domain Name System (sometimes described as the ‘telephone book’ of the internet). Footnote ⁵³ There is also interest in connecting the management of the Domain Name System to international efforts intended to counter cyber crime, including the dissemination of ‘bad content’, as variously defined. In this sense, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s argument that changing the management of internet resources is needed to halt the rise in cyber conflict may be gaining ground.\n\nIf the liberal-democratic argument that the multi-stakeholder model has worked well and served as an effective firebreak against authoritarian desires to control the internet is rejected, then all",
    "users – including those in liberal democracies – will be faced with a very different information environment than that of the previous 20 years. In this new environment, all information is likely to be treated as a potential weapon, and thus subject to government intervention and state negotiations. By effectively encouraging cyber conflict, the persistent-engagement vision greatly increases the appeal of the argument that a much stronger government role in achieving ‘cyber peace’ is needed, and that ultimately, this perilous domain needs an intergovernmental model to manage it.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nPersistent engagement may be driving unwanted effects in a number of ways, but the mixed signalling and over-communication the strategy encourages seem particularly at fault. Publicly advocating in favour of the use of offensive cyber means can only be detrimental to international peace and security, and produce an overall increase in cyber conflict. Emerging cyber nations will be incentivised not only to develop offensive cyber capabilities but also to use them – which may lead to the discovery that they can in fact compete with great powers. At the same time, hallowed principles of international order and internet governance may be undermined, to the benefit of countries whose interests may run counter to those of the United States and liberal democracies everywhere.\n\nA reconsideration of the basic premises of persistent engagement may show that past US deterrence policy was actually effective – as in the case of the US–China deal that produced a decline in Chinese intellectual-property theft. It may also show that the current high level of cyber aggression has resulted from foreign perceptions of US strength, not US weakness. Instead of publicly reinforcing its dominant posture and conflating transparency with propaganda, the United States might be better served by walking more softly in cyberspace even as it retains a big stick.\n\nAdopting a policy of genuine transparency would have a much-needed stabilising effect by limiting the threat of inadvertent escalation or loss of escalation control. Such a policy should feature multilevel discussions, with varying levels of confidentiality, about strategic cyber capabilities and their command and control, alongside ongoing international discussions on norms of restraint. Footnote 54 The obvious benefits of this approach explain why the United States' closest allies and partners have almost unanimously advocated for it. Any covert cyber activities that impair these discussions, rather than advancing them, should remain just that - covert. Otherwise, mixing signals in the cyber domain is a recipe for serious adverse effects that threaten to undermine the security not just of the United States, but of all liberal democracies and of the internet itself.",

Previous article View issue table of contents Next article The conduct and deployment of the United States Cyber Command's (CYBERCOM) vision of 'persistent engagement' represents a radical and largely unwelcome departure from previous notions of conflict in cyberspace. It builds on a number of questionable assumptions about the international history and perception of cyber conflict, the role and strategic direction of information warfare, and the general dynamics of deterrence. Ultimately, it justifies a much more aggressive CYBERCOM mission that ignores the potential for unwanted effects that could prove to be highly destabilising in an already volatile international security environment. Overall, persistent engagement is a very high-risk approach to developing cyber deterrence that is likely to not only trigger new forms of retaliation but also accelerate the already rapid international proliferation of offensive cyber capabilities. In the worst-case scenario, it may even pose a risk to the internet as we know it. Some of the risks associated with the concept could, however, be partially alleviated by reducing its reliance on mixed signals and an excess of public communication.",
