Johnson*\nSchool of Computing Science, University of Glasgow, Glasgow G12 8RZ, UK\n(Received 5 December 2012; final version received 2 June 2013)\nWe identify four roles that social networking plays in the ‘attribution problem’, which obscures whether or not cyber-attacks were state-sponsored. First, social networks motivate individuals to participate in Distributed Denial of Service attacks by providing malware and identifying potential targets. Second, attackers use an individual’s social network to focus attacks, through spear phishing. Recipients are more likely to open infected attachments when they come from a trusted source. Third, social networking infrastructures create disposable architectures to coordinate attacks through command and control servers. The ubiquitous nature of these architectures makes it difficult to determine who owns and operates the servers. Finally, governments recruit anti-social criminal networks to launch attacks on third-party infrastructures using botnets. The closing sections identify a roadmap to increase resilience against the ‘dark side’ of social networking.\n**Practitioner Summary**: This paper provides readers with an overview of state-sponsored cyber-attacks. I show how many of these threats have exploited social networks and social media. The aim was to alert practitioners to the dark side of computing, where attackers learn to exploit new interaction techniques and new forms of working.\n**Keywords**: cyber defence; national critical infrastructures; software security\n# 1. Introduction\nThis paper identifies threats to human–machine interaction in the multi-layered networks that are at the heart of this special issue. The growing complexity of socio-technical systems and the interpenetration of formerly separate systems via IT infrastructures create new opportunities for social interaction. It also creates new vulnerabilities. In particular, this paper considers the role that social networking has played in the ‘attribution problem’. This term describes the difficulty in determining who is responsible for a cyber-attack. Social networks describe interconnections between individuals and groups that change over time. These relationships may be based on family ties, sexual relationships, employment, etc. However, the interconnections can also motivate groups to launch mass cyber-attacks on common targets, whether they are multi-national corporations or government agencies. It is difficult for commercial and government organisations to monitor these connections and hence predict the groups who are likely to become involved in mass cyber-attacks. One reason for this is that state agencies are using ‘social media’ to encourage and sustain networks of hactivists that are behind many cyber-attacks. Social media are Internet-based applications that allow for the generation and dissemination of user-generated content. As we shall see, these applications provide mechanisms for the dissemination and control of malware. I also show how these techniques support forms of indirection that make it difficult to identify explicit state responsibility for many cyber-attacks over the last decade.\nAt first sight, it might seem that this topic is tangential to many of the mainstream interests within the field of Ergonomics. In contrast, I will argue that it is increasingly important to understand not only the positive role that social networks play in work and leisure but it is also equally necessary to understand how these phenomena may also be abused to support criminal activity. The following pages also explain why so much of our working lives continue to be devoted to filtering the thousands of spam emails that are generated by botnets. A botnet can be thought of as a number of interacting programmes communicating across a network of compromised machines; the term is formed from the conjunction of ‘robotic’ ‘networks’.\nSocial networking hinders the attribution of cyber-attacks in four different ways. First, social networks have helped to ‘crowd source’ the participants in an attack. They have motivated individuals to participate in mass Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. They have provided the code needed to launch DDoS and have published information on potential targets. Second, attackers have used information about an individual’s social networks to compromise security measures. For example, information about the friends and colleagues of a target can be obtained from social networks. This enables ‘spear phishing’; a recipient is more likely to open an infected attachment or link if it has been sent from a trusted participant in their social network. Third, I show how the information infrastructures that are associated with some forms of social\n© 2013 Taylor &amp; Francis\nC.W. Johnson\nnetworking create disposable architectures for command and control servers to coordinate malware attacks. Finally, governments have tolerated and even encouraged the growth of anti-social criminal networks that are later used to launch attacks on political targets, for instance, using botnets. Table 1 summarises the different roles that social media have played in the case studies that are presented in this paper. Before introducing the incidents that are included within this study, it is first important to present the methodological background to our work.\n# 1.1 Methodological interactions from action research to case-study approach\nResearch of this nature raises a host of methodological problems. Several authors have recently pioneered the use of human factors techniques to identify security threats and vulnerabilities. For instance, Kraemer, Carayon, and Clem (2009) used focus groups of IT security professionals to identify the individual and organisational causes of vulnerabilities. Shaw (2006) reviews the empirical evidence that supports the role of behavioural consultants within investigative teams looking at the potential role of insiders within particular attacks. However, neither of these studies considers the detailed role of individual and organisational human factors in state-sponsored cyber-attacks. Very few previous studies consider the wider national context of threats that extend beyond individual organisations. Many of the techniques that have been conventionally applied in Ergonomics cannot easily be used to analyse social aspects of state-sponsored cyber-crime. This is an important caveat given that cyber-attacks have an increasing impact on the working lives of many people. Empirical studies and laboratory investigations yield useful insights into individual behaviours; however, Dantzker and Hunter (2000) summarise the problems that arise when interpreting the results of studies that are intended to analyse criminal behaviour. Further criticisms stem from the limited insights that such studies provide into the group interactions (Dixona and Thebergeb 2011), which are at the heart of this paper.\nAction research provides an alternative perspective (Lewin 1946). It builds on the idea that complex social interactions cannot be studied by focussing on the isolated behaviours of particular individuals. In contrast, more situated studies provide a view of the impact of change on society. Action research provides tools to investigate changes and their effects while overcoming researchers' 'self-imposed distance from the world of action' (Dash 1999). These techniques are entirely appropriate within the context of this paper because the area of cyber-security is in constant flux. The role of social networks as a mechanism for launching attacks continues to adapt, for example, in response to new security mechanisms.\nAction research is not the only methodological approach that might be used to support this work; Blichfeldt and Andersen (2006) identify a continuum from Yin's (1994) hypothetical-deductive case-study techniques to Glaser and Strauss' (1967) notion of grounded theory. Yin's techniques assume that investigators will directly intervene in the working context, whereas Glaser and Strauss promote a more observational approach. The work reported in the following sections has been derived using action-based techniques as part of initiatives to increase the resilience of national and international infrastructures. I acknowledge that these involvements may bias our work in a positivist way. Equally active involvement helps to establish the relationships needed before access is granted to forensic evidence (Johnson 2012). Rather than focussing on these positivist interventions, the following sections draw more on the case-study methodologies associated with Yin. The intention is to provide an overview of recent incidents – not only to support our theories on the roles that social networking plays in the 'attribution problem' but also to provide readers with an overview of the causes and consequences of cyber-incidents that are an increasing threat across many different industries.\nThe methodology adopted in this work was to conduct a series of interviews with members of government organisations, including military and intelligence agencies, in the countries affected by the attacks. These were confidential, given the nature of the events under discussion. The questions focused on the probable causes of the attacks and also the consequences for government infrastructures. The initial insights provided by these meetings were validated by subsequent\nTable 1.

Telecommunications companies were asked about the resilience of their systems and where possible to provide access to technical data about the connectivity of their networks over time. I also consulted critical infrastructure providers, including air traffic management organisations and financial service companies. In many cases, the impact of state-sponsored cyber-attacks was less severe than might have been assumed. In other cases, a lack of forensic expertise exacerbated recovery. It is important to stress that our aim was to survey the use of social networks in state-sponsored cyber-attacks, rather than to follow a rigid methodology. I had limited opportunities to contact the intended targets of Stuxnet inside Iran and the victims of Ghostnet. Instead, I relied on sources within NATO to assess the impact of these attacks. The inclusion of both incidents within the paper is justified because they mark key developments in state-sponsored, offensive capabilities.\n## Estonia, April--May 2007\nThe first case study focuses on a series of cyber-attacks that were directed against Estonia during April and May 2007. There are earlier examples of coordinated threats; for instance, the US government identified the ‘Titan Rain' attacks on companies, such as Lockheed Martin, national laboratories, including Sandia, and military targets, such as the Redstone Arsenal before 2003. Attackers from the Netherlands successfully compromised some 34 US defence sites in 1990.\nThe probable causes of the Estonian case study can be traced back to tensions between ethnic Estonians and Russians following the Second World War. After independence, many ethnic Russians were left without any form of citizenship. More immediate triggers included a decision to move the Bronze Soldier of Tallinn. This war memorial had become a focus for clashes between Estonians and Russian nationalists. The subsequent riots left one person dead and 150 injured. Some argued that the statue was a symbol of the Soviet occupation of Estonia, whereas others believed that it was a memorial to the Russians who fought against Nazi occupation (Tikk 2009).\nIt is possible to distinguish several different phases in this incident. An initial emotional/physical stage was closely tied to the riots around the Bronze Soldier. A series of website defacements then took place, but these were then superseded by a third phase in which DDoS attacks were launched (Tikk 2009). The rapid development of digital communications during the moves towards independence between 1988 and 1991 arguably placed Estonia at greater risk from such cyber-attacks. At the time of the attack, some 97% of all Estonian bank transactions were made online, 65% of the population were classified as ‘active users' of the Internet and 80% of the population had national identity cards that supported digital signatures. A number of different DDoS mechanisms were used. These included Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) floods launched by individuals. The aim was to overwhelm a server and stop it responding to legitimate requests. The Estonian attacks also included the use of botnets. A botnet is a network of private computers infected with malware, and they are controlled as a group typically without the owners' knowledge.\nArbor Networks identified more than 120 different attacks over a 3-week period; these included “a decent sized botnet behind the attack, with aggregate bandwidth at our points of measurement maxing out at nearly 100 Mbps ... All in all, someone is very, very deliberate in putting the hurt on Estonia, and this kind of thing is only going to get more severe in the coming years. (Nazario 2007)”\nHowever, most of the attacks (100 of the 120) were simple ICMP floods. Four involved more sophisticated approaches where TCP connection requests were sent faster than the recipient could process them. Most of the targets were government websites, especially the Ministry of Finance (35 of 128). Most attacks lasted less than an hour, but seven went on for more than 10 h.\nThe impact on the working lives of the Estonian public has been overestimated. For instance, a Chatham House report argued: “The severity and length of the attacks directed at one of NATO's most electronically connected members put the alliance on guard. If a highly wired small state could be brought to its knees by a well-orchestrated Internet-based attack, then what type of havoc could be wrought upon larger states with more heterogeneous systems and critical infrastructure open to attack? (Hughes 2008)”\nEstonia's two largest banks, Hansapank and SEB Eesti Ühispank, were attacked several times between 9 and 15 May. However, the effects were very limited. Hansapank's e-banking service had to be shut down for up to 2 h on 9 and 10 May. SEB Eesti Ühispank's online banking service was down for a similar period on 15 May. The banks mitigated the impact of the attacks by, for instance, limiting access to customers outside of Estonia. Three major Internet service providers -- Elion Ettevõtted, Elisa Andmesideteenused and Starman -- came under DDoS attacks (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010). The Zone.ee web hosting service provider and directory service provider (ee.ee) were attacked, but in each case their services were restored relatively quickly. The US Computer Emergency Readiness Team (CERT) assessment concluded that although this was a ‘watershed' attack, it was not ‘revolutionary' in terms of the scale or sophistication of the techniques that were used (Waterman 2007).\nThe Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Paet accused the Kremlin of involvement in the cyber-attacks. However, there was no direct evidence to link the DDoS with any state agencies. In contrast, the Estonian attacks provide an early example of ‘crowdsourcing'. Digital infrastructures were used to encourage hacktivist participation. The incidents have been compared with a ‘cyber-riot' rather than a well-coordinated attack (The Economist 2007). The term ‘patriotic hacking' describes attacks performed by a group of people who take action ‘pro patria' in cases where they believe that this is the right thing for their government to do or where they perceive the government as unable to do ‘the right thing' (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010). Political activists protested by engaging in coordinated cyber-attacks against the online presence and Internet infrastructure of Estonia. The activities of disaffected individuals provided opportunities for ‘plausible deniability' by a range of state agencies that might otherwise stand accused of coordinating the attacks.\nNATO members considered the wider implications of the attacks on Estonia, leading to the development of the Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) in 2008. This organisation is not funded directly by NATO but by the supporting member states. CCDCOE provides a meeting place for military experts, scientists, lawyers and politicians. It also publishes technical reports on emerging cyber threats and provides ‘white papers' on policy decisions including the development of international legal frameworks to clarify the response to future attacks, in particular when it is not possible to identify whether a state organisation is responsible for a threat.\nTable 1 has summarised the use of social media in the Estonian case study. As can be seen, social networks were used to crowd-source participation in the DDoS attacks. Malware was distributed through Internet sites that also provided lists of potential targets. It is important to stress that the participants in this attack were not simply the individuals usually associated with hacking but included a far broader spectrum including members of the public who were opposed to what they viewed as the suppression of minority rights in the aftermath of Estonian independence (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010).\n## Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty, April 2008\nThe second case study focuses on the role that botnets and other forms of ‘anti-social' networking played on cyber-attacks against Radio Svaboda, the Belarusian service of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL). These radio stations were established during the Cold War and had been the target of direct physical attacks, including a poisoning attempt associated with the Czechoslovak intelligence service and a car bomb, linked to the Romanian government. However, the cyber-attacks can be linked to political tensions inside Belarus. Many independent observers criticised the electoral processes used by President Alexander Lukashenka to extend his tenure in 1996 and 2004. There were limited opportunities to voice criticisms within Belarus. During 2008, a Statute on Mass Media extended the state monopoly of Internet Service Provision. Beltelekom was able to restrict access to sites that criticised the administration, including those operated by Radio Svaboda.\nDuring the morning of 26 April 2008, the Radio Svaboda web servers were subjected to a DDoS attack (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010). These attacks seem to have been launched by the government supporters to prevent Radio Svaboda from covering popular protests on the 22nd anniversary of the Chernobyl accident, which occurred on the borders of Belarus and the Ukraine. Many people were unhappy about the lack of compensation for those affected by the accident. Others were angered by the administration's support for the Belarus civil nuclear programme.\nThis analysis does not explain why the cyber-attacks also affected a number of other RFL/RE servers, including those for Kosovo, Azerbaijan, Tatar-Bashkir and Radio Farda in Iran. These additional attacks were arguably intended to obfuscate the attribution of the DDoS on Radio Svaboda. However, motivation and opportunity cannot be used as surrogates for more direct evidence of official involvement. Several organisations argued that Russian DDoS botnets were involved in the attacks (Nazario 2008a). These ‘anti-social' networks were also used to coordinate attacks on a wider range of opposition media sites. These included Charter 97, an English language news site on political activities in Belarus; BelPartyzan, a local news website and the Russian language information sites, legis-group.ru and compromat.net.\nThe botnets used in the Belarus DDoS attacks were normally used for criminal activities; in particular to generate spam and phishing emails. The blurred boundary between cyber-crime and state-sponsored cyber-attacks is a feature of many case studies in this paper (Nazario 2008a, 2008b, 2008c). Government agencies provide implicit support for criminal groups, who develop the infrastructures to support future attacks. However, the links are informal. Criminal groups may act for patriotic reasons or to ensure continued implicit state approval; in either case, it seems clear that anti-social networks have been forged between state agencies and cyber-attackers (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010; Johnson 2012).\nThe RFE/RL case study also illustrates the resilience of information infrastructures. The cyber-attacks did not bring the services ‘to their knees'. Several local websites in Belarus offered to carry content for RFE/RL before they could recover. By 28 April, most of the RFL/RE sites had been restored with significant improvements in their security infrastructures. The Radio Svaboda site administrators were also able to gain technical support from communities around the globe. In particular, help was received from several groups interested in maintaining the freedom of expression across the Internet. This provides a precursor to the collective action seen during the ‘Arab Spring' of 2011. The uprisings and unrest in Algeria,\nBahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Syria, Tunisia and Yemen were all influenced by the use of social media. Attempts by many states to disrupt Internet communications did not prevent opposition groups from disseminating messages using externally hosted sites. The attacks on RFE/RL provide an early example of the ‘social resilience' of communications infrastructures in response to cyber-attacks.\nThe Estonian case study showed that social networks could be used to coordinate cyber-attacks using crowd-sourcing techniques in response to political conflict. In contrast, Table 1 has shown that hacktivism was not a significant part of the cyber-attacks on RFE/RL. In contrast, DDoS attacks were launched by criminal botnets used to generate spam messages with an obvious impact on working lives around the globe. State agencies did not close down these anti-social networks, arguably, because they knew they could be recruited to launch cyber-attacks without the need to implicate government information infrastructures. Previous ergonomic studies tend to focus on the symptoms associated with these botnets, in terms of the impact of nuisance messages. Very few have considered the criminal and political context that sustains the dark side of the Internet.\n## 4. Lithuania, June 2008\nThe cyber-attacks on Estonia and Lithuania both had their roots in the tensions that arose following the break-up of the Soviet bloc. The right-wing Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats introduced a series of amendments to prohibit the public display of Soviet or Nazi insignia and were subsequently elected to power in November 2008. This created the background for conflict as the Russian Federation began to reassert influence on the Baltic states (Pääbo 2008). The immediate passage of the amendments did not seem to trigger the same level of hostility in the local Russian population, as had been observed amongst ethnic Russians in Estonia (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010). However, President Medvedev joined with the Belarusian President Lukashenka to express the Russian Federation's concern over the legislation. There were simultaneous protests outside the Lithuanian embassy in Moscow accompanied by a significant number of cyber-attacks. Some 300 websites were defaced by anti-Lithuanian slogans and by pro-Soviet symbols that would have been banned under the 2008 amendments.\nThe attacks were first detected on 28 June, peaking between 17:00 and 18:00 EET on Sunday 29 June. Companies and government websites were targeted ranging from the Lithuanian equivalent of the Securities and Exchange Commission to the web portal for the Lithuanian Social Democratic Party. By 2 July, most of the sites were able to resume normal operation.\nAfter independence, successive governments had encouraged the development of information infrastructures across Lithuanian, for instance through the Information Society Development Programme. Almost half of all households possessed a computer at the time of the attack, and one-third of government organisations had a web presence. However, companies suffered the most. The Lithuanian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-LT) had warned government agencies on a list of ‘at-risk' organisations after an Estonian TV channel had reported the possibility of a cyber-attack on 26 July. Commercial organisations did not receive the warning because they had not been included on the initial list. CERTs have been established by governments around the globe to increase resilience to cyber-attacks. The Lithuanian CERT had been established around 18 months before the web servers were defaced.\nThe Lithuanian attacks show how CERTs can develop networks of potential targets to ensure that warnings are propagated to at-risk organisations. This case study also illustrates the need for government agencies to actively monitor social media for intelligence about potential attacks and for forensic information in the aftermath of a cyber-incident. CERT-LT traced most of the targets back to Hostex, one of the largest web hosting services in Lithuania. The forensic analysis showed that once the vulnerability had been identified, all Hostex users were targeted. CERT-LT assisted the Hostex engineers as they worked to mitigate the effects of the attacks. The modes of attack resemble those used in both Estonia and Belarus. Initial reports focused on vulnerabilities in PHP servers that were then used to run a series of scripts distributed amongst a small group of attackers. However, other modes of attack included the generation of large amounts of spam email linking to ‘Hackers United against External Threats to Russia', which resembled the use of botnets in the previous case studies (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010).\nCERT-LT and RRT, the Lithuanian communications regulatory authority, identified the use of proxy servers to the East. It seemed “likely that the attacks were organised in advance, considering the fact that signals, invitations, and agitation were spread on the Internet prior to the attacks. However, the RRT refused to speak of any particular countries as the initiator of the attack. (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010)” Subsequent analysis identified compromised hosts in France and Sweden as possible sources for the defacement attacks suggesting that they had been planned in advance. However, as in Belarus, the Lithuanian attacks might also have used servers that had already been violated for other cyber-crime activities.\nCircumstantial evidence for the involvement of Russian hacking groups is provided by discussions on Internet forums, such as hack-wars.ru. However, direct proof was difficult to obtain. For example, the Cyber Police Unit of the Lithuanian Police argued that the attackers had used the Tor ‘onion routing' protocols. Tor is used by journalists, whistle-blowers and law enforcement agencies to prevent monitoring of Internet traffic. It relies on ‘onion routing'; this refers to the use of encryption at multiple layers of a communication network. The Lithuanian attacks illustrate a number of common themes across many of the incidents in this paper. Attribution was complicated by the lack of direct evidence for state involvement and by the participation of ‘hacking groups' communicating over Internet forums and social media.\n## Georgia, August 2008\nThe fourth case study forms part of the armed conflict between Georgia and the Russian Federation over Ossetia. Although this region straddles the Caucasian mountains, North Ossetia was ceded to the Soviet Union, whereas the area south of the mountains became part of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic (GSSR). Fighting broke out between Georgian forces and South Ossetia (1991--1992) and then in Abkhazia (1992--1994). In consequence, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) formed a peacekeeping force in 1992 with troops from Russia, Georgia and South Ossetia. The composition of this peacekeeping force did little to reduce animosity between the various factions (European Commission 2009). This was exacerbated by Moscow's concern when the Bush administration provided assistance for the Georgian forces to clear Chechen fighters from the Pankisi valley. By April 2008, large-scale military exercises were being conducted on both sides of the border. Fighter aircraft and UAVs began to patrol ‘demilitarised' areas.\nOn 7 August 2008, Georgian forces attacked the town of Tskhinvali and surrounding areas in response to an alleged Russian invasion. By 8 August, the Russian air force was attacking infrastructures, targets included Tbilisi airport radar, railroad junctions and telecommunications facilities. By 10 August, the Georgian Government declared a unilateral ceasefire and announced its intention to withdraw Georgian forces from South Ossetia. By 11 August, Russian troops had crossed the boundaries of Ossetia and entered a number of Georgian towns. On 12 August, French President Sarkozy travelled to Moscow and Tiblisi, representing the European Council. He proposed a six-point peace plan that ultimately led to a ceasefire. By 22 August, Russian troops had withdrawn from their positions beyond the former boundaries of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.\nThe most obvious difference with Estonia and Lithuania is that the Georgian cyber-attacks coincided with a physical offensive. The effects were also different. More than 50% of the Estonian population were active users of the Internet. In contrast, this figure was close to 30% in Lithuania but only 10% in Georgia. However, the impact on Georgia was greater because most of their information infrastructures passed through the Russian territory (Zmijewski 2008). Georgia was aware of these communication vulnerabilities and wanted to develop trade opportunities with the EU. Most Internet traffic was deliberately routed via Turkish or Azerbaijan service providers. Work had almost been completed on a high capacity link with Bulgaria before the invasion.\nThe initial wave of cyber-attacks on the Georgian government infrastructures occurred before the armed conflict. These included ICMP floods and spurious HTTP ‘GET' requests similar to the techniques used in Estonia (Nazario 2008b). Targets included www.president.gov.ge, where images of Adolf Hitler were substituted for pictures of President Saakashvili. A collage of dictators was also placed on the National Bank of the Republic of Georgia's site. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs portal was attacked as were newspaper and media agencies in Georgia and Azerbaijan. Meanwhile, the DDoS attacks were aimed at government sites, including the Parliament and Ministry of Education and Science and the banks. The DDoS statistics gathered during the Georgian attacks were also similar to those for Estonia. Most attacks lasted from 2 to 6 h.\nIntelligence agencies had learned from events in Estonian and were better equipped to monitor the attack patterns against Georgia. Several botnets were involved, including the MachBot controller for an HTTP-based botnet attack coordinated by Russian herders. Many aspects of the attacks in Estonia and Georgia have been linked to the Russian Business Network (RBN) criminal organisation and associated botnets. The accuracy of this claim is understandably difficult to establish, as is the nexus between the founder of the RBN and Russian government agencies. It may be that the RBN provided access to botnet resources without mounting the DDoS attacks; following a ‘business model' that supported their wider activities (Grey Goose 2008). However, it is dangerous to assume that involvement in an attack provides reliable evidence about its coordination (Tikk et al. 2008). At least one of the botnets' command and control servers was located in the USA.\nThere is also evidence that social media was used to support ‘crowdsourcing' similar to that seen in Estonia: “a downloadable script to ping flood Estonian websites (both DNS and IPs) was shared on various Russian language message boards. Instructions on how to ping flood Georgian government websites were also distributed on Russian language websites and\nmessage boards, as well as lists of Georgian sites vulnerable to remote SQL injections, facilitating automatic defacement of them. (Tikk et al. 2008).”\nSQL injections occur because commands written in one language may be hidden inside the instructions of another. If the input is not correctly filtered for embedded command sequences, then these can be inadvertently executed by higher layers of an application. The email addresses of prominent Georgian politicians, academics and industrialists were also distributed. These were used to focus spamming and more targeted forms of attack (Tikk et al. 2008). Major figures had to create new email accounts and re-establish their social networks in a piecemeal fashion, at a time when their attention should have been focused on the invasion.\nThe response to the attacks was coordinated by CERT Georgia. Their analysis of Internet Protocol (IP) data was supported by Estonian, French and Polish counterparts. However, many of the targets of the cyber-attacks simply waited. Normal commercial activities were curtailed by the armed conflict. Some websites mitigated the impact of the attacks by temporarily changing IP addresses. Others used international hosts; Blogspot.com supported Georgian news and government agencies. The websites of the Georgian President and their Ministry of Defence were relocated to a company in Atlanta, GA, USA. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs moved to an Estonian server. These counter-measures had limited effects inside Georgia. Flood attacks on Caucasus Network Tbilisi caused significant bottlenecks exacerbated by damage to network infrastructures inside the war zone; many Georgian Internet connections ran through Russia.\nThese case studies illustrate a complex relation between ICT maturity and the vulnerability to cyber-attacks. The more a nation depends upon networked services, then the more vulnerable it can be to any cyber-incident. The Estonian public relied on the Internet for a host of government and financial services. The impact on Georgia was more limited. Equally, the more a nation depends upon networked services, then the more resilient it will be to any cyber-incident. Less mature nations find it harder to bring their electronic infrastructures back online. In Georgia, the attacks forced the suspension of electronic banking services for 10 days rather than the hours of interruption seen in Estonia.\nIt is difficult to underestimate the psychological impact of a combined attack on both physical and digital infrastructures. Tikk et al. (2008) observe that “while the attacks did not have a permanent or even a long-run devastating effect on the Georgian Internet infrastructure, the damage caused by the attacks was most acutely experienced at the time when Georgia was the most dependent on the availability of their information channels.”\nThe synchronisation of the physical and virtual attacks reinforced the vulnerability of the Georgian government to external forces.\nThe Georgian case study also shows how cyber-conflicts can extend across different social networks. Russian hacking groups were implicated in the initial attacks on Georgian government infrastructures. In contrast, hacking groups inside Georgia also became the targets of cyber-attacks. The www.hacking.ge website was an early victim. This removed a potential source of advice and information about ways to increase the resilience of Georgian networks. Alternatively, it can be seen as part of a direct conflict between hacking/hacking networks in Russia and Georgia. Russian sites also seem to have been the target of secondary attacks, such as that operated by the RIA Novosti news outlet (Nazario 2008c).\nTable 1 has summarised the diverse role that various forms of social networks played in the Georgian attacks. As can be seen, crowdsourcing was used through the distribution of scripts and lists of potential victims. Social networks were also used to distribute information about individuals who were then deliberately the target of spamming attacks. Finally, botnets were used to coordinate DDoS attacks. However, unlike previous case studies, there is evidence to suggest the conflict extended between hacking networks on both sides of the conflict.\n## 6. China, GhostNet, March 2009\nThere are similarities between the first four case studies; the Estonian, Belarusian, Lithuania and Georgian attacks all stemmed from the break-up of the Soviet Union. All four involved politically motivated DDoS attacks supported by the use of criminal botnets. In all four cases, the victims were able to use networks of contacts and sympathisers to recover from the attacks within hours. In contrast, the fifth case study focuses on ‘advanced persistent threats' (Daly 2009). As the term suggests, this form of attack requires greater coordination and planning. APTs also illustrate how a new generation of cyber-threats uses social networks to deliberately focus their attacks on particular individuals. Information about an individual's online contacts can be exploited by ‘socially engineered malware'.\nThis case study focuses on the violation of computers in more than 100 countries. Although the evidence is circumstantial, it seems likely that these attacks were coordinated by groups inside the People's Republic of China as part of the wider policy of active defence (IWM 2009). Subsequent sections of this paper will describe similar techniques exploited by agencies in Europe and North America. However, this case study considers targets in the foreign ministries of Iran, Bangladesh, Latvia, Indonesia, Philippines, Brunei, Barbados and Bhutan; embassies in India, South Korea, Indonesia,\nRomania, Cyprus, Malta, Thailand, Taiwan, Portugal, Germany and Pakistan; the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Secretariat and the Asian Development Bank. The attacks also compromised computers in news organisations and a range of commercial organisations.\nThese attacks seemed to follow a common pattern; a Trojan horse was introduced onto a victim's machine that would then exfiltrate information to control servers, ultimately reporting back to Chinese sources. These data would include information about the victim's social networks that could then be used by spear phishing attacks. Their email account would be used to send a malicious payload to the individuals in their contact list (Nagaraja and Anderson 2009). The success of the approach depended upon convincing the recipient to open the attached document containing the malware. People are far more likely to open an attachment if it comes from a friend or colleague. Once opened, this attachment would compromise the next link in the social network. The terms ‘social malware', ‘social engineering' and ‘spear phishing' describe the use of information about the target's network of contacts. The aim is to increase the plausibility of the email vector. In some cases, legitimate messages were simply reused. In other cases, documents were taken from other compromised machines and then passed to new targets with the embedded malware to increase the probability that they would, in turn, infect their machines.\nThis modus operandi was christened the ‘GhostNet'; it was identified following investigations on behalf of the Office of the Dalai Lama (IWM 2009). Sympathisers were detained by Chinese officials who seemed to have knowledge of their Internet communications. Many sympathisers used Tencent QQ to spread information about the Tibetan cause; this is the most widespread instant messaging service in mainland China. Voice over IP applications might also have been compromised. The Office of the Dalai Lama, therefore, installed network monitoring software to gather additional forensic evidence. They found that infected machines would exchange information with command and control servers -- to download updated versions of the malware and send data out of the local networks: “(This) led to the discovery of four control servers and six command servers ... The control servers were then probed and web-based control interfaces were identified on four control servers, which allowed us to view and control the network. The system was actively monitored for 2 weeks, which allowed us to derive an extensive list of infected systems, and to also monitor the systems operator(s) as the operator(s) specifically instructed target computers. (IWM 2009)”The IP addresses associated with most of these servers were traced to China. Several were located on the island of Hainan, home to the Lingshui signals intelligence facility and the Third Technical Department of the People's Liberation Army. However, other servers were traced to the USA, Sweden, South Korea and Taiwan. This illustrates the complexity of attribution.\nA subsequent analysis of the web servers that were used to coordinate the GhostNet Trojan's undermined arguments that they were maintained by government agencies. Instead, they used QQ instant messaging numbers to trace the sites back to members of the Chinese hacking community (Henderson 2009). These studies concluded that patriotic hacking and cybercrime may have played a role in the development of these attacks (Villeneuve 2010). Further circumstantial evidence of the anti-social networks that connect hacking groups was provided by the reuse of techniques associated with the earlier Enfal Trojan within the Ghostnet attacks. Code seems to have been exchanged between different groups of programmers working with a similar but distinct malware. The case studies in this paper provide parallels between twenty-first century cyber-crime and seventeenth century piracy. They illustrate a privateering model, in which governments authorise private individuals to attack enemies of the state. Further investigations concluded that two or three different groups were using different command and control infrastructures to support multiple forms of attack on opposition groups (IWM 2009, 2010).\nForensic analysis of the GhostNet attacks illustrates the dual nature of social networks in cyber-security. Victims were targeted using spear-phishing techniques that deliberately exploited information about their social networks (Wasserman and Galaskiewicz 1994). Conversely, the perpetrators of the attack were traced by monitoring connections between different groups of attackers, for instance across Baidu: “(these attacks were) to a large degree organised and operated through the misuse of social networking and cloud computing platforms, including Google, Baidu, Yahoo!, and Twitter, in addition to traditional command and control servers ... although we are able to piece together circumstantial evidence that provides the location and possible associations of the attackers, their actual identities and motivations remain illusory. We catch a glimpse of a shadow of attribution in the cloud, in other words, but have no positive identification ... there is a generational shift unfolding in malware networks in multiple dimensions, from what were once primarily simple to increasingly complex, adaptive systems spread across redundant services and platforms, and from criminal and industrial-based exploitation to political, military, and intelligence-focused espionage. (IWM 2010)”\nCloud-based infrastructures and web mail services support these new forms of attack. Free or low-cost hosting services with minimal background checks enable the development of command and control servers that can be used to update malware and coordinate the exfiltration of data. If the security of these servers is compromised, then they can quickly be abandoned at almost no cost. In these circumstances, the Trojans used social networking sites, including Twitter, Google Groups, Blogspot, Baidu Blogs and blog.com accounts, to access links to the new free hosting accounts that replaced the compromised command and control servers (Nazario 2009). As a final resort, the malware could contact more stable servers\nin China; these would then point the malware back to an alternate disposable hosting service reducing the chances of further detection (IWM 2010).\nThe (ab)use of social networking and Cloud infrastructures to implement command and control servers was compounded through the indirection provided by the Tor anonymity network. This technique was mentioned in our third case study; the Cyber Police Unit of the Lithuanian Police found that Tor had been used to disguise the attacks on their government servers. Tor passes communications through various volunteer servers to prevent others from identifying the origin of a message. When researchers monitored unencrypted data leaving the Tor network, they found some of it related to the Dalai Lama's office. Because these messages did not originate from the Office of the Dalai Lama, they concluded that the information was most probably being forwarded to Tor as the attackers tried to disguise the compromised machines (IMW 2010).\nThe GhostNet attacks again illustrate the need to increase links between the field of Ergonomics and cyber-security. Social-media provide significant benefits across a broad range of industries (Manyika, Chui, and Sarrazin 2012). They enable networks of contacts to work together across national borders and between diverse organisations. At the same time, Cloud computing techniques are providing low-cost methods to coordinate distributed work, for instance, through the development of shared, virtual infrastructures. However, these innovations have created new vulnerabilities. Malware now makes use of social media to obtain information about personal contacts. There are then used to propagate spear-phishing attacks where a malicious payload is disguised within email that is deliberately tailored for a recipient within a social network. Similarly, Cloud and web mail infrastructures provide the disposable technologies that enable the rapid development of command and control servers. These are used to upload more recent versions of malware and also to forward data extracted from a victim's machine. They reduce the likelihood of detection because they can be abandoned without cost should an attack be discovered. Table 1 has summarised the role of social networks and their supporting technologies within the GhostNet attacks. A key motivation for writing this paper is to encourage more active research within the field of Ergonomics to increase our resilience to these forms of attack. The solutions are unlikely to be purely technical; these forms of attack undermine the trust of victims in their information infrastructures. Unless more is carried out to make individuals and groups aware of the potential threats, there is a risk that the dark side of the Internet will limit the further development of the digital economy. Many companies now prohibit staff from accessing social media on any device that is used within their networks -- including applications that are specifically intended to support business networks (Markelj and Bernik 2012).\n## W32.STUXNET, March 2010\nThe case studies in this paper provide a spectrum from the mass DDoS attacks that relied on hacktivism and crowdsourcing in Georgia, Estonia, Latvia and Belarus, to the more focussed techniques that were deployed against the social networks of Chinese opposition groups. The final case study argues that Stuxnet had an even narrower focus; attacking a particular group of centrifuges within the Iranian nuclear enrichment programme. Social networks again played an important role in the transmission of this malware. It exploited vulnerabilities in the auto-execution mechanisms associated with removable drives, such as USB sticks. In consequence, Stuxnet quickly infected groups of users, including commercial and government organisations, which shared data and applications (Falliere, Murchu, and Chien 2011). One reason for the successful transmission of the malware was that it took steps to cover its tracks. Code was introduced to delete any malware left on a USB stick after the third infection. Stuxnet again illustrates how computer viruses can propagate across social and professional networks.\nStuxnet also illustrated the exchange of ‘lessons learned' across anti-social networks. It exploited techniques that had previously been used in the Conficker worm. Stuxnet spread across local area networks, exploiting vulnerabilities in the Windows Print Spooler. The virus would also scan infected computers for security software. In some cases, the malware would inject code into trusted processes, including anti-virus programmes. However, if the security product was considered to be resilient to the attack, then no injection would be attempted. Stuxnet used command and control servers, similar to those identified in the Chinese attacks. These were located in Malaysia and Denmark; connection requests were monitored from over 40,000 unique IP addresses in more than 155 countries. When a new machine was infected, the malware would first test connectivity with a valid address, including www.msn.com. If successful, the malware would first download an update of the virus; three different versions have been identified.\nOne of the reasons that Stuxnet was so virulent is that it included a Windows rootkit, providing privileged access to the underlying operating system while at the same time masking the intrusion. It also incorporated four ‘zero-day exploits'. These vulnerabilities in underlying operating systems or network architectures were unknown before the malware was released. The term ‘zero day' indicates that this is the first day when security firms can patch the vulnerability. The number of zero-day attacks in Stuxnet is highly unusual. Using all four at once is wasteful; an attack may be sustained by waiting for the first exploit to be patched before releasing the second and so on.\nThe attack was focussed against Iran's civil nuclear programmes. Between 2006 and 2010, the United Nations passed six resolutions to prevent them from developing the enrichment technologies to produce military grade uranium. For instance, resolution 1803 (March 2008) banned the export of dual use technologies with nuclear applications to Iran. The term ‘dual use' is important because the enrichment process is essential to develop uranium fuel for civil energy generation, but also for nuclear weapons development. Enrichment relies on cascades of centrifuges that produce successively higher concentrations. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) found evidence that Iran had created at least two strings capable of enriching uranium up to 20% by August 2010. Iran had more than 2.5 tons of low-enriched uranium, which was sufficient to support the development of nuclear weapons using existing centrifuges.\nStuxnet targeted the Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) that supervised the Iranian centrifuges. PLCs are not, typically, connected to networks. Instead, they are periodically attached to PCs, and code is downloaded directly onto the controllers. The PLCs are then connected to the centrifuges. In consequence, attackers must first infect the PCs that are used to code the PLCs. Stuxnet focussed on the Siemen's Step 7 PLC programming environment. If Step 7 was not detected on an infected PC, then no actions were taken. If it was detected, then Stuxnet exploited a number of vulnerabilities in the Step 7 environment, including a hard-coded password for its SCADA database. Stuxnet was also able to hook operating system calls to open project files associated with the Siemens application. However, it did not infect all of the Step 7 data. It was only interested in projects that had been used or accessed within the previous three and a half years.\nStuxnet monitored, replaced and disguised blocks of Step 7 code being written to PLCs. In order to do this, the malware had to forge the digital signatures that were used to authenticate drivers in the malicious binaries. These were maintained by two Taiwanese companies, which seem to have been the victims of conventional or physical industrial espionage (Matrosov et al. 2010). This is reminiscent of the Georgian case study where the cyber-attack coincident with a physical invasion. In Stuxnet, the cyber-attack was supported by convention forms of espionage.\nOnce the malicious code had made the jump from the PCs to the PLCs, it monitored the frequency of the motors attached to the centrifuge. It only attacked systems that operated at frequencies between 807 and 1210 Hz. The malware then triggered a state machine to control the sabotage. After an initial delay of some 13 days, Stuxnet set the maximum frequency to 1410 Hz; 27 days later, this was changed to 2 Hz and then 1064 Hz before the sequence was repeated. The malware acted like a landmine; the intention was not to kill the victim, but to consume finite resources of time and expertise. By analogy, the intention was not to destroy the centrifuges, but to waste the Iranian engineering resources as teams of workers had to repair affected components and identify the source of the problems. The IAEA reported signs of damage to around 900 centrifuges during the period when Stuxnet was active. However, independent studies suggest that Iran was able to increase uranium enrichment in spite of this cyber-attack (Amarelo 2011). They were resilient to the cyber-attack, just as the victims were in our previous case studies. One interpretation of this conflicting evidence is that Iranian authorities deliberately exaggerated the impact of the malware to create the impression that greater damage had been inflicted on their nuclear programmes.\nThe sophistication of Stuxnet suggests that it was developed by a network of engineers. Not only did they require a detailed knowledge of the Step 7 environment, but they also needed access to specialist hardware. The malicious payload focused on PLCs using a particular Central Processing Unit; 6ES7-315-2 (series 300). The malware monitored the PLCs' Profibus communications processors looking for frequency converters manufactured by Fararo Paya in Iran and Vacon in Finland. The range of technical skills required by this cyber-attack strongly suggests that Stuxnet was created by a team or network of developers. Stuxnet would have taken from 5 to 30 people around 6 months to prepare (Falliere, Murchu, and Chien 2011). It is remarkable that Stuxnet did not affect any of the registered users for the Step 7 environment. Hence, the development team may have included security agencies as well as representatives of the companies that might otherwise have been affected by the attack. However, this speculation does not preclude the possibility that a small group of committed individuals acted together to create the malware with or without state encouragement.\nSome commentators have argued that the preoccupation with Iranian centrifuges has masked the real purpose of the Stuxnet virus (Gaycken 2010). The attacks can be seen as the first field test of a targeted cyber-attack. The widespread dissemination of the virus violated many different systems, but the damage was highly focussed on a very small number of specialist devices. In this interpretation, the real purpose of Stuxnet was to reveal how future cyber-weapons could go beyond the mass DDoS of earlier attacks. In contrast to ‘hacktivist' crowdsourcing in Estonia, Lithuania, Georgia and Belarus, the GhostNet and Stuxnet cyber-attacks required relatively small networks of specialists working together to exploit common features of our everyday working environments -- ranging from USB sticks to social networks and Cloud infrastructures.\n## Summary of the use of social media in cyber-attacks\nThere are many motivations for a closer engagement between the field of Ergonomics and cyber-security. First, it is important that human factors specialists have a better understanding of the underlying causes of security threats. Cyber-\nErgonomics\nsecurity will have an increasing impact on working lives. It is not simply the high-profile security breaches that affect major public and private institutions, but also the everyday irritation created by spam and the continual need to maintain anti-viral systems. Second, it is essential that Ergonomists play a more active role in designing our defences. At present, we are faced with a bewildering array of firewalls, passwords and access control mechanisms that frustrate our working tasks and, as we have seen, provide limited protection against emerging threats. Third, in order to understand the threat posed by recent generations of malware, it is important to understand core concepts within the field of Ergonomics. It is important to understand that social networks support new forms of attack, for instance helping hackers exchange successful techniques. Social networks can also increase resilience, bringing together technical support in the aftermath of an attack. There remains significant work to be carried out – both in inhibiting the growth of anti-social networks and promoting the interactions that will help us recover from future threats.\nFigure 1 provides an overview of the roles that social networking plays in cyber-attacks. The Estonian, Georgian and Lithuanian case studies show that crowd-sourcing supports DDoS attacks, by exchanging malware and lists of potential targets between groups of sympathisers. Social networking provided patriotic groups with both the motivation and technical direction to implement the attacks. In these incidents, the attribution problem was complicated because it is impossible to determine whether state intervention sustained the groups who launched the attacks.\nSecond, governments can exploit informal links with anti-social criminal networks during cyber-attacks. In particular, they can make use of criminal resources to attack third-party infrastructures. Russian botnets played an important part in the Belarus case study. The use of existing criminal networks hides state intervention. The attribution problem is complicated because botnets exploit various forms of indirection to mask command and control infrastructures. This is only one example of the social networks that support cyber-attacks. Malware is often exchanged between criminal networks who reuse techniques exposing previous vulnerabilities. Stuxnet exploited vulnerabilities in the IP exploited by Conficker.\nSocial networks have also been used to infer inter-personal relationships that can then be exploited by malware, for example using spear phishing techniques. The recipient is more likely to open an infected attachment or link if it has been\nFigure 1. Different stages in the use of social networking for cyber-attacks.\nC.W. Johnson\nsent from a trusted source. The Chinese case studies have shown that politically motivated attacks, therefore, draw heavily on identity theft in wider areas of cyber-crime. Intelligence agencies now routinely monitor interactions over social media (IWM 2009).\nFinally, I have shown how the infrastructures associated with social networking create disposable architectures to coordinate attacks, for example through the development of command and control servers used by Stuxnet. The ubiquitous nature of these architectures makes it difficult to determine who owns and operates the servers. Similarly, the use of anonymity servers in the Lithuanian and GhostNet attacks shows how systems that support confidential interaction also support the dark side of the Internet.\n# 9. A roadmap for social media in cyber defence\nThis paper provides a roadmap for future resilience to the abuse of social media in cyber-attacks. I have identified existing threats – for example through crowdsourcing in DDoS attacks and through the social monitoring that directs spear phishing. I have also identified ways in which social networks can help organisations resist and recover from attacks. For instance, I have seen how the Estonian media identified Internet groups that were encouraging participation in a cyber-attack on Lithuania (stages 1 and 2 in Figure 1). In consequence, the national CERT alerted government agencies. However, organisations that had not registered with their Computer Emergency Response Team did not receive the warning. This illustrates the continuing need to develop networks for the dissemination of the best practices to increase resilience against future cyber-threats.\nFigure 2 presents our roadmap for the use of social media in mitigating the threat of cyber-attacks. It is more complex than the overview of social media in previous security incidents, illustrated in Figure 1. This is because the first diagram was based on evidence drawn from the case studies presented in this paper, using the action-based methodology from the opening sections. Figure 2 is more tentative. I have hypothesised the ways in which social media might increase resilience to future attacks. The roadmap is intended as a starting point. In particular, the diagram must be refined in response to new threats. Previous sections have described how malware exploits technologies that originally supported a wide range of end-user tasks. For instance, Cloud-based file-stores and web mail services provide flexible, virtual information infrastructures. These same technologies have also been used to create disposable command and control infrastructures. If we cannot develop a more sophisticated appreciation of the security risks that stem from the abuse of future infrastructures, then we will continue to react as cyber-attacks evolve to exploit new vulnerabilities.\nThe first element of the roadmap in Figure 2 focuses on the monitoring of social media. This can be broken down into a number of concerns. Monitoring provides advanced warning of hacktivism, especially when 'politically motivated' cyberattacks reuse infrastructures that support conventional forms of cyber-crime, including identity theft. The reuse of botnets\nFigure 2. Roadmap for the use of social networking for cyber defence.\nand many of the zero-day exploits described in previous sections were discussed on social media before they were used on political targets. Our work reiterates the need for intelligence agencies to identify intersections between political groups and the wider population of cyber-criminals using social network analysis tools.\nThe second stage of the road map reinforces links with existing security management systems through risk assessment for cyber defence. Risk assessment is important because, at present, it is not performed in an organised or systematic way by many of the potential targets of cyber-attacks. Public--private networks have been used by many states as a cost-effective means of encouraging commercial and public bodies to increase their resilience to future attacks. Companies and government agencies are encouraged to work together in developing contingency plans based on the risk assessments that identify potential cyber-threats. Unfortunately, this approach has not worked very well (Johnson 2012). Many companies have been enthusiastic participants. Many others have abstained. Even those that were initially enthusiastic have not sustained their interest.\nSocial networking provides one means of addressing these concerns. For example, the UK government is promoting Warning, Advice and Reporting Points; see www.warp.gov.uk. These groups use electronic resources to send personalised warnings and advice across a network of members. Each WARP focuses on a particular community with similar security requirements; ‘Their purpose is to provide a specific community with the capability to share security related information -- both problems and solutions -- and thereby to develop more secure and responsive environments'. The third element of the road map, therefore, focuses on the use of social media to disseminate early warnings about potential cyber-attacks.\nIssuing community warning about future attacks provides limited benefits unless they are accompanied by appropriate actions. Drills and exercises help to audit the resilience provided by these mechanisms. Too often, these drills assume perfect conditions for CERTs and other state agencies to respond to potential attacks. However, the Georgian invasion shows that cyber-incidents coincide with adverse circumstances. By developing wider communities of interest in cyber-security, by encouraging participation in drills and exercises, we can also obtain evidence of vulnerabilities and the consequences of future attacks that provide persuasive data to encourage wider participation in these initiatives.\nThe penultimate stage in the roadmap focuses on the use of social networks in forensic analysis after an attack has occurred (Johnson, in press). At present, it is extremely difficult to detect the early stages of an attack. A range of network monitoring companies, mostly located in the USA, provide detailed information on connectivity failures in the aftermath of DDoS attacks. However, CERTs cannot use these post hoc studies to trigger a more active response once an attack is underway. Greater benefits could be derived from research into the particular patterns that have characterised the initial stages of previous attacks, for example using abnormal Border Gateway Protocol events. The real-time identification of an attack is not simply a technical exercise but requires input from a range of different experts given the costs and consequences that are associated with false alarms. Closing down an infrastructure in case an attack may occur requires operational, managerial and regulatory expertise.\nThe final stage of the roadmap for using social media to increase resilience to cyber-attacks focuses on the identification and dissemination of lessons learned. At present, this remains an ad hoc process (He and Johnson 2012). Many stakeholders remain ignorant of the extent of previous attacks, especially outside their own national borders. Further problems arise when vested interests exaggerate the impact of cyber-attacks; this alienates engineering staff who play a vital role in implementing potential mitigations. As we have seen, reports that cyber-attacks will ‘bring a nation to its knees' cannot be justified on the evidence of previous incidents.\nArguably, the greatest vulnerability identified in our work has been the difficulty that managers and operators have in obtaining clear information about previous attacks. Strong contrasts can be drawn between the lack of information in this and the plethora of accident and incident reports published across safety-related industries. Of course, it can be argued that the wider dissemination of this information might encourage future attacks. However, this argument ignores the anti-social networks that have already sprung up to disseminate the technical information that can be used to launch future attacks.\n## Conclusions and further work\nThis paper provides a new perspective on the wider topics addressed in this special issue looking beyond human-centred automation. The aim has been to identify threats to human--machine interaction in multi-layered networks. Previous sections have argued that the growing complexity of socio-technical systems and the interpenetration of formerly separate systems via IT infrastructures create new opportunities for social interaction. It also creates new vulnerabilities.\nSocial networks have motivated individuals to participate in mass Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. They have disseminated information and provided resources, including lists of targets and malicious code. Second, political groups have launched attacks using infrastructures that are normally associated with wider forms of cyber-crime, including botnets. Third, I have shown how information about an individual's social networks has helped to target spear phishing. Malware is, typically, disguised in a document that was intercepted from a colleague or friend. The recipient is more likely to open an\nC.W. Johnson\nTable 2.

Finally, I have shown how the development of Cloud infrastructures and social networking applications has created disposable architectures for the command and control servers that coordinate malware attacks. The ubiquitous and distributed nature of these architectures makes it increasingly difficult to determine who owns and operates these systems. I have gone on to identify a roadmap for the defensive measures that might be used to minimise the future threats from the 'dark side' of social networking. Several of our case studies have illustrated the 'social resilience' of communications infrastructures; victims have been able to crowd-source support from overseas governments, from civil liberties groups and from sympathisers around the globe as they seek to recover from the immediate aftermath of a cyber-attack.\nTable 2 shows that the case studies were motivated by political conflict and that none had the long-term impact many fear will be the consequence of state-sponsored cyber-attacks. There are many reasons for this – most incidents affected information systems that could quickly be restored once an attack had been diagnosed. Stuxnet is a notable exception because it deliberately damaged physical systems. Even here, the Iranian authorities were able to resume enrichment activities after a relatively short period of time. However, past resilience is no basis for future complacency. This paper has shown how cyber-attacks continue to evolve. Technical innovations, intended to increase productivity and support interaction, are easily adapted to support the dark side of the Internet.\n## Acknowledgements\nThe author would like to thank the editors and reviewers of this special edition for their valuable encouragement and for feedback on early versions of this paper.

First, social networks motivate individuals to participate in Distributed Denial of Service attacks by providing malware and identifying potential targets. Second, attackers use an individual’s social network to focus attacks, through spear phishing. Recipients are more likely to open infected attachments when they come from a trusted source.

Introduction\nThis paper identifies threats to human–machine interaction in the multi-layered networks that are at the heart of this special issue. The growing complexity of socio-technical systems and the interpenetration of formerly separate systems via IT infrastructures create new opportunities for social interaction. It also creates new vulnerabilities. In particular, this paper considers the role that social networking has played in the ‘attribution problem’. This term describes the difficulty in determining who is responsible for a cyber-attack. Social networks describe interconnections between individuals and groups that change over time. These relationships may be based on family ties, sexual relationships, employment, etc. However, the interconnections can also motivate groups to launch mass cyber-attacks on common targets, whether they are multi-national corporations or government agencies. It is difficult for commercial and government organisations to monitor these connections and hence predict the groups who are likely to become involved in mass cyber-attacks. One reason for this is that state agencies are using ‘social media’ to encourage and sustain networks of hactivists that are behind many cyber-attacks. Social media are Internet-based applications that allow for the generation and dissemination of user-generated content. As we shall see, these applications provide mechanisms for the dissemination and control of malware. I also show how these techniques support forms of indirection that make it difficult to identify explicit state responsibility for many cyber-attacks over the last decade.\nAt first sight, it might seem that this topic is tangential to many of the mainstream interests within the field of Ergonomics. In contrast, I will argue that it is increasingly important to understand not only the positive role that social networks play in work and leisure but it is also equally necessary to understand how these phenomena may also be abused to support criminal activity. The following pages also explain why so much of our working lives continue to be devoted to filtering the thousands of spam emails that are generated by botnets. A botnet can be thought of as a number of interacting programmes communicating across a network of compromised machines; the term is formed from the conjunction of ‘robotic’ ‘networks’.\nSocial networking hinders the attribution of cyber-attacks in four different ways. First, social networks have helped to ‘crowd source’ the participants in an attack. They have motivated individuals to participate in mass Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. They have provided the code needed to launch DDoS and have published information on potential targets. Second, attackers have used information about an individual’s social networks to compromise security measures. For example, information about the friends and colleagues of a target can be obtained from social networks. This enables ‘spear phishing’; a recipient is more likely to open an infected attachment or link if it has been sent from a trusted participant in their social network. Third, I show how the information infrastructures that are associated with some forms of social\n© 2013 Taylor &amp; Francis\nC.W. Johnson\nnetworking create disposable architectures for command and control servers to coordinate malware attacks. Finally, governments have tolerated and even encouraged the growth of anti-social criminal networks that are later used to launch attacks on political targets, for instance, using botnets. Table 1 summarises the different roles that social media have played in the case studies that are presented in this paper. Before introducing the incidents that are included within this study, it is first important to present the methodological background to our work.\n# 1.1 Methodological interactions from action research to case-study approach\nResearch of this nature raises a host of methodological problems. Several authors have recently pioneered the use of human factors techniques to identify security threats and vulnerabilities. For instance, Kraemer, Carayon, and Clem (2009) used focus groups of IT security professionals to identify the individual and organisational causes of vulnerabilities. Shaw (2006) reviews the empirical evidence that supports the role of behavioural consultants within investigative teams looking at the potential role of insiders within particular attacks. However, neither of these studies considers the detailed role of individual and organisational human factors in state-sponsored cyber-attacks. Very few previous studies consider the wider national context of threats that extend beyond individual organisations. Many of the techniques that have been conventionally applied in Ergonomics cannot easily be used to analyse social aspects of state-sponsored cyber-crime. This is an important caveat given that cyber-attacks have an increasing impact on the working lives of many people. Empirical studies and laboratory investigations yield useful insights into individual behaviours; however, Dantzker and Hunter (2000) summarise the problems that arise when interpreting the results of studies that are intended to analyse criminal behaviour. Further criticisms stem from the limited insights that such studies provide into the group interactions , which are at the heart of this paper.\nAction research provides an alternative perspective . It builds on the idea that complex social interactions cannot be studied by focussing on the isolated behaviours of particular individuals. In contrast, more situated studies provide a view of the impact of change on society. Action research provides tools to investigate changes and their effects while overcoming researchers' 'self-imposed distance from the world of action' . These techniques are entirely appropriate within the context of this paper because the area of cyber-security is in constant flux. The role of social networks as a mechanism for launching attacks continues to adapt, for example, in response to new security mechanisms.\nAction research is not the only methodological approach that might be used to support this work; Blichfeldt and Andersen (2006) identify a continuum from Yin's (1994) hypothetical-deductive case-study techniques to Glaser and Strauss' (1967) notion of grounded theory. Yin's techniques assume that investigators will directly intervene in the working context, whereas Glaser and Strauss promote a more observational approach. The work reported in the following sections has been derived using action-based techniques as part of initiatives to increase the resilience of national and international infrastructures. I acknowledge that these involvements may bias our work in a positivist way. Equally active involvement helps to establish the relationships needed before access is granted to forensic evidence . Rather than focussing on these positivist interventions, the following sections draw more on the case-study methodologies associated with Yin. The intention is to provide an overview of recent incidents – not only to support our theories on the roles that social networking plays in the 'attribution problem' but also to provide readers with an overview of the causes and consequences of cyber-incidents that are an increasing threat across many different industries.\nThe methodology adopted in this work was to conduct a series of interviews with members of government organisations, including military and intelligence agencies, in the countries affected by the attacks. These were confidential, given the nature of the events under discussion. The questions focused on the probable causes of the attacks and also the consequences for government infrastructures. The initial insights provided by these meetings were validated by subsequent\nTable 1. High-level comparison of use of social networks in the case studies.\n|   | Social networks motivate participation through crowdsourcing | Social networks used to target individuals via spear phishing | ‘Disposable service models’ associated with social networks aid coordination of an attack | Use of anti-social networks, supporting botnets and associated criminal infrastructures  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Estonia, April–May 2007 | Yes | No | No | Yes  |\n|  Belorusia, April 2008 | No | No | Yes | Yes  |\n|  Lithuania, June 2008 | Yes | No | No | Yes  |\n|  Georgia, August 2008 | Yes | Yes | No | Yes  |\n|  China, March 2009 | No | Yes | Yes | Yes  |\n|  W32.STUXNET, March 2010 | No | No | Yes | No  |\ninterviews with commercial organisations. Telecommunications companies were asked about the resilience of their systems and where possible to provide access to technical data about the connectivity of their networks over time. I also consulted critical infrastructure providers, including air traffic management organisations and financial service companies. In many cases, the impact of state-sponsored cyber-attacks was less severe than might have been assumed. In other cases, a lack of forensic expertise exacerbated recovery. It is important to stress that our aim was to survey the use of social networks in state-sponsored cyber-attacks, rather than to follow a rigid methodology. I had limited opportunities to contact the intended targets of Stuxnet inside Iran and the victims of Ghostnet. Instead, I relied on sources within NATO to assess the impact of these attacks. The inclusion of both incidents within the paper is justified because they mark key developments in state-sponsored, offensive capabilities.\n## Estonia, April--May 2007\nThe first case study focuses on a series of cyber-attacks that were directed against Estonia during April and May 2007. There are earlier examples of coordinated threats; for instance, the US government identified the ‘Titan Rain' attacks on companies, such as Lockheed Martin, national laboratories, including Sandia, and military targets, such as the Redstone Arsenal before 2003. Attackers from the Netherlands successfully compromised some 34 US defence sites in 1990.\nThe probable causes of the Estonian case study can be traced back to tensions between ethnic Estonians and Russians following the Second World War. After independence, many ethnic Russians were left without any form of citizenship. More immediate triggers included a decision to move the Bronze Soldier of Tallinn. This war memorial had become a focus for clashes between Estonians and Russian nationalists. The subsequent riots left one person dead and 150 injured. Some argued that the statue was a symbol of the Soviet occupation of Estonia, whereas others believed that it was a memorial to the Russians who fought against Nazi occupation .\nIt is possible to distinguish several different phases in this incident. An initial emotional/physical stage was closely tied to the riots around the Bronze Soldier. A series of website defacements then took place, but these were then superseded by a third phase in which DDoS attacks were launched . The rapid development of digital communications during the moves towards independence between 1988 and 1991 arguably placed Estonia at greater risk from such cyber-attacks. At the time of the attack, some 97% of all Estonian bank transactions were made online, 65% of the population were classified as ‘active users' of the Internet and 80% of the population had national identity cards that supported digital signatures. A number of different DDoS mechanisms were used. These included Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) floods launched by individuals. The aim was to overwhelm a server and stop it responding to legitimate requests. The Estonian attacks also included the use of botnets. A botnet is a network of private computers infected with malware, and they are controlled as a group typically without the owners' knowledge.\nArbor Networks identified more than 120 different attacks over a 3-week period; these included “a decent sized botnet behind the attack, with aggregate bandwidth at our points of measurement maxing out at nearly 100 Mbps ... All in all, someone is very, very deliberate in putting the hurt on Estonia, and this kind of thing is only going to get more severe in the coming years. ”\nHowever, most of the attacks (100 of the 120) were simple ICMP floods. Four involved more sophisticated approaches where TCP connection requests were sent faster than the recipient could process them. Most of the targets were government websites, especially the Ministry of Finance (35 of 128). Most attacks lasted less than an hour, but seven went on for more than 10 h.\nThe impact on the working lives of the Estonian public has been overestimated. For instance, a Chatham House report argued: “The severity and length of the attacks directed at one of NATO's most electronically connected members put the alliance on guard. If a highly wired small state could be brought to its knees by a well-orchestrated Internet-based attack, then what type of havoc could be wrought upon larger states with more heterogeneous systems and critical infrastructure open to attack? ”\nEstonia's two largest banks, Hansapank and SEB Eesti Ühispank, were attacked several times between 9 and 15 May. However, the effects were very limited. Hansapank's e-banking service had to be shut down for up to 2 h on 9 and 10 May. SEB Eesti Ühispank's online banking service was down for a similar period on 15 May. The banks mitigated the impact of the attacks by, for instance, limiting access to customers outside of Estonia. Three major Internet service providers -- Elion Ettevõtted, Elisa Andmesideteenused and Starman -- came under DDoS attacks (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010). The Zone.ee web hosting service provider and directory service provider (ee.ee) were attacked, but in each case their services were restored relatively quickly. The US Computer Emergency Readiness Team (CERT) assessment concluded that although this was a ‘watershed' attack, it was not ‘revolutionary' in terms of the scale or sophistication of the techniques that were used .\nThe Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Paet accused the Kremlin of involvement in the cyber-attacks. However, there was no direct evidence to link the DDoS with any state agencies. In contrast, the Estonian attacks provide an early example of ‘crowdsourcing'. Digital infrastructures were used to encourage hacktivist participation. The incidents have been compared with a ‘cyber-riot' rather than a well-coordinated attack (The Economist 2007). The term ‘patriotic hacking' describes attacks performed by a group of people who take action ‘pro patria' in cases where they believe that this is the right thing for their government to do or where they perceive the government as unable to do ‘the right thing' (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010). Political activists protested by engaging in coordinated cyber-attacks against the online presence and Internet infrastructure of Estonia. The activities of disaffected individuals provided opportunities for ‘plausible deniability' by a range of state agencies that might otherwise stand accused of coordinating the attacks.\nNATO members considered the wider implications of the attacks on Estonia, leading to the development of the Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) in 2008. This organisation is not funded directly by NATO but by the supporting member states. CCDCOE provides a meeting place for military experts, scientists, lawyers and politicians. It also publishes technical reports on emerging cyber threats and provides ‘white papers' on policy decisions including the development of international legal frameworks to clarify the response to future attacks, in particular when it is not possible to identify whether a state organisation is responsible for a threat.\nTable 1 has summarised the use of social media in the Estonian case study. As can be seen, social networks were used to crowd-source participation in the DDoS attacks. Malware was distributed through Internet sites that also provided lists of potential targets. It is important to stress that the participants in this attack were not simply the individuals usually associated with hacking but included a far broader spectrum including members of the public who were opposed to what they viewed as the suppression of minority rights in the aftermath of Estonian independence (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010).\n## Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty, April 2008\nThe second case study focuses on the role that botnets and other forms of ‘anti-social' networking played on cyber-attacks against Radio Svaboda, the Belarusian service of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL). These radio stations were established during the Cold War and had been the target of direct physical attacks, including a poisoning attempt associated with the Czechoslovak intelligence service and a car bomb, linked to the Romanian government. However, the cyber-attacks can be linked to political tensions inside Belarus. Many independent observers criticised the electoral processes used by President Alexander Lukashenka to extend his tenure in 1996 and 2004. There were limited opportunities to voice criticisms within Belarus. During 2008, a Statute on Mass Media extended the state monopoly of Internet Service Provision. Beltelekom was able to restrict access to sites that criticised the administration, including those operated by Radio Svaboda.\nDuring the morning of 26 April 2008, the Radio Svaboda web servers were subjected to a DDoS attack (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010). These attacks seem to have been launched by the government supporters to prevent Radio Svaboda from covering popular protests on the 22nd anniversary of the Chernobyl accident, which occurred on the borders of Belarus and the Ukraine. Many people were unhappy about the lack of compensation for those affected by the accident. Others were angered by the administration's support for the Belarus civil nuclear programme.\nThis analysis does not explain why the cyber-attacks also affected a number of other RFL/RE servers, including those for Kosovo, Azerbaijan, Tatar-Bashkir and Radio Farda in Iran. These additional attacks were arguably intended to obfuscate the attribution of the DDoS on Radio Svaboda. However, motivation and opportunity cannot be used as surrogates for more direct evidence of official involvement. Several organisations argued that Russian DDoS botnets were involved in the attacks . These ‘anti-social' networks were also used to coordinate attacks on a wider range of opposition media sites. These included Charter 97, an English language news site on political activities in Belarus; BelPartyzan, a local news website and the Russian language information sites, legis-group.ru and compromat.net.\nThe botnets used in the Belarus DDoS attacks were normally used for criminal activities; in particular to generate spam and phishing emails. The blurred boundary between cyber-crime and state-sponsored cyber-attacks is a feature of many case studies in this paper . Government agencies provide implicit support for criminal groups, who develop the infrastructures to support future attacks. However, the links are informal. Criminal groups may act for patriotic reasons or to ensure continued implicit state approval; in either case, it seems clear that anti-social networks have been forged between state agencies and cyber-attackers (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010; Johnson 2012).\nThe RFE/RL case study also illustrates the resilience of information infrastructures. The cyber-attacks did not bring the services ‘to their knees'. Several local websites in Belarus offered to carry content for RFE/RL before they could recover. By 28 April, most of the RFL/RE sites had been restored with significant improvements in their security infrastructures. The Radio Svaboda site administrators were also able to gain technical support from communities around the globe. In particular, help was received from several groups interested in maintaining the freedom of expression across the Internet. This provides a precursor to the collective action seen during the ‘Arab Spring' of 2011. The uprisings and unrest in Algeria,\nBahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Syria, Tunisia and Yemen were all influenced by the use of social media. Attempts by many states to disrupt Internet communications did not prevent opposition groups from disseminating messages using externally hosted sites. The attacks on RFE/RL provide an early example of the ‘social resilience' of communications infrastructures in response to cyber-attacks.\nThe Estonian case study showed that social networks could be used to coordinate cyber-attacks using crowd-sourcing techniques in response to political conflict. In contrast, Table 1 has shown that hacktivism was not a significant part of the cyber-attacks on RFE/RL. In contrast, DDoS attacks were launched by criminal botnets used to generate spam messages with an obvious impact on working lives around the globe. State agencies did not close down these anti-social networks, arguably, because they knew they could be recruited to launch cyber-attacks without the need to implicate government information infrastructures. Previous ergonomic studies tend to focus on the symptoms associated with these botnets, in terms of the impact of nuisance messages. Very few have considered the criminal and political context that sustains the dark side of the Internet.\n## 4. Lithuania, June 2008\nThe cyber-attacks on Estonia and Lithuania both had their roots in the tensions that arose following the break-up of the Soviet bloc. The right-wing Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats introduced a series of amendments to prohibit the public display of Soviet or Nazi insignia and were subsequently elected to power in November 2008. This created the background for conflict as the Russian Federation began to reassert influence on the Baltic states (Pääbo 2008). The immediate passage of the amendments did not seem to trigger the same level of hostility in the local Russian population, as had been observed amongst ethnic Russians in Estonia (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010). However, President Medvedev joined with the Belarusian President Lukashenka to express the Russian Federation's concern over the legislation. There were simultaneous protests outside the Lithuanian embassy in Moscow accompanied by a significant number of cyber-attacks. Some 300 websites were defaced by anti-Lithuanian slogans and by pro-Soviet symbols that would have been banned under the 2008 amendments.\nThe attacks were first detected on 28 June, peaking between 17:00 and 18:00 EET on Sunday 29 June. Companies and government websites were targeted ranging from the Lithuanian equivalent of the Securities and Exchange Commission to the web portal for the Lithuanian Social Democratic Party. By 2 July, most of the sites were able to resume normal operation.\nAfter independence, successive governments had encouraged the development of information infrastructures across Lithuanian, for instance through the Information Society Development Programme. Almost half of all households possessed a computer at the time of the attack, and one-third of government organisations had a web presence. However, companies suffered the most. The Lithuanian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-LT) had warned government agencies on a list of ‘at-risk' organisations after an Estonian TV channel had reported the possibility of a cyber-attack on 26 July. Commercial organisations did not receive the warning because they had not been included on the initial list. CERTs have been established by governments around the globe to increase resilience to cyber-attacks. The Lithuanian CERT had been established around 18 months before the web servers were defaced.\nThe Lithuanian attacks show how CERTs can develop networks of potential targets to ensure that warnings are propagated to at-risk organisations. This case study also illustrates the need for government agencies to actively monitor social media for intelligence about potential attacks and for forensic information in the aftermath of a cyber-incident. CERT-LT traced most of the targets back to Hostex, one of the largest web hosting services in Lithuania. The forensic analysis showed that once the vulnerability had been identified, all Hostex users were targeted. CERT-LT assisted the Hostex engineers as they worked to mitigate the effects of the attacks. The modes of attack resemble those used in both Estonia and Belarus. Initial reports focused on vulnerabilities in PHP servers that were then used to run a series of scripts distributed amongst a small group of attackers. However, other modes of attack included the generation of large amounts of spam email linking to ‘Hackers United against External Threats to Russia', which resembled the use of botnets in the previous case studies (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010).\nCERT-LT and RRT, the Lithuanian communications regulatory authority, identified the use of proxy servers to the East. It seemed “likely that the attacks were organised in advance, considering the fact that signals, invitations, and agitation were spread on the Internet prior to the attacks. However, the RRT refused to speak of any particular countries as the initiator of the attack. (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010)” Subsequent analysis identified compromised hosts in France and Sweden as possible sources for the defacement attacks suggesting that they had been planned in advance. However, as in Belarus, the Lithuanian attacks might also have used servers that had already been violated for other cyber-crime activities.\nCircumstantial evidence for the involvement of Russian hacking groups is provided by discussions on Internet forums, such as hack-wars.ru. However, direct proof was difficult to obtain. For example, the Cyber Police Unit of the Lithuanian Police argued that the attackers had used the Tor ‘onion routing' protocols. Tor is used by journalists, whistle-blowers and law enforcement agencies to prevent monitoring of Internet traffic. It relies on ‘onion routing'; this refers to the use of encryption at multiple layers of a communication network. The Lithuanian attacks illustrate a number of common themes across many of the incidents in this paper. Attribution was complicated by the lack of direct evidence for state involvement and by the participation of ‘hacking groups' communicating over Internet forums and social media.\n## Georgia, August 2008\nThe fourth case study forms part of the armed conflict between Georgia and the Russian Federation over Ossetia. Although this region straddles the Caucasian mountains, North Ossetia was ceded to the Soviet Union, whereas the area south of the mountains became part of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic (GSSR). Fighting broke out between Georgian forces and South Ossetia (1991--1992) and then in Abkhazia (1992--1994). In consequence, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) formed a peacekeeping force in 1992 with troops from Russia, Georgia and South Ossetia. The composition of this peacekeeping force did little to reduce animosity between the various factions . This was exacerbated by Moscow's concern when the Bush administration provided assistance for the Georgian forces to clear Chechen fighters from the Pankisi valley. By April 2008, large-scale military exercises were being conducted on both sides of the border. Fighter aircraft and UAVs began to patrol ‘demilitarised' areas.\nOn 7 August 2008, Georgian forces attacked the town of Tskhinvali and surrounding areas in response to an alleged Russian invasion. By 8 August, the Russian air force was attacking infrastructures, targets included Tbilisi airport radar, railroad junctions and telecommunications facilities. By 10 August, the Georgian Government declared a unilateral ceasefire and announced its intention to withdraw Georgian forces from South Ossetia. By 11 August, Russian troops had crossed the boundaries of Ossetia and entered a number of Georgian towns. On 12 August, French President Sarkozy travelled to Moscow and Tiblisi, representing the European Council. He proposed a six-point peace plan that ultimately led to a ceasefire. By 22 August, Russian troops had withdrawn from their positions beyond the former boundaries of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.\nThe most obvious difference with Estonia and Lithuania is that the Georgian cyber-attacks coincided with a physical offensive. The effects were also different. More than 50% of the Estonian population were active users of the Internet. In contrast, this figure was close to 30% in Lithuania but only 10% in Georgia. However, the impact on Georgia was greater because most of their information infrastructures passed through the Russian territory . Georgia was aware of these communication vulnerabilities and wanted to develop trade opportunities with the EU. Most Internet traffic was deliberately routed via Turkish or Azerbaijan service providers. Work had almost been completed on a high capacity link with Bulgaria before the invasion.\nThe initial wave of cyber-attacks on the Georgian government infrastructures occurred before the armed conflict. These included ICMP floods and spurious HTTP ‘GET' requests similar to the techniques used in Estonia . Targets included www.president.gov.ge, where images of Adolf Hitler were substituted for pictures of President Saakashvili. A collage of dictators was also placed on the National Bank of the Republic of Georgia's site. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs portal was attacked as were newspaper and media agencies in Georgia and Azerbaijan. Meanwhile, the DDoS attacks were aimed at government sites, including the Parliament and Ministry of Education and Science and the banks. The DDoS statistics gathered during the Georgian attacks were also similar to those for Estonia. Most attacks lasted from 2 to 6 h.\nIntelligence agencies had learned from events in Estonian and were better equipped to monitor the attack patterns against Georgia. Several botnets were involved, including the MachBot controller for an HTTP-based botnet attack coordinated by Russian herders. Many aspects of the attacks in Estonia and Georgia have been linked to the Russian Business Network (RBN) criminal organisation and associated botnets. The accuracy of this claim is understandably difficult to establish, as is the nexus between the founder of the RBN and Russian government agencies. It may be that the RBN provided access to botnet resources without mounting the DDoS attacks; following a ‘business model' that supported their wider activities (Grey Goose 2008). However, it is dangerous to assume that involvement in an attack provides reliable evidence about its coordination . At least one of the botnets' command and control servers was located in the USA.\nThere is also evidence that social media was used to support ‘crowdsourcing' similar to that seen in Estonia: “a downloadable script to ping flood Estonian websites (both DNS and IPs) was shared on various Russian language message boards. Instructions on how to ping flood Georgian government websites were also distributed on Russian language websites and\nmessage boards, as well as lists of Georgian sites vulnerable to remote SQL injections, facilitating automatic defacement of them. .”\nSQL injections occur because commands written in one language may be hidden inside the instructions of another. If the input is not correctly filtered for embedded command sequences, then these can be inadvertently executed by higher layers of an application. The email addresses of prominent Georgian politicians, academics and industrialists were also distributed. These were used to focus spamming and more targeted forms of attack . Major figures had to create new email accounts and re-establish their social networks in a piecemeal fashion, at a time when their attention should have been focused on the invasion.\nThe response to the attacks was coordinated by CERT Georgia. Their analysis of Internet Protocol (IP) data was supported by Estonian, French and Polish counterparts. However, many of the targets of the cyber-attacks simply waited. Normal commercial activities were curtailed by the armed conflict. Some websites mitigated the impact of the attacks by temporarily changing IP addresses. Others used international hosts; Blogspot.com supported Georgian news and government agencies. The websites of the Georgian President and their Ministry of Defence were relocated to a company in Atlanta, GA, USA. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs moved to an Estonian server. These counter-measures had limited effects inside Georgia. Flood attacks on Caucasus Network Tbilisi caused significant bottlenecks exacerbated by damage to network infrastructures inside the war zone; many Georgian Internet connections ran through Russia.\nThese case studies illustrate a complex relation between ICT maturity and the vulnerability to cyber-attacks. The more a nation depends upon networked services, then the more vulnerable it can be to any cyber-incident. The Estonian public relied on the Internet for a host of government and financial services. The impact on Georgia was more limited. Equally, the more a nation depends upon networked services, then the more resilient it will be to any cyber-incident. Less mature nations find it harder to bring their electronic infrastructures back online. In Georgia, the attacks forced the suspension of electronic banking services for 10 days rather than the hours of interruption seen in Estonia.\nIt is difficult to underestimate the psychological impact of a combined attack on both physical and digital infrastructures. Tikk et al. (2008) observe that “while the attacks did not have a permanent or even a long-run devastating effect on the Georgian Internet infrastructure, the damage caused by the attacks was most acutely experienced at the time when Georgia was the most dependent on the availability of their information channels.”\nThe synchronisation of the physical and virtual attacks reinforced the vulnerability of the Georgian government to external forces.\nThe Georgian case study also shows how cyber-conflicts can extend across different social networks. Russian hacking groups were implicated in the initial attacks on Georgian government infrastructures. In contrast, hacking groups inside Georgia also became the targets of cyber-attacks. The www.hacking.ge website was an early victim. This removed a potential source of advice and information about ways to increase the resilience of Georgian networks. Alternatively, it can be seen as part of a direct conflict between hacking/hacking networks in Russia and Georgia. Russian sites also seem to have been the target of secondary attacks, such as that operated by the RIA Novosti news outlet .\nTable 1 has summarised the diverse role that various forms of social networks played in the Georgian attacks. As can be seen, crowdsourcing was used through the distribution of scripts and lists of potential victims. Social networks were also used to distribute information about individuals who were then deliberately the target of spamming attacks. Finally, botnets were used to coordinate DDoS attacks. However, unlike previous case studies, there is evidence to suggest the conflict extended between hacking networks on both sides of the conflict.\n## 6. China, GhostNet, March 2009\nThere are similarities between the first four case studies; the Estonian, Belarusian, Lithuania and Georgian attacks all stemmed from the break-up of the Soviet Union. All four involved politically motivated DDoS attacks supported by the use of criminal botnets. In all four cases, the victims were able to use networks of contacts and sympathisers to recover from the attacks within hours. In contrast, the fifth case study focuses on ‘advanced persistent threats' . As the term suggests, this form of attack requires greater coordination and planning. APTs also illustrate how a new generation of cyber-threats uses social networks to deliberately focus their attacks on particular individuals. Information about an individual's online contacts can be exploited by ‘socially engineered malware'.\nThis case study focuses on the violation of computers in more than 100 countries. Although the evidence is circumstantial, it seems likely that these attacks were coordinated by groups inside the People's Republic of China as part of the wider policy of active defence . Subsequent sections of this paper will describe similar techniques exploited by agencies in Europe and North America. However, this case study considers targets in the foreign ministries of Iran, Bangladesh, Latvia, Indonesia, Philippines, Brunei, Barbados and Bhutan; embassies in India, South Korea, Indonesia,\nRomania, Cyprus, Malta, Thailand, Taiwan, Portugal, Germany and Pakistan; the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Secretariat and the Asian Development Bank. The attacks also compromised computers in news organisations and a range of commercial organisations.\nThese attacks seemed to follow a common pattern; a Trojan horse was introduced onto a victim's machine that would then exfiltrate information to control servers, ultimately reporting back to Chinese sources. These data would include information about the victim's social networks that could then be used by spear phishing attacks. Their email account would be used to send a malicious payload to the individuals in their contact list . The success of the approach depended upon convincing the recipient to open the attached document containing the malware. People are far more likely to open an attachment if it comes from a friend or colleague. Once opened, this attachment would compromise the next link in the social network. The terms ‘social malware', ‘social engineering' and ‘spear phishing' describe the use of information about the target's network of contacts. The aim is to increase the plausibility of the email vector. In some cases, legitimate messages were simply reused. In other cases, documents were taken from other compromised machines and then passed to new targets with the embedded malware to increase the probability that they would, in turn, infect their machines.\nThis modus operandi was christened the ‘GhostNet'; it was identified following investigations on behalf of the Office of the Dalai Lama . Sympathisers were detained by Chinese officials who seemed to have knowledge of their Internet communications. Many sympathisers used Tencent QQ to spread information about the Tibetan cause; this is the most widespread instant messaging service in mainland China. Voice over IP applications might also have been compromised. The Office of the Dalai Lama, therefore, installed network monitoring software to gather additional forensic evidence. They found that infected machines would exchange information with command and control servers -- to download updated versions of the malware and send data out of the local networks: “(This) led to the discovery of four control servers and six command servers ... The control servers were then probed and web-based control interfaces were identified on four control servers, which allowed us to view and control the network. The system was actively monitored for 2 weeks, which allowed us to derive an extensive list of infected systems, and to also monitor the systems operator(s) as the operator(s) specifically instructed target computers. ”The IP addresses associated with most of these servers were traced to China. Several were located on the island of Hainan, home to the Lingshui signals intelligence facility and the Third Technical Department of the People's Liberation Army. However, other servers were traced to the USA, Sweden, South Korea and Taiwan. This illustrates the complexity of attribution.\nA subsequent analysis of the web servers that were used to coordinate the GhostNet Trojan's undermined arguments that they were maintained by government agencies. Instead, they used QQ instant messaging numbers to trace the sites back to members of the Chinese hacking community . These studies concluded that patriotic hacking and cybercrime may have played a role in the development of these attacks . Further circumstantial evidence of the anti-social networks that connect hacking groups was provided by the reuse of techniques associated with the earlier Enfal Trojan within the Ghostnet attacks. Code seems to have been exchanged between different groups of programmers working with a similar but distinct malware. The case studies in this paper provide parallels between twenty-first century cyber-crime and seventeenth century piracy. They illustrate a privateering model, in which governments authorise private individuals to attack enemies of the state. Further investigations concluded that two or three different groups were using different command and control infrastructures to support multiple forms of attack on opposition groups .\nForensic analysis of the GhostNet attacks illustrates the dual nature of social networks in cyber-security. Victims were targeted using spear-phishing techniques that deliberately exploited information about their social networks . Conversely, the perpetrators of the attack were traced by monitoring connections between different groups of attackers, for instance across Baidu: “(these attacks were) to a large degree organised and operated through the misuse of social networking and cloud computing platforms, including Google, Baidu, Yahoo!, and Twitter, in addition to traditional command and control servers ... although we are able to piece together circumstantial evidence that provides the location and possible associations of the attackers, their actual identities and motivations remain illusory. We catch a glimpse of a shadow of attribution in the cloud, in other words, but have no positive identification ... there is a generational shift unfolding in malware networks in multiple dimensions, from what were once primarily simple to increasingly complex, adaptive systems spread across redundant services and platforms, and from criminal and industrial-based exploitation to political, military, and intelligence-focused espionage. ”\nCloud-based infrastructures and web mail services support these new forms of attack. Free or low-cost hosting services with minimal background checks enable the development of command and control servers that can be used to update malware and coordinate the exfiltration of data. If the security of these servers is compromised, then they can quickly be abandoned at almost no cost. In these circumstances, the Trojans used social networking sites, including Twitter, Google Groups, Blogspot, Baidu Blogs and blog.com accounts, to access links to the new free hosting accounts that replaced the compromised command and control servers . As a final resort, the malware could contact more stable servers\nin China; these would then point the malware back to an alternate disposable hosting service reducing the chances of further detection .\nThe (ab)use of social networking and Cloud infrastructures to implement command and control servers was compounded through the indirection provided by the Tor anonymity network. This technique was mentioned in our third case study; the Cyber Police Unit of the Lithuanian Police found that Tor had been used to disguise the attacks on their government servers. Tor passes communications through various volunteer servers to prevent others from identifying the origin of a message. When researchers monitored unencrypted data leaving the Tor network, they found some of it related to the Dalai Lama's office. Because these messages did not originate from the Office of the Dalai Lama, they concluded that the information was most probably being forwarded to Tor as the attackers tried to disguise the compromised machines .\nThe GhostNet attacks again illustrate the need to increase links between the field of Ergonomics and cyber-security. Social-media provide significant benefits across a broad range of industries (Manyika, Chui, and Sarrazin 2012). They enable networks of contacts to work together across national borders and between diverse organisations. At the same time, Cloud computing techniques are providing low-cost methods to coordinate distributed work, for instance, through the development of shared, virtual infrastructures. However, these innovations have created new vulnerabilities. Malware now makes use of social media to obtain information about personal contacts. There are then used to propagate spear-phishing attacks where a malicious payload is disguised within email that is deliberately tailored for a recipient within a social network. Similarly, Cloud and web mail infrastructures provide the disposable technologies that enable the rapid development of command and control servers. These are used to upload more recent versions of malware and also to forward data extracted from a victim's machine. They reduce the likelihood of detection because they can be abandoned without cost should an attack be discovered. Table 1 has summarised the role of social networks and their supporting technologies within the GhostNet attacks. A key motivation for writing this paper is to encourage more active research within the field of Ergonomics to increase our resilience to these forms of attack. The solutions are unlikely to be purely technical; these forms of attack undermine the trust of victims in their information infrastructures. Unless more is carried out to make individuals and groups aware of the potential threats, there is a risk that the dark side of the Internet will limit the further development of the digital economy. Many companies now prohibit staff from accessing social media on any device that is used within their networks -- including applications that are specifically intended to support business networks .\n## W32.STUXNET, March 2010\nThe case studies in this paper provide a spectrum from the mass DDoS attacks that relied on hacktivism and crowdsourcing in Georgia, Estonia, Latvia and Belarus, to the more focussed techniques that were deployed against the social networks of Chinese opposition groups. The final case study argues that Stuxnet had an even narrower focus; attacking a particular group of centrifuges within the Iranian nuclear enrichment programme. Social networks again played an important role in the transmission of this malware. It exploited vulnerabilities in the auto-execution mechanisms associated with removable drives, such as USB sticks. In consequence, Stuxnet quickly infected groups of users, including commercial and government organisations, which shared data and applications (Falliere, Murchu, and Chien 2011). One reason for the successful transmission of the malware was that it took steps to cover its tracks. Code was introduced to delete any malware left on a USB stick after the third infection. Stuxnet again illustrates how computer viruses can propagate across social and professional networks.\nStuxnet also illustrated the exchange of ‘lessons learned' across anti-social networks. It exploited techniques that had previously been used in the Conficker worm. Stuxnet spread across local area networks, exploiting vulnerabilities in the Windows Print Spooler. The virus would also scan infected computers for security software. In some cases, the malware would inject code into trusted processes, including anti-virus programmes. However, if the security product was considered to be resilient to the attack, then no injection would be attempted. Stuxnet used command and control servers, similar to those identified in the Chinese attacks. These were located in Malaysia and Denmark; connection requests were monitored from over 40,000 unique IP addresses in more than 155 countries. When a new machine was infected, the malware would first test connectivity with a valid address, including www.msn.com. If successful, the malware would first download an update of the virus; three different versions have been identified.\nOne of the reasons that Stuxnet was so virulent is that it included a Windows rootkit, providing privileged access to the underlying operating system while at the same time masking the intrusion. It also incorporated four ‘zero-day exploits'. These vulnerabilities in underlying operating systems or network architectures were unknown before the malware was released. The term ‘zero day' indicates that this is the first day when security firms can patch the vulnerability. The number of zero-day attacks in Stuxnet is highly unusual. Using all four at once is wasteful; an attack may be sustained by waiting for the first exploit to be patched before releasing the second and so on.\nThe attack was focussed against Iran's civil nuclear programmes. Between 2006 and 2010, the United Nations passed six resolutions to prevent them from developing the enrichment technologies to produce military grade uranium. For instance, resolution 1803  banned the export of dual use technologies with nuclear applications to Iran. The term ‘dual use' is important because the enrichment process is essential to develop uranium fuel for civil energy generation, but also for nuclear weapons development. Enrichment relies on cascades of centrifuges that produce successively higher concentrations. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) found evidence that Iran had created at least two strings capable of enriching uranium up to 20% by August 2010. Iran had more than 2.5 tons of low-enriched uranium, which was sufficient to support the development of nuclear weapons using existing centrifuges.\nStuxnet targeted the Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) that supervised the Iranian centrifuges. PLCs are not, typically, connected to networks. Instead, they are periodically attached to PCs, and code is downloaded directly onto the controllers. The PLCs are then connected to the centrifuges. In consequence, attackers must first infect the PCs that are used to code the PLCs. Stuxnet focussed on the Siemen's Step 7 PLC programming environment. If Step 7 was not detected on an infected PC, then no actions were taken. If it was detected, then Stuxnet exploited a number of vulnerabilities in the Step 7 environment, including a hard-coded password for its SCADA database. Stuxnet was also able to hook operating system calls to open project files associated with the Siemens application. However, it did not infect all of the Step 7 data. It was only interested in projects that had been used or accessed within the previous three and a half years.\nStuxnet monitored, replaced and disguised blocks of Step 7 code being written to PLCs. In order to do this, the malware had to forge the digital signatures that were used to authenticate drivers in the malicious binaries. These were maintained by two Taiwanese companies, which seem to have been the victims of conventional or physical industrial espionage . This is reminiscent of the Georgian case study where the cyber-attack coincident with a physical invasion. In Stuxnet, the cyber-attack was supported by convention forms of espionage.\nOnce the malicious code had made the jump from the PCs to the PLCs, it monitored the frequency of the motors attached to the centrifuge. It only attacked systems that operated at frequencies between 807 and 1210 Hz. The malware then triggered a state machine to control the sabotage. After an initial delay of some 13 days, Stuxnet set the maximum frequency to 1410 Hz; 27 days later, this was changed to 2 Hz and then 1064 Hz before the sequence was repeated. The malware acted like a landmine; the intention was not to kill the victim, but to consume finite resources of time and expertise. By analogy, the intention was not to destroy the centrifuges, but to waste the Iranian engineering resources as teams of workers had to repair affected components and identify the source of the problems. The IAEA reported signs of damage to around 900 centrifuges during the period when Stuxnet was active. However, independent studies suggest that Iran was able to increase uranium enrichment in spite of this cyber-attack . They were resilient to the cyber-attack, just as the victims were in our previous case studies. One interpretation of this conflicting evidence is that Iranian authorities deliberately exaggerated the impact of the malware to create the impression that greater damage had been inflicted on their nuclear programmes.\nThe sophistication of Stuxnet suggests that it was developed by a network of engineers. Not only did they require a detailed knowledge of the Step 7 environment, but they also needed access to specialist hardware. The malicious payload focused on PLCs using a particular Central Processing Unit; 6ES7-315-2 (series 300). The malware monitored the PLCs' Profibus communications processors looking for frequency converters manufactured by Fararo Paya in Iran and Vacon in Finland. The range of technical skills required by this cyber-attack strongly suggests that Stuxnet was created by a team or network of developers. Stuxnet would have taken from 5 to 30 people around 6 months to prepare (Falliere, Murchu, and Chien 2011). It is remarkable that Stuxnet did not affect any of the registered users for the Step 7 environment. Hence, the development team may have included security agencies as well as representatives of the companies that might otherwise have been affected by the attack. However, this speculation does not preclude the possibility that a small group of committed individuals acted together to create the malware with or without state encouragement.\nSome commentators have argued that the preoccupation with Iranian centrifuges has masked the real purpose of the Stuxnet virus . The attacks can be seen as the first field test of a targeted cyber-attack. The widespread dissemination of the virus violated many different systems, but the damage was highly focussed on a very small number of specialist devices. In this interpretation, the real purpose of Stuxnet was to reveal how future cyber-weapons could go beyond the mass DDoS of earlier attacks. In contrast to ‘hacktivist' crowdsourcing in Estonia, Lithuania, Georgia and Belarus, the GhostNet and Stuxnet cyber-attacks required relatively small networks of specialists working together to exploit common features of our everyday working environments -- ranging from USB sticks to social networks and Cloud infrastructures.\n## Summary of the use of social media in cyber-attacks\nThere are many motivations for a closer engagement between the field of Ergonomics and cyber-security. First, it is important that human factors specialists have a better understanding of the underlying causes of security threats. Cyber-\nErgonomics\nsecurity will have an increasing impact on working lives. It is not simply the high-profile security breaches that affect major public and private institutions, but also the everyday irritation created by spam and the continual need to maintain anti-viral systems. Second, it is essential that Ergonomists play a more active role in designing our defences. At present, we are faced with a bewildering array of firewalls, passwords and access control mechanisms that frustrate our working tasks and, as we have seen, provide limited protection against emerging threats. Third, in order to understand the threat posed by recent generations of malware, it is important to understand core concepts within the field of Ergonomics. It is important to understand that social networks support new forms of attack, for instance helping hackers exchange successful techniques. Social networks can also increase resilience, bringing together technical support in the aftermath of an attack. There remains significant work to be carried out – both in inhibiting the growth of anti-social networks and promoting the interactions that will help us recover from future threats.\nFigure 1 provides an overview of the roles that social networking plays in cyber-attacks. The Estonian, Georgian and Lithuanian case studies show that crowd-sourcing supports DDoS attacks, by exchanging malware and lists of potential targets between groups of sympathisers. Social networking provided patriotic groups with both the motivation and technical direction to implement the attacks. In these incidents, the attribution problem was complicated because it is impossible to determine whether state intervention sustained the groups who launched the attacks.\nSecond, governments can exploit informal links with anti-social criminal networks during cyber-attacks. In particular, they can make use of criminal resources to attack third-party infrastructures. Russian botnets played an important part in the Belarus case study. The use of existing criminal networks hides state intervention. The attribution problem is complicated because botnets exploit various forms of indirection to mask command and control infrastructures. This is only one example of the social networks that support cyber-attacks. Malware is often exchanged between criminal networks who reuse techniques exposing previous vulnerabilities. Stuxnet exploited vulnerabilities in the IP exploited by Conficker.\nSocial networks have also been used to infer inter-personal relationships that can then be exploited by malware, for example using spear phishing techniques. The recipient is more likely to open an infected attachment or link if it has been\nFigure 1. Different stages in the use of social networking for cyber-attacks.\nC.W. Johnson\nsent from a trusted source. The Chinese case studies have shown that politically motivated attacks, therefore, draw heavily on identity theft in wider areas of cyber-crime. Intelligence agencies now routinely monitor interactions over social media .\nFinally, I have shown how the infrastructures associated with social networking create disposable architectures to coordinate attacks, for example through the development of command and control servers used by Stuxnet. The ubiquitous nature of these architectures makes it difficult to determine who owns and operates the servers. Similarly, the use of anonymity servers in the Lithuanian and GhostNet attacks shows how systems that support confidential interaction also support the dark side of the Internet.\n# 9. A roadmap for social media in cyber defence\nThis paper provides a roadmap for future resilience to the abuse of social media in cyber-attacks. I have identified existing threats – for example through crowdsourcing in DDoS attacks and through the social monitoring that directs spear phishing. I have also identified ways in which social networks can help organisations resist and recover from attacks. For instance, I have seen how the Estonian media identified Internet groups that were encouraging participation in a cyber-attack on Lithuania (stages 1 and 2 in Figure 1). In consequence, the national CERT alerted government agencies. However, organisations that had not registered with their Computer Emergency Response Team did not receive the warning. This illustrates the continuing need to develop networks for the dissemination of the best practices to increase resilience against future cyber-threats.\nFigure 2 presents our roadmap for the use of social media in mitigating the threat of cyber-attacks. It is more complex than the overview of social media in previous security incidents, illustrated in Figure 1. This is because the first diagram was based on evidence drawn from the case studies presented in this paper, using the action-based methodology from the opening sections. Figure 2 is more tentative. I have hypothesised the ways in which social media might increase resilience to future attacks. The roadmap is intended as a starting point. In particular, the diagram must be refined in response to new threats. Previous sections have described how malware exploits technologies that originally supported a wide range of end-user tasks. For instance, Cloud-based file-stores and web mail services provide flexible, virtual information infrastructures. These same technologies have also been used to create disposable command and control infrastructures. If we cannot develop a more sophisticated appreciation of the security risks that stem from the abuse of future infrastructures, then we will continue to react as cyber-attacks evolve to exploit new vulnerabilities.\nThe first element of the roadmap in Figure 2 focuses on the monitoring of social media. This can be broken down into a number of concerns. Monitoring provides advanced warning of hacktivism, especially when 'politically motivated' cyberattacks reuse infrastructures that support conventional forms of cyber-crime, including identity theft. The reuse of botnets\nFigure 2. Roadmap for the use of social networking for cyber defence.\nand many of the zero-day exploits described in previous sections were discussed on social media before they were used on political targets. Our work reiterates the need for intelligence agencies to identify intersections between political groups and the wider population of cyber-criminals using social network analysis tools.\nThe second stage of the road map reinforces links with existing security management systems through risk assessment for cyber defence. Risk assessment is important because, at present, it is not performed in an organised or systematic way by many of the potential targets of cyber-attacks. Public--private networks have been used by many states as a cost-effective means of encouraging commercial and public bodies to increase their resilience to future attacks. Companies and government agencies are encouraged to work together in developing contingency plans based on the risk assessments that identify potential cyber-threats. Unfortunately, this approach has not worked very well . Many companies have been enthusiastic participants. Many others have abstained. Even those that were initially enthusiastic have not sustained their interest.\nSocial networking provides one means of addressing these concerns. For example, the UK government is promoting Warning, Advice and Reporting Points; see www.warp.gov.uk. These groups use electronic resources to send personalised warnings and advice across a network of members. Each WARP focuses on a particular community with similar security requirements; ‘Their purpose is to provide a specific community with the capability to share security related information -- both problems and solutions -- and thereby to develop more secure and responsive environments'. The third element of the road map, therefore, focuses on the use of social media to disseminate early warnings about potential cyber-attacks.\nIssuing community warning about future attacks provides limited benefits unless they are accompanied by appropriate actions. Drills and exercises help to audit the resilience provided by these mechanisms. Too often, these drills assume perfect conditions for CERTs and other state agencies to respond to potential attacks. However, the Georgian invasion shows that cyber-incidents coincide with adverse circumstances. By developing wider communities of interest in cyber-security, by encouraging participation in drills and exercises, we can also obtain evidence of vulnerabilities and the consequences of future attacks that provide persuasive data to encourage wider participation in these initiatives.\nThe penultimate stage in the roadmap focuses on the use of social networks in forensic analysis after an attack has occurred (Johnson, in press). At present, it is extremely difficult to detect the early stages of an attack. A range of network monitoring companies, mostly located in the USA, provide detailed information on connectivity failures in the aftermath of DDoS attacks. However, CERTs cannot use these post hoc studies to trigger a more active response once an attack is underway. Greater benefits could be derived from research into the particular patterns that have characterised the initial stages of previous attacks, for example using abnormal Border Gateway Protocol events. The real-time identification of an attack is not simply a technical exercise but requires input from a range of different experts given the costs and consequences that are associated with false alarms. Closing down an infrastructure in case an attack may occur requires operational, managerial and regulatory expertise.\nThe final stage of the roadmap for using social media to increase resilience to cyber-attacks focuses on the identification and dissemination of lessons learned. At present, this remains an ad hoc process . Many stakeholders remain ignorant of the extent of previous attacks, especially outside their own national borders. Further problems arise when vested interests exaggerate the impact of cyber-attacks; this alienates engineering staff who play a vital role in implementing potential mitigations. As we have seen, reports that cyber-attacks will ‘bring a nation to its knees' cannot be justified on the evidence of previous incidents.\nArguably, the greatest vulnerability identified in our work has been the difficulty that managers and operators have in obtaining clear information about previous attacks. Strong contrasts can be drawn between the lack of information in this and the plethora of accident and incident reports published across safety-related industries. Of course, it can be argued that the wider dissemination of this information might encourage future attacks. However, this argument ignores the anti-social networks that have already sprung up to disseminate the technical information that can be used to launch future attacks.\n## Conclusions and further work\nThis paper provides a new perspective on the wider topics addressed in this special issue looking beyond human-centred automation. The aim has been to identify threats to human--machine interaction in multi-layered networks. Previous sections have argued that the growing complexity of socio-technical systems and the interpenetration of formerly separate systems via IT infrastructures create new opportunities for social interaction. It also creates new vulnerabilities.\nSocial networks have motivated individuals to participate in mass Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. They have disseminated information and provided resources, including lists of targets and malicious code. Second, political groups have launched attacks using infrastructures that are normally associated with wider forms of cyber-crime, including botnets. Third, I have shown how information about an individual's social networks has helped to target spear phishing. Malware is, typically, disguised in a document that was intercepted from a colleague or friend. The recipient is more likely to open an\nC.W. Johnson\nTable 2.

Finally, I have shown how the development of Cloud infrastructures and social networking applications has created disposable architectures for the command and control servers that coordinate malware attacks. The ubiquitous and distributed nature of these architectures makes it increasingly difficult to determine who owns and operates these systems. I have gone on to identify a roadmap for the defensive measures that might be used to minimise the future threats from the 'dark side' of social networking. Several of our case studies have illustrated the 'social resilience' of communications infrastructures; victims have been able to crowd-source support from overseas governments, from civil liberties groups and from sympathisers around the globe as they seek to recover from the immediate aftermath of a cyber-attack.\nTable 2 shows that the case studies were motivated by political conflict and that none had the long-term impact many fear will be the consequence of state-sponsored cyber-attacks. There are many reasons for this – most incidents affected information systems that could quickly be restored once an attack had been diagnosed. Stuxnet is a notable exception because it deliberately damaged physical systems. Even here, the Iranian authorities were able to resume enrichment activities after a relatively short period of time. However, past resilience is no basis for future complacency. This paper has shown how cyber-attacks continue to evolve. Technical innovations, intended to increase productivity and support interaction, are easily adapted to support the dark side of the Internet.\n## Acknowledgements\nThe author would like to thank the editors and reviewers of this special edition for their valuable encouragement and for feedback on early versions of this paper.

First, social networks motivate individuals to participate in Distributed Denial of Service attacks by providing malware and identifying potential targets. Second, attackers use an individual’s social network to focus attacks, through spear phishing. Recipients are more likely to open infected attachments when they come from a trusted source. Third, social networking infrastructures create disposable architectures to coordinate attacks through command and control servers. The ubiquitous nature of these architectures makes it difficult to determine who owns and operates the servers.

    "# 1. Introduction": "This paper identifies threats to human–machine interaction in the multi-layered networks that are at the heart of this special issue. The growing complexity of socio-technical systems and the interpenetration of formerly separate systems via IT infrastructures create new opportunities for social interaction. It also creates new vulnerabilities. In particular, this paper considers the role that social networking has played in the ‘attribution problem’. This term describes the difficulty in determining who is responsible for a cyber-attack. Social networks describe interconnections between individuals and groups that change over time. These relationships may be based on family ties, sexual relationships, employment, etc. However, the interconnections can also motivate groups to launch mass cyber-attacks on common targets, whether they are multi-national corporations or government agencies. It is difficult for commercial and government organisations to monitor these connections and hence predict the groups who are likely to become involved in mass cyber-attacks. One reason for this is that state agencies are using ‘social media’ to encourage and sustain networks of hactivists that are behind many cyber-attacks. Social media are Internet-based applications that allow for the generation and dissemination of user-generated content. As we shall see, these applications provide mechanisms for the dissemination and control of malware. I also show how these techniques support forms of indirection that make it difficult to identify explicit state responsibility for many cyber-attacks over the last decade.\nAt first sight, it might seem that this topic is tangential to many of the mainstream interests within the field of Ergonomics. In contrast, I will argue that it is increasingly important to understand not only the positive role that social networks play in work and leisure but it is also equally necessary to understand how these phenomena may also be abused to support criminal activity. The following pages also explain why so much of our working lives continue to be devoted to filtering the thousands of spam emails that are generated by botnets. A botnet can be thought of as a number of interacting programmes communicating across a network of compromised machines; the term is formed from the conjunction of ‘robotic’ ‘networks’.\nSocial networking hinders the attribution of cyber-attacks in four different ways. First, social networks have helped to ‘crowd source’ the participants in an attack. They have motivated individuals to participate in mass Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. They have provided the code needed to launch DDoS and have published information on potential targets. Second, attackers have used information about an individual’s social networks to compromise security measures. For example, information about the friends and colleagues of a target can be obtained from social networks. This enables ‘spear phishing’; a recipient is more likely to open an infected attachment or link if it has been sent from a trusted participant in their social network. Third, I show how the information infrastructures that are associated with some forms of social\n© 2013 Taylor &amp; Francis\nC.W. Johnson\nnetworking create disposable architectures for command and control servers to coordinate malware attacks. Finally, governments have tolerated and even encouraged the growth of anti-social criminal networks that are later used to launch attacks on political targets, for instance, using botnets. Table 1 summarises the different roles that social media have played in the case studies that are presented in this paper. Before introducing the incidents that are included within this study, it is first important to present the methodological background to our work.",
    "# 1.1 Methodological interactions from action research to case-study approach": "Research of this nature raises a host of methodological problems. Several authors have recently pioneered the use of human factors techniques to identify security threats and vulnerabilities. For instance, Kraemer, Carayon, and Clem (2009) used focus groups of IT security professionals to identify the individual and organisational causes of vulnerabilities. Shaw (2006) reviews the empirical evidence that supports the role of behavioural consultants within investigative teams looking at the potential role of insiders within particular attacks. However, neither of these studies considers the detailed role of individual and organisational human factors in state-sponsored cyber-attacks. Very few previous studies consider the wider national context of threats that extend beyond individual organisations. Many of the techniques that have been conventionally applied in Ergonomics cannot easily be used to analyse social aspects of state-sponsored cyber-crime. This is an important caveat given that cyber-attacks have an increasing impact on the working lives of many people. Empirical studies and laboratory investigations yield useful insights into individual behaviours; however, Dantzker and Hunter (2000) summarise the problems that arise when interpreting the results of studies that are intended to analyse criminal behaviour. Further criticisms stem from the limited insights that such studies provide into the group interactions , which are at the heart of this paper.\nAction research provides an alternative perspective . It builds on the idea that complex social interactions cannot be studied by focussing on the isolated behaviours of particular individuals. In contrast, more situated studies provide a view of the impact of change on society. Action research provides tools to investigate changes and their effects while overcoming researchers' 'self-imposed distance from the world of action' . These techniques are entirely appropriate within the context of this paper because the area of cyber-security is in constant flux. The role of social networks as a mechanism for launching attacks continues to adapt, for example, in response to new security mechanisms.\nAction research is not the only methodological approach that might be used to support this work; Blichfeldt and Andersen (2006) identify a continuum from Yin's (1994) hypothetical-deductive case-study techniques to Glaser and Strauss' (1967) notion of grounded theory. Yin's techniques assume that investigators will directly intervene in the working context, whereas Glaser and Strauss promote a more observational approach. The work reported in the following sections has been derived using action-based techniques as part of initiatives to increase the resilience of national and international infrastructures. I acknowledge that these involvements may bias our work in a positivist way. Equally active involvement helps to establish the relationships needed before access is granted to forensic evidence . Rather than focussing on these positivist interventions, the following sections draw more on the case-study methodologies associated with Yin. The intention is to provide an overview of recent incidents – not only to support our theories on the roles that social networking plays in the 'attribution problem' but also to provide readers with an overview of the causes and consequences of cyber-incidents that are an increasing threat across many different industries.\nThe methodology adopted in this work was to conduct a series of interviews with members of government organisations, including military and intelligence agencies, in the countries affected by the attacks. These were confidential, given the nature of the events under discussion. The questions focused on the probable causes of the attacks and also the consequences for government infrastructures. The initial insights provided by these meetings were validated by subsequent\nTable 1.

Telecommunications companies were asked about the resilience of their systems and where possible to provide access to technical data about the connectivity of their networks over time. I also consulted critical infrastructure providers, including air traffic management organisations and financial service companies. In many cases, the impact of state-sponsored cyber-attacks was less severe than might have been assumed. In other cases, a lack of forensic expertise exacerbated recovery. It is important to stress that our aim was to survey the use of social networks in state-sponsored cyber-attacks, rather than to follow a rigid methodology. I had limited opportunities to contact the intended targets of Stuxnet inside Iran and the victims of Ghostnet. Instead, I relied on sources within NATO to assess the impact of these attacks. The inclusion of both incidents within the paper is justified because they mark key developments in state-sponsored, offensive capabilities.\n## Estonia, April--May 2007\nThe first case study focuses on a series of cyber-attacks that were directed against Estonia during April and May 2007. There are earlier examples of coordinated threats; for instance, the US government identified the ‘Titan Rain' attacks on companies, such as Lockheed Martin, national laboratories, including Sandia, and military targets, such as the Redstone Arsenal before 2003. Attackers from the Netherlands successfully compromised some 34 US defence sites in 1990.\nThe probable causes of the Estonian case study can be traced back to tensions between ethnic Estonians and Russians following the Second World War. After independence, many ethnic Russians were left without any form of citizenship. More immediate triggers included a decision to move the Bronze Soldier of Tallinn. This war memorial had become a focus for clashes between Estonians and Russian nationalists. The subsequent riots left one person dead and 150 injured. Some argued that the statue was a symbol of the Soviet occupation of Estonia, whereas others believed that it was a memorial to the Russians who fought against Nazi occupation .\nIt is possible to distinguish several different phases in this incident. An initial emotional/physical stage was closely tied to the riots around the Bronze Soldier. A series of website defacements then took place, but these were then superseded by a third phase in which DDoS attacks were launched . The rapid development of digital communications during the moves towards independence between 1988 and 1991 arguably placed Estonia at greater risk from such cyber-attacks. At the time of the attack, some 97% of all Estonian bank transactions were made online, 65% of the population were classified as ‘active users' of the Internet and 80% of the population had national identity cards that supported digital signatures. A number of different DDoS mechanisms were used. These included Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) floods launched by individuals. The aim was to overwhelm a server and stop it responding to legitimate requests. The Estonian attacks also included the use of botnets. A botnet is a network of private computers infected with malware, and they are controlled as a group typically without the owners' knowledge.\nArbor Networks identified more than 120 different attacks over a 3-week period; these included “a decent sized botnet behind the attack, with aggregate bandwidth at our points of measurement maxing out at nearly 100 Mbps ... All in all, someone is very, very deliberate in putting the hurt on Estonia, and this kind of thing is only going to get more severe in the coming years. ”\nHowever, most of the attacks (100 of the 120) were simple ICMP floods. Four involved more sophisticated approaches where TCP connection requests were sent faster than the recipient could process them. Most of the targets were government websites, especially the Ministry of Finance (35 of 128). Most attacks lasted less than an hour, but seven went on for more than 10 h.\nThe impact on the working lives of the Estonian public has been overestimated. For instance, a Chatham House report argued: “The severity and length of the attacks directed at one of NATO's most electronically connected members put the alliance on guard. If a highly wired small state could be brought to its knees by a well-orchestrated Internet-based attack, then what type of havoc could be wrought upon larger states with more heterogeneous systems and critical infrastructure open to attack? ”\nEstonia's two largest banks, Hansapank and SEB Eesti Ühispank, were attacked several times between 9 and 15 May. However, the effects were very limited. Hansapank's e-banking service had to be shut down for up to 2 h on 9 and 10 May. SEB Eesti Ühispank's online banking service was down for a similar period on 15 May. The banks mitigated the impact of the attacks by, for instance, limiting access to customers outside of Estonia. Three major Internet service providers -- Elion Ettevõtted, Elisa Andmesideteenused and Starman -- came under DDoS attacks (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010). The Zone.ee web hosting service provider and directory service provider (ee.ee) were attacked, but in each case their services were restored relatively quickly. The US Computer Emergency Readiness Team (CERT) assessment concluded that although this was a ‘watershed' attack, it was not ‘revolutionary' in terms of the scale or sophistication of the techniques that were used .\nThe Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Paet accused the Kremlin of involvement in the cyber-attacks. However, there was no direct evidence to link the DDoS with any state agencies. In contrast, the Estonian attacks provide an early example of ‘crowdsourcing'. Digital infrastructures were used to encourage hacktivist participation. The incidents have been compared with a ‘cyber-riot' rather than a well-coordinated attack (The Economist 2007). The term ‘patriotic hacking' describes attacks performed by a group of people who take action ‘pro patria' in cases where they believe that this is the right thing for their government to do or where they perceive the government as unable to do ‘the right thing' (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010). Political activists protested by engaging in coordinated cyber-attacks against the online presence and Internet infrastructure of Estonia. The activities of disaffected individuals provided opportunities for ‘plausible deniability' by a range of state agencies that might otherwise stand accused of coordinating the attacks.\nNATO members considered the wider implications of the attacks on Estonia, leading to the development of the Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) in 2008. This organisation is not funded directly by NATO but by the supporting member states. CCDCOE provides a meeting place for military experts, scientists, lawyers and politicians. It also publishes technical reports on emerging cyber threats and provides ‘white papers' on policy decisions including the development of international legal frameworks to clarify the response to future attacks, in particular when it is not possible to identify whether a state organisation is responsible for a threat.\nTable 1 has summarised the use of social media in the Estonian case study. As can be seen, social networks were used to crowd-source participation in the DDoS attacks. Malware was distributed through Internet sites that also provided lists of potential targets. It is important to stress that the participants in this attack were not simply the individuals usually associated with hacking but included a far broader spectrum including members of the public who were opposed to what they viewed as the suppression of minority rights in the aftermath of Estonian independence (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010).\n## Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty, April 2008\nThe second case study focuses on the role that botnets and other forms of ‘anti-social' networking played on cyber-attacks against Radio Svaboda, the Belarusian service of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL). These radio stations were established during the Cold War and had been the target of direct physical attacks, including a poisoning attempt associated with the Czechoslovak intelligence service and a car bomb, linked to the Romanian government. However, the cyber-attacks can be linked to political tensions inside Belarus. Many independent observers criticised the electoral processes used by President Alexander Lukashenka to extend his tenure in 1996 and 2004. There were limited opportunities to voice criticisms within Belarus. During 2008, a Statute on Mass Media extended the state monopoly of Internet Service Provision. Beltelekom was able to restrict access to sites that criticised the administration, including those operated by Radio Svaboda.\nDuring the morning of 26 April 2008, the Radio Svaboda web servers were subjected to a DDoS attack (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010). These attacks seem to have been launched by the government supporters to prevent Radio Svaboda from covering popular protests on the 22nd anniversary of the Chernobyl accident, which occurred on the borders of Belarus and the Ukraine. Many people were unhappy about the lack of compensation for those affected by the accident. Others were angered by the administration's support for the Belarus civil nuclear programme.\nThis analysis does not explain why the cyber-attacks also affected a number of other RFL/RE servers, including those for Kosovo, Azerbaijan, Tatar-Bashkir and Radio Farda in Iran. These additional attacks were arguably intended to obfuscate the attribution of the DDoS on Radio Svaboda. However, motivation and opportunity cannot be used as surrogates for more direct evidence of official involvement. Several organisations argued that Russian DDoS botnets were involved in the attacks . These ‘anti-social' networks were also used to coordinate attacks on a wider range of opposition media sites. These included Charter 97, an English language news site on political activities in Belarus; BelPartyzan, a local news website and the Russian language information sites, legis-group.ru and compromat.net.\nThe botnets used in the Belarus DDoS attacks were normally used for criminal activities; in particular to generate spam and phishing emails. The blurred boundary between cyber-crime and state-sponsored cyber-attacks is a feature of many case studies in this paper . Government agencies provide implicit support for criminal groups, who develop the infrastructures to support future attacks. However, the links are informal. Criminal groups may act for patriotic reasons or to ensure continued implicit state approval; in either case, it seems clear that anti-social networks have been forged between state agencies and cyber-attackers (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010; Johnson 2012).\nThe RFE/RL case study also illustrates the resilience of information infrastructures. The cyber-attacks did not bring the services ‘to their knees'. Several local websites in Belarus offered to carry content for RFE/RL before they could recover. By 28 April, most of the RFL/RE sites had been restored with significant improvements in their security infrastructures. The Radio Svaboda site administrators were also able to gain technical support from communities around the globe. In particular, help was received from several groups interested in maintaining the freedom of expression across the Internet. This provides a precursor to the collective action seen during the ‘Arab Spring' of 2011. The uprisings and unrest in Algeria,\nBahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Syria, Tunisia and Yemen were all influenced by the use of social media. Attempts by many states to disrupt Internet communications did not prevent opposition groups from disseminating messages using externally hosted sites. The attacks on RFE/RL provide an early example of the ‘social resilience' of communications infrastructures in response to cyber-attacks.\nThe Estonian case study showed that social networks could be used to coordinate cyber-attacks using crowd-sourcing techniques in response to political conflict. In contrast, Table 1 has shown that hacktivism was not a significant part of the cyber-attacks on RFE/RL. In contrast, DDoS attacks were launched by criminal botnets used to generate spam messages with an obvious impact on working lives around the globe. State agencies did not close down these anti-social networks, arguably, because they knew they could be recruited to launch cyber-attacks without the need to implicate government information infrastructures. Previous ergonomic studies tend to focus on the symptoms associated with these botnets, in terms of the impact of nuisance messages. Very few have considered the criminal and political context that sustains the dark side of the Internet.\n## 4. Lithuania, June 2008\nThe cyber-attacks on Estonia and Lithuania both had their roots in the tensions that arose following the break-up of the Soviet bloc. The right-wing Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats introduced a series of amendments to prohibit the public display of Soviet or Nazi insignia and were subsequently elected to power in November 2008. This created the background for conflict as the Russian Federation began to reassert influence on the Baltic states (Pääbo 2008). The immediate passage of the amendments did not seem to trigger the same level of hostility in the local Russian population, as had been observed amongst ethnic Russians in Estonia (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010). However, President Medvedev joined with the Belarusian President Lukashenka to express the Russian Federation's concern over the legislation. There were simultaneous protests outside the Lithuanian embassy in Moscow accompanied by a significant number of cyber-attacks. Some 300 websites were defaced by anti-Lithuanian slogans and by pro-Soviet symbols that would have been banned under the 2008 amendments.\nThe attacks were first detected on 28 June, peaking between 17:00 and 18:00 EET on Sunday 29 June. Companies and government websites were targeted ranging from the Lithuanian equivalent of the Securities and Exchange Commission to the web portal for the Lithuanian Social Democratic Party. By 2 July, most of the sites were able to resume normal operation.\nAfter independence, successive governments had encouraged the development of information infrastructures across Lithuanian, for instance through the Information Society Development Programme. Almost half of all households possessed a computer at the time of the attack, and one-third of government organisations had a web presence. However, companies suffered the most. The Lithuanian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-LT) had warned government agencies on a list of ‘at-risk' organisations after an Estonian TV channel had reported the possibility of a cyber-attack on 26 July. Commercial organisations did not receive the warning because they had not been included on the initial list. CERTs have been established by governments around the globe to increase resilience to cyber-attacks. The Lithuanian CERT had been established around 18 months before the web servers were defaced.\nThe Lithuanian attacks show how CERTs can develop networks of potential targets to ensure that warnings are propagated to at-risk organisations. This case study also illustrates the need for government agencies to actively monitor social media for intelligence about potential attacks and for forensic information in the aftermath of a cyber-incident. CERT-LT traced most of the targets back to Hostex, one of the largest web hosting services in Lithuania. The forensic analysis showed that once the vulnerability had been identified, all Hostex users were targeted. CERT-LT assisted the Hostex engineers as they worked to mitigate the effects of the attacks. The modes of attack resemble those used in both Estonia and Belarus. Initial reports focused on vulnerabilities in PHP servers that were then used to run a series of scripts distributed amongst a small group of attackers. However, other modes of attack included the generation of large amounts of spam email linking to ‘Hackers United against External Threats to Russia', which resembled the use of botnets in the previous case studies (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010).\nCERT-LT and RRT, the Lithuanian communications regulatory authority, identified the use of proxy servers to the East. It seemed “likely that the attacks were organised in advance, considering the fact that signals, invitations, and agitation were spread on the Internet prior to the attacks. However, the RRT refused to speak of any particular countries as the initiator of the attack. (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010)” Subsequent analysis identified compromised hosts in France and Sweden as possible sources for the defacement attacks suggesting that they had been planned in advance. However, as in Belarus, the Lithuanian attacks might also have used servers that had already been violated for other cyber-crime activities.\nCircumstantial evidence for the involvement of Russian hacking groups is provided by discussions on Internet forums, such as hack-wars.ru. However, direct proof was difficult to obtain. For example, the Cyber Police Unit of the Lithuanian Police argued that the attackers had used the Tor ‘onion routing' protocols. Tor is used by journalists, whistle-blowers and law enforcement agencies to prevent monitoring of Internet traffic. It relies on ‘onion routing'; this refers to the use of encryption at multiple layers of a communication network. The Lithuanian attacks illustrate a number of common themes across many of the incidents in this paper. Attribution was complicated by the lack of direct evidence for state involvement and by the participation of ‘hacking groups' communicating over Internet forums and social media.\n## Georgia, August 2008\nThe fourth case study forms part of the armed conflict between Georgia and the Russian Federation over Ossetia. Although this region straddles the Caucasian mountains, North Ossetia was ceded to the Soviet Union, whereas the area south of the mountains became part of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic (GSSR). Fighting broke out between Georgian forces and South Ossetia (1991--1992) and then in Abkhazia (1992--1994). In consequence, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) formed a peacekeeping force in 1992 with troops from Russia, Georgia and South Ossetia. The composition of this peacekeeping force did little to reduce animosity between the various factions . This was exacerbated by Moscow's concern when the Bush administration provided assistance for the Georgian forces to clear Chechen fighters from the Pankisi valley. By April 2008, large-scale military exercises were being conducted on both sides of the border. Fighter aircraft and UAVs began to patrol ‘demilitarised' areas.\nOn 7 August 2008, Georgian forces attacked the town of Tskhinvali and surrounding areas in response to an alleged Russian invasion. By 8 August, the Russian air force was attacking infrastructures, targets included Tbilisi airport radar, railroad junctions and telecommunications facilities. By 10 August, the Georgian Government declared a unilateral ceasefire and announced its intention to withdraw Georgian forces from South Ossetia. By 11 August, Russian troops had crossed the boundaries of Ossetia and entered a number of Georgian towns. On 12 August, French President Sarkozy travelled to Moscow and Tiblisi, representing the European Council. He proposed a six-point peace plan that ultimately led to a ceasefire. By 22 August, Russian troops had withdrawn from their positions beyond the former boundaries of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.\nThe most obvious difference with Estonia and Lithuania is that the Georgian cyber-attacks coincided with a physical offensive. The effects were also different. More than 50% of the Estonian population were active users of the Internet. In contrast, this figure was close to 30% in Lithuania but only 10% in Georgia. However, the impact on Georgia was greater because most of their information infrastructures passed through the Russian territory . Georgia was aware of these communication vulnerabilities and wanted to develop trade opportunities with the EU. Most Internet traffic was deliberately routed via Turkish or Azerbaijan service providers. Work had almost been completed on a high capacity link with Bulgaria before the invasion.\nThe initial wave of cyber-attacks on the Georgian government infrastructures occurred before the armed conflict. These included ICMP floods and spurious HTTP ‘GET' requests similar to the techniques used in Estonia . Targets included www.president.gov.ge, where images of Adolf Hitler were substituted for pictures of President Saakashvili. A collage of dictators was also placed on the National Bank of the Republic of Georgia's site. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs portal was attacked as were newspaper and media agencies in Georgia and Azerbaijan. Meanwhile, the DDoS attacks were aimed at government sites, including the Parliament and Ministry of Education and Science and the banks. The DDoS statistics gathered during the Georgian attacks were also similar to those for Estonia. Most attacks lasted from 2 to 6 h.\nIntelligence agencies had learned from events in Estonian and were better equipped to monitor the attack patterns against Georgia. Several botnets were involved, including the MachBot controller for an HTTP-based botnet attack coordinated by Russian herders. Many aspects of the attacks in Estonia and Georgia have been linked to the Russian Business Network (RBN) criminal organisation and associated botnets. The accuracy of this claim is understandably difficult to establish, as is the nexus between the founder of the RBN and Russian government agencies. It may be that the RBN provided access to botnet resources without mounting the DDoS attacks; following a ‘business model' that supported their wider activities (Grey Goose 2008). However, it is dangerous to assume that involvement in an attack provides reliable evidence about its coordination . At least one of the botnets' command and control servers was located in the USA.\nThere is also evidence that social media was used to support ‘crowdsourcing' similar to that seen in Estonia: “a downloadable script to ping flood Estonian websites (both DNS and IPs) was shared on various Russian language message boards. Instructions on how to ping flood Georgian government websites were also distributed on Russian language websites and\nmessage boards, as well as lists of Georgian sites vulnerable to remote SQL injections, facilitating automatic defacement of them. .”\nSQL injections occur because commands written in one language may be hidden inside the instructions of another. If the input is not correctly filtered for embedded command sequences, then these can be inadvertently executed by higher layers of an application. The email addresses of prominent Georgian politicians, academics and industrialists were also distributed. These were used to focus spamming and more targeted forms of attack . Major figures had to create new email accounts and re-establish their social networks in a piecemeal fashion, at a time when their attention should have been focused on the invasion.\nThe response to the attacks was coordinated by CERT Georgia. Their analysis of Internet Protocol (IP) data was supported by Estonian, French and Polish counterparts. However, many of the targets of the cyber-attacks simply waited. Normal commercial activities were curtailed by the armed conflict. Some websites mitigated the impact of the attacks by temporarily changing IP addresses. Others used international hosts; Blogspot.com supported Georgian news and government agencies. The websites of the Georgian President and their Ministry of Defence were relocated to a company in Atlanta, GA, USA. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs moved to an Estonian server. These counter-measures had limited effects inside Georgia. Flood attacks on Caucasus Network Tbilisi caused significant bottlenecks exacerbated by damage to network infrastructures inside the war zone; many Georgian Internet connections ran through Russia.\nThese case studies illustrate a complex relation between ICT maturity and the vulnerability to cyber-attacks. The more a nation depends upon networked services, then the more vulnerable it can be to any cyber-incident. The Estonian public relied on the Internet for a host of government and financial services. The impact on Georgia was more limited. Equally, the more a nation depends upon networked services, then the more resilient it will be to any cyber-incident. Less mature nations find it harder to bring their electronic infrastructures back online. In Georgia, the attacks forced the suspension of electronic banking services for 10 days rather than the hours of interruption seen in Estonia.\nIt is difficult to underestimate the psychological impact of a combined attack on both physical and digital infrastructures. Tikk et al. (2008) observe that “while the attacks did not have a permanent or even a long-run devastating effect on the Georgian Internet infrastructure, the damage caused by the attacks was most acutely experienced at the time when Georgia was the most dependent on the availability of their information channels.”\nThe synchronisation of the physical and virtual attacks reinforced the vulnerability of the Georgian government to external forces.\nThe Georgian case study also shows how cyber-conflicts can extend across different social networks. Russian hacking groups were implicated in the initial attacks on Georgian government infrastructures. In contrast, hacking groups inside Georgia also became the targets of cyber-attacks. The www.hacking.ge website was an early victim. This removed a potential source of advice and information about ways to increase the resilience of Georgian networks. Alternatively, it can be seen as part of a direct conflict between hacking/hacking networks in Russia and Georgia. Russian sites also seem to have been the target of secondary attacks, such as that operated by the RIA Novosti news outlet .\nTable 1 has summarised the diverse role that various forms of social networks played in the Georgian attacks. As can be seen, crowdsourcing was used through the distribution of scripts and lists of potential victims. Social networks were also used to distribute information about individuals who were then deliberately the target of spamming attacks. Finally, botnets were used to coordinate DDoS attacks. However, unlike previous case studies, there is evidence to suggest the conflict extended between hacking networks on both sides of the conflict.\n## 6. China, GhostNet, March 2009\nThere are similarities between the first four case studies; the Estonian, Belarusian, Lithuania and Georgian attacks all stemmed from the break-up of the Soviet Union. All four involved politically motivated DDoS attacks supported by the use of criminal botnets. In all four cases, the victims were able to use networks of contacts and sympathisers to recover from the attacks within hours. In contrast, the fifth case study focuses on ‘advanced persistent threats' . As the term suggests, this form of attack requires greater coordination and planning. APTs also illustrate how a new generation of cyber-threats uses social networks to deliberately focus their attacks on particular individuals. Information about an individual's online contacts can be exploited by ‘socially engineered malware'.\nThis case study focuses on the violation of computers in more than 100 countries. Although the evidence is circumstantial, it seems likely that these attacks were coordinated by groups inside the People's Republic of China as part of the wider policy of active defence . Subsequent sections of this paper will describe similar techniques exploited by agencies in Europe and North America. However, this case study considers targets in the foreign ministries of Iran, Bangladesh, Latvia, Indonesia, Philippines, Brunei, Barbados and Bhutan; embassies in India, South Korea, Indonesia,\nRomania, Cyprus, Malta, Thailand, Taiwan, Portugal, Germany and Pakistan; the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Secretariat and the Asian Development Bank. The attacks also compromised computers in news organisations and a range of commercial organisations.\nThese attacks seemed to follow a common pattern; a Trojan horse was introduced onto a victim's machine that would then exfiltrate information to control servers, ultimately reporting back to Chinese sources. These data would include information about the victim's social networks that could then be used by spear phishing attacks. Their email account would be used to send a malicious payload to the individuals in their contact list . The success of the approach depended upon convincing the recipient to open the attached document containing the malware. People are far more likely to open an attachment if it comes from a friend or colleague. Once opened, this attachment would compromise the next link in the social network. The terms ‘social malware', ‘social engineering' and ‘spear phishing' describe the use of information about the target's network of contacts. The aim is to increase the plausibility of the email vector. In some cases, legitimate messages were simply reused. In other cases, documents were taken from other compromised machines and then passed to new targets with the embedded malware to increase the probability that they would, in turn, infect their machines.\nThis modus operandi was christened the ‘GhostNet'; it was identified following investigations on behalf of the Office of the Dalai Lama . Sympathisers were detained by Chinese officials who seemed to have knowledge of their Internet communications. Many sympathisers used Tencent QQ to spread information about the Tibetan cause; this is the most widespread instant messaging service in mainland China. Voice over IP applications might also have been compromised. The Office of the Dalai Lama, therefore, installed network monitoring software to gather additional forensic evidence. They found that infected machines would exchange information with command and control servers -- to download updated versions of the malware and send data out of the local networks: “(This) led to the discovery of four control servers and six command servers ... The control servers were then probed and web-based control interfaces were identified on four control servers, which allowed us to view and control the network. The system was actively monitored for 2 weeks, which allowed us to derive an extensive list of infected systems, and to also monitor the systems operator(s) as the operator(s) specifically instructed target computers. ”The IP addresses associated with most of these servers were traced to China. Several were located on the island of Hainan, home to the Lingshui signals intelligence facility and the Third Technical Department of the People's Liberation Army. However, other servers were traced to the USA, Sweden, South Korea and Taiwan. This illustrates the complexity of attribution.\nA subsequent analysis of the web servers that were used to coordinate the GhostNet Trojan's undermined arguments that they were maintained by government agencies. Instead, they used QQ instant messaging numbers to trace the sites back to members of the Chinese hacking community . These studies concluded that patriotic hacking and cybercrime may have played a role in the development of these attacks . Further circumstantial evidence of the anti-social networks that connect hacking groups was provided by the reuse of techniques associated with the earlier Enfal Trojan within the Ghostnet attacks. Code seems to have been exchanged between different groups of programmers working with a similar but distinct malware. The case studies in this paper provide parallels between twenty-first century cyber-crime and seventeenth century piracy. They illustrate a privateering model, in which governments authorise private individuals to attack enemies of the state. Further investigations concluded that two or three different groups were using different command and control infrastructures to support multiple forms of attack on opposition groups .\nForensic analysis of the GhostNet attacks illustrates the dual nature of social networks in cyber-security. Victims were targeted using spear-phishing techniques that deliberately exploited information about their social networks . Conversely, the perpetrators of the attack were traced by monitoring connections between different groups of attackers, for instance across Baidu: “(these attacks were) to a large degree organised and operated through the misuse of social networking and cloud computing platforms, including Google, Baidu, Yahoo!, and Twitter, in addition to traditional command and control servers ... although we are able to piece together circumstantial evidence that provides the location and possible associations of the attackers, their actual identities and motivations remain illusory. We catch a glimpse of a shadow of attribution in the cloud, in other words, but have no positive identification ... there is a generational shift unfolding in malware networks in multiple dimensions, from what were once primarily simple to increasingly complex, adaptive systems spread across redundant services and platforms, and from criminal and industrial-based exploitation to political, military, and intelligence-focused espionage. ”\nCloud-based infrastructures and web mail services support these new forms of attack. Free or low-cost hosting services with minimal background checks enable the development of command and control servers that can be used to update malware and coordinate the exfiltration of data. If the security of these servers is compromised, then they can quickly be abandoned at almost no cost. In these circumstances, the Trojans used social networking sites, including Twitter, Google Groups, Blogspot, Baidu Blogs and blog.com accounts, to access links to the new free hosting accounts that replaced the compromised command and control servers . As a final resort, the malware could contact more stable servers\nin China; these would then point the malware back to an alternate disposable hosting service reducing the chances of further detection .\nThe (ab)use of social networking and Cloud infrastructures to implement command and control servers was compounded through the indirection provided by the Tor anonymity network. This technique was mentioned in our third case study; the Cyber Police Unit of the Lithuanian Police found that Tor had been used to disguise the attacks on their government servers. Tor passes communications through various volunteer servers to prevent others from identifying the origin of a message. When researchers monitored unencrypted data leaving the Tor network, they found some of it related to the Dalai Lama's office. Because these messages did not originate from the Office of the Dalai Lama, they concluded that the information was most probably being forwarded to Tor as the attackers tried to disguise the compromised machines .\nThe GhostNet attacks again illustrate the need to increase links between the field of Ergonomics and cyber-security. Social-media provide significant benefits across a broad range of industries (Manyika, Chui, and Sarrazin 2012). They enable networks of contacts to work together across national borders and between diverse organisations. At the same time, Cloud computing techniques are providing low-cost methods to coordinate distributed work, for instance, through the development of shared, virtual infrastructures. However, these innovations have created new vulnerabilities. Malware now makes use of social media to obtain information about personal contacts. There are then used to propagate spear-phishing attacks where a malicious payload is disguised within email that is deliberately tailored for a recipient within a social network. Similarly, Cloud and web mail infrastructures provide the disposable technologies that enable the rapid development of command and control servers. These are used to upload more recent versions of malware and also to forward data extracted from a victim's machine. They reduce the likelihood of detection because they can be abandoned without cost should an attack be discovered. Table 1 has summarised the role of social networks and their supporting technologies within the GhostNet attacks. A key motivation for writing this paper is to encourage more active research within the field of Ergonomics to increase our resilience to these forms of attack. The solutions are unlikely to be purely technical; these forms of attack undermine the trust of victims in their information infrastructures. Unless more is carried out to make individuals and groups aware of the potential threats, there is a risk that the dark side of the Internet will limit the further development of the digital economy. Many companies now prohibit staff from accessing social media on any device that is used within their networks -- including applications that are specifically intended to support business networks .\n## W32.STUXNET, March 2010\nThe case studies in this paper provide a spectrum from the mass DDoS attacks that relied on hacktivism and crowdsourcing in Georgia, Estonia, Latvia and Belarus, to the more focussed techniques that were deployed against the social networks of Chinese opposition groups. The final case study argues that Stuxnet had an even narrower focus; attacking a particular group of centrifuges within the Iranian nuclear enrichment programme. Social networks again played an important role in the transmission of this malware. It exploited vulnerabilities in the auto-execution mechanisms associated with removable drives, such as USB sticks. In consequence, Stuxnet quickly infected groups of users, including commercial and government organisations, which shared data and applications (Falliere, Murchu, and Chien 2011). One reason for the successful transmission of the malware was that it took steps to cover its tracks. Code was introduced to delete any malware left on a USB stick after the third infection. Stuxnet again illustrates how computer viruses can propagate across social and professional networks.\nStuxnet also illustrated the exchange of ‘lessons learned' across anti-social networks. It exploited techniques that had previously been used in the Conficker worm. Stuxnet spread across local area networks, exploiting vulnerabilities in the Windows Print Spooler. The virus would also scan infected computers for security software. In some cases, the malware would inject code into trusted processes, including anti-virus programmes. However, if the security product was considered to be resilient to the attack, then no injection would be attempted. Stuxnet used command and control servers, similar to those identified in the Chinese attacks. These were located in Malaysia and Denmark; connection requests were monitored from over 40,000 unique IP addresses in more than 155 countries. When a new machine was infected, the malware would first test connectivity with a valid address, including www.msn.com. If successful, the malware would first download an update of the virus; three different versions have been identified.\nOne of the reasons that Stuxnet was so virulent is that it included a Windows rootkit, providing privileged access to the underlying operating system while at the same time masking the intrusion. It also incorporated four ‘zero-day exploits'. These vulnerabilities in underlying operating systems or network architectures were unknown before the malware was released. The term ‘zero day' indicates that this is the first day when security firms can patch the vulnerability. The number of zero-day attacks in Stuxnet is highly unusual. Using all four at once is wasteful; an attack may be sustained by waiting for the first exploit to be patched before releasing the second and so on.\nThe attack was focussed against Iran's civil nuclear programmes. Between 2006 and 2010, the United Nations passed six resolutions to prevent them from developing the enrichment technologies to produce military grade uranium. For instance, resolution 1803  banned the export of dual use technologies with nuclear applications to Iran. The term ‘dual use' is important because the enrichment process is essential to develop uranium fuel for civil energy generation, but also for nuclear weapons development. Enrichment relies on cascades of centrifuges that produce successively higher concentrations. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) found evidence that Iran had created at least two strings capable of enriching uranium up to 20% by August 2010. Iran had more than 2.5 tons of low-enriched uranium, which was sufficient to support the development of nuclear weapons using existing centrifuges.\nStuxnet targeted the Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) that supervised the Iranian centrifuges. PLCs are not, typically, connected to networks. Instead, they are periodically attached to PCs, and code is downloaded directly onto the controllers. The PLCs are then connected to the centrifuges. In consequence, attackers must first infect the PCs that are used to code the PLCs. Stuxnet focussed on the Siemen's Step 7 PLC programming environment. If Step 7 was not detected on an infected PC, then no actions were taken. If it was detected, then Stuxnet exploited a number of vulnerabilities in the Step 7 environment, including a hard-coded password for its SCADA database. Stuxnet was also able to hook operating system calls to open project files associated with the Siemens application. However, it did not infect all of the Step 7 data. It was only interested in projects that had been used or accessed within the previous three and a half years.\nStuxnet monitored, replaced and disguised blocks of Step 7 code being written to PLCs. In order to do this, the malware had to forge the digital signatures that were used to authenticate drivers in the malicious binaries. These were maintained by two Taiwanese companies, which seem to have been the victims of conventional or physical industrial espionage . This is reminiscent of the Georgian case study where the cyber-attack coincident with a physical invasion. In Stuxnet, the cyber-attack was supported by convention forms of espionage.\nOnce the malicious code had made the jump from the PCs to the PLCs, it monitored the frequency of the motors attached to the centrifuge. It only attacked systems that operated at frequencies between 807 and 1210 Hz. The malware then triggered a state machine to control the sabotage. After an initial delay of some 13 days, Stuxnet set the maximum frequency to 1410 Hz; 27 days later, this was changed to 2 Hz and then 1064 Hz before the sequence was repeated. The malware acted like a landmine; the intention was not to kill the victim, but to consume finite resources of time and expertise. By analogy, the intention was not to destroy the centrifuges, but to waste the Iranian engineering resources as teams of workers had to repair affected components and identify the source of the problems. The IAEA reported signs of damage to around 900 centrifuges during the period when Stuxnet was active. However, independent studies suggest that Iran was able to increase uranium enrichment in spite of this cyber-attack . They were resilient to the cyber-attack, just as the victims were in our previous case studies. One interpretation of this conflicting evidence is that Iranian authorities deliberately exaggerated the impact of the malware to create the impression that greater damage had been inflicted on their nuclear programmes.\nThe sophistication of Stuxnet suggests that it was developed by a network of engineers. Not only did they require a detailed knowledge of the Step 7 environment, but they also needed access to specialist hardware. The malicious payload focused on PLCs using a particular Central Processing Unit; 6ES7-315-2 (series 300). The malware monitored the PLCs' Profibus communications processors looking for frequency converters manufactured by Fararo Paya in Iran and Vacon in Finland. The range of technical skills required by this cyber-attack strongly suggests that Stuxnet was created by a team or network of developers. Stuxnet would have taken from 5 to 30 people around 6 months to prepare (Falliere, Murchu, and Chien 2011). It is remarkable that Stuxnet did not affect any of the registered users for the Step 7 environment. Hence, the development team may have included security agencies as well as representatives of the companies that might otherwise have been affected by the attack. However, this speculation does not preclude the possibility that a small group of committed individuals acted together to create the malware with or without state encouragement.\nSome commentators have argued that the preoccupation with Iranian centrifuges has masked the real purpose of the Stuxnet virus . The attacks can be seen as the first field test of a targeted cyber-attack. The widespread dissemination of the virus violated many different systems, but the damage was highly focussed on a very small number of specialist devices. In this interpretation, the real purpose of Stuxnet was to reveal how future cyber-weapons could go beyond the mass DDoS of earlier attacks. In contrast to ‘hacktivist' crowdsourcing in Estonia, Lithuania, Georgia and Belarus, the GhostNet and Stuxnet cyber-attacks required relatively small networks of specialists working together to exploit common features of our everyday working environments -- ranging from USB sticks to social networks and Cloud infrastructures.\n## Summary of the use of social media in cyber-attacks\nThere are many motivations for a closer engagement between the field of Ergonomics and cyber-security. First, it is important that human factors specialists have a better understanding of the underlying causes of security threats. Cyber-\nErgonomics\nsecurity will have an increasing impact on working lives. It is not simply the high-profile security breaches that affect major public and private institutions, but also the everyday irritation created by spam and the continual need to maintain anti-viral systems. Second, it is essential that Ergonomists play a more active role in designing our defences. At present, we are faced with a bewildering array of firewalls, passwords and access control mechanisms that frustrate our working tasks and, as we have seen, provide limited protection against emerging threats. Third, in order to understand the threat posed by recent generations of malware, it is important to understand core concepts within the field of Ergonomics. It is important to understand that social networks support new forms of attack, for instance helping hackers exchange successful techniques. Social networks can also increase resilience, bringing together technical support in the aftermath of an attack. There remains significant work to be carried out – both in inhibiting the growth of anti-social networks and promoting the interactions that will help us recover from future threats.\nFigure 1 provides an overview of the roles that social networking plays in cyber-attacks. The Estonian, Georgian and Lithuanian case studies show that crowd-sourcing supports DDoS attacks, by exchanging malware and lists of potential targets between groups of sympathisers. Social networking provided patriotic groups with both the motivation and technical direction to implement the attacks. In these incidents, the attribution problem was complicated because it is impossible to determine whether state intervention sustained the groups who launched the attacks.\nSecond, governments can exploit informal links with anti-social criminal networks during cyber-attacks. In particular, they can make use of criminal resources to attack third-party infrastructures. Russian botnets played an important part in the Belarus case study. The use of existing criminal networks hides state intervention. The attribution problem is complicated because botnets exploit various forms of indirection to mask command and control infrastructures. This is only one example of the social networks that support cyber-attacks. Malware is often exchanged between criminal networks who reuse techniques exposing previous vulnerabilities. Stuxnet exploited vulnerabilities in the IP exploited by Conficker.\nSocial networks have also been used to infer inter-personal relationships that can then be exploited by malware, for example using spear phishing techniques. The recipient is more likely to open an infected attachment or link if it has been\nFigure 1. Different stages in the use of social networking for cyber-attacks.\nC.W. Johnson\nsent from a trusted source. The Chinese case studies have shown that politically motivated attacks, therefore, draw heavily on identity theft in wider areas of cyber-crime. Intelligence agencies now routinely monitor interactions over social media .\nFinally, I have shown how the infrastructures associated with social networking create disposable architectures to coordinate attacks, for example through the development of command and control servers used by Stuxnet. The ubiquitous nature of these architectures makes it difficult to determine who owns and operates the servers. Similarly, the use of anonymity servers in the Lithuanian and GhostNet attacks shows how systems that support confidential interaction also support the dark side of the Internet.",
    "# 9. A roadmap for social media in cyber defence": "This paper provides a roadmap for future resilience to the abuse of social media in cyber-attacks. I have identified existing threats – for example through crowdsourcing in DDoS attacks and through the social monitoring that directs spear phishing. I have also identified ways in which social networks can help organisations resist and recover from attacks. For instance, I have seen how the Estonian media identified Internet groups that were encouraging participation in a cyber-attack on Lithuania (stages 1 and 2 in Figure 1). In consequence, the national CERT alerted government agencies. However, organisations that had not registered with their Computer Emergency Response Team did not receive the warning. This illustrates the continuing need to develop networks for the dissemination of the best practices to increase resilience against future cyber-threats.\nFigure 2 presents our roadmap for the use of social media in mitigating the threat of cyber-attacks. It is more complex than the overview of social media in previous security incidents, illustrated in Figure 1. This is because the first diagram was based on evidence drawn from the case studies presented in this paper, using the action-based methodology from the opening sections. Figure 2 is more tentative. I have hypothesised the ways in which social media might increase resilience to future attacks. The roadmap is intended as a starting point. In particular, the diagram must be refined in response to new threats. Previous sections have described how malware exploits technologies that originally supported a wide range of end-user tasks. For instance, Cloud-based file-stores and web mail services provide flexible, virtual information infrastructures. These same technologies have also been used to create disposable command and control infrastructures. If we cannot develop a more sophisticated appreciation of the security risks that stem from the abuse of future infrastructures, then we will continue to react as cyber-attacks evolve to exploit new vulnerabilities.\nThe first element of the roadmap in Figure 2 focuses on the monitoring of social media. This can be broken down into a number of concerns. Monitoring provides advanced warning of hacktivism, especially when 'politically motivated' cyberattacks reuse infrastructures that support conventional forms of cyber-crime, including identity theft. The reuse of botnets\nFigure 2. Roadmap for the use of social networking for cyber defence.\nand many of the zero-day exploits described in previous sections were discussed on social media before they were used on political targets. Our work reiterates the need for intelligence agencies to identify intersections between political groups and the wider population of cyber-criminals using social network analysis tools.\nThe second stage of the road map reinforces links with existing security management systems through risk assessment for cyber defence. Risk assessment is important because, at present, it is not performed in an organised or systematic way by many of the potential targets of cyber-attacks. Public--private networks have been used by many states as a cost-effective means of encouraging commercial and public bodies to increase their resilience to future attacks. Companies and government agencies are encouraged to work together in developing contingency plans based on the risk assessments that identify potential cyber-threats. Unfortunately, this approach has not worked very well . Many companies have been enthusiastic participants. Many others have abstained. Even those that were initially enthusiastic have not sustained their interest.\nSocial networking provides one means of addressing these concerns. For example, the UK government is promoting Warning, Advice and Reporting Points; see www.warp.gov.uk. These groups use electronic resources to send personalised warnings and advice across a network of members. Each WARP focuses on a particular community with similar security requirements; ‘Their purpose is to provide a specific community with the capability to share security related information -- both problems and solutions -- and thereby to develop more secure and responsive environments'. The third element of the road map, therefore, focuses on the use of social media to disseminate early warnings about potential cyber-attacks.\nIssuing community warning about future attacks provides limited benefits unless they are accompanied by appropriate actions. Drills and exercises help to audit the resilience provided by these mechanisms. Too often, these drills assume perfect conditions for CERTs and other state agencies to respond to potential attacks. However, the Georgian invasion shows that cyber-incidents coincide with adverse circumstances. By developing wider communities of interest in cyber-security, by encouraging participation in drills and exercises, we can also obtain evidence of vulnerabilities and the consequences of future attacks that provide persuasive data to encourage wider participation in these initiatives.\nThe penultimate stage in the roadmap focuses on the use of social networks in forensic analysis after an attack has occurred (Johnson, in press). At present, it is extremely difficult to detect the early stages of an attack. A range of network monitoring companies, mostly located in the USA, provide detailed information on connectivity failures in the aftermath of DDoS attacks. However, CERTs cannot use these post hoc studies to trigger a more active response once an attack is underway. Greater benefits could be derived from research into the particular patterns that have characterised the initial stages of previous attacks, for example using abnormal Border Gateway Protocol events. The real-time identification of an attack is not simply a technical exercise but requires input from a range of different experts given the costs and consequences that are associated with false alarms. Closing down an infrastructure in case an attack may occur requires operational, managerial and regulatory expertise.\nThe final stage of the roadmap for using social media to increase resilience to cyber-attacks focuses on the identification and dissemination of lessons learned. At present, this remains an ad hoc process . Many stakeholders remain ignorant of the extent of previous attacks, especially outside their own national borders. Further problems arise when vested interests exaggerate the impact of cyber-attacks; this alienates engineering staff who play a vital role in implementing potential mitigations. As we have seen, reports that cyber-attacks will ‘bring a nation to its knees' cannot be justified on the evidence of previous incidents.\nArguably, the greatest vulnerability identified in our work has been the difficulty that managers and operators have in obtaining clear information about previous attacks. Strong contrasts can be drawn between the lack of information in this and the plethora of accident and incident reports published across safety-related industries. Of course, it can be argued that the wider dissemination of this information might encourage future attacks. However, this argument ignores the anti-social networks that have already sprung up to disseminate the technical information that can be used to launch future attacks.",
    "## Conclusions and further work": "This paper provides a new perspective on the wider topics addressed in this special issue looking beyond human-centred automation. The aim has been to identify threats to human--machine interaction in multi-layered networks. Previous sections have argued that the growing complexity of socio-technical systems and the interpenetration of formerly separate systems via IT infrastructures create new opportunities for social interaction. It also creates new vulnerabilities.\nSocial networks have motivated individuals to participate in mass Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. They have disseminated information and provided resources, including lists of targets and malicious code. Second, political groups have launched attacks using infrastructures that are normally associated with wider forms of cyber-crime, including botnets. Third, I have shown how information about an individual's social networks has helped to target spear phishing. Malware is, typically, disguised in a document that was intercepted from a colleague or friend. The recipient is more likely to open an\nC.W. Johnson\nTable 2.

Finally, I have shown how the development of Cloud infrastructures and social networking applications has created disposable architectures for the command and control servers that coordinate malware attacks. The ubiquitous and distributed nature of these architectures makes it increasingly difficult to determine who owns and operates these systems. I have gone on to identify a roadmap for the defensive measures that might be used to minimise the future threats from the 'dark side' of social networking. Several of our case studies have illustrated the 'social resilience' of communications infrastructures; victims have been able to crowd-source support from overseas governments, from civil liberties groups and from sympathisers around the globe as they seek to recover from the immediate aftermath of a cyber-attack.\nTable 2 shows that the case studies were motivated by political conflict and that none had the long-term impact many fear will be the consequence of state-sponsored cyber-attacks. There are many reasons for this – most incidents affected information systems that could quickly be restored once an attack had been diagnosed. Stuxnet is a notable exception because it deliberately damaged physical systems. Even here, the Iranian authorities were able to resume enrichment activities after a relatively short period of time. However, past resilience is no basis for future complacency. This paper has shown how cyber-attacks continue to evolve. Technical innovations, intended to increase productivity and support interaction, are easily adapted to support the dark side of the Internet.",

First, social networks motivate individuals to participate in Distributed Denial of Service attacks by providing malware and identifying potential targets. Second, attackers use an individual’s social network to focus attacks, through spear phishing. Recipients are more likely to open infected attachments when they come from a trusted source. Third, social networking infrastructures create disposable architectures to coordinate attacks through command and control servers. The ubiquitous nature of these architectures makes it difficult to determine who owns and operates the servers. Finally, governments recruit anti-social criminal networks to launch attacks on third-party infrastructures using botnets. The closing sections identify a roadmap to increase resilience against the ‘dark side’ of social networking.\n**Practitioner Summary**: This paper provides readers with an overview of state-sponsored cyber-attacks. I show how many of these threats have exploited social networks and social media. The aim was to alert practitioners to the dark side of computing, where attackers learn to exploit new interaction techniques and new forms of working.\n**Keywords**: cyber defence; national critical infrastructures; software security\n# 1. Introduction\nThis paper identifies threats to human–machine interaction in the multi-layered networks that are at the heart of this special issue. The growing complexity of socio-technical systems and the interpenetration of formerly separate systems via IT infrastructures create new opportunities for social interaction. It also creates new vulnerabilities. In particular, this paper considers the role that social networking has played in the ‘attribution problem’. This term describes the difficulty in determining who is responsible for a cyber-attack. Social networks describe interconnections between individuals and groups that change over time. These relationships may be based on family ties, sexual relationships, employment, etc. However, the interconnections can also motivate groups to launch mass cyber-attacks on common targets, whether they are multi-national corporations or government agencies. It is difficult for commercial and government organisations to monitor these connections and hence predict the groups who are likely to become involved in mass cyber-attacks. One reason for this is that state agencies are using ‘social media’ to encourage and sustain networks of hactivists that are behind many cyber-attacks. Social media are Internet-based applications that allow for the generation and dissemination of user-generated content. As we shall see, these applications provide mechanisms for the dissemination and control of malware. I also show how these techniques support forms of indirection that make it difficult to identify explicit state responsibility for many cyber-attacks over the last decade.\nAt first sight, it might seem that this topic is tangential to many of the mainstream interests within the field of Ergonomics. In contrast, I will argue that it is increasingly important to understand not only the positive role that social networks play in work and leisure but it is also equally necessary to understand how these phenomena may also be abused to support criminal activity. The following pages also explain why so much of our working lives continue to be devoted to filtering the thousands of spam emails that are generated by botnets. A botnet can be thought of as a number of interacting programmes communicating across a network of compromised machines; the term is formed from the conjunction of ‘robotic’ ‘networks’.\nSocial networking hinders the attribution of cyber-attacks in four different ways. First, social networks have helped to ‘crowd source’ the participants in an attack. They have motivated individuals to participate in mass Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. They have provided the code needed to launch DDoS and have published information on potential targets. Second, attackers have used information about an individual’s social networks to compromise security measures. For example, information about the friends and colleagues of a target can be obtained from social networks. This enables ‘spear phishing’; a recipient is more likely to open an infected attachment or link if it has been sent from a trusted participant in their social network. Third, I show how the information infrastructures that are associated with some forms of social\n© 2013 Taylor &amp; Francis\nC.W. Johnson\nnetworking create disposable architectures for command and control servers to coordinate malware attacks. Finally, governments have tolerated and even encouraged the growth of anti-social criminal networks that are later used to launch attacks on political targets, for instance, using botnets. Table 1 summarises the different roles that social media have played in the case studies that are presented in this paper. Before introducing the incidents that are included within this study, it is first important to present the methodological background to our work.\n# 1.1 Methodological interactions from action research to case-study approach\nResearch of this nature raises a host of methodological problems. Several authors have recently pioneered the use of human factors techniques to identify security threats and vulnerabilities. For instance, Kraemer, Carayon, and Clem (2009) used focus groups of IT security professionals to identify the individual and organisational causes of vulnerabilities. Shaw (2006) reviews the empirical evidence that supports the role of behavioural consultants within investigative teams looking at the potential role of insiders within particular attacks. However, neither of these studies considers the detailed role of individual and organisational human factors in state-sponsored cyber-attacks. Very few previous studies consider the wider national context of threats that extend beyond individual organisations. Many of the techniques that have been conventionally applied in Ergonomics cannot easily be used to analyse social aspects of state-sponsored cyber-crime. This is an important caveat given that cyber-attacks have an increasing impact on the working lives of many people. Empirical studies and laboratory investigations yield useful insights into individual behaviours; however, Dantzker and Hunter (2000) summarise the problems that arise when interpreting the results of studies that are intended to analyse criminal behaviour. Further criticisms stem from the limited insights that such studies provide into the group interactions , which are at the heart of this paper.\nAction research provides an alternative perspective . It builds on the idea that complex social interactions cannot be studied by focussing on the isolated behaviours of particular individuals. In contrast, more situated studies provide a view of the impact of change on society. Action research provides tools to investigate changes and their effects while overcoming researchers' 'self-imposed distance from the world of action' . These techniques are entirely appropriate within the context of this paper because the area of cyber-security is in constant flux. The role of social networks as a mechanism for launching attacks continues to adapt, for example, in response to new security mechanisms.\nAction research is not the only methodological approach that might be used to support this work; Blichfeldt and Andersen (2006) identify a continuum from Yin's (1994) hypothetical-deductive case-study techniques to Glaser and Strauss' (1967) notion of grounded theory. Yin's techniques assume that investigators will directly intervene in the working context, whereas Glaser and Strauss promote a more observational approach. The work reported in the following sections has been derived using action-based techniques as part of initiatives to increase the resilience of national and international infrastructures. I acknowledge that these involvements may bias our work in a positivist way. Equally active involvement helps to establish the relationships needed before access is granted to forensic evidence . Rather than focussing on these positivist interventions, the following sections draw more on the case-study methodologies associated with Yin. The intention is to provide an overview of recent incidents – not only to support our theories on the roles that social networking plays in the 'attribution problem' but also to provide readers with an overview of the causes and consequences of cyber-incidents that are an increasing threat across many different industries.\nThe methodology adopted in this work was to conduct a series of interviews with members of government organisations, including military and intelligence agencies, in the countries affected by the attacks. These were confidential, given the nature of the events under discussion. The questions focused on the probable causes of the attacks and also the consequences for government infrastructures. The initial insights provided by these meetings were validated by subsequent\nTable 1. High-level comparison of use of social networks in the case studies.\n|   | Social networks motivate participation through crowdsourcing | Social networks used to target individuals via spear phishing | ‘Disposable service models’ associated with social networks aid coordination of an attack | Use of anti-social networks, supporting botnets and associated criminal infrastructures  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Estonia, April–May 2007 | Yes | No | No | Yes  |\n|  Belorusia, April 2008 | No | No | Yes | Yes  |\n|  Lithuania, June 2008 | Yes | No | No | Yes  |\n|  Georgia, August 2008 | Yes | Yes | No | Yes  |\n|  China, March 2009 | No | Yes | Yes | Yes  |\n|  W32.STUXNET, March 2010 | No | No | Yes | No  |\ninterviews with commercial organisations. Telecommunications companies were asked about the resilience of their systems and where possible to provide access to technical data about the connectivity of their networks over time. I also consulted critical infrastructure providers, including air traffic management organisations and financial service companies. In many cases, the impact of state-sponsored cyber-attacks was less severe than might have been assumed. In other cases, a lack of forensic expertise exacerbated recovery. It is important to stress that our aim was to survey the use of social networks in state-sponsored cyber-attacks, rather than to follow a rigid methodology. I had limited opportunities to contact the intended targets of Stuxnet inside Iran and the victims of Ghostnet. Instead, I relied on sources within NATO to assess the impact of these attacks. The inclusion of both incidents within the paper is justified because they mark key developments in state-sponsored, offensive capabilities.\n## Estonia, April--May 2007\nThe first case study focuses on a series of cyber-attacks that were directed against Estonia during April and May 2007. There are earlier examples of coordinated threats; for instance, the US government identified the ‘Titan Rain' attacks on companies, such as Lockheed Martin, national laboratories, including Sandia, and military targets, such as the Redstone Arsenal before 2003. Attackers from the Netherlands successfully compromised some 34 US defence sites in 1990.\nThe probable causes of the Estonian case study can be traced back to tensions between ethnic Estonians and Russians following the Second World War. After independence, many ethnic Russians were left without any form of citizenship. More immediate triggers included a decision to move the Bronze Soldier of Tallinn. This war memorial had become a focus for clashes between Estonians and Russian nationalists. The subsequent riots left one person dead and 150 injured. Some argued that the statue was a symbol of the Soviet occupation of Estonia, whereas others believed that it was a memorial to the Russians who fought against Nazi occupation .\nIt is possible to distinguish several different phases in this incident. An initial emotional/physical stage was closely tied to the riots around the Bronze Soldier. A series of website defacements then took place, but these were then superseded by a third phase in which DDoS attacks were launched . The rapid development of digital communications during the moves towards independence between 1988 and 1991 arguably placed Estonia at greater risk from such cyber-attacks. At the time of the attack, some 97% of all Estonian bank transactions were made online, 65% of the population were classified as ‘active users' of the Internet and 80% of the population had national identity cards that supported digital signatures. A number of different DDoS mechanisms were used. These included Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) floods launched by individuals. The aim was to overwhelm a server and stop it responding to legitimate requests. The Estonian attacks also included the use of botnets. A botnet is a network of private computers infected with malware, and they are controlled as a group typically without the owners' knowledge.\nArbor Networks identified more than 120 different attacks over a 3-week period; these included “a decent sized botnet behind the attack, with aggregate bandwidth at our points of measurement maxing out at nearly 100 Mbps ... All in all, someone is very, very deliberate in putting the hurt on Estonia, and this kind of thing is only going to get more severe in the coming years. ”\nHowever, most of the attacks (100 of the 120) were simple ICMP floods. Four involved more sophisticated approaches where TCP connection requests were sent faster than the recipient could process them. Most of the targets were government websites, especially the Ministry of Finance (35 of 128). Most attacks lasted less than an hour, but seven went on for more than 10 h.\nThe impact on the working lives of the Estonian public has been overestimated. For instance, a Chatham House report argued: “The severity and length of the attacks directed at one of NATO's most electronically connected members put the alliance on guard. If a highly wired small state could be brought to its knees by a well-orchestrated Internet-based attack, then what type of havoc could be wrought upon larger states with more heterogeneous systems and critical infrastructure open to attack? ”\nEstonia's two largest banks, Hansapank and SEB Eesti Ühispank, were attacked several times between 9 and 15 May. However, the effects were very limited. Hansapank's e-banking service had to be shut down for up to 2 h on 9 and 10 May. SEB Eesti Ühispank's online banking service was down for a similar period on 15 May. The banks mitigated the impact of the attacks by, for instance, limiting access to customers outside of Estonia. Three major Internet service providers -- Elion Ettevõtted, Elisa Andmesideteenused and Starman -- came under DDoS attacks (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010). The Zone.ee web hosting service provider and directory service provider (ee.ee) were attacked, but in each case their services were restored relatively quickly. The US Computer Emergency Readiness Team (CERT) assessment concluded that although this was a ‘watershed' attack, it was not ‘revolutionary' in terms of the scale or sophistication of the techniques that were used .\nThe Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Paet accused the Kremlin of involvement in the cyber-attacks. However, there was no direct evidence to link the DDoS with any state agencies. In contrast, the Estonian attacks provide an early example of ‘crowdsourcing'. Digital infrastructures were used to encourage hacktivist participation. The incidents have been compared with a ‘cyber-riot' rather than a well-coordinated attack (The Economist 2007). The term ‘patriotic hacking' describes attacks performed by a group of people who take action ‘pro patria' in cases where they believe that this is the right thing for their government to do or where they perceive the government as unable to do ‘the right thing' (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010). Political activists protested by engaging in coordinated cyber-attacks against the online presence and Internet infrastructure of Estonia. The activities of disaffected individuals provided opportunities for ‘plausible deniability' by a range of state agencies that might otherwise stand accused of coordinating the attacks.\nNATO members considered the wider implications of the attacks on Estonia, leading to the development of the Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) in 2008. This organisation is not funded directly by NATO but by the supporting member states. CCDCOE provides a meeting place for military experts, scientists, lawyers and politicians. It also publishes technical reports on emerging cyber threats and provides ‘white papers' on policy decisions including the development of international legal frameworks to clarify the response to future attacks, in particular when it is not possible to identify whether a state organisation is responsible for a threat.\nTable 1 has summarised the use of social media in the Estonian case study. As can be seen, social networks were used to crowd-source participation in the DDoS attacks. Malware was distributed through Internet sites that also provided lists of potential targets. It is important to stress that the participants in this attack were not simply the individuals usually associated with hacking but included a far broader spectrum including members of the public who were opposed to what they viewed as the suppression of minority rights in the aftermath of Estonian independence (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010).\n## Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty, April 2008\nThe second case study focuses on the role that botnets and other forms of ‘anti-social' networking played on cyber-attacks against Radio Svaboda, the Belarusian service of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL). These radio stations were established during the Cold War and had been the target of direct physical attacks, including a poisoning attempt associated with the Czechoslovak intelligence service and a car bomb, linked to the Romanian government. However, the cyber-attacks can be linked to political tensions inside Belarus. Many independent observers criticised the electoral processes used by President Alexander Lukashenka to extend his tenure in 1996 and 2004. There were limited opportunities to voice criticisms within Belarus. During 2008, a Statute on Mass Media extended the state monopoly of Internet Service Provision. Beltelekom was able to restrict access to sites that criticised the administration, including those operated by Radio Svaboda.\nDuring the morning of 26 April 2008, the Radio Svaboda web servers were subjected to a DDoS attack (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010). These attacks seem to have been launched by the government supporters to prevent Radio Svaboda from covering popular protests on the 22nd anniversary of the Chernobyl accident, which occurred on the borders of Belarus and the Ukraine. Many people were unhappy about the lack of compensation for those affected by the accident. Others were angered by the administration's support for the Belarus civil nuclear programme.\nThis analysis does not explain why the cyber-attacks also affected a number of other RFL/RE servers, including those for Kosovo, Azerbaijan, Tatar-Bashkir and Radio Farda in Iran. These additional attacks were arguably intended to obfuscate the attribution of the DDoS on Radio Svaboda. However, motivation and opportunity cannot be used as surrogates for more direct evidence of official involvement. Several organisations argued that Russian DDoS botnets were involved in the attacks . These ‘anti-social' networks were also used to coordinate attacks on a wider range of opposition media sites. These included Charter 97, an English language news site on political activities in Belarus; BelPartyzan, a local news website and the Russian language information sites, legis-group.ru and compromat.net.\nThe botnets used in the Belarus DDoS attacks were normally used for criminal activities; in particular to generate spam and phishing emails. The blurred boundary between cyber-crime and state-sponsored cyber-attacks is a feature of many case studies in this paper . Government agencies provide implicit support for criminal groups, who develop the infrastructures to support future attacks. However, the links are informal. Criminal groups may act for patriotic reasons or to ensure continued implicit state approval; in either case, it seems clear that anti-social networks have been forged between state agencies and cyber-attackers (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010; Johnson 2012).\nThe RFE/RL case study also illustrates the resilience of information infrastructures. The cyber-attacks did not bring the services ‘to their knees'. Several local websites in Belarus offered to carry content for RFE/RL before they could recover. By 28 April, most of the RFL/RE sites had been restored with significant improvements in their security infrastructures. The Radio Svaboda site administrators were also able to gain technical support from communities around the globe. In particular, help was received from several groups interested in maintaining the freedom of expression across the Internet. This provides a precursor to the collective action seen during the ‘Arab Spring' of 2011. The uprisings and unrest in Algeria,\nBahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Syria, Tunisia and Yemen were all influenced by the use of social media. Attempts by many states to disrupt Internet communications did not prevent opposition groups from disseminating messages using externally hosted sites. The attacks on RFE/RL provide an early example of the ‘social resilience' of communications infrastructures in response to cyber-attacks.\nThe Estonian case study showed that social networks could be used to coordinate cyber-attacks using crowd-sourcing techniques in response to political conflict. In contrast, Table 1 has shown that hacktivism was not a significant part of the cyber-attacks on RFE/RL. In contrast, DDoS attacks were launched by criminal botnets used to generate spam messages with an obvious impact on working lives around the globe. State agencies did not close down these anti-social networks, arguably, because they knew they could be recruited to launch cyber-attacks without the need to implicate government information infrastructures. Previous ergonomic studies tend to focus on the symptoms associated with these botnets, in terms of the impact of nuisance messages. Very few have considered the criminal and political context that sustains the dark side of the Internet.\n## 4. Lithuania, June 2008\nThe cyber-attacks on Estonia and Lithuania both had their roots in the tensions that arose following the break-up of the Soviet bloc. The right-wing Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats introduced a series of amendments to prohibit the public display of Soviet or Nazi insignia and were subsequently elected to power in November 2008. This created the background for conflict as the Russian Federation began to reassert influence on the Baltic states (Pääbo 2008). The immediate passage of the amendments did not seem to trigger the same level of hostility in the local Russian population, as had been observed amongst ethnic Russians in Estonia (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010). However, President Medvedev joined with the Belarusian President Lukashenka to express the Russian Federation's concern over the legislation. There were simultaneous protests outside the Lithuanian embassy in Moscow accompanied by a significant number of cyber-attacks. Some 300 websites were defaced by anti-Lithuanian slogans and by pro-Soviet symbols that would have been banned under the 2008 amendments.\nThe attacks were first detected on 28 June, peaking between 17:00 and 18:00 EET on Sunday 29 June. Companies and government websites were targeted ranging from the Lithuanian equivalent of the Securities and Exchange Commission to the web portal for the Lithuanian Social Democratic Party. By 2 July, most of the sites were able to resume normal operation.\nAfter independence, successive governments had encouraged the development of information infrastructures across Lithuanian, for instance through the Information Society Development Programme. Almost half of all households possessed a computer at the time of the attack, and one-third of government organisations had a web presence. However, companies suffered the most. The Lithuanian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-LT) had warned government agencies on a list of ‘at-risk' organisations after an Estonian TV channel had reported the possibility of a cyber-attack on 26 July. Commercial organisations did not receive the warning because they had not been included on the initial list. CERTs have been established by governments around the globe to increase resilience to cyber-attacks. The Lithuanian CERT had been established around 18 months before the web servers were defaced.\nThe Lithuanian attacks show how CERTs can develop networks of potential targets to ensure that warnings are propagated to at-risk organisations. This case study also illustrates the need for government agencies to actively monitor social media for intelligence about potential attacks and for forensic information in the aftermath of a cyber-incident. CERT-LT traced most of the targets back to Hostex, one of the largest web hosting services in Lithuania. The forensic analysis showed that once the vulnerability had been identified, all Hostex users were targeted. CERT-LT assisted the Hostex engineers as they worked to mitigate the effects of the attacks. The modes of attack resemble those used in both Estonia and Belarus. Initial reports focused on vulnerabilities in PHP servers that were then used to run a series of scripts distributed amongst a small group of attackers. However, other modes of attack included the generation of large amounts of spam email linking to ‘Hackers United against External Threats to Russia', which resembled the use of botnets in the previous case studies (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010).\nCERT-LT and RRT, the Lithuanian communications regulatory authority, identified the use of proxy servers to the East. It seemed “likely that the attacks were organised in advance, considering the fact that signals, invitations, and agitation were spread on the Internet prior to the attacks. However, the RRT refused to speak of any particular countries as the initiator of the attack. (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010)” Subsequent analysis identified compromised hosts in France and Sweden as possible sources for the defacement attacks suggesting that they had been planned in advance. However, as in Belarus, the Lithuanian attacks might also have used servers that had already been violated for other cyber-crime activities.\nCircumstantial evidence for the involvement of Russian hacking groups is provided by discussions on Internet forums, such as hack-wars.ru. However, direct proof was difficult to obtain. For example, the Cyber Police Unit of the Lithuanian Police argued that the attackers had used the Tor ‘onion routing' protocols. Tor is used by journalists, whistle-blowers and law enforcement agencies to prevent monitoring of Internet traffic. It relies on ‘onion routing'; this refers to the use of encryption at multiple layers of a communication network. The Lithuanian attacks illustrate a number of common themes across many of the incidents in this paper. Attribution was complicated by the lack of direct evidence for state involvement and by the participation of ‘hacking groups' communicating over Internet forums and social media.\n## Georgia, August 2008\nThe fourth case study forms part of the armed conflict between Georgia and the Russian Federation over Ossetia. Although this region straddles the Caucasian mountains, North Ossetia was ceded to the Soviet Union, whereas the area south of the mountains became part of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic (GSSR). Fighting broke out between Georgian forces and South Ossetia (1991--1992) and then in Abkhazia (1992--1994). In consequence, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) formed a peacekeeping force in 1992 with troops from Russia, Georgia and South Ossetia. The composition of this peacekeeping force did little to reduce animosity between the various factions . This was exacerbated by Moscow's concern when the Bush administration provided assistance for the Georgian forces to clear Chechen fighters from the Pankisi valley. By April 2008, large-scale military exercises were being conducted on both sides of the border. Fighter aircraft and UAVs began to patrol ‘demilitarised' areas.\nOn 7 August 2008, Georgian forces attacked the town of Tskhinvali and surrounding areas in response to an alleged Russian invasion. By 8 August, the Russian air force was attacking infrastructures, targets included Tbilisi airport radar, railroad junctions and telecommunications facilities. By 10 August, the Georgian Government declared a unilateral ceasefire and announced its intention to withdraw Georgian forces from South Ossetia. By 11 August, Russian troops had crossed the boundaries of Ossetia and entered a number of Georgian towns. On 12 August, French President Sarkozy travelled to Moscow and Tiblisi, representing the European Council. He proposed a six-point peace plan that ultimately led to a ceasefire. By 22 August, Russian troops had withdrawn from their positions beyond the former boundaries of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.\nThe most obvious difference with Estonia and Lithuania is that the Georgian cyber-attacks coincided with a physical offensive. The effects were also different. More than 50% of the Estonian population were active users of the Internet. In contrast, this figure was close to 30% in Lithuania but only 10% in Georgia. However, the impact on Georgia was greater because most of their information infrastructures passed through the Russian territory . Georgia was aware of these communication vulnerabilities and wanted to develop trade opportunities with the EU. Most Internet traffic was deliberately routed via Turkish or Azerbaijan service providers. Work had almost been completed on a high capacity link with Bulgaria before the invasion.\nThe initial wave of cyber-attacks on the Georgian government infrastructures occurred before the armed conflict. These included ICMP floods and spurious HTTP ‘GET' requests similar to the techniques used in Estonia . Targets included www.president.gov.ge, where images of Adolf Hitler were substituted for pictures of President Saakashvili. A collage of dictators was also placed on the National Bank of the Republic of Georgia's site. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs portal was attacked as were newspaper and media agencies in Georgia and Azerbaijan. Meanwhile, the DDoS attacks were aimed at government sites, including the Parliament and Ministry of Education and Science and the banks. The DDoS statistics gathered during the Georgian attacks were also similar to those for Estonia. Most attacks lasted from 2 to 6 h.\nIntelligence agencies had learned from events in Estonian and were better equipped to monitor the attack patterns against Georgia. Several botnets were involved, including the MachBot controller for an HTTP-based botnet attack coordinated by Russian herders. Many aspects of the attacks in Estonia and Georgia have been linked to the Russian Business Network (RBN) criminal organisation and associated botnets. The accuracy of this claim is understandably difficult to establish, as is the nexus between the founder of the RBN and Russian government agencies. It may be that the RBN provided access to botnet resources without mounting the DDoS attacks; following a ‘business model' that supported their wider activities (Grey Goose 2008). However, it is dangerous to assume that involvement in an attack provides reliable evidence about its coordination . At least one of the botnets' command and control servers was located in the USA.\nThere is also evidence that social media was used to support ‘crowdsourcing' similar to that seen in Estonia: “a downloadable script to ping flood Estonian websites (both DNS and IPs) was shared on various Russian language message boards. Instructions on how to ping flood Georgian government websites were also distributed on Russian language websites and\nmessage boards, as well as lists of Georgian sites vulnerable to remote SQL injections, facilitating automatic defacement of them. .”\nSQL injections occur because commands written in one language may be hidden inside the instructions of another. If the input is not correctly filtered for embedded command sequences, then these can be inadvertently executed by higher layers of an application. The email addresses of prominent Georgian politicians, academics and industrialists were also distributed. These were used to focus spamming and more targeted forms of attack . Major figures had to create new email accounts and re-establish their social networks in a piecemeal fashion, at a time when their attention should have been focused on the invasion.\nThe response to the attacks was coordinated by CERT Georgia. Their analysis of Internet Protocol (IP) data was supported by Estonian, French and Polish counterparts. However, many of the targets of the cyber-attacks simply waited. Normal commercial activities were curtailed by the armed conflict. Some websites mitigated the impact of the attacks by temporarily changing IP addresses. Others used international hosts; Blogspot.com supported Georgian news and government agencies. The websites of the Georgian President and their Ministry of Defence were relocated to a company in Atlanta, GA, USA. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs moved to an Estonian server. These counter-measures had limited effects inside Georgia. Flood attacks on Caucasus Network Tbilisi caused significant bottlenecks exacerbated by damage to network infrastructures inside the war zone; many Georgian Internet connections ran through Russia.\nThese case studies illustrate a complex relation between ICT maturity and the vulnerability to cyber-attacks. The more a nation depends upon networked services, then the more vulnerable it can be to any cyber-incident. The Estonian public relied on the Internet for a host of government and financial services. The impact on Georgia was more limited. Equally, the more a nation depends upon networked services, then the more resilient it will be to any cyber-incident. Less mature nations find it harder to bring their electronic infrastructures back online. In Georgia, the attacks forced the suspension of electronic banking services for 10 days rather than the hours of interruption seen in Estonia.\nIt is difficult to underestimate the psychological impact of a combined attack on both physical and digital infrastructures. Tikk et al. (2008) observe that “while the attacks did not have a permanent or even a long-run devastating effect on the Georgian Internet infrastructure, the damage caused by the attacks was most acutely experienced at the time when Georgia was the most dependent on the availability of their information channels.”\nThe synchronisation of the physical and virtual attacks reinforced the vulnerability of the Georgian government to external forces.\nThe Georgian case study also shows how cyber-conflicts can extend across different social networks. Russian hacking groups were implicated in the initial attacks on Georgian government infrastructures. In contrast, hacking groups inside Georgia also became the targets of cyber-attacks. The www.hacking.ge website was an early victim. This removed a potential source of advice and information about ways to increase the resilience of Georgian networks. Alternatively, it can be seen as part of a direct conflict between hacking/hacking networks in Russia and Georgia. Russian sites also seem to have been the target of secondary attacks, such as that operated by the RIA Novosti news outlet .\nTable 1 has summarised the diverse role that various forms of social networks played in the Georgian attacks. As can be seen, crowdsourcing was used through the distribution of scripts and lists of potential victims. Social networks were also used to distribute information about individuals who were then deliberately the target of spamming attacks. Finally, botnets were used to coordinate DDoS attacks. However, unlike previous case studies, there is evidence to suggest the conflict extended between hacking networks on both sides of the conflict.\n## 6. China, GhostNet, March 2009\nThere are similarities between the first four case studies; the Estonian, Belarusian, Lithuania and Georgian attacks all stemmed from the break-up of the Soviet Union. All four involved politically motivated DDoS attacks supported by the use of criminal botnets. In all four cases, the victims were able to use networks of contacts and sympathisers to recover from the attacks within hours. In contrast, the fifth case study focuses on ‘advanced persistent threats' . As the term suggests, this form of attack requires greater coordination and planning. APTs also illustrate how a new generation of cyber-threats uses social networks to deliberately focus their attacks on particular individuals. Information about an individual's online contacts can be exploited by ‘socially engineered malware'.\nThis case study focuses on the violation of computers in more than 100 countries. Although the evidence is circumstantial, it seems likely that these attacks were coordinated by groups inside the People's Republic of China as part of the wider policy of active defence . Subsequent sections of this paper will describe similar techniques exploited by agencies in Europe and North America. However, this case study considers targets in the foreign ministries of Iran, Bangladesh, Latvia, Indonesia, Philippines, Brunei, Barbados and Bhutan; embassies in India, South Korea, Indonesia,\nRomania, Cyprus, Malta, Thailand, Taiwan, Portugal, Germany and Pakistan; the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Secretariat and the Asian Development Bank. The attacks also compromised computers in news organisations and a range of commercial organisations.\nThese attacks seemed to follow a common pattern; a Trojan horse was introduced onto a victim's machine that would then exfiltrate information to control servers, ultimately reporting back to Chinese sources. These data would include information about the victim's social networks that could then be used by spear phishing attacks. Their email account would be used to send a malicious payload to the individuals in their contact list . The success of the approach depended upon convincing the recipient to open the attached document containing the malware. People are far more likely to open an attachment if it comes from a friend or colleague. Once opened, this attachment would compromise the next link in the social network. The terms ‘social malware', ‘social engineering' and ‘spear phishing' describe the use of information about the target's network of contacts. The aim is to increase the plausibility of the email vector. In some cases, legitimate messages were simply reused. In other cases, documents were taken from other compromised machines and then passed to new targets with the embedded malware to increase the probability that they would, in turn, infect their machines.\nThis modus operandi was christened the ‘GhostNet'; it was identified following investigations on behalf of the Office of the Dalai Lama . Sympathisers were detained by Chinese officials who seemed to have knowledge of their Internet communications. Many sympathisers used Tencent QQ to spread information about the Tibetan cause; this is the most widespread instant messaging service in mainland China. Voice over IP applications might also have been compromised. The Office of the Dalai Lama, therefore, installed network monitoring software to gather additional forensic evidence. They found that infected machines would exchange information with command and control servers -- to download updated versions of the malware and send data out of the local networks: “(This) led to the discovery of four control servers and six command servers ... The control servers were then probed and web-based control interfaces were identified on four control servers, which allowed us to view and control the network. The system was actively monitored for 2 weeks, which allowed us to derive an extensive list of infected systems, and to also monitor the systems operator(s) as the operator(s) specifically instructed target computers. ”The IP addresses associated with most of these servers were traced to China. Several were located on the island of Hainan, home to the Lingshui signals intelligence facility and the Third Technical Department of the People's Liberation Army. However, other servers were traced to the USA, Sweden, South Korea and Taiwan. This illustrates the complexity of attribution.\nA subsequent analysis of the web servers that were used to coordinate the GhostNet Trojan's undermined arguments that they were maintained by government agencies. Instead, they used QQ instant messaging numbers to trace the sites back to members of the Chinese hacking community . These studies concluded that patriotic hacking and cybercrime may have played a role in the development of these attacks . Further circumstantial evidence of the anti-social networks that connect hacking groups was provided by the reuse of techniques associated with the earlier Enfal Trojan within the Ghostnet attacks. Code seems to have been exchanged between different groups of programmers working with a similar but distinct malware. The case studies in this paper provide parallels between twenty-first century cyber-crime and seventeenth century piracy. They illustrate a privateering model, in which governments authorise private individuals to attack enemies of the state. Further investigations concluded that two or three different groups were using different command and control infrastructures to support multiple forms of attack on opposition groups .\nForensic analysis of the GhostNet attacks illustrates the dual nature of social networks in cyber-security. Victims were targeted using spear-phishing techniques that deliberately exploited information about their social networks . Conversely, the perpetrators of the attack were traced by monitoring connections between different groups of attackers, for instance across Baidu: “(these attacks were) to a large degree organised and operated through the misuse of social networking and cloud computing platforms, including Google, Baidu, Yahoo!, and Twitter, in addition to traditional command and control servers ... although we are able to piece together circumstantial evidence that provides the location and possible associations of the attackers, their actual identities and motivations remain illusory. We catch a glimpse of a shadow of attribution in the cloud, in other words, but have no positive identification ... there is a generational shift unfolding in malware networks in multiple dimensions, from what were once primarily simple to increasingly complex, adaptive systems spread across redundant services and platforms, and from criminal and industrial-based exploitation to political, military, and intelligence-focused espionage. ”\nCloud-based infrastructures and web mail services support these new forms of attack. Free or low-cost hosting services with minimal background checks enable the development of command and control servers that can be used to update malware and coordinate the exfiltration of data. If the security of these servers is compromised, then they can quickly be abandoned at almost no cost. In these circumstances, the Trojans used social networking sites, including Twitter, Google Groups, Blogspot, Baidu Blogs and blog.com accounts, to access links to the new free hosting accounts that replaced the compromised command and control servers . As a final resort, the malware could contact more stable servers\nin China; these would then point the malware back to an alternate disposable hosting service reducing the chances of further detection .\nThe (ab)use of social networking and Cloud infrastructures to implement command and control servers was compounded through the indirection provided by the Tor anonymity network. This technique was mentioned in our third case study; the Cyber Police Unit of the Lithuanian Police found that Tor had been used to disguise the attacks on their government servers. Tor passes communications through various volunteer servers to prevent others from identifying the origin of a message. When researchers monitored unencrypted data leaving the Tor network, they found some of it related to the Dalai Lama's office. Because these messages did not originate from the Office of the Dalai Lama, they concluded that the information was most probably being forwarded to Tor as the attackers tried to disguise the compromised machines .\nThe GhostNet attacks again illustrate the need to increase links between the field of Ergonomics and cyber-security. Social-media provide significant benefits across a broad range of industries (Manyika, Chui, and Sarrazin 2012). They enable networks of contacts to work together across national borders and between diverse organisations. At the same time, Cloud computing techniques are providing low-cost methods to coordinate distributed work, for instance, through the development of shared, virtual infrastructures. However, these innovations have created new vulnerabilities. Malware now makes use of social media to obtain information about personal contacts. There are then used to propagate spear-phishing attacks where a malicious payload is disguised within email that is deliberately tailored for a recipient within a social network. Similarly, Cloud and web mail infrastructures provide the disposable technologies that enable the rapid development of command and control servers. These are used to upload more recent versions of malware and also to forward data extracted from a victim's machine. They reduce the likelihood of detection because they can be abandoned without cost should an attack be discovered. Table 1 has summarised the role of social networks and their supporting technologies within the GhostNet attacks. A key motivation for writing this paper is to encourage more active research within the field of Ergonomics to increase our resilience to these forms of attack. The solutions are unlikely to be purely technical; these forms of attack undermine the trust of victims in their information infrastructures. Unless more is carried out to make individuals and groups aware of the potential threats, there is a risk that the dark side of the Internet will limit the further development of the digital economy. Many companies now prohibit staff from accessing social media on any device that is used within their networks -- including applications that are specifically intended to support business networks .\n## W32.STUXNET, March 2010\nThe case studies in this paper provide a spectrum from the mass DDoS attacks that relied on hacktivism and crowdsourcing in Georgia, Estonia, Latvia and Belarus, to the more focussed techniques that were deployed against the social networks of Chinese opposition groups. The final case study argues that Stuxnet had an even narrower focus; attacking a particular group of centrifuges within the Iranian nuclear enrichment programme. Social networks again played an important role in the transmission of this malware. It exploited vulnerabilities in the auto-execution mechanisms associated with removable drives, such as USB sticks. In consequence, Stuxnet quickly infected groups of users, including commercial and government organisations, which shared data and applications (Falliere, Murchu, and Chien 2011). One reason for the successful transmission of the malware was that it took steps to cover its tracks. Code was introduced to delete any malware left on a USB stick after the third infection. Stuxnet again illustrates how computer viruses can propagate across social and professional networks.\nStuxnet also illustrated the exchange of ‘lessons learned' across anti-social networks. It exploited techniques that had previously been used in the Conficker worm. Stuxnet spread across local area networks, exploiting vulnerabilities in the Windows Print Spooler. The virus would also scan infected computers for security software. In some cases, the malware would inject code into trusted processes, including anti-virus programmes. However, if the security product was considered to be resilient to the attack, then no injection would be attempted. Stuxnet used command and control servers, similar to those identified in the Chinese attacks. These were located in Malaysia and Denmark; connection requests were monitored from over 40,000 unique IP addresses in more than 155 countries. When a new machine was infected, the malware would first test connectivity with a valid address, including www.msn.com. If successful, the malware would first download an update of the virus; three different versions have been identified.\nOne of the reasons that Stuxnet was so virulent is that it included a Windows rootkit, providing privileged access to the underlying operating system while at the same time masking the intrusion. It also incorporated four ‘zero-day exploits'. These vulnerabilities in underlying operating systems or network architectures were unknown before the malware was released. The term ‘zero day' indicates that this is the first day when security firms can patch the vulnerability. The number of zero-day attacks in Stuxnet is highly unusual. Using all four at once is wasteful; an attack may be sustained by waiting for the first exploit to be patched before releasing the second and so on.\nThe attack was focussed against Iran's civil nuclear programmes. Between 2006 and 2010, the United Nations passed six resolutions to prevent them from developing the enrichment technologies to produce military grade uranium. For instance, resolution 1803  banned the export of dual use technologies with nuclear applications to Iran. The term ‘dual use' is important because the enrichment process is essential to develop uranium fuel for civil energy generation, but also for nuclear weapons development. Enrichment relies on cascades of centrifuges that produce successively higher concentrations. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) found evidence that Iran had created at least two strings capable of enriching uranium up to 20% by August 2010. Iran had more than 2.5 tons of low-enriched uranium, which was sufficient to support the development of nuclear weapons using existing centrifuges.\nStuxnet targeted the Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) that supervised the Iranian centrifuges. PLCs are not, typically, connected to networks. Instead, they are periodically attached to PCs, and code is downloaded directly onto the controllers. The PLCs are then connected to the centrifuges. In consequence, attackers must first infect the PCs that are used to code the PLCs. Stuxnet focussed on the Siemen's Step 7 PLC programming environment. If Step 7 was not detected on an infected PC, then no actions were taken. If it was detected, then Stuxnet exploited a number of vulnerabilities in the Step 7 environment, including a hard-coded password for its SCADA database. Stuxnet was also able to hook operating system calls to open project files associated with the Siemens application. However, it did not infect all of the Step 7 data. It was only interested in projects that had been used or accessed within the previous three and a half years.\nStuxnet monitored, replaced and disguised blocks of Step 7 code being written to PLCs. In order to do this, the malware had to forge the digital signatures that were used to authenticate drivers in the malicious binaries. These were maintained by two Taiwanese companies, which seem to have been the victims of conventional or physical industrial espionage . This is reminiscent of the Georgian case study where the cyber-attack coincident with a physical invasion. In Stuxnet, the cyber-attack was supported by convention forms of espionage.\nOnce the malicious code had made the jump from the PCs to the PLCs, it monitored the frequency of the motors attached to the centrifuge. It only attacked systems that operated at frequencies between 807 and 1210 Hz. The malware then triggered a state machine to control the sabotage. After an initial delay of some 13 days, Stuxnet set the maximum frequency to 1410 Hz; 27 days later, this was changed to 2 Hz and then 1064 Hz before the sequence was repeated. The malware acted like a landmine; the intention was not to kill the victim, but to consume finite resources of time and expertise. By analogy, the intention was not to destroy the centrifuges, but to waste the Iranian engineering resources as teams of workers had to repair affected components and identify the source of the problems. The IAEA reported signs of damage to around 900 centrifuges during the period when Stuxnet was active. However, independent studies suggest that Iran was able to increase uranium enrichment in spite of this cyber-attack . They were resilient to the cyber-attack, just as the victims were in our previous case studies. One interpretation of this conflicting evidence is that Iranian authorities deliberately exaggerated the impact of the malware to create the impression that greater damage had been inflicted on their nuclear programmes.\nThe sophistication of Stuxnet suggests that it was developed by a network of engineers. Not only did they require a detailed knowledge of the Step 7 environment, but they also needed access to specialist hardware. The malicious payload focused on PLCs using a particular Central Processing Unit; 6ES7-315-2 (series 300). The malware monitored the PLCs' Profibus communications processors looking for frequency converters manufactured by Fararo Paya in Iran and Vacon in Finland. The range of technical skills required by this cyber-attack strongly suggests that Stuxnet was created by a team or network of developers. Stuxnet would have taken from 5 to 30 people around 6 months to prepare (Falliere, Murchu, and Chien 2011). It is remarkable that Stuxnet did not affect any of the registered users for the Step 7 environment. Hence, the development team may have included security agencies as well as representatives of the companies that might otherwise have been affected by the attack. However, this speculation does not preclude the possibility that a small group of committed individuals acted together to create the malware with or without state encouragement.\nSome commentators have argued that the preoccupation with Iranian centrifuges has masked the real purpose of the Stuxnet virus . The attacks can be seen as the first field test of a targeted cyber-attack. The widespread dissemination of the virus violated many different systems, but the damage was highly focussed on a very small number of specialist devices. In this interpretation, the real purpose of Stuxnet was to reveal how future cyber-weapons could go beyond the mass DDoS of earlier attacks. In contrast to ‘hacktivist' crowdsourcing in Estonia, Lithuania, Georgia and Belarus, the GhostNet and Stuxnet cyber-attacks required relatively small networks of specialists working together to exploit common features of our everyday working environments -- ranging from USB sticks to social networks and Cloud infrastructures.\n## Summary of the use of social media in cyber-attacks\nThere are many motivations for a closer engagement between the field of Ergonomics and cyber-security. First, it is important that human factors specialists have a better understanding of the underlying causes of security threats. Cyber-\nErgonomics\nsecurity will have an increasing impact on working lives. It is not simply the high-profile security breaches that affect major public and private institutions, but also the everyday irritation created by spam and the continual need to maintain anti-viral systems. Second, it is essential that Ergonomists play a more active role in designing our defences. At present, we are faced with a bewildering array of firewalls, passwords and access control mechanisms that frustrate our working tasks and, as we have seen, provide limited protection against emerging threats. Third, in order to understand the threat posed by recent generations of malware, it is important to understand core concepts within the field of Ergonomics. It is important to understand that social networks support new forms of attack, for instance helping hackers exchange successful techniques. Social networks can also increase resilience, bringing together technical support in the aftermath of an attack. There remains significant work to be carried out – both in inhibiting the growth of anti-social networks and promoting the interactions that will help us recover from future threats.\nFigure 1 provides an overview of the roles that social networking plays in cyber-attacks. The Estonian, Georgian and Lithuanian case studies show that crowd-sourcing supports DDoS attacks, by exchanging malware and lists of potential targets between groups of sympathisers. Social networking provided patriotic groups with both the motivation and technical direction to implement the attacks. In these incidents, the attribution problem was complicated because it is impossible to determine whether state intervention sustained the groups who launched the attacks.\nSecond, governments can exploit informal links with anti-social criminal networks during cyber-attacks. In particular, they can make use of criminal resources to attack third-party infrastructures. Russian botnets played an important part in the Belarus case study. The use of existing criminal networks hides state intervention. The attribution problem is complicated because botnets exploit various forms of indirection to mask command and control infrastructures. This is only one example of the social networks that support cyber-attacks. Malware is often exchanged between criminal networks who reuse techniques exposing previous vulnerabilities. Stuxnet exploited vulnerabilities in the IP exploited by Conficker.\nSocial networks have also been used to infer inter-personal relationships that can then be exploited by malware, for example using spear phishing techniques. The recipient is more likely to open an infected attachment or link if it has been\nFigure 1. Different stages in the use of social networking for cyber-attacks.\nC.W. Johnson\nsent from a trusted source. The Chinese case studies have shown that politically motivated attacks, therefore, draw heavily on identity theft in wider areas of cyber-crime. Intelligence agencies now routinely monitor interactions over social media .\nFinally, I have shown how the infrastructures associated with social networking create disposable architectures to coordinate attacks, for example through the development of command and control servers used by Stuxnet. The ubiquitous nature of these architectures makes it difficult to determine who owns and operates the servers. Similarly, the use of anonymity servers in the Lithuanian and GhostNet attacks shows how systems that support confidential interaction also support the dark side of the Internet.\n# 9. A roadmap for social media in cyber defence\nThis paper provides a roadmap for future resilience to the abuse of social media in cyber-attacks. I have identified existing threats – for example through crowdsourcing in DDoS attacks and through the social monitoring that directs spear phishing. I have also identified ways in which social networks can help organisations resist and recover from attacks. For instance, I have seen how the Estonian media identified Internet groups that were encouraging participation in a cyber-attack on Lithuania (stages 1 and 2 in Figure 1). In consequence, the national CERT alerted government agencies. However, organisations that had not registered with their Computer Emergency Response Team did not receive the warning. This illustrates the continuing need to develop networks for the dissemination of the best practices to increase resilience against future cyber-threats.\nFigure 2 presents our roadmap for the use of social media in mitigating the threat of cyber-attacks. It is more complex than the overview of social media in previous security incidents, illustrated in Figure 1. This is because the first diagram was based on evidence drawn from the case studies presented in this paper, using the action-based methodology from the opening sections. Figure 2 is more tentative. I have hypothesised the ways in which social media might increase resilience to future attacks. The roadmap is intended as a starting point. In particular, the diagram must be refined in response to new threats. Previous sections have described how malware exploits technologies that originally supported a wide range of end-user tasks. For instance, Cloud-based file-stores and web mail services provide flexible, virtual information infrastructures. These same technologies have also been used to create disposable command and control infrastructures. If we cannot develop a more sophisticated appreciation of the security risks that stem from the abuse of future infrastructures, then we will continue to react as cyber-attacks evolve to exploit new vulnerabilities.\nThe first element of the roadmap in Figure 2 focuses on the monitoring of social media. This can be broken down into a number of concerns. Monitoring provides advanced warning of hacktivism, especially when 'politically motivated' cyberattacks reuse infrastructures that support conventional forms of cyber-crime, including identity theft. The reuse of botnets\nFigure 2. Roadmap for the use of social networking for cyber defence.\nand many of the zero-day exploits described in previous sections were discussed on social media before they were used on political targets. Our work reiterates the need for intelligence agencies to identify intersections between political groups and the wider population of cyber-criminals using social network analysis tools.\nThe second stage of the road map reinforces links with existing security management systems through risk assessment for cyber defence. Risk assessment is important because, at present, it is not performed in an organised or systematic way by many of the potential targets of cyber-attacks. Public--private networks have been used by many states as a cost-effective means of encouraging commercial and public bodies to increase their resilience to future attacks. Companies and government agencies are encouraged to work together in developing contingency plans based on the risk assessments that identify potential cyber-threats. Unfortunately, this approach has not worked very well . Many companies have been enthusiastic participants. Many others have abstained. Even those that were initially enthusiastic have not sustained their interest.\nSocial networking provides one means of addressing these concerns. For example, the UK government is promoting Warning, Advice and Reporting Points; see www.warp.gov.uk. These groups use electronic resources to send personalised warnings and advice across a network of members. Each WARP focuses on a particular community with similar security requirements; ‘Their purpose is to provide a specific community with the capability to share security related information -- both problems and solutions -- and thereby to develop more secure and responsive environments'. The third element of the road map, therefore, focuses on the use of social media to disseminate early warnings about potential cyber-attacks.\nIssuing community warning about future attacks provides limited benefits unless they are accompanied by appropriate actions. Drills and exercises help to audit the resilience provided by these mechanisms. Too often, these drills assume perfect conditions for CERTs and other state agencies to respond to potential attacks. However, the Georgian invasion shows that cyber-incidents coincide with adverse circumstances. By developing wider communities of interest in cyber-security, by encouraging participation in drills and exercises, we can also obtain evidence of vulnerabilities and the consequences of future attacks that provide persuasive data to encourage wider participation in these initiatives.\nThe penultimate stage in the roadmap focuses on the use of social networks in forensic analysis after an attack has occurred (Johnson, in press). At present, it is extremely difficult to detect the early stages of an attack. A range of network monitoring companies, mostly located in the USA, provide detailed information on connectivity failures in the aftermath of DDoS attacks. However, CERTs cannot use these post hoc studies to trigger a more active response once an attack is underway. Greater benefits could be derived from research into the particular patterns that have characterised the initial stages of previous attacks, for example using abnormal Border Gateway Protocol events. The real-time identification of an attack is not simply a technical exercise but requires input from a range of different experts given the costs and consequences that are associated with false alarms. Closing down an infrastructure in case an attack may occur requires operational, managerial and regulatory expertise.\nThe final stage of the roadmap for using social media to increase resilience to cyber-attacks focuses on the identification and dissemination of lessons learned. At present, this remains an ad hoc process . Many stakeholders remain ignorant of the extent of previous attacks, especially outside their own national borders. Further problems arise when vested interests exaggerate the impact of cyber-attacks; this alienates engineering staff who play a vital role in implementing potential mitigations. As we have seen, reports that cyber-attacks will ‘bring a nation to its knees' cannot be justified on the evidence of previous incidents.\nArguably, the greatest vulnerability identified in our work has been the difficulty that managers and operators have in obtaining clear information about previous attacks. Strong contrasts can be drawn between the lack of information in this and the plethora of accident and incident reports published across safety-related industries. Of course, it can be argued that the wider dissemination of this information might encourage future attacks. However, this argument ignores the anti-social networks that have already sprung up to disseminate the technical information that can be used to launch future attacks.\n## Conclusions and further work\nThis paper provides a new perspective on the wider topics addressed in this special issue looking beyond human-centred automation. The aim has been to identify threats to human--machine interaction in multi-layered networks. Previous sections have argued that the growing complexity of socio-technical systems and the interpenetration of formerly separate systems via IT infrastructures create new opportunities for social interaction. It also creates new vulnerabilities.\nSocial networks have motivated individuals to participate in mass Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. They have disseminated information and provided resources, including lists of targets and malicious code. Second, political groups have launched attacks using infrastructures that are normally associated with wider forms of cyber-crime, including botnets. Third, I have shown how information about an individual's social networks has helped to target spear phishing. Malware is, typically, disguised in a document that was intercepted from a colleague or friend. The recipient is more likely to open an\nC.W. Johnson\nTable 2.

Finally, I have shown how the development of Cloud infrastructures and social networking applications has created disposable architectures for the command and control servers that coordinate malware attacks. The ubiquitous and distributed nature of these architectures makes it increasingly difficult to determine who owns and operates these systems. I have gone on to identify a roadmap for the defensive measures that might be used to minimise the future threats from the 'dark side' of social networking. Several of our case studies have illustrated the 'social resilience' of communications infrastructures; victims have been able to crowd-source support from overseas governments, from civil liberties groups and from sympathisers around the globe as they seek to recover from the immediate aftermath of a cyber-attack.\nTable 2 shows that the case studies were motivated by political conflict and that none had the long-term impact many fear will be the consequence of state-sponsored cyber-attacks. There are many reasons for this – most incidents affected information systems that could quickly be restored once an attack had been diagnosed. Stuxnet is a notable exception because it deliberately damaged physical systems. Even here, the Iranian authorities were able to resume enrichment activities after a relatively short period of time. However, past resilience is no basis for future complacency. This paper has shown how cyber-attacks continue to evolve. Technical innovations, intended to increase productivity and support interaction, are easily adapted to support the dark side of the Internet.\n## Acknowledgements\nThe author would like to thank the editors and reviewers of this special edition for their valuable encouragement and for feedback on early versions of this paper.

First, social networks motivate individuals to participate in Distributed Denial of Service attacks by providing malware and identifying potential targets. Second, attackers use an individual’s social network to focus attacks, through spear phishing. Recipients are more likely to open infected attachments when they come from a trusted source. Third, social networking infrastructures create disposable architectures to coordinate attacks through command and control servers. The ubiquitous nature of these architectures makes it difficult to determine who owns and operates the servers. Finally, governments recruit anti-social criminal networks to launch attacks on third-party infrastructures using botnets. The closing sections identify a roadmap to increase resilience against the ‘dark side’ of social networking.\n**Practitioner Summary**: This paper provides readers with an overview of state-sponsored cyber-attacks. I show how many of these threats have exploited social networks and social media. The aim was to alert practitioners to the dark side of computing, where attackers learn to exploit new interaction techniques and new forms of working.\n**Keywords**: cyber defence; national critical infrastructures; software security\n# 1. Introduction\nThis paper identifies threats to human–machine interaction in the multi-layered networks that are at the heart of this special issue. The growing complexity of socio-technical systems and the interpenetration of formerly separate systems via IT infrastructures create new opportunities for social interaction. It also creates new vulnerabilities. In particular, this paper considers the role that social networking has played in the ‘attribution problem’. This term describes the difficulty in determining who is responsible for a cyber-attack. Social networks describe interconnections between individuals and groups that change over time. These relationships may be based on family ties, sexual relationships, employment, etc. However, the interconnections can also motivate groups to launch mass cyber-attacks on common targets, whether they are multi-national corporations or government agencies. It is difficult for commercial and government organisations to monitor these connections and hence predict the groups who are likely to become involved in mass cyber-attacks. One reason for this is that state agencies are using ‘social media’ to encourage and sustain networks of hactivists that are behind many cyber-attacks. Social media are Internet-based applications that allow for the generation and dissemination of user-generated content. As we shall see, these applications provide mechanisms for the dissemination and control of malware. I also show how these techniques support forms of indirection that make it difficult to identify explicit state responsibility for many cyber-attacks over the last decade.\nAt first sight, it might seem that this topic is tangential to many of the mainstream interests within the field of Ergonomics. In contrast, I will argue that it is increasingly important to understand not only the positive role that social networks play in work and leisure but it is also equally necessary to understand how these phenomena may also be abused to support criminal activity. The following pages also explain why so much of our working lives continue to be devoted to filtering the thousands of spam emails that are generated by botnets. A botnet can be thought of as a number of interacting programmes communicating across a network of compromised machines; the term is formed from the conjunction of ‘robotic’ ‘networks’.\nSocial networking hinders the attribution of cyber-attacks in four different ways. First, social networks have helped to ‘crowd source’ the participants in an attack. They have motivated individuals to participate in mass Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. They have provided the code needed to launch DDoS and have published information on potential targets. Second, attackers have used information about an individual’s social networks to compromise security measures. For example, information about the friends and colleagues of a target can be obtained from social networks. This enables ‘spear phishing’; a recipient is more likely to open an infected attachment or link if it has been sent from a trusted participant in their social network. Third, I show how the information infrastructures that are associated with some forms of social\n© 2013 Taylor &amp; Francis\nC.W. Johnson\nnetworking create disposable architectures for command and control servers to coordinate malware attacks. Finally, governments have tolerated and even encouraged the growth of anti-social criminal networks that are later used to launch attacks on political targets, for instance, using botnets. Table 1 summarises the different roles that social media have played in the case studies that are presented in this paper. Before introducing the incidents that are included within this study, it is first important to present the methodological background to our work.\n# 1.1 Methodological interactions from action research to case-study approach\nResearch of this nature raises a host of methodological problems. Several authors have recently pioneered the use of human factors techniques to identify security threats and vulnerabilities. For instance, Kraemer, Carayon, and Clem (2009) used focus groups of IT security professionals to identify the individual and organisational causes of vulnerabilities. Shaw (2006) reviews the empirical evidence that supports the role of behavioural consultants within investigative teams looking at the potential role of insiders within particular attacks. However, neither of these studies considers the detailed role of individual and organisational human factors in state-sponsored cyber-attacks. Very few previous studies consider the wider national context of threats that extend beyond individual organisations. Many of the techniques that have been conventionally applied in Ergonomics cannot easily be used to analyse social aspects of state-sponsored cyber-crime. This is an important caveat given that cyber-attacks have an increasing impact on the working lives of many people. Empirical studies and laboratory investigations yield useful insights into individual behaviours; however, Dantzker and Hunter (2000) summarise the problems that arise when interpreting the results of studies that are intended to analyse criminal behaviour. Further criticisms stem from the limited insights that such studies provide into the group interactions (Dixona and Thebergeb 2011), which are at the heart of this paper.\nAction research provides an alternative perspective (Lewin 1946). It builds on the idea that complex social interactions cannot be studied by focussing on the isolated behaviours of particular individuals. In contrast, more situated studies provide a view of the impact of change on society. Action research provides tools to investigate changes and their effects while overcoming researchers' 'self-imposed distance from the world of action' (Dash 1999). These techniques are entirely appropriate within the context of this paper because the area of cyber-security is in constant flux. The role of social networks as a mechanism for launching attacks continues to adapt, for example, in response to new security mechanisms.\nAction research is not the only methodological approach that might be used to support this work; Blichfeldt and Andersen (2006) identify a continuum from Yin's (1994) hypothetical-deductive case-study techniques to Glaser and Strauss' (1967) notion of grounded theory. Yin's techniques assume that investigators will directly intervene in the working context, whereas Glaser and Strauss promote a more observational approach. The work reported in the following sections has been derived using action-based techniques as part of initiatives to increase the resilience of national and international infrastructures. I acknowledge that these involvements may bias our work in a positivist way. Equally active involvement helps to establish the relationships needed before access is granted to forensic evidence (Johnson 2012). Rather than focussing on these positivist interventions, the following sections draw more on the case-study methodologies associated with Yin. The intention is to provide an overview of recent incidents – not only to support our theories on the roles that social networking plays in the 'attribution problem' but also to provide readers with an overview of the causes and consequences of cyber-incidents that are an increasing threat across many different industries.\nThe methodology adopted in this work was to conduct a series of interviews with members of government organisations, including military and intelligence agencies, in the countries affected by the attacks. These were confidential, given the nature of the events under discussion. The questions focused on the probable causes of the attacks and also the consequences for government infrastructures. The initial insights provided by these meetings were validated by subsequent\nTable 1. High-level comparison of use of social networks in the case studies.\n|   | Social networks motivate participation through crowdsourcing | Social networks used to target individuals via spear phishing | ‘Disposable service models’ associated with social networks aid coordination of an attack | Use of anti-social networks, supporting botnets and associated criminal infrastructures  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Estonia, April–May 2007 | Yes | No | No | Yes  |\n|  Belorusia, April 2008 | No | No | Yes | Yes  |\n|  Lithuania, June 2008 | Yes | No | No | Yes  |\n|  Georgia, August 2008 | Yes | Yes | No | Yes  |\n|  China, March 2009 | No | Yes | Yes | Yes  |\n|  W32.STUXNET, March 2010 | No | No | Yes | No  |\ninterviews with commercial organisations. Telecommunications companies were asked about the resilience of their systems and where possible to provide access to technical data about the connectivity of their networks over time. I also consulted critical infrastructure providers, including air traffic management organisations and financial service companies. In many cases, the impact of state-sponsored cyber-attacks was less severe than might have been assumed. In other cases, a lack of forensic expertise exacerbated recovery. It is important to stress that our aim was to survey the use of social networks in state-sponsored cyber-attacks, rather than to follow a rigid methodology. I had limited opportunities to contact the intended targets of Stuxnet inside Iran and the victims of Ghostnet. Instead, I relied on sources within NATO to assess the impact of these attacks. The inclusion of both incidents within the paper is justified because they mark key developments in state-sponsored, offensive capabilities.\n## Estonia, April--May 2007\nThe first case study focuses on a series of cyber-attacks that were directed against Estonia during April and May 2007. There are earlier examples of coordinated threats; for instance, the US government identified the ‘Titan Rain' attacks on companies, such as Lockheed Martin, national laboratories, including Sandia, and military targets, such as the Redstone Arsenal before 2003. Attackers from the Netherlands successfully compromised some 34 US defence sites in 1990.\nThe probable causes of the Estonian case study can be traced back to tensions between ethnic Estonians and Russians following the Second World War. After independence, many ethnic Russians were left without any form of citizenship. More immediate triggers included a decision to move the Bronze Soldier of Tallinn. This war memorial had become a focus for clashes between Estonians and Russian nationalists. The subsequent riots left one person dead and 150 injured. Some argued that the statue was a symbol of the Soviet occupation of Estonia, whereas others believed that it was a memorial to the Russians who fought against Nazi occupation (Tikk 2009).\nIt is possible to distinguish several different phases in this incident. An initial emotional/physical stage was closely tied to the riots around the Bronze Soldier. A series of website defacements then took place, but these were then superseded by a third phase in which DDoS attacks were launched (Tikk 2009). The rapid development of digital communications during the moves towards independence between 1988 and 1991 arguably placed Estonia at greater risk from such cyber-attacks. At the time of the attack, some 97% of all Estonian bank transactions were made online, 65% of the population were classified as ‘active users' of the Internet and 80% of the population had national identity cards that supported digital signatures. A number of different DDoS mechanisms were used. These included Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) floods launched by individuals. The aim was to overwhelm a server and stop it responding to legitimate requests. The Estonian attacks also included the use of botnets. A botnet is a network of private computers infected with malware, and they are controlled as a group typically without the owners' knowledge.\nArbor Networks identified more than 120 different attacks over a 3-week period; these included “a decent sized botnet behind the attack, with aggregate bandwidth at our points of measurement maxing out at nearly 100 Mbps ... All in all, someone is very, very deliberate in putting the hurt on Estonia, and this kind of thing is only going to get more severe in the coming years. (Nazario 2007)”\nHowever, most of the attacks (100 of the 120) were simple ICMP floods. Four involved more sophisticated approaches where TCP connection requests were sent faster than the recipient could process them. Most of the targets were government websites, especially the Ministry of Finance (35 of 128). Most attacks lasted less than an hour, but seven went on for more than 10 h.\nThe impact on the working lives of the Estonian public has been overestimated. For instance, a Chatham House report argued: “The severity and length of the attacks directed at one of NATO's most electronically connected members put the alliance on guard. If a highly wired small state could be brought to its knees by a well-orchestrated Internet-based attack, then what type of havoc could be wrought upon larger states with more heterogeneous systems and critical infrastructure open to attack? (Hughes 2008)”\nEstonia's two largest banks, Hansapank and SEB Eesti Ühispank, were attacked several times between 9 and 15 May. However, the effects were very limited. Hansapank's e-banking service had to be shut down for up to 2 h on 9 and 10 May. SEB Eesti Ühispank's online banking service was down for a similar period on 15 May. The banks mitigated the impact of the attacks by, for instance, limiting access to customers outside of Estonia. Three major Internet service providers -- Elion Ettevõtted, Elisa Andmesideteenused and Starman -- came under DDoS attacks (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010). The Zone.ee web hosting service provider and directory service provider (ee.ee) were attacked, but in each case their services were restored relatively quickly. The US Computer Emergency Readiness Team (CERT) assessment concluded that although this was a ‘watershed' attack, it was not ‘revolutionary' in terms of the scale or sophistication of the techniques that were used (Waterman 2007).\nThe Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Paet accused the Kremlin of involvement in the cyber-attacks. However, there was no direct evidence to link the DDoS with any state agencies. In contrast, the Estonian attacks provide an early example of ‘crowdsourcing'. Digital infrastructures were used to encourage hacktivist participation. The incidents have been compared with a ‘cyber-riot' rather than a well-coordinated attack (The Economist 2007). The term ‘patriotic hacking' describes attacks performed by a group of people who take action ‘pro patria' in cases where they believe that this is the right thing for their government to do or where they perceive the government as unable to do ‘the right thing' (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010). Political activists protested by engaging in coordinated cyber-attacks against the online presence and Internet infrastructure of Estonia. The activities of disaffected individuals provided opportunities for ‘plausible deniability' by a range of state agencies that might otherwise stand accused of coordinating the attacks.\nNATO members considered the wider implications of the attacks on Estonia, leading to the development of the Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) in 2008. This organisation is not funded directly by NATO but by the supporting member states. CCDCOE provides a meeting place for military experts, scientists, lawyers and politicians. It also publishes technical reports on emerging cyber threats and provides ‘white papers' on policy decisions including the development of international legal frameworks to clarify the response to future attacks, in particular when it is not possible to identify whether a state organisation is responsible for a threat.\nTable 1 has summarised the use of social media in the Estonian case study. As can be seen, social networks were used to crowd-source participation in the DDoS attacks. Malware was distributed through Internet sites that also provided lists of potential targets. It is important to stress that the participants in this attack were not simply the individuals usually associated with hacking but included a far broader spectrum including members of the public who were opposed to what they viewed as the suppression of minority rights in the aftermath of Estonian independence (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010).\n## Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty, April 2008\nThe second case study focuses on the role that botnets and other forms of ‘anti-social' networking played on cyber-attacks against Radio Svaboda, the Belarusian service of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL). These radio stations were established during the Cold War and had been the target of direct physical attacks, including a poisoning attempt associated with the Czechoslovak intelligence service and a car bomb, linked to the Romanian government. However, the cyber-attacks can be linked to political tensions inside Belarus. Many independent observers criticised the electoral processes used by President Alexander Lukashenka to extend his tenure in 1996 and 2004. There were limited opportunities to voice criticisms within Belarus. During 2008, a Statute on Mass Media extended the state monopoly of Internet Service Provision. Beltelekom was able to restrict access to sites that criticised the administration, including those operated by Radio Svaboda.\nDuring the morning of 26 April 2008, the Radio Svaboda web servers were subjected to a DDoS attack (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010). These attacks seem to have been launched by the government supporters to prevent Radio Svaboda from covering popular protests on the 22nd anniversary of the Chernobyl accident, which occurred on the borders of Belarus and the Ukraine. Many people were unhappy about the lack of compensation for those affected by the accident. Others were angered by the administration's support for the Belarus civil nuclear programme.\nThis analysis does not explain why the cyber-attacks also affected a number of other RFL/RE servers, including those for Kosovo, Azerbaijan, Tatar-Bashkir and Radio Farda in Iran. These additional attacks were arguably intended to obfuscate the attribution of the DDoS on Radio Svaboda. However, motivation and opportunity cannot be used as surrogates for more direct evidence of official involvement. Several organisations argued that Russian DDoS botnets were involved in the attacks (Nazario 2008a). These ‘anti-social' networks were also used to coordinate attacks on a wider range of opposition media sites. These included Charter 97, an English language news site on political activities in Belarus; BelPartyzan, a local news website and the Russian language information sites, legis-group.ru and compromat.net.\nThe botnets used in the Belarus DDoS attacks were normally used for criminal activities; in particular to generate spam and phishing emails. The blurred boundary between cyber-crime and state-sponsored cyber-attacks is a feature of many case studies in this paper (Nazario 2008a, 2008b, 2008c). Government agencies provide implicit support for criminal groups, who develop the infrastructures to support future attacks. However, the links are informal. Criminal groups may act for patriotic reasons or to ensure continued implicit state approval; in either case, it seems clear that anti-social networks have been forged between state agencies and cyber-attackers (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010; Johnson 2012).\nThe RFE/RL case study also illustrates the resilience of information infrastructures. The cyber-attacks did not bring the services ‘to their knees'. Several local websites in Belarus offered to carry content for RFE/RL before they could recover. By 28 April, most of the RFL/RE sites had been restored with significant improvements in their security infrastructures. The Radio Svaboda site administrators were also able to gain technical support from communities around the globe. In particular, help was received from several groups interested in maintaining the freedom of expression across the Internet. This provides a precursor to the collective action seen during the ‘Arab Spring' of 2011. The uprisings and unrest in Algeria,\nBahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Syria, Tunisia and Yemen were all influenced by the use of social media. Attempts by many states to disrupt Internet communications did not prevent opposition groups from disseminating messages using externally hosted sites. The attacks on RFE/RL provide an early example of the ‘social resilience' of communications infrastructures in response to cyber-attacks.\nThe Estonian case study showed that social networks could be used to coordinate cyber-attacks using crowd-sourcing techniques in response to political conflict. In contrast, Table 1 has shown that hacktivism was not a significant part of the cyber-attacks on RFE/RL. In contrast, DDoS attacks were launched by criminal botnets used to generate spam messages with an obvious impact on working lives around the globe. State agencies did not close down these anti-social networks, arguably, because they knew they could be recruited to launch cyber-attacks without the need to implicate government information infrastructures. Previous ergonomic studies tend to focus on the symptoms associated with these botnets, in terms of the impact of nuisance messages. Very few have considered the criminal and political context that sustains the dark side of the Internet.\n## 4. Lithuania, June 2008\nThe cyber-attacks on Estonia and Lithuania both had their roots in the tensions that arose following the break-up of the Soviet bloc. The right-wing Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats introduced a series of amendments to prohibit the public display of Soviet or Nazi insignia and were subsequently elected to power in November 2008. This created the background for conflict as the Russian Federation began to reassert influence on the Baltic states (Pääbo 2008). The immediate passage of the amendments did not seem to trigger the same level of hostility in the local Russian population, as had been observed amongst ethnic Russians in Estonia (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010). However, President Medvedev joined with the Belarusian President Lukashenka to express the Russian Federation's concern over the legislation. There were simultaneous protests outside the Lithuanian embassy in Moscow accompanied by a significant number of cyber-attacks. Some 300 websites were defaced by anti-Lithuanian slogans and by pro-Soviet symbols that would have been banned under the 2008 amendments.\nThe attacks were first detected on 28 June, peaking between 17:00 and 18:00 EET on Sunday 29 June. Companies and government websites were targeted ranging from the Lithuanian equivalent of the Securities and Exchange Commission to the web portal for the Lithuanian Social Democratic Party. By 2 July, most of the sites were able to resume normal operation.\nAfter independence, successive governments had encouraged the development of information infrastructures across Lithuanian, for instance through the Information Society Development Programme. Almost half of all households possessed a computer at the time of the attack, and one-third of government organisations had a web presence. However, companies suffered the most. The Lithuanian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-LT) had warned government agencies on a list of ‘at-risk' organisations after an Estonian TV channel had reported the possibility of a cyber-attack on 26 July. Commercial organisations did not receive the warning because they had not been included on the initial list. CERTs have been established by governments around the globe to increase resilience to cyber-attacks. The Lithuanian CERT had been established around 18 months before the web servers were defaced.\nThe Lithuanian attacks show how CERTs can develop networks of potential targets to ensure that warnings are propagated to at-risk organisations. This case study also illustrates the need for government agencies to actively monitor social media for intelligence about potential attacks and for forensic information in the aftermath of a cyber-incident. CERT-LT traced most of the targets back to Hostex, one of the largest web hosting services in Lithuania. The forensic analysis showed that once the vulnerability had been identified, all Hostex users were targeted. CERT-LT assisted the Hostex engineers as they worked to mitigate the effects of the attacks. The modes of attack resemble those used in both Estonia and Belarus. Initial reports focused on vulnerabilities in PHP servers that were then used to run a series of scripts distributed amongst a small group of attackers. However, other modes of attack included the generation of large amounts of spam email linking to ‘Hackers United against External Threats to Russia', which resembled the use of botnets in the previous case studies (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010).\nCERT-LT and RRT, the Lithuanian communications regulatory authority, identified the use of proxy servers to the East. It seemed “likely that the attacks were organised in advance, considering the fact that signals, invitations, and agitation were spread on the Internet prior to the attacks. However, the RRT refused to speak of any particular countries as the initiator of the attack. (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010)” Subsequent analysis identified compromised hosts in France and Sweden as possible sources for the defacement attacks suggesting that they had been planned in advance. However, as in Belarus, the Lithuanian attacks might also have used servers that had already been violated for other cyber-crime activities.\nCircumstantial evidence for the involvement of Russian hacking groups is provided by discussions on Internet forums, such as hack-wars.ru. However, direct proof was difficult to obtain. For example, the Cyber Police Unit of the Lithuanian Police argued that the attackers had used the Tor ‘onion routing' protocols. Tor is used by journalists, whistle-blowers and law enforcement agencies to prevent monitoring of Internet traffic. It relies on ‘onion routing'; this refers to the use of encryption at multiple layers of a communication network. The Lithuanian attacks illustrate a number of common themes across many of the incidents in this paper. Attribution was complicated by the lack of direct evidence for state involvement and by the participation of ‘hacking groups' communicating over Internet forums and social media.\n## Georgia, August 2008\nThe fourth case study forms part of the armed conflict between Georgia and the Russian Federation over Ossetia. Although this region straddles the Caucasian mountains, North Ossetia was ceded to the Soviet Union, whereas the area south of the mountains became part of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic (GSSR). Fighting broke out between Georgian forces and South Ossetia (1991--1992) and then in Abkhazia (1992--1994). In consequence, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) formed a peacekeeping force in 1992 with troops from Russia, Georgia and South Ossetia. The composition of this peacekeeping force did little to reduce animosity between the various factions (European Commission 2009). This was exacerbated by Moscow's concern when the Bush administration provided assistance for the Georgian forces to clear Chechen fighters from the Pankisi valley. By April 2008, large-scale military exercises were being conducted on both sides of the border. Fighter aircraft and UAVs began to patrol ‘demilitarised' areas.\nOn 7 August 2008, Georgian forces attacked the town of Tskhinvali and surrounding areas in response to an alleged Russian invasion. By 8 August, the Russian air force was attacking infrastructures, targets included Tbilisi airport radar, railroad junctions and telecommunications facilities. By 10 August, the Georgian Government declared a unilateral ceasefire and announced its intention to withdraw Georgian forces from South Ossetia. By 11 August, Russian troops had crossed the boundaries of Ossetia and entered a number of Georgian towns. On 12 August, French President Sarkozy travelled to Moscow and Tiblisi, representing the European Council. He proposed a six-point peace plan that ultimately led to a ceasefire. By 22 August, Russian troops had withdrawn from their positions beyond the former boundaries of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.\nThe most obvious difference with Estonia and Lithuania is that the Georgian cyber-attacks coincided with a physical offensive. The effects were also different. More than 50% of the Estonian population were active users of the Internet. In contrast, this figure was close to 30% in Lithuania but only 10% in Georgia. However, the impact on Georgia was greater because most of their information infrastructures passed through the Russian territory (Zmijewski 2008). Georgia was aware of these communication vulnerabilities and wanted to develop trade opportunities with the EU. Most Internet traffic was deliberately routed via Turkish or Azerbaijan service providers. Work had almost been completed on a high capacity link with Bulgaria before the invasion.\nThe initial wave of cyber-attacks on the Georgian government infrastructures occurred before the armed conflict. These included ICMP floods and spurious HTTP ‘GET' requests similar to the techniques used in Estonia (Nazario 2008b). Targets included www.president.gov.ge, where images of Adolf Hitler were substituted for pictures of President Saakashvili. A collage of dictators was also placed on the National Bank of the Republic of Georgia's site. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs portal was attacked as were newspaper and media agencies in Georgia and Azerbaijan. Meanwhile, the DDoS attacks were aimed at government sites, including the Parliament and Ministry of Education and Science and the banks. The DDoS statistics gathered during the Georgian attacks were also similar to those for Estonia. Most attacks lasted from 2 to 6 h.\nIntelligence agencies had learned from events in Estonian and were better equipped to monitor the attack patterns against Georgia. Several botnets were involved, including the MachBot controller for an HTTP-based botnet attack coordinated by Russian herders. Many aspects of the attacks in Estonia and Georgia have been linked to the Russian Business Network (RBN) criminal organisation and associated botnets. The accuracy of this claim is understandably difficult to establish, as is the nexus between the founder of the RBN and Russian government agencies. It may be that the RBN provided access to botnet resources without mounting the DDoS attacks; following a ‘business model' that supported their wider activities (Grey Goose 2008). However, it is dangerous to assume that involvement in an attack provides reliable evidence about its coordination (Tikk et al. 2008). At least one of the botnets' command and control servers was located in the USA.\nThere is also evidence that social media was used to support ‘crowdsourcing' similar to that seen in Estonia: “a downloadable script to ping flood Estonian websites (both DNS and IPs) was shared on various Russian language message boards. Instructions on how to ping flood Georgian government websites were also distributed on Russian language websites and\nmessage boards, as well as lists of Georgian sites vulnerable to remote SQL injections, facilitating automatic defacement of them. (Tikk et al. 2008).”\nSQL injections occur because commands written in one language may be hidden inside the instructions of another. If the input is not correctly filtered for embedded command sequences, then these can be inadvertently executed by higher layers of an application. The email addresses of prominent Georgian politicians, academics and industrialists were also distributed. These were used to focus spamming and more targeted forms of attack (Tikk et al. 2008). Major figures had to create new email accounts and re-establish their social networks in a piecemeal fashion, at a time when their attention should have been focused on the invasion.\nThe response to the attacks was coordinated by CERT Georgia. Their analysis of Internet Protocol (IP) data was supported by Estonian, French and Polish counterparts. However, many of the targets of the cyber-attacks simply waited. Normal commercial activities were curtailed by the armed conflict. Some websites mitigated the impact of the attacks by temporarily changing IP addresses. Others used international hosts; Blogspot.com supported Georgian news and government agencies. The websites of the Georgian President and their Ministry of Defence were relocated to a company in Atlanta, GA, USA. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs moved to an Estonian server. These counter-measures had limited effects inside Georgia. Flood attacks on Caucasus Network Tbilisi caused significant bottlenecks exacerbated by damage to network infrastructures inside the war zone; many Georgian Internet connections ran through Russia.\nThese case studies illustrate a complex relation between ICT maturity and the vulnerability to cyber-attacks. The more a nation depends upon networked services, then the more vulnerable it can be to any cyber-incident. The Estonian public relied on the Internet for a host of government and financial services. The impact on Georgia was more limited. Equally, the more a nation depends upon networked services, then the more resilient it will be to any cyber-incident. Less mature nations find it harder to bring their electronic infrastructures back online. In Georgia, the attacks forced the suspension of electronic banking services for 10 days rather than the hours of interruption seen in Estonia.\nIt is difficult to underestimate the psychological impact of a combined attack on both physical and digital infrastructures. Tikk et al. (2008) observe that “while the attacks did not have a permanent or even a long-run devastating effect on the Georgian Internet infrastructure, the damage caused by the attacks was most acutely experienced at the time when Georgia was the most dependent on the availability of their information channels.”\nThe synchronisation of the physical and virtual attacks reinforced the vulnerability of the Georgian government to external forces.\nThe Georgian case study also shows how cyber-conflicts can extend across different social networks. Russian hacking groups were implicated in the initial attacks on Georgian government infrastructures. In contrast, hacking groups inside Georgia also became the targets of cyber-attacks. The www.hacking.ge website was an early victim. This removed a potential source of advice and information about ways to increase the resilience of Georgian networks. Alternatively, it can be seen as part of a direct conflict between hacking/hacking networks in Russia and Georgia. Russian sites also seem to have been the target of secondary attacks, such as that operated by the RIA Novosti news outlet (Nazario 2008c).\nTable 1 has summarised the diverse role that various forms of social networks played in the Georgian attacks. As can be seen, crowdsourcing was used through the distribution of scripts and lists of potential victims. Social networks were also used to distribute information about individuals who were then deliberately the target of spamming attacks. Finally, botnets were used to coordinate DDoS attacks. However, unlike previous case studies, there is evidence to suggest the conflict extended between hacking networks on both sides of the conflict.\n## 6. China, GhostNet, March 2009\nThere are similarities between the first four case studies; the Estonian, Belarusian, Lithuania and Georgian attacks all stemmed from the break-up of the Soviet Union. All four involved politically motivated DDoS attacks supported by the use of criminal botnets. In all four cases, the victims were able to use networks of contacts and sympathisers to recover from the attacks within hours. In contrast, the fifth case study focuses on ‘advanced persistent threats' (Daly 2009). As the term suggests, this form of attack requires greater coordination and planning. APTs also illustrate how a new generation of cyber-threats uses social networks to deliberately focus their attacks on particular individuals. Information about an individual's online contacts can be exploited by ‘socially engineered malware'.\nThis case study focuses on the violation of computers in more than 100 countries. Although the evidence is circumstantial, it seems likely that these attacks were coordinated by groups inside the People's Republic of China as part of the wider policy of active defence (IWM 2009). Subsequent sections of this paper will describe similar techniques exploited by agencies in Europe and North America. However, this case study considers targets in the foreign ministries of Iran, Bangladesh, Latvia, Indonesia, Philippines, Brunei, Barbados and Bhutan; embassies in India, South Korea, Indonesia,\nRomania, Cyprus, Malta, Thailand, Taiwan, Portugal, Germany and Pakistan; the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Secretariat and the Asian Development Bank. The attacks also compromised computers in news organisations and a range of commercial organisations.\nThese attacks seemed to follow a common pattern; a Trojan horse was introduced onto a victim's machine that would then exfiltrate information to control servers, ultimately reporting back to Chinese sources. These data would include information about the victim's social networks that could then be used by spear phishing attacks. Their email account would be used to send a malicious payload to the individuals in their contact list (Nagaraja and Anderson 2009). The success of the approach depended upon convincing the recipient to open the attached document containing the malware. People are far more likely to open an attachment if it comes from a friend or colleague. Once opened, this attachment would compromise the next link in the social network. The terms ‘social malware', ‘social engineering' and ‘spear phishing' describe the use of information about the target's network of contacts. The aim is to increase the plausibility of the email vector. In some cases, legitimate messages were simply reused. In other cases, documents were taken from other compromised machines and then passed to new targets with the embedded malware to increase the probability that they would, in turn, infect their machines.\nThis modus operandi was christened the ‘GhostNet'; it was identified following investigations on behalf of the Office of the Dalai Lama (IWM 2009). Sympathisers were detained by Chinese officials who seemed to have knowledge of their Internet communications. Many sympathisers used Tencent QQ to spread information about the Tibetan cause; this is the most widespread instant messaging service in mainland China. Voice over IP applications might also have been compromised. The Office of the Dalai Lama, therefore, installed network monitoring software to gather additional forensic evidence. They found that infected machines would exchange information with command and control servers -- to download updated versions of the malware and send data out of the local networks: “(This) led to the discovery of four control servers and six command servers ... The control servers were then probed and web-based control interfaces were identified on four control servers, which allowed us to view and control the network. The system was actively monitored for 2 weeks, which allowed us to derive an extensive list of infected systems, and to also monitor the systems operator(s) as the operator(s) specifically instructed target computers. (IWM 2009)”The IP addresses associated with most of these servers were traced to China. Several were located on the island of Hainan, home to the Lingshui signals intelligence facility and the Third Technical Department of the People's Liberation Army. However, other servers were traced to the USA, Sweden, South Korea and Taiwan. This illustrates the complexity of attribution.\nA subsequent analysis of the web servers that were used to coordinate the GhostNet Trojan's undermined arguments that they were maintained by government agencies. Instead, they used QQ instant messaging numbers to trace the sites back to members of the Chinese hacking community (Henderson 2009). These studies concluded that patriotic hacking and cybercrime may have played a role in the development of these attacks (Villeneuve 2010). Further circumstantial evidence of the anti-social networks that connect hacking groups was provided by the reuse of techniques associated with the earlier Enfal Trojan within the Ghostnet attacks. Code seems to have been exchanged between different groups of programmers working with a similar but distinct malware. The case studies in this paper provide parallels between twenty-first century cyber-crime and seventeenth century piracy. They illustrate a privateering model, in which governments authorise private individuals to attack enemies of the state. Further investigations concluded that two or three different groups were using different command and control infrastructures to support multiple forms of attack on opposition groups (IWM 2009, 2010).\nForensic analysis of the GhostNet attacks illustrates the dual nature of social networks in cyber-security. Victims were targeted using spear-phishing techniques that deliberately exploited information about their social networks (Wasserman and Galaskiewicz 1994). Conversely, the perpetrators of the attack were traced by monitoring connections between different groups of attackers, for instance across Baidu: “(these attacks were) to a large degree organised and operated through the misuse of social networking and cloud computing platforms, including Google, Baidu, Yahoo!, and Twitter, in addition to traditional command and control servers ... although we are able to piece together circumstantial evidence that provides the location and possible associations of the attackers, their actual identities and motivations remain illusory. We catch a glimpse of a shadow of attribution in the cloud, in other words, but have no positive identification ... there is a generational shift unfolding in malware networks in multiple dimensions, from what were once primarily simple to increasingly complex, adaptive systems spread across redundant services and platforms, and from criminal and industrial-based exploitation to political, military, and intelligence-focused espionage. (IWM 2010)”\nCloud-based infrastructures and web mail services support these new forms of attack. Free or low-cost hosting services with minimal background checks enable the development of command and control servers that can be used to update malware and coordinate the exfiltration of data. If the security of these servers is compromised, then they can quickly be abandoned at almost no cost. In these circumstances, the Trojans used social networking sites, including Twitter, Google Groups, Blogspot, Baidu Blogs and blog.com accounts, to access links to the new free hosting accounts that replaced the compromised command and control servers (Nazario 2009). As a final resort, the malware could contact more stable servers\nin China; these would then point the malware back to an alternate disposable hosting service reducing the chances of further detection (IWM 2010).\nThe (ab)use of social networking and Cloud infrastructures to implement command and control servers was compounded through the indirection provided by the Tor anonymity network. This technique was mentioned in our third case study; the Cyber Police Unit of the Lithuanian Police found that Tor had been used to disguise the attacks on their government servers. Tor passes communications through various volunteer servers to prevent others from identifying the origin of a message. When researchers monitored unencrypted data leaving the Tor network, they found some of it related to the Dalai Lama's office. Because these messages did not originate from the Office of the Dalai Lama, they concluded that the information was most probably being forwarded to Tor as the attackers tried to disguise the compromised machines (IMW 2010).\nThe GhostNet attacks again illustrate the need to increase links between the field of Ergonomics and cyber-security. Social-media provide significant benefits across a broad range of industries (Manyika, Chui, and Sarrazin 2012). They enable networks of contacts to work together across national borders and between diverse organisations. At the same time, Cloud computing techniques are providing low-cost methods to coordinate distributed work, for instance, through the development of shared, virtual infrastructures. However, these innovations have created new vulnerabilities. Malware now makes use of social media to obtain information about personal contacts. There are then used to propagate spear-phishing attacks where a malicious payload is disguised within email that is deliberately tailored for a recipient within a social network. Similarly, Cloud and web mail infrastructures provide the disposable technologies that enable the rapid development of command and control servers. These are used to upload more recent versions of malware and also to forward data extracted from a victim's machine. They reduce the likelihood of detection because they can be abandoned without cost should an attack be discovered. Table 1 has summarised the role of social networks and their supporting technologies within the GhostNet attacks. A key motivation for writing this paper is to encourage more active research within the field of Ergonomics to increase our resilience to these forms of attack. The solutions are unlikely to be purely technical; these forms of attack undermine the trust of victims in their information infrastructures. Unless more is carried out to make individuals and groups aware of the potential threats, there is a risk that the dark side of the Internet will limit the further development of the digital economy. Many companies now prohibit staff from accessing social media on any device that is used within their networks -- including applications that are specifically intended to support business networks (Markelj and Bernik 2012).\n## W32.STUXNET, March 2010\nThe case studies in this paper provide a spectrum from the mass DDoS attacks that relied on hacktivism and crowdsourcing in Georgia, Estonia, Latvia and Belarus, to the more focussed techniques that were deployed against the social networks of Chinese opposition groups. The final case study argues that Stuxnet had an even narrower focus; attacking a particular group of centrifuges within the Iranian nuclear enrichment programme. Social networks again played an important role in the transmission of this malware. It exploited vulnerabilities in the auto-execution mechanisms associated with removable drives, such as USB sticks. In consequence, Stuxnet quickly infected groups of users, including commercial and government organisations, which shared data and applications (Falliere, Murchu, and Chien 2011). One reason for the successful transmission of the malware was that it took steps to cover its tracks. Code was introduced to delete any malware left on a USB stick after the third infection. Stuxnet again illustrates how computer viruses can propagate across social and professional networks.\nStuxnet also illustrated the exchange of ‘lessons learned' across anti-social networks. It exploited techniques that had previously been used in the Conficker worm. Stuxnet spread across local area networks, exploiting vulnerabilities in the Windows Print Spooler. The virus would also scan infected computers for security software. In some cases, the malware would inject code into trusted processes, including anti-virus programmes. However, if the security product was considered to be resilient to the attack, then no injection would be attempted. Stuxnet used command and control servers, similar to those identified in the Chinese attacks. These were located in Malaysia and Denmark; connection requests were monitored from over 40,000 unique IP addresses in more than 155 countries. When a new machine was infected, the malware would first test connectivity with a valid address, including www.msn.com. If successful, the malware would first download an update of the virus; three different versions have been identified.\nOne of the reasons that Stuxnet was so virulent is that it included a Windows rootkit, providing privileged access to the underlying operating system while at the same time masking the intrusion. It also incorporated four ‘zero-day exploits'. These vulnerabilities in underlying operating systems or network architectures were unknown before the malware was released. The term ‘zero day' indicates that this is the first day when security firms can patch the vulnerability. The number of zero-day attacks in Stuxnet is highly unusual. Using all four at once is wasteful; an attack may be sustained by waiting for the first exploit to be patched before releasing the second and so on.\nThe attack was focussed against Iran's civil nuclear programmes. Between 2006 and 2010, the United Nations passed six resolutions to prevent them from developing the enrichment technologies to produce military grade uranium. For instance, resolution 1803 (March 2008) banned the export of dual use technologies with nuclear applications to Iran. The term ‘dual use' is important because the enrichment process is essential to develop uranium fuel for civil energy generation, but also for nuclear weapons development. Enrichment relies on cascades of centrifuges that produce successively higher concentrations. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) found evidence that Iran had created at least two strings capable of enriching uranium up to 20% by August 2010. Iran had more than 2.5 tons of low-enriched uranium, which was sufficient to support the development of nuclear weapons using existing centrifuges.\nStuxnet targeted the Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) that supervised the Iranian centrifuges. PLCs are not, typically, connected to networks. Instead, they are periodically attached to PCs, and code is downloaded directly onto the controllers. The PLCs are then connected to the centrifuges. In consequence, attackers must first infect the PCs that are used to code the PLCs. Stuxnet focussed on the Siemen's Step 7 PLC programming environment. If Step 7 was not detected on an infected PC, then no actions were taken. If it was detected, then Stuxnet exploited a number of vulnerabilities in the Step 7 environment, including a hard-coded password for its SCADA database. Stuxnet was also able to hook operating system calls to open project files associated with the Siemens application. However, it did not infect all of the Step 7 data. It was only interested in projects that had been used or accessed within the previous three and a half years.\nStuxnet monitored, replaced and disguised blocks of Step 7 code being written to PLCs. In order to do this, the malware had to forge the digital signatures that were used to authenticate drivers in the malicious binaries. These were maintained by two Taiwanese companies, which seem to have been the victims of conventional or physical industrial espionage (Matrosov et al. 2010). This is reminiscent of the Georgian case study where the cyber-attack coincident with a physical invasion. In Stuxnet, the cyber-attack was supported by convention forms of espionage.\nOnce the malicious code had made the jump from the PCs to the PLCs, it monitored the frequency of the motors attached to the centrifuge. It only attacked systems that operated at frequencies between 807 and 1210 Hz. The malware then triggered a state machine to control the sabotage. After an initial delay of some 13 days, Stuxnet set the maximum frequency to 1410 Hz; 27 days later, this was changed to 2 Hz and then 1064 Hz before the sequence was repeated. The malware acted like a landmine; the intention was not to kill the victim, but to consume finite resources of time and expertise. By analogy, the intention was not to destroy the centrifuges, but to waste the Iranian engineering resources as teams of workers had to repair affected components and identify the source of the problems. The IAEA reported signs of damage to around 900 centrifuges during the period when Stuxnet was active. However, independent studies suggest that Iran was able to increase uranium enrichment in spite of this cyber-attack (Amarelo 2011). They were resilient to the cyber-attack, just as the victims were in our previous case studies. One interpretation of this conflicting evidence is that Iranian authorities deliberately exaggerated the impact of the malware to create the impression that greater damage had been inflicted on their nuclear programmes.\nThe sophistication of Stuxnet suggests that it was developed by a network of engineers. Not only did they require a detailed knowledge of the Step 7 environment, but they also needed access to specialist hardware. The malicious payload focused on PLCs using a particular Central Processing Unit; 6ES7-315-2 (series 300). The malware monitored the PLCs' Profibus communications processors looking for frequency converters manufactured by Fararo Paya in Iran and Vacon in Finland. The range of technical skills required by this cyber-attack strongly suggests that Stuxnet was created by a team or network of developers. Stuxnet would have taken from 5 to 30 people around 6 months to prepare (Falliere, Murchu, and Chien 2011). It is remarkable that Stuxnet did not affect any of the registered users for the Step 7 environment. Hence, the development team may have included security agencies as well as representatives of the companies that might otherwise have been affected by the attack. However, this speculation does not preclude the possibility that a small group of committed individuals acted together to create the malware with or without state encouragement.\nSome commentators have argued that the preoccupation with Iranian centrifuges has masked the real purpose of the Stuxnet virus (Gaycken 2010). The attacks can be seen as the first field test of a targeted cyber-attack. The widespread dissemination of the virus violated many different systems, but the damage was highly focussed on a very small number of specialist devices. In this interpretation, the real purpose of Stuxnet was to reveal how future cyber-weapons could go beyond the mass DDoS of earlier attacks. In contrast to ‘hacktivist' crowdsourcing in Estonia, Lithuania, Georgia and Belarus, the GhostNet and Stuxnet cyber-attacks required relatively small networks of specialists working together to exploit common features of our everyday working environments -- ranging from USB sticks to social networks and Cloud infrastructures.\n## Summary of the use of social media in cyber-attacks\nThere are many motivations for a closer engagement between the field of Ergonomics and cyber-security. First, it is important that human factors specialists have a better understanding of the underlying causes of security threats. Cyber-\nErgonomics\nsecurity will have an increasing impact on working lives. It is not simply the high-profile security breaches that affect major public and private institutions, but also the everyday irritation created by spam and the continual need to maintain anti-viral systems. Second, it is essential that Ergonomists play a more active role in designing our defences. At present, we are faced with a bewildering array of firewalls, passwords and access control mechanisms that frustrate our working tasks and, as we have seen, provide limited protection against emerging threats. Third, in order to understand the threat posed by recent generations of malware, it is important to understand core concepts within the field of Ergonomics. It is important to understand that social networks support new forms of attack, for instance helping hackers exchange successful techniques. Social networks can also increase resilience, bringing together technical support in the aftermath of an attack. There remains significant work to be carried out – both in inhibiting the growth of anti-social networks and promoting the interactions that will help us recover from future threats.\nFigure 1 provides an overview of the roles that social networking plays in cyber-attacks. The Estonian, Georgian and Lithuanian case studies show that crowd-sourcing supports DDoS attacks, by exchanging malware and lists of potential targets between groups of sympathisers. Social networking provided patriotic groups with both the motivation and technical direction to implement the attacks. In these incidents, the attribution problem was complicated because it is impossible to determine whether state intervention sustained the groups who launched the attacks.\nSecond, governments can exploit informal links with anti-social criminal networks during cyber-attacks. In particular, they can make use of criminal resources to attack third-party infrastructures. Russian botnets played an important part in the Belarus case study. The use of existing criminal networks hides state intervention. The attribution problem is complicated because botnets exploit various forms of indirection to mask command and control infrastructures. This is only one example of the social networks that support cyber-attacks. Malware is often exchanged between criminal networks who reuse techniques exposing previous vulnerabilities. Stuxnet exploited vulnerabilities in the IP exploited by Conficker.\nSocial networks have also been used to infer inter-personal relationships that can then be exploited by malware, for example using spear phishing techniques. The recipient is more likely to open an infected attachment or link if it has been\nFigure 1. Different stages in the use of social networking for cyber-attacks.\nC.W. Johnson\nsent from a trusted source. The Chinese case studies have shown that politically motivated attacks, therefore, draw heavily on identity theft in wider areas of cyber-crime. Intelligence agencies now routinely monitor interactions over social media (IWM 2009).\nFinally, I have shown how the infrastructures associated with social networking create disposable architectures to coordinate attacks, for example through the development of command and control servers used by Stuxnet. The ubiquitous nature of these architectures makes it difficult to determine who owns and operates the servers. Similarly, the use of anonymity servers in the Lithuanian and GhostNet attacks shows how systems that support confidential interaction also support the dark side of the Internet.\n# 9. A roadmap for social media in cyber defence\nThis paper provides a roadmap for future resilience to the abuse of social media in cyber-attacks. I have identified existing threats – for example through crowdsourcing in DDoS attacks and through the social monitoring that directs spear phishing. I have also identified ways in which social networks can help organisations resist and recover from attacks. For instance, I have seen how the Estonian media identified Internet groups that were encouraging participation in a cyber-attack on Lithuania (stages 1 and 2 in Figure 1). In consequence, the national CERT alerted government agencies. However, organisations that had not registered with their Computer Emergency Response Team did not receive the warning. This illustrates the continuing need to develop networks for the dissemination of the best practices to increase resilience against future cyber-threats.\nFigure 2 presents our roadmap for the use of social media in mitigating the threat of cyber-attacks. It is more complex than the overview of social media in previous security incidents, illustrated in Figure 1. This is because the first diagram was based on evidence drawn from the case studies presented in this paper, using the action-based methodology from the opening sections. Figure 2 is more tentative. I have hypothesised the ways in which social media might increase resilience to future attacks. The roadmap is intended as a starting point. In particular, the diagram must be refined in response to new threats. Previous sections have described how malware exploits technologies that originally supported a wide range of end-user tasks. For instance, Cloud-based file-stores and web mail services provide flexible, virtual information infrastructures. These same technologies have also been used to create disposable command and control infrastructures. If we cannot develop a more sophisticated appreciation of the security risks that stem from the abuse of future infrastructures, then we will continue to react as cyber-attacks evolve to exploit new vulnerabilities.\nThe first element of the roadmap in Figure 2 focuses on the monitoring of social media. This can be broken down into a number of concerns. Monitoring provides advanced warning of hacktivism, especially when 'politically motivated' cyberattacks reuse infrastructures that support conventional forms of cyber-crime, including identity theft. The reuse of botnets\nFigure 2. Roadmap for the use of social networking for cyber defence.\nand many of the zero-day exploits described in previous sections were discussed on social media before they were used on political targets. Our work reiterates the need for intelligence agencies to identify intersections between political groups and the wider population of cyber-criminals using social network analysis tools.\nThe second stage of the road map reinforces links with existing security management systems through risk assessment for cyber defence. Risk assessment is important because, at present, it is not performed in an organised or systematic way by many of the potential targets of cyber-attacks. Public--private networks have been used by many states as a cost-effective means of encouraging commercial and public bodies to increase their resilience to future attacks. Companies and government agencies are encouraged to work together in developing contingency plans based on the risk assessments that identify potential cyber-threats. Unfortunately, this approach has not worked very well (Johnson 2012). Many companies have been enthusiastic participants. Many others have abstained. Even those that were initially enthusiastic have not sustained their interest.\nSocial networking provides one means of addressing these concerns. For example, the UK government is promoting Warning, Advice and Reporting Points; see www.warp.gov.uk. These groups use electronic resources to send personalised warnings and advice across a network of members. Each WARP focuses on a particular community with similar security requirements; ‘Their purpose is to provide a specific community with the capability to share security related information -- both problems and solutions -- and thereby to develop more secure and responsive environments'. The third element of the road map, therefore, focuses on the use of social media to disseminate early warnings about potential cyber-attacks.\nIssuing community warning about future attacks provides limited benefits unless they are accompanied by appropriate actions. Drills and exercises help to audit the resilience provided by these mechanisms. Too often, these drills assume perfect conditions for CERTs and other state agencies to respond to potential attacks. However, the Georgian invasion shows that cyber-incidents coincide with adverse circumstances. By developing wider communities of interest in cyber-security, by encouraging participation in drills and exercises, we can also obtain evidence of vulnerabilities and the consequences of future attacks that provide persuasive data to encourage wider participation in these initiatives.\nThe penultimate stage in the roadmap focuses on the use of social networks in forensic analysis after an attack has occurred (Johnson, in press). At present, it is extremely difficult to detect the early stages of an attack. A range of network monitoring companies, mostly located in the USA, provide detailed information on connectivity failures in the aftermath of DDoS attacks. However, CERTs cannot use these post hoc studies to trigger a more active response once an attack is underway. Greater benefits could be derived from research into the particular patterns that have characterised the initial stages of previous attacks, for example using abnormal Border Gateway Protocol events. The real-time identification of an attack is not simply a technical exercise but requires input from a range of different experts given the costs and consequences that are associated with false alarms. Closing down an infrastructure in case an attack may occur requires operational, managerial and regulatory expertise.\nThe final stage of the roadmap for using social media to increase resilience to cyber-attacks focuses on the identification and dissemination of lessons learned. At present, this remains an ad hoc process (He and Johnson 2012). Many stakeholders remain ignorant of the extent of previous attacks, especially outside their own national borders. Further problems arise when vested interests exaggerate the impact of cyber-attacks; this alienates engineering staff who play a vital role in implementing potential mitigations. As we have seen, reports that cyber-attacks will ‘bring a nation to its knees' cannot be justified on the evidence of previous incidents.\nArguably, the greatest vulnerability identified in our work has been the difficulty that managers and operators have in obtaining clear information about previous attacks. Strong contrasts can be drawn between the lack of information in this and the plethora of accident and incident reports published across safety-related industries. Of course, it can be argued that the wider dissemination of this information might encourage future attacks. However, this argument ignores the anti-social networks that have already sprung up to disseminate the technical information that can be used to launch future attacks.\n## Conclusions and further work\nThis paper provides a new perspective on the wider topics addressed in this special issue looking beyond human-centred automation. The aim has been to identify threats to human--machine interaction in multi-layered networks. Previous sections have argued that the growing complexity of socio-technical systems and the interpenetration of formerly separate systems via IT infrastructures create new opportunities for social interaction. It also creates new vulnerabilities.\nSocial networks have motivated individuals to participate in mass Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. They have disseminated information and provided resources, including lists of targets and malicious code. Second, political groups have launched attacks using infrastructures that are normally associated with wider forms of cyber-crime, including botnets. Third, I have shown how information about an individual's social networks has helped to target spear phishing. Malware is, typically, disguised in a document that was intercepted from a colleague or friend. The recipient is more likely to open an\nC.W. Johnson\nTable 2.

Finally, I have shown how the development of Cloud infrastructures and social networking applications has created disposable architectures for the command and control servers that coordinate malware attacks. The ubiquitous and distributed nature of these architectures makes it increasingly difficult to determine who owns and operates these systems. I have gone on to identify a roadmap for the defensive measures that might be used to minimise the future threats from the 'dark side' of social networking. Several of our case studies have illustrated the 'social resilience' of communications infrastructures; victims have been able to crowd-source support from overseas governments, from civil liberties groups and from sympathisers around the globe as they seek to recover from the immediate aftermath of a cyber-attack.\nTable 2 shows that the case studies were motivated by political conflict and that none had the long-term impact many fear will be the consequence of state-sponsored cyber-attacks. There are many reasons for this – most incidents affected information systems that could quickly be restored once an attack had been diagnosed. Stuxnet is a notable exception because it deliberately damaged physical systems. Even here, the Iranian authorities were able to resume enrichment activities after a relatively short period of time. However, past resilience is no basis for future complacency. This paper has shown how cyber-attacks continue to evolve. Technical innovations, intended to increase productivity and support interaction, are easily adapted to support the dark side of the Internet.\n## Acknowledgements\nThe author would like to thank the editors and reviewers of this special edition for their valuable encouragement and for feedback on early versions of this paper.

First, social networks motivate individuals to participate in Distributed Denial of Service attacks by providing malware and identifying potential targets. Second, attackers use an individual’s social network to focus attacks, through spear phishing. Recipients are more likely to open infected attachments when they come from a trusted source.

Introduction\nThis paper identifies threats to human–machine interaction in the multi-layered networks that are at the heart of this special issue. The growing complexity of socio-technical systems and the interpenetration of formerly separate systems via IT infrastructures create new opportunities for social interaction. It also creates new vulnerabilities. In particular, this paper considers the role that social networking has played in the ‘attribution problem’. This term describes the difficulty in determining who is responsible for a cyber-attack. Social networks describe interconnections between individuals and groups that change over time. These relationships may be based on family ties, sexual relationships, employment, etc. However, the interconnections can also motivate groups to launch mass cyber-attacks on common targets, whether they are multi-national corporations or government agencies. It is difficult for commercial and government organisations to monitor these connections and hence predict the groups who are likely to become involved in mass cyber-attacks. One reason for this is that state agencies are using ‘social media’ to encourage and sustain networks of hactivists that are behind many cyber-attacks. Social media are Internet-based applications that allow for the generation and dissemination of user-generated content. As we shall see, these applications provide mechanisms for the dissemination and control of malware. I also show how these techniques support forms of indirection that make it difficult to identify explicit state responsibility for many cyber-attacks over the last decade.\nAt first sight, it might seem that this topic is tangential to many of the mainstream interests within the field of Ergonomics. In contrast, I will argue that it is increasingly important to understand not only the positive role that social networks play in work and leisure but it is also equally necessary to understand how these phenomena may also be abused to support criminal activity. The following pages also explain why so much of our working lives continue to be devoted to filtering the thousands of spam emails that are generated by botnets. A botnet can be thought of as a number of interacting programmes communicating across a network of compromised machines; the term is formed from the conjunction of ‘robotic’ ‘networks’.\nSocial networking hinders the attribution of cyber-attacks in four different ways. First, social networks have helped to ‘crowd source’ the participants in an attack. They have motivated individuals to participate in mass Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. They have provided the code needed to launch DDoS and have published information on potential targets. Second, attackers have used information about an individual’s social networks to compromise security measures. For example, information about the friends and colleagues of a target can be obtained from social networks. This enables ‘spear phishing’; a recipient is more likely to open an infected attachment or link if it has been sent from a trusted participant in their social network. Third, I show how the information infrastructures that are associated with some forms of social\n© 2013 Taylor &amp; Francis\nC.W. Johnson\nnetworking create disposable architectures for command and control servers to coordinate malware attacks. Finally, governments have tolerated and even encouraged the growth of anti-social criminal networks that are later used to launch attacks on political targets, for instance, using botnets. Table 1 summarises the different roles that social media have played in the case studies that are presented in this paper. Before introducing the incidents that are included within this study, it is first important to present the methodological background to our work.\n# 1.1 Methodological interactions from action research to case-study approach\nResearch of this nature raises a host of methodological problems. Several authors have recently pioneered the use of human factors techniques to identify security threats and vulnerabilities. For instance, Kraemer, Carayon, and Clem (2009) used focus groups of IT security professionals to identify the individual and organisational causes of vulnerabilities. Shaw (2006) reviews the empirical evidence that supports the role of behavioural consultants within investigative teams looking at the potential role of insiders within particular attacks. However, neither of these studies considers the detailed role of individual and organisational human factors in state-sponsored cyber-attacks. Very few previous studies consider the wider national context of threats that extend beyond individual organisations. Many of the techniques that have been conventionally applied in Ergonomics cannot easily be used to analyse social aspects of state-sponsored cyber-crime. This is an important caveat given that cyber-attacks have an increasing impact on the working lives of many people. Empirical studies and laboratory investigations yield useful insights into individual behaviours; however, Dantzker and Hunter (2000) summarise the problems that arise when interpreting the results of studies that are intended to analyse criminal behaviour. Further criticisms stem from the limited insights that such studies provide into the group interactions (Dixona and Thebergeb 2011), which are at the heart of this paper.\nAction research provides an alternative perspective (Lewin 1946). It builds on the idea that complex social interactions cannot be studied by focussing on the isolated behaviours of particular individuals. In contrast, more situated studies provide a view of the impact of change on society. Action research provides tools to investigate changes and their effects while overcoming researchers' 'self-imposed distance from the world of action' (Dash 1999). These techniques are entirely appropriate within the context of this paper because the area of cyber-security is in constant flux. The role of social networks as a mechanism for launching attacks continues to adapt, for example, in response to new security mechanisms.\nAction research is not the only methodological approach that might be used to support this work; Blichfeldt and Andersen (2006) identify a continuum from Yin's (1994) hypothetical-deductive case-study techniques to Glaser and Strauss' (1967) notion of grounded theory. Yin's techniques assume that investigators will directly intervene in the working context, whereas Glaser and Strauss promote a more observational approach. The work reported in the following sections has been derived using action-based techniques as part of initiatives to increase the resilience of national and international infrastructures. I acknowledge that these involvements may bias our work in a positivist way. Equally active involvement helps to establish the relationships needed before access is granted to forensic evidence (Johnson 2012). Rather than focussing on these positivist interventions, the following sections draw more on the case-study methodologies associated with Yin. The intention is to provide an overview of recent incidents – not only to support our theories on the roles that social networking plays in the 'attribution problem' but also to provide readers with an overview of the causes and consequences of cyber-incidents that are an increasing threat across many different industries.\nThe methodology adopted in this work was to conduct a series of interviews with members of government organisations, including military and intelligence agencies, in the countries affected by the attacks. These were confidential, given the nature of the events under discussion. The questions focused on the probable causes of the attacks and also the consequences for government infrastructures. The initial insights provided by these meetings were validated by subsequent\nTable 1.

Telecommunications companies were asked about the resilience of their systems and where possible to provide access to technical data about the connectivity of their networks over time. I also consulted critical infrastructure providers, including air traffic management organisations and financial service companies. In many cases, the impact of state-sponsored cyber-attacks was less severe than might have been assumed. In other cases, a lack of forensic expertise exacerbated recovery. It is important to stress that our aim was to survey the use of social networks in state-sponsored cyber-attacks, rather than to follow a rigid methodology. I had limited opportunities to contact the intended targets of Stuxnet inside Iran and the victims of Ghostnet. Instead, I relied on sources within NATO to assess the impact of these attacks. The inclusion of both incidents within the paper is justified because they mark key developments in state-sponsored, offensive capabilities.\n## Estonia, April--May 2007\nThe first case study focuses on a series of cyber-attacks that were directed against Estonia during April and May 2007. There are earlier examples of coordinated threats; for instance, the US government identified the ‘Titan Rain' attacks on companies, such as Lockheed Martin, national laboratories, including Sandia, and military targets, such as the Redstone Arsenal before 2003. Attackers from the Netherlands successfully compromised some 34 US defence sites in 1990.\nThe probable causes of the Estonian case study can be traced back to tensions between ethnic Estonians and Russians following the Second World War. After independence, many ethnic Russians were left without any form of citizenship. More immediate triggers included a decision to move the Bronze Soldier of Tallinn. This war memorial had become a focus for clashes between Estonians and Russian nationalists. The subsequent riots left one person dead and 150 injured. Some argued that the statue was a symbol of the Soviet occupation of Estonia, whereas others believed that it was a memorial to the Russians who fought against Nazi occupation (Tikk 2009).\nIt is possible to distinguish several different phases in this incident. An initial emotional/physical stage was closely tied to the riots around the Bronze Soldier. A series of website defacements then took place, but these were then superseded by a third phase in which DDoS attacks were launched (Tikk 2009). The rapid development of digital communications during the moves towards independence between 1988 and 1991 arguably placed Estonia at greater risk from such cyber-attacks. At the time of the attack, some 97% of all Estonian bank transactions were made online, 65% of the population were classified as ‘active users' of the Internet and 80% of the population had national identity cards that supported digital signatures. A number of different DDoS mechanisms were used. These included Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) floods launched by individuals. The aim was to overwhelm a server and stop it responding to legitimate requests. The Estonian attacks also included the use of botnets. A botnet is a network of private computers infected with malware, and they are controlled as a group typically without the owners' knowledge.\nArbor Networks identified more than 120 different attacks over a 3-week period; these included “a decent sized botnet behind the attack, with aggregate bandwidth at our points of measurement maxing out at nearly 100 Mbps ... All in all, someone is very, very deliberate in putting the hurt on Estonia, and this kind of thing is only going to get more severe in the coming years. (Nazario 2007)”\nHowever, most of the attacks (100 of the 120) were simple ICMP floods. Four involved more sophisticated approaches where TCP connection requests were sent faster than the recipient could process them. Most of the targets were government websites, especially the Ministry of Finance (35 of 128). Most attacks lasted less than an hour, but seven went on for more than 10 h.\nThe impact on the working lives of the Estonian public has been overestimated. For instance, a Chatham House report argued: “The severity and length of the attacks directed at one of NATO's most electronically connected members put the alliance on guard. If a highly wired small state could be brought to its knees by a well-orchestrated Internet-based attack, then what type of havoc could be wrought upon larger states with more heterogeneous systems and critical infrastructure open to attack? (Hughes 2008)”\nEstonia's two largest banks, Hansapank and SEB Eesti Ühispank, were attacked several times between 9 and 15 May. However, the effects were very limited. Hansapank's e-banking service had to be shut down for up to 2 h on 9 and 10 May. SEB Eesti Ühispank's online banking service was down for a similar period on 15 May. The banks mitigated the impact of the attacks by, for instance, limiting access to customers outside of Estonia. Three major Internet service providers -- Elion Ettevõtted, Elisa Andmesideteenused and Starman -- came under DDoS attacks (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010). The Zone.ee web hosting service provider and directory service provider (ee.ee) were attacked, but in each case their services were restored relatively quickly. The US Computer Emergency Readiness Team (CERT) assessment concluded that although this was a ‘watershed' attack, it was not ‘revolutionary' in terms of the scale or sophistication of the techniques that were used (Waterman 2007).\nThe Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Paet accused the Kremlin of involvement in the cyber-attacks. However, there was no direct evidence to link the DDoS with any state agencies. In contrast, the Estonian attacks provide an early example of ‘crowdsourcing'. Digital infrastructures were used to encourage hacktivist participation. The incidents have been compared with a ‘cyber-riot' rather than a well-coordinated attack (The Economist 2007). The term ‘patriotic hacking' describes attacks performed by a group of people who take action ‘pro patria' in cases where they believe that this is the right thing for their government to do or where they perceive the government as unable to do ‘the right thing' (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010). Political activists protested by engaging in coordinated cyber-attacks against the online presence and Internet infrastructure of Estonia. The activities of disaffected individuals provided opportunities for ‘plausible deniability' by a range of state agencies that might otherwise stand accused of coordinating the attacks.\nNATO members considered the wider implications of the attacks on Estonia, leading to the development of the Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) in 2008. This organisation is not funded directly by NATO but by the supporting member states. CCDCOE provides a meeting place for military experts, scientists, lawyers and politicians. It also publishes technical reports on emerging cyber threats and provides ‘white papers' on policy decisions including the development of international legal frameworks to clarify the response to future attacks, in particular when it is not possible to identify whether a state organisation is responsible for a threat.\nTable 1 has summarised the use of social media in the Estonian case study. As can be seen, social networks were used to crowd-source participation in the DDoS attacks. Malware was distributed through Internet sites that also provided lists of potential targets. It is important to stress that the participants in this attack were not simply the individuals usually associated with hacking but included a far broader spectrum including members of the public who were opposed to what they viewed as the suppression of minority rights in the aftermath of Estonian independence (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010).\n## Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty, April 2008\nThe second case study focuses on the role that botnets and other forms of ‘anti-social' networking played on cyber-attacks against Radio Svaboda, the Belarusian service of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL). These radio stations were established during the Cold War and had been the target of direct physical attacks, including a poisoning attempt associated with the Czechoslovak intelligence service and a car bomb, linked to the Romanian government. However, the cyber-attacks can be linked to political tensions inside Belarus. Many independent observers criticised the electoral processes used by President Alexander Lukashenka to extend his tenure in 1996 and 2004. There were limited opportunities to voice criticisms within Belarus. During 2008, a Statute on Mass Media extended the state monopoly of Internet Service Provision. Beltelekom was able to restrict access to sites that criticised the administration, including those operated by Radio Svaboda.\nDuring the morning of 26 April 2008, the Radio Svaboda web servers were subjected to a DDoS attack (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010). These attacks seem to have been launched by the government supporters to prevent Radio Svaboda from covering popular protests on the 22nd anniversary of the Chernobyl accident, which occurred on the borders of Belarus and the Ukraine. Many people were unhappy about the lack of compensation for those affected by the accident. Others were angered by the administration's support for the Belarus civil nuclear programme.\nThis analysis does not explain why the cyber-attacks also affected a number of other RFL/RE servers, including those for Kosovo, Azerbaijan, Tatar-Bashkir and Radio Farda in Iran. These additional attacks were arguably intended to obfuscate the attribution of the DDoS on Radio Svaboda. However, motivation and opportunity cannot be used as surrogates for more direct evidence of official involvement. Several organisations argued that Russian DDoS botnets were involved in the attacks (Nazario 2008a). These ‘anti-social' networks were also used to coordinate attacks on a wider range of opposition media sites. These included Charter 97, an English language news site on political activities in Belarus; BelPartyzan, a local news website and the Russian language information sites, legis-group.ru and compromat.net.\nThe botnets used in the Belarus DDoS attacks were normally used for criminal activities; in particular to generate spam and phishing emails. The blurred boundary between cyber-crime and state-sponsored cyber-attacks is a feature of many case studies in this paper (Nazario 2008a, 2008b, 2008c). Government agencies provide implicit support for criminal groups, who develop the infrastructures to support future attacks. However, the links are informal. Criminal groups may act for patriotic reasons or to ensure continued implicit state approval; in either case, it seems clear that anti-social networks have been forged between state agencies and cyber-attackers (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010; Johnson 2012).\nThe RFE/RL case study also illustrates the resilience of information infrastructures. The cyber-attacks did not bring the services ‘to their knees'. Several local websites in Belarus offered to carry content for RFE/RL before they could recover. By 28 April, most of the RFL/RE sites had been restored with significant improvements in their security infrastructures. The Radio Svaboda site administrators were also able to gain technical support from communities around the globe. In particular, help was received from several groups interested in maintaining the freedom of expression across the Internet. This provides a precursor to the collective action seen during the ‘Arab Spring' of 2011. The uprisings and unrest in Algeria,\nBahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Syria, Tunisia and Yemen were all influenced by the use of social media. Attempts by many states to disrupt Internet communications did not prevent opposition groups from disseminating messages using externally hosted sites. The attacks on RFE/RL provide an early example of the ‘social resilience' of communications infrastructures in response to cyber-attacks.\nThe Estonian case study showed that social networks could be used to coordinate cyber-attacks using crowd-sourcing techniques in response to political conflict. In contrast, Table 1 has shown that hacktivism was not a significant part of the cyber-attacks on RFE/RL. In contrast, DDoS attacks were launched by criminal botnets used to generate spam messages with an obvious impact on working lives around the globe. State agencies did not close down these anti-social networks, arguably, because they knew they could be recruited to launch cyber-attacks without the need to implicate government information infrastructures. Previous ergonomic studies tend to focus on the symptoms associated with these botnets, in terms of the impact of nuisance messages. Very few have considered the criminal and political context that sustains the dark side of the Internet.\n## 4. Lithuania, June 2008\nThe cyber-attacks on Estonia and Lithuania both had their roots in the tensions that arose following the break-up of the Soviet bloc. The right-wing Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats introduced a series of amendments to prohibit the public display of Soviet or Nazi insignia and were subsequently elected to power in November 2008. This created the background for conflict as the Russian Federation began to reassert influence on the Baltic states (Pääbo 2008). The immediate passage of the amendments did not seem to trigger the same level of hostility in the local Russian population, as had been observed amongst ethnic Russians in Estonia (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010). However, President Medvedev joined with the Belarusian President Lukashenka to express the Russian Federation's concern over the legislation. There were simultaneous protests outside the Lithuanian embassy in Moscow accompanied by a significant number of cyber-attacks. Some 300 websites were defaced by anti-Lithuanian slogans and by pro-Soviet symbols that would have been banned under the 2008 amendments.\nThe attacks were first detected on 28 June, peaking between 17:00 and 18:00 EET on Sunday 29 June. Companies and government websites were targeted ranging from the Lithuanian equivalent of the Securities and Exchange Commission to the web portal for the Lithuanian Social Democratic Party. By 2 July, most of the sites were able to resume normal operation.\nAfter independence, successive governments had encouraged the development of information infrastructures across Lithuanian, for instance through the Information Society Development Programme. Almost half of all households possessed a computer at the time of the attack, and one-third of government organisations had a web presence. However, companies suffered the most. The Lithuanian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-LT) had warned government agencies on a list of ‘at-risk' organisations after an Estonian TV channel had reported the possibility of a cyber-attack on 26 July. Commercial organisations did not receive the warning because they had not been included on the initial list. CERTs have been established by governments around the globe to increase resilience to cyber-attacks. The Lithuanian CERT had been established around 18 months before the web servers were defaced.\nThe Lithuanian attacks show how CERTs can develop networks of potential targets to ensure that warnings are propagated to at-risk organisations. This case study also illustrates the need for government agencies to actively monitor social media for intelligence about potential attacks and for forensic information in the aftermath of a cyber-incident. CERT-LT traced most of the targets back to Hostex, one of the largest web hosting services in Lithuania. The forensic analysis showed that once the vulnerability had been identified, all Hostex users were targeted. CERT-LT assisted the Hostex engineers as they worked to mitigate the effects of the attacks. The modes of attack resemble those used in both Estonia and Belarus. Initial reports focused on vulnerabilities in PHP servers that were then used to run a series of scripts distributed amongst a small group of attackers. However, other modes of attack included the generation of large amounts of spam email linking to ‘Hackers United against External Threats to Russia', which resembled the use of botnets in the previous case studies (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010).\nCERT-LT and RRT, the Lithuanian communications regulatory authority, identified the use of proxy servers to the East. It seemed “likely that the attacks were organised in advance, considering the fact that signals, invitations, and agitation were spread on the Internet prior to the attacks. However, the RRT refused to speak of any particular countries as the initiator of the attack. (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010)” Subsequent analysis identified compromised hosts in France and Sweden as possible sources for the defacement attacks suggesting that they had been planned in advance. However, as in Belarus, the Lithuanian attacks might also have used servers that had already been violated for other cyber-crime activities.\nCircumstantial evidence for the involvement of Russian hacking groups is provided by discussions on Internet forums, such as hack-wars.ru. However, direct proof was difficult to obtain. For example, the Cyber Police Unit of the Lithuanian Police argued that the attackers had used the Tor ‘onion routing' protocols. Tor is used by journalists, whistle-blowers and law enforcement agencies to prevent monitoring of Internet traffic. It relies on ‘onion routing'; this refers to the use of encryption at multiple layers of a communication network. The Lithuanian attacks illustrate a number of common themes across many of the incidents in this paper. Attribution was complicated by the lack of direct evidence for state involvement and by the participation of ‘hacking groups' communicating over Internet forums and social media.\n## Georgia, August 2008\nThe fourth case study forms part of the armed conflict between Georgia and the Russian Federation over Ossetia. Although this region straddles the Caucasian mountains, North Ossetia was ceded to the Soviet Union, whereas the area south of the mountains became part of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic (GSSR). Fighting broke out between Georgian forces and South Ossetia (1991--1992) and then in Abkhazia (1992--1994). In consequence, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) formed a peacekeeping force in 1992 with troops from Russia, Georgia and South Ossetia. The composition of this peacekeeping force did little to reduce animosity between the various factions (European Commission 2009). This was exacerbated by Moscow's concern when the Bush administration provided assistance for the Georgian forces to clear Chechen fighters from the Pankisi valley. By April 2008, large-scale military exercises were being conducted on both sides of the border. Fighter aircraft and UAVs began to patrol ‘demilitarised' areas.\nOn 7 August 2008, Georgian forces attacked the town of Tskhinvali and surrounding areas in response to an alleged Russian invasion. By 8 August, the Russian air force was attacking infrastructures, targets included Tbilisi airport radar, railroad junctions and telecommunications facilities. By 10 August, the Georgian Government declared a unilateral ceasefire and announced its intention to withdraw Georgian forces from South Ossetia. By 11 August, Russian troops had crossed the boundaries of Ossetia and entered a number of Georgian towns. On 12 August, French President Sarkozy travelled to Moscow and Tiblisi, representing the European Council. He proposed a six-point peace plan that ultimately led to a ceasefire. By 22 August, Russian troops had withdrawn from their positions beyond the former boundaries of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.\nThe most obvious difference with Estonia and Lithuania is that the Georgian cyber-attacks coincided with a physical offensive. The effects were also different. More than 50% of the Estonian population were active users of the Internet. In contrast, this figure was close to 30% in Lithuania but only 10% in Georgia. However, the impact on Georgia was greater because most of their information infrastructures passed through the Russian territory (Zmijewski 2008). Georgia was aware of these communication vulnerabilities and wanted to develop trade opportunities with the EU. Most Internet traffic was deliberately routed via Turkish or Azerbaijan service providers. Work had almost been completed on a high capacity link with Bulgaria before the invasion.\nThe initial wave of cyber-attacks on the Georgian government infrastructures occurred before the armed conflict. These included ICMP floods and spurious HTTP ‘GET' requests similar to the techniques used in Estonia (Nazario 2008b). Targets included www.president.gov.ge, where images of Adolf Hitler were substituted for pictures of President Saakashvili. A collage of dictators was also placed on the National Bank of the Republic of Georgia's site. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs portal was attacked as were newspaper and media agencies in Georgia and Azerbaijan. Meanwhile, the DDoS attacks were aimed at government sites, including the Parliament and Ministry of Education and Science and the banks. The DDoS statistics gathered during the Georgian attacks were also similar to those for Estonia. Most attacks lasted from 2 to 6 h.\nIntelligence agencies had learned from events in Estonian and were better equipped to monitor the attack patterns against Georgia. Several botnets were involved, including the MachBot controller for an HTTP-based botnet attack coordinated by Russian herders. Many aspects of the attacks in Estonia and Georgia have been linked to the Russian Business Network (RBN) criminal organisation and associated botnets. The accuracy of this claim is understandably difficult to establish, as is the nexus between the founder of the RBN and Russian government agencies. It may be that the RBN provided access to botnet resources without mounting the DDoS attacks; following a ‘business model' that supported their wider activities (Grey Goose 2008). However, it is dangerous to assume that involvement in an attack provides reliable evidence about its coordination (Tikk et al. 2008). At least one of the botnets' command and control servers was located in the USA.\nThere is also evidence that social media was used to support ‘crowdsourcing' similar to that seen in Estonia: “a downloadable script to ping flood Estonian websites (both DNS and IPs) was shared on various Russian language message boards. Instructions on how to ping flood Georgian government websites were also distributed on Russian language websites and\nmessage boards, as well as lists of Georgian sites vulnerable to remote SQL injections, facilitating automatic defacement of them. (Tikk et al. 2008).”\nSQL injections occur because commands written in one language may be hidden inside the instructions of another. If the input is not correctly filtered for embedded command sequences, then these can be inadvertently executed by higher layers of an application. The email addresses of prominent Georgian politicians, academics and industrialists were also distributed. These were used to focus spamming and more targeted forms of attack (Tikk et al. 2008). Major figures had to create new email accounts and re-establish their social networks in a piecemeal fashion, at a time when their attention should have been focused on the invasion.\nThe response to the attacks was coordinated by CERT Georgia. Their analysis of Internet Protocol (IP) data was supported by Estonian, French and Polish counterparts. However, many of the targets of the cyber-attacks simply waited. Normal commercial activities were curtailed by the armed conflict. Some websites mitigated the impact of the attacks by temporarily changing IP addresses. Others used international hosts; Blogspot.com supported Georgian news and government agencies. The websites of the Georgian President and their Ministry of Defence were relocated to a company in Atlanta, GA, USA. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs moved to an Estonian server. These counter-measures had limited effects inside Georgia. Flood attacks on Caucasus Network Tbilisi caused significant bottlenecks exacerbated by damage to network infrastructures inside the war zone; many Georgian Internet connections ran through Russia.\nThese case studies illustrate a complex relation between ICT maturity and the vulnerability to cyber-attacks. The more a nation depends upon networked services, then the more vulnerable it can be to any cyber-incident. The Estonian public relied on the Internet for a host of government and financial services. The impact on Georgia was more limited. Equally, the more a nation depends upon networked services, then the more resilient it will be to any cyber-incident. Less mature nations find it harder to bring their electronic infrastructures back online. In Georgia, the attacks forced the suspension of electronic banking services for 10 days rather than the hours of interruption seen in Estonia.\nIt is difficult to underestimate the psychological impact of a combined attack on both physical and digital infrastructures. Tikk et al. (2008) observe that “while the attacks did not have a permanent or even a long-run devastating effect on the Georgian Internet infrastructure, the damage caused by the attacks was most acutely experienced at the time when Georgia was the most dependent on the availability of their information channels.”\nThe synchronisation of the physical and virtual attacks reinforced the vulnerability of the Georgian government to external forces.\nThe Georgian case study also shows how cyber-conflicts can extend across different social networks. Russian hacking groups were implicated in the initial attacks on Georgian government infrastructures. In contrast, hacking groups inside Georgia also became the targets of cyber-attacks. The www.hacking.ge website was an early victim. This removed a potential source of advice and information about ways to increase the resilience of Georgian networks. Alternatively, it can be seen as part of a direct conflict between hacking/hacking networks in Russia and Georgia. Russian sites also seem to have been the target of secondary attacks, such as that operated by the RIA Novosti news outlet (Nazario 2008c).\nTable 1 has summarised the diverse role that various forms of social networks played in the Georgian attacks. As can be seen, crowdsourcing was used through the distribution of scripts and lists of potential victims. Social networks were also used to distribute information about individuals who were then deliberately the target of spamming attacks. Finally, botnets were used to coordinate DDoS attacks. However, unlike previous case studies, there is evidence to suggest the conflict extended between hacking networks on both sides of the conflict.\n## 6. China, GhostNet, March 2009\nThere are similarities between the first four case studies; the Estonian, Belarusian, Lithuania and Georgian attacks all stemmed from the break-up of the Soviet Union. All four involved politically motivated DDoS attacks supported by the use of criminal botnets. In all four cases, the victims were able to use networks of contacts and sympathisers to recover from the attacks within hours. In contrast, the fifth case study focuses on ‘advanced persistent threats' (Daly 2009). As the term suggests, this form of attack requires greater coordination and planning. APTs also illustrate how a new generation of cyber-threats uses social networks to deliberately focus their attacks on particular individuals. Information about an individual's online contacts can be exploited by ‘socially engineered malware'.\nThis case study focuses on the violation of computers in more than 100 countries. Although the evidence is circumstantial, it seems likely that these attacks were coordinated by groups inside the People's Republic of China as part of the wider policy of active defence (IWM 2009). Subsequent sections of this paper will describe similar techniques exploited by agencies in Europe and North America. However, this case study considers targets in the foreign ministries of Iran, Bangladesh, Latvia, Indonesia, Philippines, Brunei, Barbados and Bhutan; embassies in India, South Korea, Indonesia,\nRomania, Cyprus, Malta, Thailand, Taiwan, Portugal, Germany and Pakistan; the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Secretariat and the Asian Development Bank. The attacks also compromised computers in news organisations and a range of commercial organisations.\nThese attacks seemed to follow a common pattern; a Trojan horse was introduced onto a victim's machine that would then exfiltrate information to control servers, ultimately reporting back to Chinese sources. These data would include information about the victim's social networks that could then be used by spear phishing attacks. Their email account would be used to send a malicious payload to the individuals in their contact list (Nagaraja and Anderson 2009). The success of the approach depended upon convincing the recipient to open the attached document containing the malware. People are far more likely to open an attachment if it comes from a friend or colleague. Once opened, this attachment would compromise the next link in the social network. The terms ‘social malware', ‘social engineering' and ‘spear phishing' describe the use of information about the target's network of contacts. The aim is to increase the plausibility of the email vector. In some cases, legitimate messages were simply reused. In other cases, documents were taken from other compromised machines and then passed to new targets with the embedded malware to increase the probability that they would, in turn, infect their machines.\nThis modus operandi was christened the ‘GhostNet'; it was identified following investigations on behalf of the Office of the Dalai Lama (IWM 2009). Sympathisers were detained by Chinese officials who seemed to have knowledge of their Internet communications. Many sympathisers used Tencent QQ to spread information about the Tibetan cause; this is the most widespread instant messaging service in mainland China. Voice over IP applications might also have been compromised. The Office of the Dalai Lama, therefore, installed network monitoring software to gather additional forensic evidence. They found that infected machines would exchange information with command and control servers -- to download updated versions of the malware and send data out of the local networks: “(This) led to the discovery of four control servers and six command servers ... The control servers were then probed and web-based control interfaces were identified on four control servers, which allowed us to view and control the network. The system was actively monitored for 2 weeks, which allowed us to derive an extensive list of infected systems, and to also monitor the systems operator(s) as the operator(s) specifically instructed target computers. (IWM 2009)”The IP addresses associated with most of these servers were traced to China. Several were located on the island of Hainan, home to the Lingshui signals intelligence facility and the Third Technical Department of the People's Liberation Army. However, other servers were traced to the USA, Sweden, South Korea and Taiwan. This illustrates the complexity of attribution.\nA subsequent analysis of the web servers that were used to coordinate the GhostNet Trojan's undermined arguments that they were maintained by government agencies. Instead, they used QQ instant messaging numbers to trace the sites back to members of the Chinese hacking community (Henderson 2009). These studies concluded that patriotic hacking and cybercrime may have played a role in the development of these attacks (Villeneuve 2010). Further circumstantial evidence of the anti-social networks that connect hacking groups was provided by the reuse of techniques associated with the earlier Enfal Trojan within the Ghostnet attacks. Code seems to have been exchanged between different groups of programmers working with a similar but distinct malware. The case studies in this paper provide parallels between twenty-first century cyber-crime and seventeenth century piracy. They illustrate a privateering model, in which governments authorise private individuals to attack enemies of the state. Further investigations concluded that two or three different groups were using different command and control infrastructures to support multiple forms of attack on opposition groups (IWM 2009, 2010).\nForensic analysis of the GhostNet attacks illustrates the dual nature of social networks in cyber-security. Victims were targeted using spear-phishing techniques that deliberately exploited information about their social networks (Wasserman and Galaskiewicz 1994). Conversely, the perpetrators of the attack were traced by monitoring connections between different groups of attackers, for instance across Baidu: “(these attacks were) to a large degree organised and operated through the misuse of social networking and cloud computing platforms, including Google, Baidu, Yahoo!, and Twitter, in addition to traditional command and control servers ... although we are able to piece together circumstantial evidence that provides the location and possible associations of the attackers, their actual identities and motivations remain illusory. We catch a glimpse of a shadow of attribution in the cloud, in other words, but have no positive identification ... there is a generational shift unfolding in malware networks in multiple dimensions, from what were once primarily simple to increasingly complex, adaptive systems spread across redundant services and platforms, and from criminal and industrial-based exploitation to political, military, and intelligence-focused espionage. (IWM 2010)”\nCloud-based infrastructures and web mail services support these new forms of attack. Free or low-cost hosting services with minimal background checks enable the development of command and control servers that can be used to update malware and coordinate the exfiltration of data. If the security of these servers is compromised, then they can quickly be abandoned at almost no cost. In these circumstances, the Trojans used social networking sites, including Twitter, Google Groups, Blogspot, Baidu Blogs and blog.com accounts, to access links to the new free hosting accounts that replaced the compromised command and control servers (Nazario 2009). As a final resort, the malware could contact more stable servers\nin China; these would then point the malware back to an alternate disposable hosting service reducing the chances of further detection (IWM 2010).\nThe (ab)use of social networking and Cloud infrastructures to implement command and control servers was compounded through the indirection provided by the Tor anonymity network. This technique was mentioned in our third case study; the Cyber Police Unit of the Lithuanian Police found that Tor had been used to disguise the attacks on their government servers. Tor passes communications through various volunteer servers to prevent others from identifying the origin of a message. When researchers monitored unencrypted data leaving the Tor network, they found some of it related to the Dalai Lama's office. Because these messages did not originate from the Office of the Dalai Lama, they concluded that the information was most probably being forwarded to Tor as the attackers tried to disguise the compromised machines (IMW 2010).\nThe GhostNet attacks again illustrate the need to increase links between the field of Ergonomics and cyber-security. Social-media provide significant benefits across a broad range of industries (Manyika, Chui, and Sarrazin 2012). They enable networks of contacts to work together across national borders and between diverse organisations. At the same time, Cloud computing techniques are providing low-cost methods to coordinate distributed work, for instance, through the development of shared, virtual infrastructures. However, these innovations have created new vulnerabilities. Malware now makes use of social media to obtain information about personal contacts. There are then used to propagate spear-phishing attacks where a malicious payload is disguised within email that is deliberately tailored for a recipient within a social network. Similarly, Cloud and web mail infrastructures provide the disposable technologies that enable the rapid development of command and control servers. These are used to upload more recent versions of malware and also to forward data extracted from a victim's machine. They reduce the likelihood of detection because they can be abandoned without cost should an attack be discovered. Table 1 has summarised the role of social networks and their supporting technologies within the GhostNet attacks. A key motivation for writing this paper is to encourage more active research within the field of Ergonomics to increase our resilience to these forms of attack. The solutions are unlikely to be purely technical; these forms of attack undermine the trust of victims in their information infrastructures. Unless more is carried out to make individuals and groups aware of the potential threats, there is a risk that the dark side of the Internet will limit the further development of the digital economy. Many companies now prohibit staff from accessing social media on any device that is used within their networks -- including applications that are specifically intended to support business networks (Markelj and Bernik 2012).\n## W32.STUXNET, March 2010\nThe case studies in this paper provide a spectrum from the mass DDoS attacks that relied on hacktivism and crowdsourcing in Georgia, Estonia, Latvia and Belarus, to the more focussed techniques that were deployed against the social networks of Chinese opposition groups. The final case study argues that Stuxnet had an even narrower focus; attacking a particular group of centrifuges within the Iranian nuclear enrichment programme. Social networks again played an important role in the transmission of this malware. It exploited vulnerabilities in the auto-execution mechanisms associated with removable drives, such as USB sticks. In consequence, Stuxnet quickly infected groups of users, including commercial and government organisations, which shared data and applications (Falliere, Murchu, and Chien 2011). One reason for the successful transmission of the malware was that it took steps to cover its tracks. Code was introduced to delete any malware left on a USB stick after the third infection. Stuxnet again illustrates how computer viruses can propagate across social and professional networks.\nStuxnet also illustrated the exchange of ‘lessons learned' across anti-social networks. It exploited techniques that had previously been used in the Conficker worm. Stuxnet spread across local area networks, exploiting vulnerabilities in the Windows Print Spooler. The virus would also scan infected computers for security software. In some cases, the malware would inject code into trusted processes, including anti-virus programmes. However, if the security product was considered to be resilient to the attack, then no injection would be attempted. Stuxnet used command and control servers, similar to those identified in the Chinese attacks. These were located in Malaysia and Denmark; connection requests were monitored from over 40,000 unique IP addresses in more than 155 countries. When a new machine was infected, the malware would first test connectivity with a valid address, including www.msn.com. If successful, the malware would first download an update of the virus; three different versions have been identified.\nOne of the reasons that Stuxnet was so virulent is that it included a Windows rootkit, providing privileged access to the underlying operating system while at the same time masking the intrusion. It also incorporated four ‘zero-day exploits'. These vulnerabilities in underlying operating systems or network architectures were unknown before the malware was released. The term ‘zero day' indicates that this is the first day when security firms can patch the vulnerability. The number of zero-day attacks in Stuxnet is highly unusual. Using all four at once is wasteful; an attack may be sustained by waiting for the first exploit to be patched before releasing the second and so on.\nThe attack was focussed against Iran's civil nuclear programmes. Between 2006 and 2010, the United Nations passed six resolutions to prevent them from developing the enrichment technologies to produce military grade uranium. For instance, resolution 1803 (March 2008) banned the export of dual use technologies with nuclear applications to Iran. The term ‘dual use' is important because the enrichment process is essential to develop uranium fuel for civil energy generation, but also for nuclear weapons development. Enrichment relies on cascades of centrifuges that produce successively higher concentrations. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) found evidence that Iran had created at least two strings capable of enriching uranium up to 20% by August 2010. Iran had more than 2.5 tons of low-enriched uranium, which was sufficient to support the development of nuclear weapons using existing centrifuges.\nStuxnet targeted the Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) that supervised the Iranian centrifuges. PLCs are not, typically, connected to networks. Instead, they are periodically attached to PCs, and code is downloaded directly onto the controllers. The PLCs are then connected to the centrifuges. In consequence, attackers must first infect the PCs that are used to code the PLCs. Stuxnet focussed on the Siemen's Step 7 PLC programming environment. If Step 7 was not detected on an infected PC, then no actions were taken. If it was detected, then Stuxnet exploited a number of vulnerabilities in the Step 7 environment, including a hard-coded password for its SCADA database. Stuxnet was also able to hook operating system calls to open project files associated with the Siemens application. However, it did not infect all of the Step 7 data. It was only interested in projects that had been used or accessed within the previous three and a half years.\nStuxnet monitored, replaced and disguised blocks of Step 7 code being written to PLCs. In order to do this, the malware had to forge the digital signatures that were used to authenticate drivers in the malicious binaries. These were maintained by two Taiwanese companies, which seem to have been the victims of conventional or physical industrial espionage (Matrosov et al. 2010). This is reminiscent of the Georgian case study where the cyber-attack coincident with a physical invasion. In Stuxnet, the cyber-attack was supported by convention forms of espionage.\nOnce the malicious code had made the jump from the PCs to the PLCs, it monitored the frequency of the motors attached to the centrifuge. It only attacked systems that operated at frequencies between 807 and 1210 Hz. The malware then triggered a state machine to control the sabotage. After an initial delay of some 13 days, Stuxnet set the maximum frequency to 1410 Hz; 27 days later, this was changed to 2 Hz and then 1064 Hz before the sequence was repeated. The malware acted like a landmine; the intention was not to kill the victim, but to consume finite resources of time and expertise. By analogy, the intention was not to destroy the centrifuges, but to waste the Iranian engineering resources as teams of workers had to repair affected components and identify the source of the problems. The IAEA reported signs of damage to around 900 centrifuges during the period when Stuxnet was active. However, independent studies suggest that Iran was able to increase uranium enrichment in spite of this cyber-attack (Amarelo 2011). They were resilient to the cyber-attack, just as the victims were in our previous case studies. One interpretation of this conflicting evidence is that Iranian authorities deliberately exaggerated the impact of the malware to create the impression that greater damage had been inflicted on their nuclear programmes.\nThe sophistication of Stuxnet suggests that it was developed by a network of engineers. Not only did they require a detailed knowledge of the Step 7 environment, but they also needed access to specialist hardware. The malicious payload focused on PLCs using a particular Central Processing Unit; 6ES7-315-2 (series 300). The malware monitored the PLCs' Profibus communications processors looking for frequency converters manufactured by Fararo Paya in Iran and Vacon in Finland. The range of technical skills required by this cyber-attack strongly suggests that Stuxnet was created by a team or network of developers. Stuxnet would have taken from 5 to 30 people around 6 months to prepare (Falliere, Murchu, and Chien 2011). It is remarkable that Stuxnet did not affect any of the registered users for the Step 7 environment. Hence, the development team may have included security agencies as well as representatives of the companies that might otherwise have been affected by the attack. However, this speculation does not preclude the possibility that a small group of committed individuals acted together to create the malware with or without state encouragement.\nSome commentators have argued that the preoccupation with Iranian centrifuges has masked the real purpose of the Stuxnet virus (Gaycken 2010). The attacks can be seen as the first field test of a targeted cyber-attack. The widespread dissemination of the virus violated many different systems, but the damage was highly focussed on a very small number of specialist devices. In this interpretation, the real purpose of Stuxnet was to reveal how future cyber-weapons could go beyond the mass DDoS of earlier attacks. In contrast to ‘hacktivist' crowdsourcing in Estonia, Lithuania, Georgia and Belarus, the GhostNet and Stuxnet cyber-attacks required relatively small networks of specialists working together to exploit common features of our everyday working environments -- ranging from USB sticks to social networks and Cloud infrastructures.\n## Summary of the use of social media in cyber-attacks\nThere are many motivations for a closer engagement between the field of Ergonomics and cyber-security. First, it is important that human factors specialists have a better understanding of the underlying causes of security threats. Cyber-\nErgonomics\nsecurity will have an increasing impact on working lives. It is not simply the high-profile security breaches that affect major public and private institutions, but also the everyday irritation created by spam and the continual need to maintain anti-viral systems. Second, it is essential that Ergonomists play a more active role in designing our defences. At present, we are faced with a bewildering array of firewalls, passwords and access control mechanisms that frustrate our working tasks and, as we have seen, provide limited protection against emerging threats. Third, in order to understand the threat posed by recent generations of malware, it is important to understand core concepts within the field of Ergonomics. It is important to understand that social networks support new forms of attack, for instance helping hackers exchange successful techniques. Social networks can also increase resilience, bringing together technical support in the aftermath of an attack. There remains significant work to be carried out – both in inhibiting the growth of anti-social networks and promoting the interactions that will help us recover from future threats.\nFigure 1 provides an overview of the roles that social networking plays in cyber-attacks. The Estonian, Georgian and Lithuanian case studies show that crowd-sourcing supports DDoS attacks, by exchanging malware and lists of potential targets between groups of sympathisers. Social networking provided patriotic groups with both the motivation and technical direction to implement the attacks. In these incidents, the attribution problem was complicated because it is impossible to determine whether state intervention sustained the groups who launched the attacks.\nSecond, governments can exploit informal links with anti-social criminal networks during cyber-attacks. In particular, they can make use of criminal resources to attack third-party infrastructures. Russian botnets played an important part in the Belarus case study. The use of existing criminal networks hides state intervention. The attribution problem is complicated because botnets exploit various forms of indirection to mask command and control infrastructures. This is only one example of the social networks that support cyber-attacks. Malware is often exchanged between criminal networks who reuse techniques exposing previous vulnerabilities. Stuxnet exploited vulnerabilities in the IP exploited by Conficker.\nSocial networks have also been used to infer inter-personal relationships that can then be exploited by malware, for example using spear phishing techniques. The recipient is more likely to open an infected attachment or link if it has been\nFigure 1. Different stages in the use of social networking for cyber-attacks.\nC.W. Johnson\nsent from a trusted source. The Chinese case studies have shown that politically motivated attacks, therefore, draw heavily on identity theft in wider areas of cyber-crime. Intelligence agencies now routinely monitor interactions over social media (IWM 2009).\nFinally, I have shown how the infrastructures associated with social networking create disposable architectures to coordinate attacks, for example through the development of command and control servers used by Stuxnet. The ubiquitous nature of these architectures makes it difficult to determine who owns and operates the servers. Similarly, the use of anonymity servers in the Lithuanian and GhostNet attacks shows how systems that support confidential interaction also support the dark side of the Internet.\n# 9. A roadmap for social media in cyber defence\nThis paper provides a roadmap for future resilience to the abuse of social media in cyber-attacks. I have identified existing threats – for example through crowdsourcing in DDoS attacks and through the social monitoring that directs spear phishing. I have also identified ways in which social networks can help organisations resist and recover from attacks. For instance, I have seen how the Estonian media identified Internet groups that were encouraging participation in a cyber-attack on Lithuania (stages 1 and 2 in Figure 1). In consequence, the national CERT alerted government agencies. However, organisations that had not registered with their Computer Emergency Response Team did not receive the warning. This illustrates the continuing need to develop networks for the dissemination of the best practices to increase resilience against future cyber-threats.\nFigure 2 presents our roadmap for the use of social media in mitigating the threat of cyber-attacks. It is more complex than the overview of social media in previous security incidents, illustrated in Figure 1. This is because the first diagram was based on evidence drawn from the case studies presented in this paper, using the action-based methodology from the opening sections. Figure 2 is more tentative. I have hypothesised the ways in which social media might increase resilience to future attacks. The roadmap is intended as a starting point. In particular, the diagram must be refined in response to new threats. Previous sections have described how malware exploits technologies that originally supported a wide range of end-user tasks. For instance, Cloud-based file-stores and web mail services provide flexible, virtual information infrastructures. These same technologies have also been used to create disposable command and control infrastructures. If we cannot develop a more sophisticated appreciation of the security risks that stem from the abuse of future infrastructures, then we will continue to react as cyber-attacks evolve to exploit new vulnerabilities.\nThe first element of the roadmap in Figure 2 focuses on the monitoring of social media. This can be broken down into a number of concerns. Monitoring provides advanced warning of hacktivism, especially when 'politically motivated' cyberattacks reuse infrastructures that support conventional forms of cyber-crime, including identity theft. The reuse of botnets\nFigure 2. Roadmap for the use of social networking for cyber defence.\nand many of the zero-day exploits described in previous sections were discussed on social media before they were used on political targets. Our work reiterates the need for intelligence agencies to identify intersections between political groups and the wider population of cyber-criminals using social network analysis tools.\nThe second stage of the road map reinforces links with existing security management systems through risk assessment for cyber defence. Risk assessment is important because, at present, it is not performed in an organised or systematic way by many of the potential targets of cyber-attacks. Public--private networks have been used by many states as a cost-effective means of encouraging commercial and public bodies to increase their resilience to future attacks. Companies and government agencies are encouraged to work together in developing contingency plans based on the risk assessments that identify potential cyber-threats. Unfortunately, this approach has not worked very well (Johnson 2012). Many companies have been enthusiastic participants. Many others have abstained. Even those that were initially enthusiastic have not sustained their interest.\nSocial networking provides one means of addressing these concerns. For example, the UK government is promoting Warning, Advice and Reporting Points; see www.warp.gov.uk. These groups use electronic resources to send personalised warnings and advice across a network of members. Each WARP focuses on a particular community with similar security requirements; ‘Their purpose is to provide a specific community with the capability to share security related information -- both problems and solutions -- and thereby to develop more secure and responsive environments'. The third element of the road map, therefore, focuses on the use of social media to disseminate early warnings about potential cyber-attacks.\nIssuing community warning about future attacks provides limited benefits unless they are accompanied by appropriate actions. Drills and exercises help to audit the resilience provided by these mechanisms. Too often, these drills assume perfect conditions for CERTs and other state agencies to respond to potential attacks. However, the Georgian invasion shows that cyber-incidents coincide with adverse circumstances. By developing wider communities of interest in cyber-security, by encouraging participation in drills and exercises, we can also obtain evidence of vulnerabilities and the consequences of future attacks that provide persuasive data to encourage wider participation in these initiatives.\nThe penultimate stage in the roadmap focuses on the use of social networks in forensic analysis after an attack has occurred (Johnson, in press). At present, it is extremely difficult to detect the early stages of an attack. A range of network monitoring companies, mostly located in the USA, provide detailed information on connectivity failures in the aftermath of DDoS attacks. However, CERTs cannot use these post hoc studies to trigger a more active response once an attack is underway. Greater benefits could be derived from research into the particular patterns that have characterised the initial stages of previous attacks, for example using abnormal Border Gateway Protocol events. The real-time identification of an attack is not simply a technical exercise but requires input from a range of different experts given the costs and consequences that are associated with false alarms. Closing down an infrastructure in case an attack may occur requires operational, managerial and regulatory expertise.\nThe final stage of the roadmap for using social media to increase resilience to cyber-attacks focuses on the identification and dissemination of lessons learned. At present, this remains an ad hoc process (He and Johnson 2012). Many stakeholders remain ignorant of the extent of previous attacks, especially outside their own national borders. Further problems arise when vested interests exaggerate the impact of cyber-attacks; this alienates engineering staff who play a vital role in implementing potential mitigations. As we have seen, reports that cyber-attacks will ‘bring a nation to its knees' cannot be justified on the evidence of previous incidents.\nArguably, the greatest vulnerability identified in our work has been the difficulty that managers and operators have in obtaining clear information about previous attacks. Strong contrasts can be drawn between the lack of information in this and the plethora of accident and incident reports published across safety-related industries. Of course, it can be argued that the wider dissemination of this information might encourage future attacks. However, this argument ignores the anti-social networks that have already sprung up to disseminate the technical information that can be used to launch future attacks.\n## Conclusions and further work\nThis paper provides a new perspective on the wider topics addressed in this special issue looking beyond human-centred automation. The aim has been to identify threats to human--machine interaction in multi-layered networks. Previous sections have argued that the growing complexity of socio-technical systems and the interpenetration of formerly separate systems via IT infrastructures create new opportunities for social interaction. It also creates new vulnerabilities.\nSocial networks have motivated individuals to participate in mass Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. They have disseminated information and provided resources, including lists of targets and malicious code. Second, political groups have launched attacks using infrastructures that are normally associated with wider forms of cyber-crime, including botnets. Third, I have shown how information about an individual's social networks has helped to target spear phishing. Malware is, typically, disguised in a document that was intercepted from a colleague or friend. The recipient is more likely to open an\nC.W. Johnson\nTable 2.

Finally, I have shown how the development of Cloud infrastructures and social networking applications has created disposable architectures for the command and control servers that coordinate malware attacks. The ubiquitous and distributed nature of these architectures makes it increasingly difficult to determine who owns and operates these systems. I have gone on to identify a roadmap for the defensive measures that might be used to minimise the future threats from the 'dark side' of social networking. Several of our case studies have illustrated the 'social resilience' of communications infrastructures; victims have been able to crowd-source support from overseas governments, from civil liberties groups and from sympathisers around the globe as they seek to recover from the immediate aftermath of a cyber-attack.\nTable 2 shows that the case studies were motivated by political conflict and that none had the long-term impact many fear will be the consequence of state-sponsored cyber-attacks. There are many reasons for this – most incidents affected information systems that could quickly be restored once an attack had been diagnosed. Stuxnet is a notable exception because it deliberately damaged physical systems. Even here, the Iranian authorities were able to resume enrichment activities after a relatively short period of time. However, past resilience is no basis for future complacency. This paper has shown how cyber-attacks continue to evolve. Technical innovations, intended to increase productivity and support interaction, are easily adapted to support the dark side of the Internet.\n## Acknowledgements\nThe author would like to thank the editors and reviewers of this special edition for their valuable encouragement and for feedback on early versions of this paper.

Johnson*\nSchool of Computing Science, University of Glasgow, Glasgow G12 8RZ, UK\n(Received 5 December 2012; final version received 2 June 2013)\nWe identify four roles that social networking plays in the ‘attribution problem’, which obscures whether or not cyber-attacks were state-sponsored. First, social networks motivate individuals to participate in Distributed Denial of Service attacks by providing malware and identifying potential targets. Second, attackers use an individual’s social network to focus attacks, through spear phishing. Recipients are more likely to open infected attachments when they come from a trusted source. Third, social networking infrastructures create disposable architectures to coordinate attacks through command and control servers. The ubiquitous nature of these architectures makes it difficult to determine who owns and operates the servers. Finally, governments recruit anti-social criminal networks to launch attacks on third-party infrastructures using botnets. The closing sections identify a roadmap to increase resilience against the ‘dark side’ of social networking.\n**Practitioner Summary**: This paper provides readers with an overview of state-sponsored cyber-attacks. I show how many of these threats have exploited social networks and social media. The aim was to alert practitioners to the dark side of computing, where attackers learn to exploit new interaction techniques and new forms of working.\n**Keywords**: cyber defence; national critical infrastructures; software security\n# 1. Introduction\nThis paper identifies threats to human–machine interaction in the multi-layered networks that are at the heart of this special issue. The growing complexity of socio-technical systems and the interpenetration of formerly separate systems via IT infrastructures create new opportunities for social interaction. It also creates new vulnerabilities. In particular, this paper considers the role that social networking has played in the ‘attribution problem’. This term describes the difficulty in determining who is responsible for a cyber-attack. Social networks describe interconnections between individuals and groups that change over time. These relationships may be based on family ties, sexual relationships, employment, etc. However, the interconnections can also motivate groups to launch mass cyber-attacks on common targets, whether they are multi-national corporations or government agencies. It is difficult for commercial and government organisations to monitor these connections and hence predict the groups who are likely to become involved in mass cyber-attacks. One reason for this is that state agencies are using ‘social media’ to encourage and sustain networks of hactivists that are behind many cyber-attacks. Social media are Internet-based applications that allow for the generation and dissemination of user-generated content. As we shall see, these applications provide mechanisms for the dissemination and control of malware. I also show how these techniques support forms of indirection that make it difficult to identify explicit state responsibility for many cyber-attacks over the last decade.\nAt first sight, it might seem that this topic is tangential to many of the mainstream interests within the field of Ergonomics. In contrast, I will argue that it is increasingly important to understand not only the positive role that social networks play in work and leisure but it is also equally necessary to understand how these phenomena may also be abused to support criminal activity. The following pages also explain why so much of our working lives continue to be devoted to filtering the thousands of spam emails that are generated by botnets. A botnet can be thought of as a number of interacting programmes communicating across a network of compromised machines; the term is formed from the conjunction of ‘robotic’ ‘networks’.\nSocial networking hinders the attribution of cyber-attacks in four different ways. First, social networks have helped to ‘crowd source’ the participants in an attack. They have motivated individuals to participate in mass Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. They have provided the code needed to launch DDoS and have published information on potential targets. Second, attackers have used information about an individual’s social networks to compromise security measures. For example, information about the friends and colleagues of a target can be obtained from social networks. This enables ‘spear phishing’; a recipient is more likely to open an infected attachment or link if it has been sent from a trusted participant in their social network. Third, I show how the information infrastructures that are associated with some forms of social\n© 2013 Taylor &amp; Francis\nC.W. Johnson\nnetworking create disposable architectures for command and control servers to coordinate malware attacks. Finally, governments have tolerated and even encouraged the growth of anti-social criminal networks that are later used to launch attacks on political targets, for instance, using botnets. Table 1 summarises the different roles that social media have played in the case studies that are presented in this paper. Before introducing the incidents that are included within this study, it is first important to present the methodological background to our work.\n# 1.1 Methodological interactions from action research to case-study approach\nResearch of this nature raises a host of methodological problems. Several authors have recently pioneered the use of human factors techniques to identify security threats and vulnerabilities. For instance, Kraemer, Carayon, and Clem (2009) used focus groups of IT security professionals to identify the individual and organisational causes of vulnerabilities. Shaw (2006) reviews the empirical evidence that supports the role of behavioural consultants within investigative teams looking at the potential role of insiders within particular attacks. However, neither of these studies considers the detailed role of individual and organisational human factors in state-sponsored cyber-attacks. Very few previous studies consider the wider national context of threats that extend beyond individual organisations. Many of the techniques that have been conventionally applied in Ergonomics cannot easily be used to analyse social aspects of state-sponsored cyber-crime. This is an important caveat given that cyber-attacks have an increasing impact on the working lives of many people. Empirical studies and laboratory investigations yield useful insights into individual behaviours; however, Dantzker and Hunter (2000) summarise the problems that arise when interpreting the results of studies that are intended to analyse criminal behaviour. Further criticisms stem from the limited insights that such studies provide into the group interactions , which are at the heart of this paper.\nAction research provides an alternative perspective . It builds on the idea that complex social interactions cannot be studied by focussing on the isolated behaviours of particular individuals. In contrast, more situated studies provide a view of the impact of change on society. Action research provides tools to investigate changes and their effects while overcoming researchers' 'self-imposed distance from the world of action' . These techniques are entirely appropriate within the context of this paper because the area of cyber-security is in constant flux. The role of social networks as a mechanism for launching attacks continues to adapt, for example, in response to new security mechanisms.\nAction research is not the only methodological approach that might be used to support this work; Blichfeldt and Andersen (2006) identify a continuum from Yin's (1994) hypothetical-deductive case-study techniques to Glaser and Strauss' (1967) notion of grounded theory. Yin's techniques assume that investigators will directly intervene in the working context, whereas Glaser and Strauss promote a more observational approach. The work reported in the following sections has been derived using action-based techniques as part of initiatives to increase the resilience of national and international infrastructures. I acknowledge that these involvements may bias our work in a positivist way. Equally active involvement helps to establish the relationships needed before access is granted to forensic evidence . Rather than focussing on these positivist interventions, the following sections draw more on the case-study methodologies associated with Yin. The intention is to provide an overview of recent incidents – not only to support our theories on the roles that social networking plays in the 'attribution problem' but also to provide readers with an overview of the causes and consequences of cyber-incidents that are an increasing threat across many different industries.\nThe methodology adopted in this work was to conduct a series of interviews with members of government organisations, including military and intelligence agencies, in the countries affected by the attacks. These were confidential, given the nature of the events under discussion. The questions focused on the probable causes of the attacks and also the consequences for government infrastructures. The initial insights provided by these meetings were validated by subsequent\nTable 1.

Telecommunications companies were asked about the resilience of their systems and where possible to provide access to technical data about the connectivity of their networks over time. I also consulted critical infrastructure providers, including air traffic management organisations and financial service companies. In many cases, the impact of state-sponsored cyber-attacks was less severe than might have been assumed. In other cases, a lack of forensic expertise exacerbated recovery. It is important to stress that our aim was to survey the use of social networks in state-sponsored cyber-attacks, rather than to follow a rigid methodology. I had limited opportunities to contact the intended targets of Stuxnet inside Iran and the victims of Ghostnet. Instead, I relied on sources within NATO to assess the impact of these attacks. The inclusion of both incidents within the paper is justified because they mark key developments in state-sponsored, offensive capabilities.\n## Estonia, April--May 2007\nThe first case study focuses on a series of cyber-attacks that were directed against Estonia during April and May 2007. There are earlier examples of coordinated threats; for instance, the US government identified the ‘Titan Rain' attacks on companies, such as Lockheed Martin, national laboratories, including Sandia, and military targets, such as the Redstone Arsenal before 2003. Attackers from the Netherlands successfully compromised some 34 US defence sites in 1990.\nThe probable causes of the Estonian case study can be traced back to tensions between ethnic Estonians and Russians following the Second World War. After independence, many ethnic Russians were left without any form of citizenship. More immediate triggers included a decision to move the Bronze Soldier of Tallinn. This war memorial had become a focus for clashes between Estonians and Russian nationalists. The subsequent riots left one person dead and 150 injured. Some argued that the statue was a symbol of the Soviet occupation of Estonia, whereas others believed that it was a memorial to the Russians who fought against Nazi occupation .\nIt is possible to distinguish several different phases in this incident. An initial emotional/physical stage was closely tied to the riots around the Bronze Soldier. A series of website defacements then took place, but these were then superseded by a third phase in which DDoS attacks were launched . The rapid development of digital communications during the moves towards independence between 1988 and 1991 arguably placed Estonia at greater risk from such cyber-attacks. At the time of the attack, some 97% of all Estonian bank transactions were made online, 65% of the population were classified as ‘active users' of the Internet and 80% of the population had national identity cards that supported digital signatures. A number of different DDoS mechanisms were used. These included Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) floods launched by individuals. The aim was to overwhelm a server and stop it responding to legitimate requests. The Estonian attacks also included the use of botnets. A botnet is a network of private computers infected with malware, and they are controlled as a group typically without the owners' knowledge.\nArbor Networks identified more than 120 different attacks over a 3-week period; these included “a decent sized botnet behind the attack, with aggregate bandwidth at our points of measurement maxing out at nearly 100 Mbps ... All in all, someone is very, very deliberate in putting the hurt on Estonia, and this kind of thing is only going to get more severe in the coming years. ”\nHowever, most of the attacks (100 of the 120) were simple ICMP floods. Four involved more sophisticated approaches where TCP connection requests were sent faster than the recipient could process them. Most of the targets were government websites, especially the Ministry of Finance (35 of 128). Most attacks lasted less than an hour, but seven went on for more than 10 h.\nThe impact on the working lives of the Estonian public has been overestimated. For instance, a Chatham House report argued: “The severity and length of the attacks directed at one of NATO's most electronically connected members put the alliance on guard. If a highly wired small state could be brought to its knees by a well-orchestrated Internet-based attack, then what type of havoc could be wrought upon larger states with more heterogeneous systems and critical infrastructure open to attack? ”\nEstonia's two largest banks, Hansapank and SEB Eesti Ühispank, were attacked several times between 9 and 15 May. However, the effects were very limited. Hansapank's e-banking service had to be shut down for up to 2 h on 9 and 10 May. SEB Eesti Ühispank's online banking service was down for a similar period on 15 May. The banks mitigated the impact of the attacks by, for instance, limiting access to customers outside of Estonia. Three major Internet service providers -- Elion Ettevõtted, Elisa Andmesideteenused and Starman -- came under DDoS attacks (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010). The Zone.ee web hosting service provider and directory service provider (ee.ee) were attacked, but in each case their services were restored relatively quickly. The US Computer Emergency Readiness Team (CERT) assessment concluded that although this was a ‘watershed' attack, it was not ‘revolutionary' in terms of the scale or sophistication of the techniques that were used .\nThe Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Paet accused the Kremlin of involvement in the cyber-attacks. However, there was no direct evidence to link the DDoS with any state agencies. In contrast, the Estonian attacks provide an early example of ‘crowdsourcing'. Digital infrastructures were used to encourage hacktivist participation. The incidents have been compared with a ‘cyber-riot' rather than a well-coordinated attack (The Economist 2007). The term ‘patriotic hacking' describes attacks performed by a group of people who take action ‘pro patria' in cases where they believe that this is the right thing for their government to do or where they perceive the government as unable to do ‘the right thing' (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010). Political activists protested by engaging in coordinated cyber-attacks against the online presence and Internet infrastructure of Estonia. The activities of disaffected individuals provided opportunities for ‘plausible deniability' by a range of state agencies that might otherwise stand accused of coordinating the attacks.\nNATO members considered the wider implications of the attacks on Estonia, leading to the development of the Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) in 2008. This organisation is not funded directly by NATO but by the supporting member states. CCDCOE provides a meeting place for military experts, scientists, lawyers and politicians. It also publishes technical reports on emerging cyber threats and provides ‘white papers' on policy decisions including the development of international legal frameworks to clarify the response to future attacks, in particular when it is not possible to identify whether a state organisation is responsible for a threat.\nTable 1 has summarised the use of social media in the Estonian case study. As can be seen, social networks were used to crowd-source participation in the DDoS attacks. Malware was distributed through Internet sites that also provided lists of potential targets. It is important to stress that the participants in this attack were not simply the individuals usually associated with hacking but included a far broader spectrum including members of the public who were opposed to what they viewed as the suppression of minority rights in the aftermath of Estonian independence (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010).\n## Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty, April 2008\nThe second case study focuses on the role that botnets and other forms of ‘anti-social' networking played on cyber-attacks against Radio Svaboda, the Belarusian service of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL). These radio stations were established during the Cold War and had been the target of direct physical attacks, including a poisoning attempt associated with the Czechoslovak intelligence service and a car bomb, linked to the Romanian government. However, the cyber-attacks can be linked to political tensions inside Belarus. Many independent observers criticised the electoral processes used by President Alexander Lukashenka to extend his tenure in 1996 and 2004. There were limited opportunities to voice criticisms within Belarus. During 2008, a Statute on Mass Media extended the state monopoly of Internet Service Provision. Beltelekom was able to restrict access to sites that criticised the administration, including those operated by Radio Svaboda.\nDuring the morning of 26 April 2008, the Radio Svaboda web servers were subjected to a DDoS attack (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010). These attacks seem to have been launched by the government supporters to prevent Radio Svaboda from covering popular protests on the 22nd anniversary of the Chernobyl accident, which occurred on the borders of Belarus and the Ukraine. Many people were unhappy about the lack of compensation for those affected by the accident. Others were angered by the administration's support for the Belarus civil nuclear programme.\nThis analysis does not explain why the cyber-attacks also affected a number of other RFL/RE servers, including those for Kosovo, Azerbaijan, Tatar-Bashkir and Radio Farda in Iran. These additional attacks were arguably intended to obfuscate the attribution of the DDoS on Radio Svaboda. However, motivation and opportunity cannot be used as surrogates for more direct evidence of official involvement. Several organisations argued that Russian DDoS botnets were involved in the attacks . These ‘anti-social' networks were also used to coordinate attacks on a wider range of opposition media sites. These included Charter 97, an English language news site on political activities in Belarus; BelPartyzan, a local news website and the Russian language information sites, legis-group.ru and compromat.net.\nThe botnets used in the Belarus DDoS attacks were normally used for criminal activities; in particular to generate spam and phishing emails. The blurred boundary between cyber-crime and state-sponsored cyber-attacks is a feature of many case studies in this paper . Government agencies provide implicit support for criminal groups, who develop the infrastructures to support future attacks. However, the links are informal. Criminal groups may act for patriotic reasons or to ensure continued implicit state approval; in either case, it seems clear that anti-social networks have been forged between state agencies and cyber-attackers (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010; Johnson 2012).\nThe RFE/RL case study also illustrates the resilience of information infrastructures. The cyber-attacks did not bring the services ‘to their knees'. Several local websites in Belarus offered to carry content for RFE/RL before they could recover. By 28 April, most of the RFL/RE sites had been restored with significant improvements in their security infrastructures. The Radio Svaboda site administrators were also able to gain technical support from communities around the globe. In particular, help was received from several groups interested in maintaining the freedom of expression across the Internet. This provides a precursor to the collective action seen during the ‘Arab Spring' of 2011. The uprisings and unrest in Algeria,\nBahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Syria, Tunisia and Yemen were all influenced by the use of social media. Attempts by many states to disrupt Internet communications did not prevent opposition groups from disseminating messages using externally hosted sites. The attacks on RFE/RL provide an early example of the ‘social resilience' of communications infrastructures in response to cyber-attacks.\nThe Estonian case study showed that social networks could be used to coordinate cyber-attacks using crowd-sourcing techniques in response to political conflict. In contrast, Table 1 has shown that hacktivism was not a significant part of the cyber-attacks on RFE/RL. In contrast, DDoS attacks were launched by criminal botnets used to generate spam messages with an obvious impact on working lives around the globe. State agencies did not close down these anti-social networks, arguably, because they knew they could be recruited to launch cyber-attacks without the need to implicate government information infrastructures. Previous ergonomic studies tend to focus on the symptoms associated with these botnets, in terms of the impact of nuisance messages. Very few have considered the criminal and political context that sustains the dark side of the Internet.\n## 4. Lithuania, June 2008\nThe cyber-attacks on Estonia and Lithuania both had their roots in the tensions that arose following the break-up of the Soviet bloc. The right-wing Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats introduced a series of amendments to prohibit the public display of Soviet or Nazi insignia and were subsequently elected to power in November 2008. This created the background for conflict as the Russian Federation began to reassert influence on the Baltic states (Pääbo 2008). The immediate passage of the amendments did not seem to trigger the same level of hostility in the local Russian population, as had been observed amongst ethnic Russians in Estonia (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010). However, President Medvedev joined with the Belarusian President Lukashenka to express the Russian Federation's concern over the legislation. There were simultaneous protests outside the Lithuanian embassy in Moscow accompanied by a significant number of cyber-attacks. Some 300 websites were defaced by anti-Lithuanian slogans and by pro-Soviet symbols that would have been banned under the 2008 amendments.\nThe attacks were first detected on 28 June, peaking between 17:00 and 18:00 EET on Sunday 29 June. Companies and government websites were targeted ranging from the Lithuanian equivalent of the Securities and Exchange Commission to the web portal for the Lithuanian Social Democratic Party. By 2 July, most of the sites were able to resume normal operation.\nAfter independence, successive governments had encouraged the development of information infrastructures across Lithuanian, for instance through the Information Society Development Programme. Almost half of all households possessed a computer at the time of the attack, and one-third of government organisations had a web presence. However, companies suffered the most. The Lithuanian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-LT) had warned government agencies on a list of ‘at-risk' organisations after an Estonian TV channel had reported the possibility of a cyber-attack on 26 July. Commercial organisations did not receive the warning because they had not been included on the initial list. CERTs have been established by governments around the globe to increase resilience to cyber-attacks. The Lithuanian CERT had been established around 18 months before the web servers were defaced.\nThe Lithuanian attacks show how CERTs can develop networks of potential targets to ensure that warnings are propagated to at-risk organisations. This case study also illustrates the need for government agencies to actively monitor social media for intelligence about potential attacks and for forensic information in the aftermath of a cyber-incident. CERT-LT traced most of the targets back to Hostex, one of the largest web hosting services in Lithuania. The forensic analysis showed that once the vulnerability had been identified, all Hostex users were targeted. CERT-LT assisted the Hostex engineers as they worked to mitigate the effects of the attacks. The modes of attack resemble those used in both Estonia and Belarus. Initial reports focused on vulnerabilities in PHP servers that were then used to run a series of scripts distributed amongst a small group of attackers. However, other modes of attack included the generation of large amounts of spam email linking to ‘Hackers United against External Threats to Russia', which resembled the use of botnets in the previous case studies (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010).\nCERT-LT and RRT, the Lithuanian communications regulatory authority, identified the use of proxy servers to the East. It seemed “likely that the attacks were organised in advance, considering the fact that signals, invitations, and agitation were spread on the Internet prior to the attacks. However, the RRT refused to speak of any particular countries as the initiator of the attack. (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010)” Subsequent analysis identified compromised hosts in France and Sweden as possible sources for the defacement attacks suggesting that they had been planned in advance. However, as in Belarus, the Lithuanian attacks might also have used servers that had already been violated for other cyber-crime activities.\nCircumstantial evidence for the involvement of Russian hacking groups is provided by discussions on Internet forums, such as hack-wars.ru. However, direct proof was difficult to obtain. For example, the Cyber Police Unit of the Lithuanian Police argued that the attackers had used the Tor ‘onion routing' protocols. Tor is used by journalists, whistle-blowers and law enforcement agencies to prevent monitoring of Internet traffic. It relies on ‘onion routing'; this refers to the use of encryption at multiple layers of a communication network. The Lithuanian attacks illustrate a number of common themes across many of the incidents in this paper. Attribution was complicated by the lack of direct evidence for state involvement and by the participation of ‘hacking groups' communicating over Internet forums and social media.\n## Georgia, August 2008\nThe fourth case study forms part of the armed conflict between Georgia and the Russian Federation over Ossetia. Although this region straddles the Caucasian mountains, North Ossetia was ceded to the Soviet Union, whereas the area south of the mountains became part of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic (GSSR). Fighting broke out between Georgian forces and South Ossetia (1991--1992) and then in Abkhazia (1992--1994). In consequence, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) formed a peacekeeping force in 1992 with troops from Russia, Georgia and South Ossetia. The composition of this peacekeeping force did little to reduce animosity between the various factions . This was exacerbated by Moscow's concern when the Bush administration provided assistance for the Georgian forces to clear Chechen fighters from the Pankisi valley. By April 2008, large-scale military exercises were being conducted on both sides of the border. Fighter aircraft and UAVs began to patrol ‘demilitarised' areas.\nOn 7 August 2008, Georgian forces attacked the town of Tskhinvali and surrounding areas in response to an alleged Russian invasion. By 8 August, the Russian air force was attacking infrastructures, targets included Tbilisi airport radar, railroad junctions and telecommunications facilities. By 10 August, the Georgian Government declared a unilateral ceasefire and announced its intention to withdraw Georgian forces from South Ossetia. By 11 August, Russian troops had crossed the boundaries of Ossetia and entered a number of Georgian towns. On 12 August, French President Sarkozy travelled to Moscow and Tiblisi, representing the European Council. He proposed a six-point peace plan that ultimately led to a ceasefire. By 22 August, Russian troops had withdrawn from their positions beyond the former boundaries of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.\nThe most obvious difference with Estonia and Lithuania is that the Georgian cyber-attacks coincided with a physical offensive. The effects were also different. More than 50% of the Estonian population were active users of the Internet. In contrast, this figure was close to 30% in Lithuania but only 10% in Georgia. However, the impact on Georgia was greater because most of their information infrastructures passed through the Russian territory . Georgia was aware of these communication vulnerabilities and wanted to develop trade opportunities with the EU. Most Internet traffic was deliberately routed via Turkish or Azerbaijan service providers. Work had almost been completed on a high capacity link with Bulgaria before the invasion.\nThe initial wave of cyber-attacks on the Georgian government infrastructures occurred before the armed conflict. These included ICMP floods and spurious HTTP ‘GET' requests similar to the techniques used in Estonia . Targets included www.president.gov.ge, where images of Adolf Hitler were substituted for pictures of President Saakashvili. A collage of dictators was also placed on the National Bank of the Republic of Georgia's site. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs portal was attacked as were newspaper and media agencies in Georgia and Azerbaijan. Meanwhile, the DDoS attacks were aimed at government sites, including the Parliament and Ministry of Education and Science and the banks. The DDoS statistics gathered during the Georgian attacks were also similar to those for Estonia. Most attacks lasted from 2 to 6 h.\nIntelligence agencies had learned from events in Estonian and were better equipped to monitor the attack patterns against Georgia. Several botnets were involved, including the MachBot controller for an HTTP-based botnet attack coordinated by Russian herders. Many aspects of the attacks in Estonia and Georgia have been linked to the Russian Business Network (RBN) criminal organisation and associated botnets. The accuracy of this claim is understandably difficult to establish, as is the nexus between the founder of the RBN and Russian government agencies. It may be that the RBN provided access to botnet resources without mounting the DDoS attacks; following a ‘business model' that supported their wider activities (Grey Goose 2008). However, it is dangerous to assume that involvement in an attack provides reliable evidence about its coordination . At least one of the botnets' command and control servers was located in the USA.\nThere is also evidence that social media was used to support ‘crowdsourcing' similar to that seen in Estonia: “a downloadable script to ping flood Estonian websites (both DNS and IPs) was shared on various Russian language message boards. Instructions on how to ping flood Georgian government websites were also distributed on Russian language websites and\nmessage boards, as well as lists of Georgian sites vulnerable to remote SQL injections, facilitating automatic defacement of them. .”\nSQL injections occur because commands written in one language may be hidden inside the instructions of another. If the input is not correctly filtered for embedded command sequences, then these can be inadvertently executed by higher layers of an application. The email addresses of prominent Georgian politicians, academics and industrialists were also distributed. These were used to focus spamming and more targeted forms of attack . Major figures had to create new email accounts and re-establish their social networks in a piecemeal fashion, at a time when their attention should have been focused on the invasion.\nThe response to the attacks was coordinated by CERT Georgia. Their analysis of Internet Protocol (IP) data was supported by Estonian, French and Polish counterparts. However, many of the targets of the cyber-attacks simply waited. Normal commercial activities were curtailed by the armed conflict. Some websites mitigated the impact of the attacks by temporarily changing IP addresses. Others used international hosts; Blogspot.com supported Georgian news and government agencies. The websites of the Georgian President and their Ministry of Defence were relocated to a company in Atlanta, GA, USA. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs moved to an Estonian server. These counter-measures had limited effects inside Georgia. Flood attacks on Caucasus Network Tbilisi caused significant bottlenecks exacerbated by damage to network infrastructures inside the war zone; many Georgian Internet connections ran through Russia.\nThese case studies illustrate a complex relation between ICT maturity and the vulnerability to cyber-attacks. The more a nation depends upon networked services, then the more vulnerable it can be to any cyber-incident. The Estonian public relied on the Internet for a host of government and financial services. The impact on Georgia was more limited. Equally, the more a nation depends upon networked services, then the more resilient it will be to any cyber-incident. Less mature nations find it harder to bring their electronic infrastructures back online. In Georgia, the attacks forced the suspension of electronic banking services for 10 days rather than the hours of interruption seen in Estonia.\nIt is difficult to underestimate the psychological impact of a combined attack on both physical and digital infrastructures. Tikk et al. (2008) observe that “while the attacks did not have a permanent or even a long-run devastating effect on the Georgian Internet infrastructure, the damage caused by the attacks was most acutely experienced at the time when Georgia was the most dependent on the availability of their information channels.”\nThe synchronisation of the physical and virtual attacks reinforced the vulnerability of the Georgian government to external forces.\nThe Georgian case study also shows how cyber-conflicts can extend across different social networks. Russian hacking groups were implicated in the initial attacks on Georgian government infrastructures. In contrast, hacking groups inside Georgia also became the targets of cyber-attacks. The www.hacking.ge website was an early victim. This removed a potential source of advice and information about ways to increase the resilience of Georgian networks. Alternatively, it can be seen as part of a direct conflict between hacking/hacking networks in Russia and Georgia. Russian sites also seem to have been the target of secondary attacks, such as that operated by the RIA Novosti news outlet .\nTable 1 has summarised the diverse role that various forms of social networks played in the Georgian attacks. As can be seen, crowdsourcing was used through the distribution of scripts and lists of potential victims. Social networks were also used to distribute information about individuals who were then deliberately the target of spamming attacks. Finally, botnets were used to coordinate DDoS attacks. However, unlike previous case studies, there is evidence to suggest the conflict extended between hacking networks on both sides of the conflict.\n## 6. China, GhostNet, March 2009\nThere are similarities between the first four case studies; the Estonian, Belarusian, Lithuania and Georgian attacks all stemmed from the break-up of the Soviet Union. All four involved politically motivated DDoS attacks supported by the use of criminal botnets. In all four cases, the victims were able to use networks of contacts and sympathisers to recover from the attacks within hours. In contrast, the fifth case study focuses on ‘advanced persistent threats' . As the term suggests, this form of attack requires greater coordination and planning. APTs also illustrate how a new generation of cyber-threats uses social networks to deliberately focus their attacks on particular individuals. Information about an individual's online contacts can be exploited by ‘socially engineered malware'.\nThis case study focuses on the violation of computers in more than 100 countries. Although the evidence is circumstantial, it seems likely that these attacks were coordinated by groups inside the People's Republic of China as part of the wider policy of active defence . Subsequent sections of this paper will describe similar techniques exploited by agencies in Europe and North America. However, this case study considers targets in the foreign ministries of Iran, Bangladesh, Latvia, Indonesia, Philippines, Brunei, Barbados and Bhutan; embassies in India, South Korea, Indonesia,\nRomania, Cyprus, Malta, Thailand, Taiwan, Portugal, Germany and Pakistan; the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Secretariat and the Asian Development Bank. The attacks also compromised computers in news organisations and a range of commercial organisations.\nThese attacks seemed to follow a common pattern; a Trojan horse was introduced onto a victim's machine that would then exfiltrate information to control servers, ultimately reporting back to Chinese sources. These data would include information about the victim's social networks that could then be used by spear phishing attacks. Their email account would be used to send a malicious payload to the individuals in their contact list . The success of the approach depended upon convincing the recipient to open the attached document containing the malware. People are far more likely to open an attachment if it comes from a friend or colleague. Once opened, this attachment would compromise the next link in the social network. The terms ‘social malware', ‘social engineering' and ‘spear phishing' describe the use of information about the target's network of contacts. The aim is to increase the plausibility of the email vector. In some cases, legitimate messages were simply reused. In other cases, documents were taken from other compromised machines and then passed to new targets with the embedded malware to increase the probability that they would, in turn, infect their machines.\nThis modus operandi was christened the ‘GhostNet'; it was identified following investigations on behalf of the Office of the Dalai Lama . Sympathisers were detained by Chinese officials who seemed to have knowledge of their Internet communications. Many sympathisers used Tencent QQ to spread information about the Tibetan cause; this is the most widespread instant messaging service in mainland China. Voice over IP applications might also have been compromised. The Office of the Dalai Lama, therefore, installed network monitoring software to gather additional forensic evidence. They found that infected machines would exchange information with command and control servers -- to download updated versions of the malware and send data out of the local networks: “(This) led to the discovery of four control servers and six command servers ... The control servers were then probed and web-based control interfaces were identified on four control servers, which allowed us to view and control the network. The system was actively monitored for 2 weeks, which allowed us to derive an extensive list of infected systems, and to also monitor the systems operator(s) as the operator(s) specifically instructed target computers. ”The IP addresses associated with most of these servers were traced to China. Several were located on the island of Hainan, home to the Lingshui signals intelligence facility and the Third Technical Department of the People's Liberation Army. However, other servers were traced to the USA, Sweden, South Korea and Taiwan. This illustrates the complexity of attribution.\nA subsequent analysis of the web servers that were used to coordinate the GhostNet Trojan's undermined arguments that they were maintained by government agencies. Instead, they used QQ instant messaging numbers to trace the sites back to members of the Chinese hacking community . These studies concluded that patriotic hacking and cybercrime may have played a role in the development of these attacks . Further circumstantial evidence of the anti-social networks that connect hacking groups was provided by the reuse of techniques associated with the earlier Enfal Trojan within the Ghostnet attacks. Code seems to have been exchanged between different groups of programmers working with a similar but distinct malware. The case studies in this paper provide parallels between twenty-first century cyber-crime and seventeenth century piracy. They illustrate a privateering model, in which governments authorise private individuals to attack enemies of the state. Further investigations concluded that two or three different groups were using different command and control infrastructures to support multiple forms of attack on opposition groups .\nForensic analysis of the GhostNet attacks illustrates the dual nature of social networks in cyber-security. Victims were targeted using spear-phishing techniques that deliberately exploited information about their social networks . Conversely, the perpetrators of the attack were traced by monitoring connections between different groups of attackers, for instance across Baidu: “(these attacks were) to a large degree organised and operated through the misuse of social networking and cloud computing platforms, including Google, Baidu, Yahoo!, and Twitter, in addition to traditional command and control servers ... although we are able to piece together circumstantial evidence that provides the location and possible associations of the attackers, their actual identities and motivations remain illusory. We catch a glimpse of a shadow of attribution in the cloud, in other words, but have no positive identification ... there is a generational shift unfolding in malware networks in multiple dimensions, from what were once primarily simple to increasingly complex, adaptive systems spread across redundant services and platforms, and from criminal and industrial-based exploitation to political, military, and intelligence-focused espionage. ”\nCloud-based infrastructures and web mail services support these new forms of attack. Free or low-cost hosting services with minimal background checks enable the development of command and control servers that can be used to update malware and coordinate the exfiltration of data. If the security of these servers is compromised, then they can quickly be abandoned at almost no cost. In these circumstances, the Trojans used social networking sites, including Twitter, Google Groups, Blogspot, Baidu Blogs and blog.com accounts, to access links to the new free hosting accounts that replaced the compromised command and control servers . As a final resort, the malware could contact more stable servers\nin China; these would then point the malware back to an alternate disposable hosting service reducing the chances of further detection .\nThe (ab)use of social networking and Cloud infrastructures to implement command and control servers was compounded through the indirection provided by the Tor anonymity network. This technique was mentioned in our third case study; the Cyber Police Unit of the Lithuanian Police found that Tor had been used to disguise the attacks on their government servers. Tor passes communications through various volunteer servers to prevent others from identifying the origin of a message. When researchers monitored unencrypted data leaving the Tor network, they found some of it related to the Dalai Lama's office. Because these messages did not originate from the Office of the Dalai Lama, they concluded that the information was most probably being forwarded to Tor as the attackers tried to disguise the compromised machines .\nThe GhostNet attacks again illustrate the need to increase links between the field of Ergonomics and cyber-security. Social-media provide significant benefits across a broad range of industries (Manyika, Chui, and Sarrazin 2012). They enable networks of contacts to work together across national borders and between diverse organisations. At the same time, Cloud computing techniques are providing low-cost methods to coordinate distributed work, for instance, through the development of shared, virtual infrastructures. However, these innovations have created new vulnerabilities. Malware now makes use of social media to obtain information about personal contacts. There are then used to propagate spear-phishing attacks where a malicious payload is disguised within email that is deliberately tailored for a recipient within a social network. Similarly, Cloud and web mail infrastructures provide the disposable technologies that enable the rapid development of command and control servers. These are used to upload more recent versions of malware and also to forward data extracted from a victim's machine. They reduce the likelihood of detection because they can be abandoned without cost should an attack be discovered. Table 1 has summarised the role of social networks and their supporting technologies within the GhostNet attacks. A key motivation for writing this paper is to encourage more active research within the field of Ergonomics to increase our resilience to these forms of attack. The solutions are unlikely to be purely technical; these forms of attack undermine the trust of victims in their information infrastructures. Unless more is carried out to make individuals and groups aware of the potential threats, there is a risk that the dark side of the Internet will limit the further development of the digital economy. Many companies now prohibit staff from accessing social media on any device that is used within their networks -- including applications that are specifically intended to support business networks .\n## W32.STUXNET, March 2010\nThe case studies in this paper provide a spectrum from the mass DDoS attacks that relied on hacktivism and crowdsourcing in Georgia, Estonia, Latvia and Belarus, to the more focussed techniques that were deployed against the social networks of Chinese opposition groups. The final case study argues that Stuxnet had an even narrower focus; attacking a particular group of centrifuges within the Iranian nuclear enrichment programme. Social networks again played an important role in the transmission of this malware. It exploited vulnerabilities in the auto-execution mechanisms associated with removable drives, such as USB sticks. In consequence, Stuxnet quickly infected groups of users, including commercial and government organisations, which shared data and applications (Falliere, Murchu, and Chien 2011). One reason for the successful transmission of the malware was that it took steps to cover its tracks. Code was introduced to delete any malware left on a USB stick after the third infection. Stuxnet again illustrates how computer viruses can propagate across social and professional networks.\nStuxnet also illustrated the exchange of ‘lessons learned' across anti-social networks. It exploited techniques that had previously been used in the Conficker worm. Stuxnet spread across local area networks, exploiting vulnerabilities in the Windows Print Spooler. The virus would also scan infected computers for security software. In some cases, the malware would inject code into trusted processes, including anti-virus programmes. However, if the security product was considered to be resilient to the attack, then no injection would be attempted. Stuxnet used command and control servers, similar to those identified in the Chinese attacks. These were located in Malaysia and Denmark; connection requests were monitored from over 40,000 unique IP addresses in more than 155 countries. When a new machine was infected, the malware would first test connectivity with a valid address, including www.msn.com. If successful, the malware would first download an update of the virus; three different versions have been identified.\nOne of the reasons that Stuxnet was so virulent is that it included a Windows rootkit, providing privileged access to the underlying operating system while at the same time masking the intrusion. It also incorporated four ‘zero-day exploits'. These vulnerabilities in underlying operating systems or network architectures were unknown before the malware was released. The term ‘zero day' indicates that this is the first day when security firms can patch the vulnerability. The number of zero-day attacks in Stuxnet is highly unusual. Using all four at once is wasteful; an attack may be sustained by waiting for the first exploit to be patched before releasing the second and so on.\nThe attack was focussed against Iran's civil nuclear programmes. Between 2006 and 2010, the United Nations passed six resolutions to prevent them from developing the enrichment technologies to produce military grade uranium. For instance, resolution 1803  banned the export of dual use technologies with nuclear applications to Iran. The term ‘dual use' is important because the enrichment process is essential to develop uranium fuel for civil energy generation, but also for nuclear weapons development. Enrichment relies on cascades of centrifuges that produce successively higher concentrations. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) found evidence that Iran had created at least two strings capable of enriching uranium up to 20% by August 2010. Iran had more than 2.5 tons of low-enriched uranium, which was sufficient to support the development of nuclear weapons using existing centrifuges.\nStuxnet targeted the Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) that supervised the Iranian centrifuges. PLCs are not, typically, connected to networks. Instead, they are periodically attached to PCs, and code is downloaded directly onto the controllers. The PLCs are then connected to the centrifuges. In consequence, attackers must first infect the PCs that are used to code the PLCs. Stuxnet focussed on the Siemen's Step 7 PLC programming environment. If Step 7 was not detected on an infected PC, then no actions were taken. If it was detected, then Stuxnet exploited a number of vulnerabilities in the Step 7 environment, including a hard-coded password for its SCADA database. Stuxnet was also able to hook operating system calls to open project files associated with the Siemens application. However, it did not infect all of the Step 7 data. It was only interested in projects that had been used or accessed within the previous three and a half years.\nStuxnet monitored, replaced and disguised blocks of Step 7 code being written to PLCs. In order to do this, the malware had to forge the digital signatures that were used to authenticate drivers in the malicious binaries. These were maintained by two Taiwanese companies, which seem to have been the victims of conventional or physical industrial espionage . This is reminiscent of the Georgian case study where the cyber-attack coincident with a physical invasion. In Stuxnet, the cyber-attack was supported by convention forms of espionage.\nOnce the malicious code had made the jump from the PCs to the PLCs, it monitored the frequency of the motors attached to the centrifuge. It only attacked systems that operated at frequencies between 807 and 1210 Hz. The malware then triggered a state machine to control the sabotage. After an initial delay of some 13 days, Stuxnet set the maximum frequency to 1410 Hz; 27 days later, this was changed to 2 Hz and then 1064 Hz before the sequence was repeated. The malware acted like a landmine; the intention was not to kill the victim, but to consume finite resources of time and expertise. By analogy, the intention was not to destroy the centrifuges, but to waste the Iranian engineering resources as teams of workers had to repair affected components and identify the source of the problems. The IAEA reported signs of damage to around 900 centrifuges during the period when Stuxnet was active. However, independent studies suggest that Iran was able to increase uranium enrichment in spite of this cyber-attack . They were resilient to the cyber-attack, just as the victims were in our previous case studies. One interpretation of this conflicting evidence is that Iranian authorities deliberately exaggerated the impact of the malware to create the impression that greater damage had been inflicted on their nuclear programmes.\nThe sophistication of Stuxnet suggests that it was developed by a network of engineers. Not only did they require a detailed knowledge of the Step 7 environment, but they also needed access to specialist hardware. The malicious payload focused on PLCs using a particular Central Processing Unit; 6ES7-315-2 (series 300). The malware monitored the PLCs' Profibus communications processors looking for frequency converters manufactured by Fararo Paya in Iran and Vacon in Finland. The range of technical skills required by this cyber-attack strongly suggests that Stuxnet was created by a team or network of developers. Stuxnet would have taken from 5 to 30 people around 6 months to prepare (Falliere, Murchu, and Chien 2011). It is remarkable that Stuxnet did not affect any of the registered users for the Step 7 environment. Hence, the development team may have included security agencies as well as representatives of the companies that might otherwise have been affected by the attack. However, this speculation does not preclude the possibility that a small group of committed individuals acted together to create the malware with or without state encouragement.\nSome commentators have argued that the preoccupation with Iranian centrifuges has masked the real purpose of the Stuxnet virus . The attacks can be seen as the first field test of a targeted cyber-attack. The widespread dissemination of the virus violated many different systems, but the damage was highly focussed on a very small number of specialist devices. In this interpretation, the real purpose of Stuxnet was to reveal how future cyber-weapons could go beyond the mass DDoS of earlier attacks. In contrast to ‘hacktivist' crowdsourcing in Estonia, Lithuania, Georgia and Belarus, the GhostNet and Stuxnet cyber-attacks required relatively small networks of specialists working together to exploit common features of our everyday working environments -- ranging from USB sticks to social networks and Cloud infrastructures.\n## Summary of the use of social media in cyber-attacks\nThere are many motivations for a closer engagement between the field of Ergonomics and cyber-security. First, it is important that human factors specialists have a better understanding of the underlying causes of security threats. Cyber-\nErgonomics\nsecurity will have an increasing impact on working lives. It is not simply the high-profile security breaches that affect major public and private institutions, but also the everyday irritation created by spam and the continual need to maintain anti-viral systems. Second, it is essential that Ergonomists play a more active role in designing our defences. At present, we are faced with a bewildering array of firewalls, passwords and access control mechanisms that frustrate our working tasks and, as we have seen, provide limited protection against emerging threats. Third, in order to understand the threat posed by recent generations of malware, it is important to understand core concepts within the field of Ergonomics. It is important to understand that social networks support new forms of attack, for instance helping hackers exchange successful techniques. Social networks can also increase resilience, bringing together technical support in the aftermath of an attack. There remains significant work to be carried out – both in inhibiting the growth of anti-social networks and promoting the interactions that will help us recover from future threats.\nFigure 1 provides an overview of the roles that social networking plays in cyber-attacks. The Estonian, Georgian and Lithuanian case studies show that crowd-sourcing supports DDoS attacks, by exchanging malware and lists of potential targets between groups of sympathisers. Social networking provided patriotic groups with both the motivation and technical direction to implement the attacks. In these incidents, the attribution problem was complicated because it is impossible to determine whether state intervention sustained the groups who launched the attacks.\nSecond, governments can exploit informal links with anti-social criminal networks during cyber-attacks. In particular, they can make use of criminal resources to attack third-party infrastructures. Russian botnets played an important part in the Belarus case study. The use of existing criminal networks hides state intervention. The attribution problem is complicated because botnets exploit various forms of indirection to mask command and control infrastructures. This is only one example of the social networks that support cyber-attacks. Malware is often exchanged between criminal networks who reuse techniques exposing previous vulnerabilities. Stuxnet exploited vulnerabilities in the IP exploited by Conficker.\nSocial networks have also been used to infer inter-personal relationships that can then be exploited by malware, for example using spear phishing techniques. The recipient is more likely to open an infected attachment or link if it has been\nFigure 1. Different stages in the use of social networking for cyber-attacks.\nC.W. Johnson\nsent from a trusted source. The Chinese case studies have shown that politically motivated attacks, therefore, draw heavily on identity theft in wider areas of cyber-crime. Intelligence agencies now routinely monitor interactions over social media .\nFinally, I have shown how the infrastructures associated with social networking create disposable architectures to coordinate attacks, for example through the development of command and control servers used by Stuxnet. The ubiquitous nature of these architectures makes it difficult to determine who owns and operates the servers. Similarly, the use of anonymity servers in the Lithuanian and GhostNet attacks shows how systems that support confidential interaction also support the dark side of the Internet.\n# 9. A roadmap for social media in cyber defence\nThis paper provides a roadmap for future resilience to the abuse of social media in cyber-attacks. I have identified existing threats – for example through crowdsourcing in DDoS attacks and through the social monitoring that directs spear phishing. I have also identified ways in which social networks can help organisations resist and recover from attacks. For instance, I have seen how the Estonian media identified Internet groups that were encouraging participation in a cyber-attack on Lithuania (stages 1 and 2 in Figure 1). In consequence, the national CERT alerted government agencies. However, organisations that had not registered with their Computer Emergency Response Team did not receive the warning. This illustrates the continuing need to develop networks for the dissemination of the best practices to increase resilience against future cyber-threats.\nFigure 2 presents our roadmap for the use of social media in mitigating the threat of cyber-attacks. It is more complex than the overview of social media in previous security incidents, illustrated in Figure 1. This is because the first diagram was based on evidence drawn from the case studies presented in this paper, using the action-based methodology from the opening sections. Figure 2 is more tentative. I have hypothesised the ways in which social media might increase resilience to future attacks. The roadmap is intended as a starting point. In particular, the diagram must be refined in response to new threats. Previous sections have described how malware exploits technologies that originally supported a wide range of end-user tasks. For instance, Cloud-based file-stores and web mail services provide flexible, virtual information infrastructures. These same technologies have also been used to create disposable command and control infrastructures. If we cannot develop a more sophisticated appreciation of the security risks that stem from the abuse of future infrastructures, then we will continue to react as cyber-attacks evolve to exploit new vulnerabilities.\nThe first element of the roadmap in Figure 2 focuses on the monitoring of social media. This can be broken down into a number of concerns. Monitoring provides advanced warning of hacktivism, especially when 'politically motivated' cyberattacks reuse infrastructures that support conventional forms of cyber-crime, including identity theft. The reuse of botnets\nFigure 2. Roadmap for the use of social networking for cyber defence.\nand many of the zero-day exploits described in previous sections were discussed on social media before they were used on political targets. Our work reiterates the need for intelligence agencies to identify intersections between political groups and the wider population of cyber-criminals using social network analysis tools.\nThe second stage of the road map reinforces links with existing security management systems through risk assessment for cyber defence. Risk assessment is important because, at present, it is not performed in an organised or systematic way by many of the potential targets of cyber-attacks. Public--private networks have been used by many states as a cost-effective means of encouraging commercial and public bodies to increase their resilience to future attacks. Companies and government agencies are encouraged to work together in developing contingency plans based on the risk assessments that identify potential cyber-threats. Unfortunately, this approach has not worked very well . Many companies have been enthusiastic participants. Many others have abstained. Even those that were initially enthusiastic have not sustained their interest.\nSocial networking provides one means of addressing these concerns. For example, the UK government is promoting Warning, Advice and Reporting Points; see www.warp.gov.uk. These groups use electronic resources to send personalised warnings and advice across a network of members. Each WARP focuses on a particular community with similar security requirements; ‘Their purpose is to provide a specific community with the capability to share security related information -- both problems and solutions -- and thereby to develop more secure and responsive environments'. The third element of the road map, therefore, focuses on the use of social media to disseminate early warnings about potential cyber-attacks.\nIssuing community warning about future attacks provides limited benefits unless they are accompanied by appropriate actions. Drills and exercises help to audit the resilience provided by these mechanisms. Too often, these drills assume perfect conditions for CERTs and other state agencies to respond to potential attacks. However, the Georgian invasion shows that cyber-incidents coincide with adverse circumstances. By developing wider communities of interest in cyber-security, by encouraging participation in drills and exercises, we can also obtain evidence of vulnerabilities and the consequences of future attacks that provide persuasive data to encourage wider participation in these initiatives.\nThe penultimate stage in the roadmap focuses on the use of social networks in forensic analysis after an attack has occurred (Johnson, in press). At present, it is extremely difficult to detect the early stages of an attack. A range of network monitoring companies, mostly located in the USA, provide detailed information on connectivity failures in the aftermath of DDoS attacks. However, CERTs cannot use these post hoc studies to trigger a more active response once an attack is underway. Greater benefits could be derived from research into the particular patterns that have characterised the initial stages of previous attacks, for example using abnormal Border Gateway Protocol events. The real-time identification of an attack is not simply a technical exercise but requires input from a range of different experts given the costs and consequences that are associated with false alarms. Closing down an infrastructure in case an attack may occur requires operational, managerial and regulatory expertise.\nThe final stage of the roadmap for using social media to increase resilience to cyber-attacks focuses on the identification and dissemination of lessons learned. At present, this remains an ad hoc process . Many stakeholders remain ignorant of the extent of previous attacks, especially outside their own national borders. Further problems arise when vested interests exaggerate the impact of cyber-attacks; this alienates engineering staff who play a vital role in implementing potential mitigations. As we have seen, reports that cyber-attacks will ‘bring a nation to its knees' cannot be justified on the evidence of previous incidents.\nArguably, the greatest vulnerability identified in our work has been the difficulty that managers and operators have in obtaining clear information about previous attacks. Strong contrasts can be drawn between the lack of information in this and the plethora of accident and incident reports published across safety-related industries. Of course, it can be argued that the wider dissemination of this information might encourage future attacks. However, this argument ignores the anti-social networks that have already sprung up to disseminate the technical information that can be used to launch future attacks.\n## Conclusions and further work\nThis paper provides a new perspective on the wider topics addressed in this special issue looking beyond human-centred automation.

The growing complexity of socio-technical systems and the interpenetration of formerly separate systems via IT infrastructures create new opportunities for social interaction. It also creates new vulnerabilities. In particular, this paper considers the role that social networking has played in the ‘attribution problem’. This term describes the difficulty in determining who is responsible for a cyber-attack. Social networks describe interconnections between individuals and groups that change over time. These relationships may be based on family ties, sexual relationships, employment, etc. However, the interconnections can also motivate groups to launch mass cyber-attacks on common targets, whether they are multi-national corporations or government agencies. It is difficult for commercial and government organisations to monitor these connections and hence predict the groups who are likely to become involved in mass cyber-attacks. One reason for this is that state agencies are using ‘social media’ to encourage and sustain networks of hactivists that are behind many cyber-attacks. Social media are Internet-based applications that allow for the generation and dissemination of user-generated content. As we shall see, these applications provide mechanisms for the dissemination and control of malware. I also show how these techniques support forms of indirection that make it difficult to identify explicit state responsibility for many cyber-attacks over the last decade.\nAt first sight, it might seem that this topic is tangential to many of the mainstream interests within the field of Ergonomics. In contrast, I will argue that it is increasingly important to understand not only the positive role that social networks play in work and leisure but it is also equally necessary to understand how these phenomena may also be abused to support criminal activity. The following pages also explain why so much of our working lives continue to be devoted to filtering the thousands of spam emails that are generated by botnets. A botnet can be thought of as a number of interacting programmes communicating across a network of compromised machines; the term is formed from the conjunction of ‘robotic’ ‘networks’.\nSocial networking hinders the attribution of cyber-attacks in four different ways. First, social networks have helped to ‘crowd source’ the participants in an attack. They have motivated individuals to participate in mass Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. They have provided the code needed to launch DDoS and have published information on potential targets. Second, attackers have used information about an individual’s social networks to compromise security measures. For example, information about the friends and colleagues of a target can be obtained from social networks. This enables ‘spear phishing’; a recipient is more likely to open an infected attachment or link if it has been sent from a trusted participant in their social network.

Second, attackers use an individual’s social network to focus attacks, through spear phishing. Recipients are more likely to open infected attachments when they come from a trusted source.

Finally, governments have tolerated and even encouraged the growth of anti-social criminal networks that are later used to launch attacks on political targets, for instance, using botnets. Table 1 summarises the different roles that social media have played in the case studies that are presented in this paper. Before introducing the incidents that are included within this study, it is first important to present the methodological background to our work.\n\n# 1.1 Methodological interactions from action research to case-study approach\n\nResearch of this nature raises a host of methodological problems. Several authors have recently pioneered the use of human factors techniques to identify security threats and vulnerabilities. For instance, Kraemer, Carayon, and Clem (2009) used focus groups of IT security professionals to identify the individual and organisational causes of vulnerabilities. Shaw (2006) reviews the empirical evidence that supports the role of behavioural consultants within investigative teams looking at the potential role of insiders within particular attacks. However, neither of these studies considers the detailed role of individual and organisational human factors in state-sponsored cyber-attacks. Very few previous studies consider the wider national context of threats that extend beyond individual organisations. Many of the techniques that have been conventionally applied in Ergonomics cannot easily be used to analyse social aspects of state-sponsored cyber-crime. This is an important caveat given that cyber-attacks have an increasing impact on the working lives of many people. Empirical studies and laboratory investigations yield useful insights into individual behaviours; however, Dantzker and Hunter (2000) summarise the problems that arise when interpreting the results of studies that are intended to analyse criminal behaviour. Further criticisms stem from the limited insights that such studies provide into the group interactions (Dixona and Thebergeb 2011), which are at the heart of this paper.\n\nAction research provides an alternative perspective (Lewin 1946). It builds on the idea that complex social interactions cannot be studied by focussing on the isolated behaviours of particular individuals. In contrast, more situated studies provide a view of the impact of change on society. Action research provides tools to investigate changes and their effects while overcoming researchers' 'self-imposed distance from the world of action' (Dash 1999). These techniques are entirely appropriate within the context of this paper because the area of cyber-security is in constant flux. The role of social networks as a mechanism for launching attacks continues to adapt, for example, in response to new security mechanisms.\n\nAction research is not the only methodological approach that might be used to support this work; Blichfeldt and Andersen (2006) identify a continuum from Yin's (1994) hypothetical-deductive case-study techniques to Glaser and Strauss' (1967) notion of grounded theory. Yin's techniques assume that investigators will directly intervene in the working context, whereas Glaser and Strauss promote a more observational approach. The work reported in the following sections has been derived using action-based techniques as part of initiatives to increase the resilience of national and international infrastructures. I acknowledge that these involvements may bias our work in a positivist way. Equally active involvement helps to establish the relationships needed before access is granted to forensic evidence (Johnson 2012). Rather than focussing on these positivist interventions, the following sections draw more on the case-study methodologies associated with Yin. The intention is to provide an overview of recent incidents – not only to support our theories on the roles that social networking plays in the 'attribution problem' but also to provide readers with an overview of the causes and consequences of cyber-incidents that are an increasing threat across many different industries.\n\nThe methodology adopted in this work was to conduct a series of interviews with members of government organisations, including military and intelligence agencies, in the countries affected by the attacks. These were confidential, given the nature of the events under discussion. The questions focused on the probable causes of the attacks and also the consequences for government infrastructures. The initial insights provided by these meetings were validated by subsequent\n\nTable 1.

    "interviews with commercial organisations. Telecommunications companies were asked about the resilience of their systems and where possible to provide access to technical data about the connectivity of their networks over time. I also consulted critical infrastructure providers, including air traffic management organisations and financial service companies. In many cases, the impact of state-sponsored cyber-attacks was less severe than might have been assumed. In other cases, a lack of forensic expertise exacerbated recovery. It is important to stress that our aim was to survey the use of social networks in state-sponsored cyber-attacks, rather than to follow a rigid methodology. I had limited opportunities to contact the intended targets of Stuxnet inside Iran and the victims of Ghostnet. Instead, I relied on sources within NATO to assess the impact of these attacks. The inclusion of both incidents within the paper is justified because they mark key developments in state-sponsored, offensive capabilities.\n\n## Estonia, April--May 2007\n\nThe first case study focuses on a series of cyber-attacks that were directed against Estonia during April and May 2007. There are earlier examples of coordinated threats; for instance, the US government identified the ‘Titan Rain' attacks on companies, such as Lockheed Martin, national laboratories, including Sandia, and military targets, such as the Redstone Arsenal before 2003. Attackers from the Netherlands successfully compromised some 34 US defence sites in 1990.\n\nThe probable causes of the Estonian case study can be traced back to tensions between ethnic Estonians and Russians following the Second World War. After independence, many ethnic Russians were left without any form of citizenship. More immediate triggers included a decision to move the Bronze Soldier of Tallinn. This war memorial had become a focus for clashes between Estonians and Russian nationalists. The subsequent riots left one person dead and 150 injured. Some argued that the statue was a symbol of the Soviet occupation of Estonia, whereas others believed that it was a memorial to the Russians who fought against Nazi occupation (Tikk 2009).\n\nIt is possible to distinguish several different phases in this incident. An initial emotional/physical stage was closely tied to the riots around the Bronze Soldier. A series of website defacements then took place, but these were then superseded by a third phase in which DDoS attacks were launched (Tikk 2009). The rapid development of digital communications during the moves towards independence between 1988 and 1991 arguably placed Estonia at greater risk from such cyber-attacks. At the time of the attack, some 97% of all Estonian bank transactions were made online, 65% of the population were classified as ‘active users' of the Internet and 80% of the population had national identity cards that supported digital signatures. A number of different DDoS mechanisms were used. These included Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) floods launched by individuals. The aim was to overwhelm a server and stop it responding to legitimate requests. The Estonian attacks also included the use of botnets. A botnet is a network of private computers infected with malware, and they are controlled as a group typically without the owners' knowledge.\n\nArbor Networks identified more than 120 different attacks over a 3-week period; these included “a decent sized botnet behind the attack, with aggregate bandwidth at our points of measurement maxing out at nearly 100 Mbps ... All in all, someone is very, very deliberate in putting the hurt on Estonia, and this kind of thing is only going to get more severe in the coming years. (Nazario 2007)”\n\nHowever, most of the attacks (100 of the 120) were simple ICMP floods. Four involved more sophisticated approaches where TCP connection requests were sent faster than the recipient could process them. Most of the targets were government websites, especially the Ministry of Finance (35 of 128). Most attacks lasted less than an hour, but seven went on for more than 10 h.\n\nThe impact on the working lives of the Estonian public has been overestimated. For instance, a Chatham House report argued: “The severity and length of the attacks directed at one of NATO's most electronically connected members put the alliance on guard. If a highly wired small state could be brought to its knees by a well-orchestrated Internet-based attack, then what type of havoc could be wrought upon larger states with more heterogeneous systems and critical infrastructure open to attack? (Hughes 2008)”\n\nEstonia's two largest banks, Hansapank and SEB Eesti Ühispank, were attacked several times between 9 and 15 May. However, the effects were very limited. Hansapank's e-banking service had to be shut down for up to 2 h on 9 and 10 May. SEB Eesti Ühispank's online banking service was down for a similar period on 15 May. The banks mitigated the impact of the attacks by, for instance, limiting access to customers outside of Estonia. Three major Internet service providers -- Elion Ettevõtted, Elisa Andmesideteenused and Starman -- came under DDoS attacks (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010). The Zone.ee web hosting service provider and directory service provider (ee.ee) were attacked, but in each case their services were restored relatively quickly. The US Computer Emergency Readiness Team (CERT) assessment concluded that although this was a ‘watershed' attack, it was not ‘revolutionary' in terms of the scale or sophistication of the techniques that were used (Waterman 2007).",
    "The Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Paet accused the Kremlin of involvement in the cyber-attacks. However, there was no direct evidence to link the DDoS with any state agencies. In contrast, the Estonian attacks provide an early example of ‘crowdsourcing'. Digital infrastructures were used to encourage hacktivist participation. The incidents have been compared with a ‘cyber-riot' rather than a well-coordinated attack (The Economist 2007). The term ‘patriotic hacking' describes attacks performed by a group of people who take action ‘pro patria' in cases where they believe that this is the right thing for their government to do or where they perceive the government as unable to do ‘the right thing' (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010). Political activists protested by engaging in coordinated cyber-attacks against the online presence and Internet infrastructure of Estonia. The activities of disaffected individuals provided opportunities for ‘plausible deniability' by a range of state agencies that might otherwise stand accused of coordinating the attacks.\n\nNATO members considered the wider implications of the attacks on Estonia, leading to the development of the Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) in 2008. This organisation is not funded directly by NATO but by the supporting member states. CCDCOE provides a meeting place for military experts, scientists, lawyers and politicians. It also publishes technical reports on emerging cyber threats and provides ‘white papers' on policy decisions including the development of international legal frameworks to clarify the response to future attacks, in particular when it is not possible to identify whether a state organisation is responsible for a threat.\n\nTable 1 has summarised the use of social media in the Estonian case study. As can be seen, social networks were used to crowd-source participation in the DDoS attacks. Malware was distributed through Internet sites that also provided lists of potential targets. It is important to stress that the participants in this attack were not simply the individuals usually associated with hacking but included a far broader spectrum including members of the public who were opposed to what they viewed as the suppression of minority rights in the aftermath of Estonian independence (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010).\n\n## Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty, April 2008\n\nThe second case study focuses on the role that botnets and other forms of ‘anti-social' networking played on cyber-attacks against Radio Svaboda, the Belarusian service of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL). These radio stations were established during the Cold War and had been the target of direct physical attacks, including a poisoning attempt associated with the Czechoslovak intelligence service and a car bomb, linked to the Romanian government. However, the cyber-attacks can be linked to political tensions inside Belarus. Many independent observers criticised the electoral processes used by President Alexander Lukashenka to extend his tenure in 1996 and 2004. There were limited opportunities to voice criticisms within Belarus. During 2008, a Statute on Mass Media extended the state monopoly of Internet Service Provision. Beltelekom was able to restrict access to sites that criticised the administration, including those operated by Radio Svaboda.\n\nDuring the morning of 26 April 2008, the Radio Svaboda web servers were subjected to a DDoS attack (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010). These attacks seem to have been launched by the government supporters to prevent Radio Svaboda from covering popular protests on the 22nd anniversary of the Chernobyl accident, which occurred on the borders of Belarus and the Ukraine. Many people were unhappy about the lack of compensation for those affected by the accident. Others were angered by the administration's support for the Belarus civil nuclear programme.\n\nThis analysis does not explain why the cyber-attacks also affected a number of other RFL/RE servers, including those for Kosovo, Azerbaijan, Tatar-Bashkir and Radio Farda in Iran. These additional attacks were arguably intended to obfuscate the attribution of the DDoS on Radio Svaboda. However, motivation and opportunity cannot be used as surrogates for more direct evidence of official involvement. Several organisations argued that Russian DDoS botnets were involved in the attacks (Nazario 2008a). These ‘anti-social' networks were also used to coordinate attacks on a wider range of opposition media sites. These included Charter 97, an English language news site on political activities in Belarus; BelPartyzan, a local news website and the Russian language information sites, legis-group.ru and compromat.net.\n\nThe botnets used in the Belarus DDoS attacks were normally used for criminal activities; in particular to generate spam and phishing emails. The blurred boundary between cyber-crime and state-sponsored cyber-attacks is a feature of many case studies in this paper (Nazario 2008a, 2008b, 2008c). Government agencies provide implicit support for criminal groups, who develop the infrastructures to support future attacks. However, the links are informal. Criminal groups may act for patriotic reasons or to ensure continued implicit state approval; in either case, it seems clear that anti-social networks have been forged between state agencies and cyber-attackers (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010; Johnson 2012).\n\nThe RFE/RL case study also illustrates the resilience of information infrastructures. The cyber-attacks did not bring the services ‘to their knees'. Several local websites in Belarus offered to carry content for RFE/RL before they could recover. By 28 April, most of the RFL/RE sites had been restored with significant improvements in their security infrastructures. The Radio Svaboda site administrators were also able to gain technical support from communities around the globe. In particular, help was received from several groups interested in maintaining the freedom of expression across the Internet. This provides a precursor to the collective action seen during the ‘Arab Spring' of 2011. The uprisings and unrest in Algeria,",
    "Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Syria, Tunisia and Yemen were all influenced by the use of social media. Attempts by many states to disrupt Internet communications did not prevent opposition groups from disseminating messages using externally hosted sites. The attacks on RFE/RL provide an early example of the ‘social resilience' of communications infrastructures in response to cyber-attacks.\n\nThe Estonian case study showed that social networks could be used to coordinate cyber-attacks using crowd-sourcing techniques in response to political conflict. In contrast, Table 1 has shown that hacktivism was not a significant part of the cyber-attacks on RFE/RL. In contrast, DDoS attacks were launched by criminal botnets used to generate spam messages with an obvious impact on working lives around the globe. State agencies did not close down these anti-social networks, arguably, because they knew they could be recruited to launch cyber-attacks without the need to implicate government information infrastructures. Previous ergonomic studies tend to focus on the symptoms associated with these botnets, in terms of the impact of nuisance messages. Very few have considered the criminal and political context that sustains the dark side of the Internet.\n\n## 4. Lithuania, June 2008\n\nThe cyber-attacks on Estonia and Lithuania both had their roots in the tensions that arose following the break-up of the Soviet bloc. The right-wing Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats introduced a series of amendments to prohibit the public display of Soviet or Nazi insignia and were subsequently elected to power in November 2008. This created the background for conflict as the Russian Federation began to reassert influence on the Baltic states (Pääbo 2008). The immediate passage of the amendments did not seem to trigger the same level of hostility in the local Russian population, as had been observed amongst ethnic Russians in Estonia (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010). However, President Medvedev joined with the Belarusian President Lukashenka to express the Russian Federation's concern over the legislation. There were simultaneous protests outside the Lithuanian embassy in Moscow accompanied by a significant number of cyber-attacks. Some 300 websites were defaced by anti-Lithuanian slogans and by pro-Soviet symbols that would have been banned under the 2008 amendments.\n\nThe attacks were first detected on 28 June, peaking between 17:00 and 18:00 EET on Sunday 29 June. Companies and government websites were targeted ranging from the Lithuanian equivalent of the Securities and Exchange Commission to the web portal for the Lithuanian Social Democratic Party. By 2 July, most of the sites were able to resume normal operation.\n\nAfter independence, successive governments had encouraged the development of information infrastructures across Lithuanian, for instance through the Information Society Development Programme. Almost half of all households possessed a computer at the time of the attack, and one-third of government organisations had a web presence. However, companies suffered the most. The Lithuanian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-LT) had warned government agencies on a list of ‘at-risk' organisations after an Estonian TV channel had reported the possibility of a cyber-attack on 26 July. Commercial organisations did not receive the warning because they had not been included on the initial list. CERTs have been established by governments around the globe to increase resilience to cyber-attacks. The Lithuanian CERT had been established around 18 months before the web servers were defaced.\n\nThe Lithuanian attacks show how CERTs can develop networks of potential targets to ensure that warnings are propagated to at-risk organisations. This case study also illustrates the need for government agencies to actively monitor social media for intelligence about potential attacks and for forensic information in the aftermath of a cyber-incident. CERT-LT traced most of the targets back to Hostex, one of the largest web hosting services in Lithuania. The forensic analysis showed that once the vulnerability had been identified, all Hostex users were targeted. CERT-LT assisted the Hostex engineers as they worked to mitigate the effects of the attacks. The modes of attack resemble those used in both Estonia and Belarus. Initial reports focused on vulnerabilities in PHP servers that were then used to run a series of scripts distributed amongst a small group of attackers. However, other modes of attack included the generation of large amounts of spam email linking to ‘Hackers United against External Threats to Russia', which resembled the use of botnets in the previous case studies (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010).\n\nCERT-LT and RRT, the Lithuanian communications regulatory authority, identified the use of proxy servers to the East. It seemed “likely that the attacks were organised in advance, considering the fact that signals, invitations, and agitation were spread on the Internet prior to the attacks. However, the RRT refused to speak of any particular countries as the initiator of the attack. (Tikk, Kaska, and Vihul 2010)” Subsequent analysis identified compromised hosts in France and Sweden as possible sources for the defacement attacks suggesting that they had been planned in advance. However, as in Belarus, the Lithuanian attacks might also have used servers that had already been violated for other cyber-crime activities.",
    "Circumstantial evidence for the involvement of Russian hacking groups is provided by discussions on Internet forums, such as hack-wars.ru. However, direct proof was difficult to obtain. For example, the Cyber Police Unit of the Lithuanian Police argued that the attackers had used the Tor ‘onion routing' protocols. Tor is used by journalists, whistle-blowers and law enforcement agencies to prevent monitoring of Internet traffic. It relies on ‘onion routing'; this refers to the use of encryption at multiple layers of a communication network. The Lithuanian attacks illustrate a number of common themes across many of the incidents in this paper. Attribution was complicated by the lack of direct evidence for state involvement and by the participation of ‘hacking groups' communicating over Internet forums and social media.\n\n## Georgia, August 2008\n\nThe fourth case study forms part of the armed conflict between Georgia and the Russian Federation over Ossetia. Although this region straddles the Caucasian mountains, North Ossetia was ceded to the Soviet Union, whereas the area south of the mountains became part of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic (GSSR). Fighting broke out between Georgian forces and South Ossetia (1991--1992) and then in Abkhazia (1992--1994). In consequence, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) formed a peacekeeping force in 1992 with troops from Russia, Georgia and South Ossetia. The composition of this peacekeeping force did little to reduce animosity between the various factions (European Commission 2009). This was exacerbated by Moscow's concern when the Bush administration provided assistance for the Georgian forces to clear Chechen fighters from the Pankisi valley. By April 2008, large-scale military exercises were being conducted on both sides of the border. Fighter aircraft and UAVs began to patrol ‘demilitarised' areas.\n\nOn 7 August 2008, Georgian forces attacked the town of Tskhinvali and surrounding areas in response to an alleged Russian invasion. By 8 August, the Russian air force was attacking infrastructures, targets included Tbilisi airport radar, railroad junctions and telecommunications facilities. By 10 August, the Georgian Government declared a unilateral ceasefire and announced its intention to withdraw Georgian forces from South Ossetia. By 11 August, Russian troops had crossed the boundaries of Ossetia and entered a number of Georgian towns. On 12 August, French President Sarkozy travelled to Moscow and Tiblisi, representing the European Council. He proposed a six-point peace plan that ultimately led to a ceasefire. By 22 August, Russian troops had withdrawn from their positions beyond the former boundaries of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.\n\nThe most obvious difference with Estonia and Lithuania is that the Georgian cyber-attacks coincided with a physical offensive. The effects were also different. More than 50% of the Estonian population were active users of the Internet. In contrast, this figure was close to 30% in Lithuania but only 10% in Georgia. However, the impact on Georgia was greater because most of their information infrastructures passed through the Russian territory (Zmijewski 2008). Georgia was aware of these communication vulnerabilities and wanted to develop trade opportunities with the EU. Most Internet traffic was deliberately routed via Turkish or Azerbaijan service providers. Work had almost been completed on a high capacity link with Bulgaria before the invasion.\n\nThe initial wave of cyber-attacks on the Georgian government infrastructures occurred before the armed conflict. These included ICMP floods and spurious HTTP ‘GET' requests similar to the techniques used in Estonia (Nazario 2008b). Targets included www.president.gov.ge, where images of Adolf Hitler were substituted for pictures of President Saakashvili. A collage of dictators was also placed on the National Bank of the Republic of Georgia's site. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs portal was attacked as were newspaper and media agencies in Georgia and Azerbaijan. Meanwhile, the DDoS attacks were aimed at government sites, including the Parliament and Ministry of Education and Science and the banks. The DDoS statistics gathered during the Georgian attacks were also similar to those for Estonia. Most attacks lasted from 2 to 6 h.\n\nIntelligence agencies had learned from events in Estonian and were better equipped to monitor the attack patterns against Georgia. Several botnets were involved, including the MachBot controller for an HTTP-based botnet attack coordinated by Russian herders. Many aspects of the attacks in Estonia and Georgia have been linked to the Russian Business Network (RBN) criminal organisation and associated botnets. The accuracy of this claim is understandably difficult to establish, as is the nexus between the founder of the RBN and Russian government agencies. It may be that the RBN provided access to botnet resources without mounting the DDoS attacks; following a ‘business model' that supported their wider activities (Grey Goose 2008). However, it is dangerous to assume that involvement in an attack provides reliable evidence about its coordination (Tikk et al. 2008). At least one of the botnets' command and control servers was located in the USA.\n\nThere is also evidence that social media was used to support ‘crowdsourcing' similar to that seen in Estonia: “a downloadable script to ping flood Estonian websites (both DNS and IPs) was shared on various Russian language message boards. Instructions on how to ping flood Georgian government websites were also distributed on Russian language websites and",
    "message boards, as well as lists of Georgian sites vulnerable to remote SQL injections, facilitating automatic defacement of them. (Tikk et al. 2008).”\n\nSQL injections occur because commands written in one language may be hidden inside the instructions of another. If the input is not correctly filtered for embedded command sequences, then these can be inadvertently executed by higher layers of an application. The email addresses of prominent Georgian politicians, academics and industrialists were also distributed. These were used to focus spamming and more targeted forms of attack (Tikk et al. 2008). Major figures had to create new email accounts and re-establish their social networks in a piecemeal fashion, at a time when their attention should have been focused on the invasion.\n\nThe response to the attacks was coordinated by CERT Georgia. Their analysis of Internet Protocol (IP) data was supported by Estonian, French and Polish counterparts. However, many of the targets of the cyber-attacks simply waited. Normal commercial activities were curtailed by the armed conflict. Some websites mitigated the impact of the attacks by temporarily changing IP addresses. Others used international hosts; Blogspot.com supported Georgian news and government agencies. The websites of the Georgian President and their Ministry of Defence were relocated to a company in Atlanta, GA, USA. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs moved to an Estonian server. These counter-measures had limited effects inside Georgia. Flood attacks on Caucasus Network Tbilisi caused significant bottlenecks exacerbated by damage to network infrastructures inside the war zone; many Georgian Internet connections ran through Russia.\n\nThese case studies illustrate a complex relation between ICT maturity and the vulnerability to cyber-attacks. The more a nation depends upon networked services, then the more vulnerable it can be to any cyber-incident. The Estonian public relied on the Internet for a host of government and financial services. The impact on Georgia was more limited. Equally, the more a nation depends upon networked services, then the more resilient it will be to any cyber-incident. Less mature nations find it harder to bring their electronic infrastructures back online. In Georgia, the attacks forced the suspension of electronic banking services for 10 days rather than the hours of interruption seen in Estonia.\n\nIt is difficult to underestimate the psychological impact of a combined attack on both physical and digital infrastructures. Tikk et al. (2008) observe that “while the attacks did not have a permanent or even a long-run devastating effect on the Georgian Internet infrastructure, the damage caused by the attacks was most acutely experienced at the time when Georgia was the most dependent on the availability of their information channels.”\n\nThe synchronisation of the physical and virtual attacks reinforced the vulnerability of the Georgian government to external forces.\n\nThe Georgian case study also shows how cyber-conflicts can extend across different social networks. Russian hacking groups were implicated in the initial attacks on Georgian government infrastructures. In contrast, hacking groups inside Georgia also became the targets of cyber-attacks. The www.hacking.ge website was an early victim. This removed a potential source of advice and information about ways to increase the resilience of Georgian networks. Alternatively, it can be seen as part of a direct conflict between hacking/hacking networks in Russia and Georgia. Russian sites also seem to have been the target of secondary attacks, such as that operated by the RIA Novosti news outlet (Nazario 2008c).\n\nTable 1 has summarised the diverse role that various forms of social networks played in the Georgian attacks. As can be seen, crowdsourcing was used through the distribution of scripts and lists of potential victims. Social networks were also used to distribute information about individuals who were then deliberately the target of spamming attacks. Finally, botnets were used to coordinate DDoS attacks. However, unlike previous case studies, there is evidence to suggest the conflict extended between hacking networks on both sides of the conflict.\n\n## 6. China, GhostNet, March 2009\n\nThere are similarities between the first four case studies; the Estonian, Belarusian, Lithuania and Georgian attacks all stemmed from the break-up of the Soviet Union. All four involved politically motivated DDoS attacks supported by the use of criminal botnets. In all four cases, the victims were able to use networks of contacts and sympathisers to recover from the attacks within hours. In contrast, the fifth case study focuses on ‘advanced persistent threats' (Daly 2009). As the term suggests, this form of attack requires greater coordination and planning. APTs also illustrate how a new generation of cyber-threats uses social networks to deliberately focus their attacks on particular individuals. Information about an individual's online contacts can be exploited by ‘socially engineered malware'.\n\nThis case study focuses on the violation of computers in more than 100 countries. Although the evidence is circumstantial, it seems likely that these attacks were coordinated by groups inside the People's Republic of China as part of the wider policy of active defence (IWM 2009). Subsequent sections of this paper will describe similar techniques exploited by agencies in Europe and North America. However, this case study considers targets in the foreign ministries of Iran, Bangladesh, Latvia, Indonesia, Philippines, Brunei, Barbados and Bhutan; embassies in India, South Korea, Indonesia,",
    "Romania, Cyprus, Malta, Thailand, Taiwan, Portugal, Germany and Pakistan; the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Secretariat and the Asian Development Bank. The attacks also compromised computers in news organisations and a range of commercial organisations.\n\nThese attacks seemed to follow a common pattern; a Trojan horse was introduced onto a victim's machine that would then exfiltrate information to control servers, ultimately reporting back to Chinese sources. These data would include information about the victim's social networks that could then be used by spear phishing attacks. Their email account would be used to send a malicious payload to the individuals in their contact list (Nagaraja and Anderson 2009). The success of the approach depended upon convincing the recipient to open the attached document containing the malware. People are far more likely to open an attachment if it comes from a friend or colleague. Once opened, this attachment would compromise the next link in the social network. The terms ‘social malware', ‘social engineering' and ‘spear phishing' describe the use of information about the target's network of contacts. The aim is to increase the plausibility of the email vector. In some cases, legitimate messages were simply reused. In other cases, documents were taken from other compromised machines and then passed to new targets with the embedded malware to increase the probability that they would, in turn, infect their machines.\n\nThis modus operandi was christened the ‘GhostNet'; it was identified following investigations on behalf of the Office of the Dalai Lama (IWM 2009). Sympathisers were detained by Chinese officials who seemed to have knowledge of their Internet communications. Many sympathisers used Tencent QQ to spread information about the Tibetan cause; this is the most widespread instant messaging service in mainland China. Voice over IP applications might also have been compromised. The Office of the Dalai Lama, therefore, installed network monitoring software to gather additional forensic evidence. They found that infected machines would exchange information with command and control servers -- to download updated versions of the malware and send data out of the local networks: “(This) led to the discovery of four control servers and six command servers ... The control servers were then probed and web-based control interfaces were identified on four control servers, which allowed us to view and control the network. The system was actively monitored for 2 weeks, which allowed us to derive an extensive list of infected systems, and to also monitor the systems operator(s) as the operator(s) specifically instructed target computers. (IWM 2009)”The IP addresses associated with most of these servers were traced to China. Several were located on the island of Hainan, home to the Lingshui signals intelligence facility and the Third Technical Department of the People's Liberation Army. However, other servers were traced to the USA, Sweden, South Korea and Taiwan. This illustrates the complexity of attribution.\n\nA subsequent analysis of the web servers that were used to coordinate the GhostNet Trojan's undermined arguments that they were maintained by government agencies. Instead, they used QQ instant messaging numbers to trace the sites back to members of the Chinese hacking community (Henderson 2009). These studies concluded that patriotic hacking and cybercrime may have played a role in the development of these attacks (Villeneuve 2010). Further circumstantial evidence of the anti-social networks that connect hacking groups was provided by the reuse of techniques associated with the earlier Enfal Trojan within the Ghostnet attacks. Code seems to have been exchanged between different groups of programmers working with a similar but distinct malware. The case studies in this paper provide parallels between twenty-first century cyber-crime and seventeenth century piracy. They illustrate a privateering model, in which governments authorise private individuals to attack enemies of the state. Further investigations concluded that two or three different groups were using different command and control infrastructures to support multiple forms of attack on opposition groups (IWM 2009, 2010).\n\nForensic analysis of the GhostNet attacks illustrates the dual nature of social networks in cyber-security. Victims were targeted using spear-phishing techniques that deliberately exploited information about their social networks (Wasserman and Galaskiewicz 1994). Conversely, the perpetrators of the attack were traced by monitoring connections between different groups of attackers, for instance across Baidu: “(these attacks were) to a large degree organised and operated through the misuse of social networking and cloud computing platforms, including Google, Baidu, Yahoo!, and Twitter, in addition to traditional command and control servers ... although we are able to piece together circumstantial evidence that provides the location and possible associations of the attackers, their actual identities and motivations remain illusory. We catch a glimpse of a shadow of attribution in the cloud, in other words, but have no positive identification ... there is a generational shift unfolding in malware networks in multiple dimensions, from what were once primarily simple to increasingly complex, adaptive systems spread across redundant services and platforms, and from criminal and industrial-based exploitation to political, military, and intelligence-focused espionage. (IWM 2010)”\n\nCloud-based infrastructures and web mail services support these new forms of attack. Free or low-cost hosting services with minimal background checks enable the development of command and control servers that can be used to update malware and coordinate the exfiltration of data. If the security of these servers is compromised, then they can quickly be abandoned at almost no cost. In these circumstances, the Trojans used social networking sites, including Twitter, Google Groups, Blogspot, Baidu Blogs and blog.com accounts, to access links to the new free hosting accounts that replaced the compromised command and control servers (Nazario 2009). As a final resort, the malware could contact more stable servers",
    "in China; these would then point the malware back to an alternate disposable hosting service reducing the chances of further detection (IWM 2010).\n\nThe (ab)use of social networking and Cloud infrastructures to implement command and control servers was compounded through the indirection provided by the Tor anonymity network. This technique was mentioned in our third case study; the Cyber Police Unit of the Lithuanian Police found that Tor had been used to disguise the attacks on their government servers. Tor passes communications through various volunteer servers to prevent others from identifying the origin of a message. When researchers monitored unencrypted data leaving the Tor network, they found some of it related to the Dalai Lama's office. Because these messages did not originate from the Office of the Dalai Lama, they concluded that the information was most probably being forwarded to Tor as the attackers tried to disguise the compromised machines (IMW 2010).\n\nThe GhostNet attacks again illustrate the need to increase links between the field of Ergonomics and cyber-security. Social-media provide significant benefits across a broad range of industries (Manyika, Chui, and Sarrazin 2012). They enable networks of contacts to work together across national borders and between diverse organisations. At the same time, Cloud computing techniques are providing low-cost methods to coordinate distributed work, for instance, through the development of shared, virtual infrastructures. However, these innovations have created new vulnerabilities. Malware now makes use of social media to obtain information about personal contacts. There are then used to propagate spear-phishing attacks where a malicious payload is disguised within email that is deliberately tailored for a recipient within a social network. Similarly, Cloud and web mail infrastructures provide the disposable technologies that enable the rapid development of command and control servers. These are used to upload more recent versions of malware and also to forward data extracted from a victim's machine. They reduce the likelihood of detection because they can be abandoned without cost should an attack be discovered. Table 1 has summarised the role of social networks and their supporting technologies within the GhostNet attacks. A key motivation for writing this paper is to encourage more active research within the field of Ergonomics to increase our resilience to these forms of attack. The solutions are unlikely to be purely technical; these forms of attack undermine the trust of victims in their information infrastructures. Unless more is carried out to make individuals and groups aware of the potential threats, there is a risk that the dark side of the Internet will limit the further development of the digital economy. Many companies now prohibit staff from accessing social media on any device that is used within their networks -- including applications that are specifically intended to support business networks (Markelj and Bernik 2012).\n\n## W32.STUXNET, March 2010\n\nThe case studies in this paper provide a spectrum from the mass DDoS attacks that relied on hacktivism and crowdsourcing in Georgia, Estonia, Latvia and Belarus, to the more focussed techniques that were deployed against the social networks of Chinese opposition groups. The final case study argues that Stuxnet had an even narrower focus; attacking a particular group of centrifuges within the Iranian nuclear enrichment programme. Social networks again played an important role in the transmission of this malware. It exploited vulnerabilities in the auto-execution mechanisms associated with removable drives, such as USB sticks. In consequence, Stuxnet quickly infected groups of users, including commercial and government organisations, which shared data and applications (Falliere, Murchu, and Chien 2011). One reason for the successful transmission of the malware was that it took steps to cover its tracks. Code was introduced to delete any malware left on a USB stick after the third infection. Stuxnet again illustrates how computer viruses can propagate across social and professional networks.\n\nStuxnet also illustrated the exchange of ‘lessons learned' across anti-social networks. It exploited techniques that had previously been used in the Conficker worm. Stuxnet spread across local area networks, exploiting vulnerabilities in the Windows Print Spooler. The virus would also scan infected computers for security software. In some cases, the malware would inject code into trusted processes, including anti-virus programmes. However, if the security product was considered to be resilient to the attack, then no injection would be attempted. Stuxnet used command and control servers, similar to those identified in the Chinese attacks. These were located in Malaysia and Denmark; connection requests were monitored from over 40,000 unique IP addresses in more than 155 countries. When a new machine was infected, the malware would first test connectivity with a valid address, including www.msn.com. If successful, the malware would first download an update of the virus; three different versions have been identified.\n\nOne of the reasons that Stuxnet was so virulent is that it included a Windows rootkit, providing privileged access to the underlying operating system while at the same time masking the intrusion. It also incorporated four ‘zero-day exploits'. These vulnerabilities in underlying operating systems or network architectures were unknown before the malware was released. The term ‘zero day' indicates that this is the first day when security firms can patch the vulnerability. The number of zero-day attacks in Stuxnet is highly unusual. Using all four at once is wasteful; an attack may be sustained by waiting for the first exploit to be patched before releasing the second and so on.",
    "The attack was focussed against Iran's civil nuclear programmes. Between 2006 and 2010, the United Nations passed six resolutions to prevent them from developing the enrichment technologies to produce military grade uranium. For instance, resolution 1803 (March 2008) banned the export of dual use technologies with nuclear applications to Iran. The term ‘dual use' is important because the enrichment process is essential to develop uranium fuel for civil energy generation, but also for nuclear weapons development. Enrichment relies on cascades of centrifuges that produce successively higher concentrations. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) found evidence that Iran had created at least two strings capable of enriching uranium up to 20% by August 2010. Iran had more than 2.5 tons of low-enriched uranium, which was sufficient to support the development of nuclear weapons using existing centrifuges.\n\nStuxnet targeted the Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) that supervised the Iranian centrifuges. PLCs are not, typically, connected to networks. Instead, they are periodically attached to PCs, and code is downloaded directly onto the controllers. The PLCs are then connected to the centrifuges. In consequence, attackers must first infect the PCs that are used to code the PLCs. Stuxnet focussed on the Siemen's Step 7 PLC programming environment. If Step 7 was not detected on an infected PC, then no actions were taken. If it was detected, then Stuxnet exploited a number of vulnerabilities in the Step 7 environment, including a hard-coded password for its SCADA database. Stuxnet was also able to hook operating system calls to open project files associated with the Siemens application. However, it did not infect all of the Step 7 data. It was only interested in projects that had been used or accessed within the previous three and a half years.\n\nStuxnet monitored, replaced and disguised blocks of Step 7 code being written to PLCs. In order to do this, the malware had to forge the digital signatures that were used to authenticate drivers in the malicious binaries. These were maintained by two Taiwanese companies, which seem to have been the victims of conventional or physical industrial espionage (Matrosov et al. 2010). This is reminiscent of the Georgian case study where the cyber-attack coincident with a physical invasion. In Stuxnet, the cyber-attack was supported by convention forms of espionage.\n\nOnce the malicious code had made the jump from the PCs to the PLCs, it monitored the frequency of the motors attached to the centrifuge. It only attacked systems that operated at frequencies between 807 and 1210 Hz. The malware then triggered a state machine to control the sabotage. After an initial delay of some 13 days, Stuxnet set the maximum frequency to 1410 Hz; 27 days later, this was changed to 2 Hz and then 1064 Hz before the sequence was repeated. The malware acted like a landmine; the intention was not to kill the victim, but to consume finite resources of time and expertise. By analogy, the intention was not to destroy the centrifuges, but to waste the Iranian engineering resources as teams of workers had to repair affected components and identify the source of the problems. The IAEA reported signs of damage to around 900 centrifuges during the period when Stuxnet was active. However, independent studies suggest that Iran was able to increase uranium enrichment in spite of this cyber-attack (Amarelo 2011). They were resilient to the cyber-attack, just as the victims were in our previous case studies. One interpretation of this conflicting evidence is that Iranian authorities deliberately exaggerated the impact of the malware to create the impression that greater damage had been inflicted on their nuclear programmes.\n\nThe sophistication of Stuxnet suggests that it was developed by a network of engineers. Not only did they require a detailed knowledge of the Step 7 environment, but they also needed access to specialist hardware. The malicious payload focused on PLCs using a particular Central Processing Unit; 6ES7-315-2 (series 300). The malware monitored the PLCs' Profibus communications processors looking for frequency converters manufactured by Fararo Paya in Iran and Vacon in Finland. The range of technical skills required by this cyber-attack strongly suggests that Stuxnet was created by a team or network of developers. Stuxnet would have taken from 5 to 30 people around 6 months to prepare (Falliere, Murchu, and Chien 2011). It is remarkable that Stuxnet did not affect any of the registered users for the Step 7 environment. Hence, the development team may have included security agencies as well as representatives of the companies that might otherwise have been affected by the attack. However, this speculation does not preclude the possibility that a small group of committed individuals acted together to create the malware with or without state encouragement.\n\nSome commentators have argued that the preoccupation with Iranian centrifuges has masked the real purpose of the Stuxnet virus (Gaycken 2010). The attacks can be seen as the first field test of a targeted cyber-attack. The widespread dissemination of the virus violated many different systems, but the damage was highly focussed on a very small number of specialist devices. In this interpretation, the real purpose of Stuxnet was to reveal how future cyber-weapons could go beyond the mass DDoS of earlier attacks. In contrast to ‘hacktivist' crowdsourcing in Estonia, Lithuania, Georgia and Belarus, the GhostNet and Stuxnet cyber-attacks required relatively small networks of specialists working together to exploit common features of our everyday working environments -- ranging from USB sticks to social networks and Cloud infrastructures.\n\n## Summary of the use of social media in cyber-attacks\n\nThere are many motivations for a closer engagement between the field of Ergonomics and cyber-security. First, it is important that human factors specialists have a better understanding of the underlying causes of security threats. Cyber-",
    "Ergonomics\n\nsecurity will have an increasing impact on working lives. It is not simply the high-profile security breaches that affect major public and private institutions, but also the everyday irritation created by spam and the continual need to maintain anti-viral systems. Second, it is essential that Ergonomists play a more active role in designing our defences. At present, we are faced with a bewildering array of firewalls, passwords and access control mechanisms that frustrate our working tasks and, as we have seen, provide limited protection against emerging threats. Third, in order to understand the threat posed by recent generations of malware, it is important to understand core concepts within the field of Ergonomics. It is important to understand that social networks support new forms of attack, for instance helping hackers exchange successful techniques. Social networks can also increase resilience, bringing together technical support in the aftermath of an attack. There remains significant work to be carried out – both in inhibiting the growth of anti-social networks and promoting the interactions that will help us recover from future threats.\n\nFigure 1 provides an overview of the roles that social networking plays in cyber-attacks. The Estonian, Georgian and Lithuanian case studies show that crowd-sourcing supports DDoS attacks, by exchanging malware and lists of potential targets between groups of sympathisers. Social networking provided patriotic groups with both the motivation and technical direction to implement the attacks. In these incidents, the attribution problem was complicated because it is impossible to determine whether state intervention sustained the groups who launched the attacks.\n\nSecond, governments can exploit informal links with anti-social criminal networks during cyber-attacks. In particular, they can make use of criminal resources to attack third-party infrastructures. Russian botnets played an important part in the Belarus case study. The use of existing criminal networks hides state intervention. The attribution problem is complicated because botnets exploit various forms of indirection to mask command and control infrastructures. This is only one example of the social networks that support cyber-attacks. Malware is often exchanged between criminal networks who reuse techniques exposing previous vulnerabilities. Stuxnet exploited vulnerabilities in the IP exploited by Conficker.\n\nSocial networks have also been used to infer inter-personal relationships that can then be exploited by malware, for example using spear phishing techniques. The recipient is more likely to open an infected attachment or link if it has been\n\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\nFigure 1. Different stages in the use of social networking for cyber-attacks.",
    "C.W. Johnson\n\nsent from a trusted source. The Chinese case studies have shown that politically motivated attacks, therefore, draw heavily on identity theft in wider areas of cyber-crime. Intelligence agencies now routinely monitor interactions over social media (IWM 2009).\n\nFinally, I have shown how the infrastructures associated with social networking create disposable architectures to coordinate attacks, for example through the development of command and control servers used by Stuxnet. The ubiquitous nature of these architectures makes it difficult to determine who owns and operates the servers. Similarly, the use of anonymity servers in the Lithuanian and GhostNet attacks shows how systems that support confidential interaction also support the dark side of the Internet.\n\n# 9. A roadmap for social media in cyber defence\n\nThis paper provides a roadmap for future resilience to the abuse of social media in cyber-attacks. I have identified existing threats – for example through crowdsourcing in DDoS attacks and through the social monitoring that directs spear phishing. I have also identified ways in which social networks can help organisations resist and recover from attacks. For instance, I have seen how the Estonian media identified Internet groups that were encouraging participation in a cyber-attack on Lithuania (stages 1 and 2 in Figure 1). In consequence, the national CERT alerted government agencies. However, organisations that had not registered with their Computer Emergency Response Team did not receive the warning. This illustrates the continuing need to develop networks for the dissemination of the best practices to increase resilience against future cyber-threats.\n\nFigure 2 presents our roadmap for the use of social media in mitigating the threat of cyber-attacks. It is more complex than the overview of social media in previous security incidents, illustrated in Figure 1. This is because the first diagram was based on evidence drawn from the case studies presented in this paper, using the action-based methodology from the opening sections. Figure 2 is more tentative. I have hypothesised the ways in which social media might increase resilience to future attacks. The roadmap is intended as a starting point. In particular, the diagram must be refined in response to new threats. Previous sections have described how malware exploits technologies that originally supported a wide range of end-user tasks. For instance, Cloud-based file-stores and web mail services provide flexible, virtual information infrastructures. These same technologies have also been used to create disposable command and control infrastructures. If we cannot develop a more sophisticated appreciation of the security risks that stem from the abuse of future infrastructures, then we will continue to react as cyber-attacks evolve to exploit new vulnerabilities.\n\nThe first element of the roadmap in Figure 2 focuses on the monitoring of social media. This can be broken down into a number of concerns. Monitoring provides advanced warning of hacktivism, especially when 'politically motivated' cyberattacks reuse infrastructures that support conventional forms of cyber-crime, including identity theft. The reuse of botnets\n\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)\nFigure 2. Roadmap for the use of social networking for cyber defence.",
    "and many of the zero-day exploits described in previous sections were discussed on social media before they were used on political targets. Our work reiterates the need for intelligence agencies to identify intersections between political groups and the wider population of cyber-criminals using social network analysis tools.\n\nThe second stage of the road map reinforces links with existing security management systems through risk assessment for cyber defence. Risk assessment is important because, at present, it is not performed in an organised or systematic way by many of the potential targets of cyber-attacks. Public--private networks have been used by many states as a cost-effective means of encouraging commercial and public bodies to increase their resilience to future attacks. Companies and government agencies are encouraged to work together in developing contingency plans based on the risk assessments that identify potential cyber-threats. Unfortunately, this approach has not worked very well (Johnson 2012). Many companies have been enthusiastic participants. Many others have abstained. Even those that were initially enthusiastic have not sustained their interest.\n\nSocial networking provides one means of addressing these concerns. For example, the UK government is promoting Warning, Advice and Reporting Points; see www.warp.gov.uk. These groups use electronic resources to send personalised warnings and advice across a network of members. Each WARP focuses on a particular community with similar security requirements; ‘Their purpose is to provide a specific community with the capability to share security related information -- both problems and solutions -- and thereby to develop more secure and responsive environments'. The third element of the road map, therefore, focuses on the use of social media to disseminate early warnings about potential cyber-attacks.\n\nIssuing community warning about future attacks provides limited benefits unless they are accompanied by appropriate actions. Drills and exercises help to audit the resilience provided by these mechanisms. Too often, these drills assume perfect conditions for CERTs and other state agencies to respond to potential attacks. However, the Georgian invasion shows that cyber-incidents coincide with adverse circumstances. By developing wider communities of interest in cyber-security, by encouraging participation in drills and exercises, we can also obtain evidence of vulnerabilities and the consequences of future attacks that provide persuasive data to encourage wider participation in these initiatives.\n\nThe penultimate stage in the roadmap focuses on the use of social networks in forensic analysis after an attack has occurred (Johnson, in press). At present, it is extremely difficult to detect the early stages of an attack. A range of network monitoring companies, mostly located in the USA, provide detailed information on connectivity failures in the aftermath of DDoS attacks. However, CERTs cannot use these post hoc studies to trigger a more active response once an attack is underway. Greater benefits could be derived from research into the particular patterns that have characterised the initial stages of previous attacks, for example using abnormal Border Gateway Protocol events. The real-time identification of an attack is not simply a technical exercise but requires input from a range of different experts given the costs and consequences that are associated with false alarms. Closing down an infrastructure in case an attack may occur requires operational, managerial and regulatory expertise.\n\nThe final stage of the roadmap for using social media to increase resilience to cyber-attacks focuses on the identification and dissemination of lessons learned. At present, this remains an ad hoc process (He and Johnson 2012). Many stakeholders remain ignorant of the extent of previous attacks, especially outside their own national borders. Further problems arise when vested interests exaggerate the impact of cyber-attacks; this alienates engineering staff who play a vital role in implementing potential mitigations. As we have seen, reports that cyber-attacks will ‘bring a nation to its knees' cannot be justified on the evidence of previous incidents.\n\nArguably, the greatest vulnerability identified in our work has been the difficulty that managers and operators have in obtaining clear information about previous attacks. Strong contrasts can be drawn between the lack of information in this and the plethora of accident and incident reports published across safety-related industries. Of course, it can be argued that the wider dissemination of this information might encourage future attacks. However, this argument ignores the anti-social networks that have already sprung up to disseminate the technical information that can be used to launch future attacks.\n\n## Conclusions and further work\n\nThis paper provides a new perspective on the wider topics addressed in this special issue looking beyond human-centred automation. The aim has been to identify threats to human--machine interaction in multi-layered networks. Previous sections have argued that the growing complexity of socio-technical systems and the interpenetration of formerly separate systems via IT infrastructures create new opportunities for social interaction. It also creates new vulnerabilities.\n\nSocial networks have motivated individuals to participate in mass Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. They have disseminated information and provided resources, including lists of targets and malicious code. Second, political groups have launched attacks using infrastructures that are normally associated with wider forms of cyber-crime, including botnets. Third, I have shown how information about an individual's social networks has helped to target spear phishing. Malware is, typically, disguised in a document that was intercepted from a colleague or friend. The recipient is more likely to open an",

Finally, I have shown how the development of Cloud infrastructures and social networking applications has created disposable architectures for the command and control servers that coordinate malware attacks. The ubiquitous and distributed nature of these architectures makes it increasingly difficult to determine who owns and operates these systems. I have gone on to identify a roadmap for the defensive measures that might be used to minimise the future threats from the 'dark side' of social networking. Several of our case studies have illustrated the 'social resilience' of communications infrastructures; victims have been able to crowd-source support from overseas governments, from civil liberties groups and from sympathisers around the globe as they seek to recover from the immediate aftermath of a cyber-attack.\n\nTable 2 shows that the case studies were motivated by political conflict and that none had the long-term impact many fear will be the consequence of state-sponsored cyber-attacks. There are many reasons for this – most incidents affected information systems that could quickly be restored once an attack had been diagnosed. Stuxnet is a notable exception because it deliberately damaged physical systems. Even here, the Iranian authorities were able to resume enrichment activities after a relatively short period of time. However, past resilience is no basis for future complacency. This paper has shown how cyber-attacks continue to evolve. Technical innovations, intended to increase productivity and support interaction, are easily adapted to support the dark side of the Internet.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThe author would like to thank the editors and reviewers of this special edition for their valuable encouragement and for feedback on early versions of this paper.

    "abstract": "There are many motivations for a closer engagement between the field of Ergonomics and cyber-security. First, it is important that human factors specialists have a better understanding of the underlying causes of security threats. Cyber- Ergonomics security will have an increasing impact on working lives. It is not simply the high-profile security breaches that affect major public and private institutions, but also the everyday irritation created by spam and the continual need to maintain anti-viral systems. Second, it is essential that Ergonomists play a more active role in designing our defences. At present, we are faced with a bewildering array of firewalls, passwords and access control mechanisms that frustrate our working tasks and, as we have seen, provide limited protection against emerging threats. Third, in order to understand the threat posed by recent generations of malware, it is important to understand core concepts within the field of Ergonomics. It is important to understand that social networks support new forms of attack, for instance helping hackers exchange successful techniques. Social networks can also increase resilience, bringing together technical support in the aftermath of an attack. There remains significant work to be carried out – both in inhibiting the growth of anti-social networks and promoting the interactions that will help us recover from future threats. Figure 1 provides an overview of the roles that social networking plays in cyber-attacks. The Estonian, Georgian and Lithuanian case studies show that crowd-sourcing supports DDoS attacks, by exchanging malware and lists of potential targets between groups of sympathisers. Social networking provided patriotic groups with both the motivation and technical direction to implement the attacks. In these incidents, the attribution problem was complicated because it is impossible to determine whether state intervention sustained the groups who launched the attacks. Second, governments can exploit informal links with anti-social criminal networks during cyber-attacks. In particular, they can make use of criminal resources to attack third-party infrastructures. Russian botnets played an important part in the Belarus case study. The use of existing criminal networks hides state intervention. The attribution problem is complicated because botnets exploit various forms of indirection to mask command and control infrastructures. This is only one example of the social networks that support cyber-attacks. Malware is often exchanged between criminal networks who reuse techniques exposing previous vulnerabilities. Stuxnet exploited vulnerabilities in the IP exploited by Conficker. Social networks have also been used to infer inter-personal relationships that can then be exploited by malware, for example using spear phishing techniques. The recipient is more likely to open an infected attachment or link if it has been Figure 1. Different stages in the use of social networking for cyber-attacks. C.W. Johnson sent from a trusted source. The Chinese case studies have shown that politically motivated attacks, therefore, draw heavily on identity theft in wider areas of cyber-crime. Intelligence agencies now routinely monitor interactions over social media (IWM 2009). Finally, I have shown how the infrastructures associated with social networking create disposable architectures to coordinate attacks, for example through the development of command and control servers used by Stuxnet. The ubiquitous nature of these architectures makes it difficult to determine who owns and operates the servers. Similarly, the use of anonymity servers in the Lithuanian and GhostNet attacks shows how systems that support confidential interaction also support the dark side of the Internet.",
