This leads to the question of how such evidence may be used and considered admissible in a judicial proceeding, or more generally in an international dispute, related to a cyber operation.\n\nThe development of State activities in cyberspace, notably offensive cyber operations, has led to international disputes between States. To date, a State has neither disputed a cyber operation before an international court or tribunal nor raised the issue before the UN Security Council. Generally, victim States have chosen to respond through extra-juridical measures, such as cyber countermeasures or measures of retorsion.¹ However, there is the possibility that a State, in future, may bring a charge of harmful cyber operations before an international court or tribunal or before the UN Security Council.\n\nDifferent procedures for the collection, presentation and assessment of evidence exist depending on the international court or tribunal selected and the circumstances of the case.² The assertion presented hereunder is that the International Court of Justice (ICJ) would be the most suitable judicial organ to deal with an international dispute arising from cyber operations conducted by one State against another. Thus, this chapter considers the procedures for the collection and assessment of evidence that may be applied in the event of a case before the ICJ. Before the ICJ, all parties are equal and thus have equal rights to submit and present their legal case. Moreover, each party bears the burden of proof regarding\n\n¹ See infra Chapter 10.\n\n² Rüdiger Wolfrum and Mirka Möldner, ‘International Courts and Tribunals, Evidence’, Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law (MPEPIL), https://opil.ouplaw.com/view/10.1093/law:epil/9780199231690/law-9780199231690-e26 (OUP 2013).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press",

This is particularly crucial regarding cyber conduct, as cyberspace offers numerous opportunities to hide or forge the real paternity of a cyber operation, notably by using proxy computer systems or botnets located in other countries.

For many years, the USA did not officially respond to cyber operations targeting their interests, and thus did not disclose publicly any evidence proving the facts and possible attribution. The 2014 Sony Pictures Entertainment hack marked a watershed in US practice. The American subsidiary of the Japanese conglomerate Sony Corporation was hacked and a significant amount of data was stolen from the company. This data was then publicly released by the hackers in November 2014. The hackers demanded the cancellation of the planned release of the film *The Interview*, a comedy about the assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. US officials alleged that the attack was sponsored by North Korea.⁸ North Korea, however, denied any involvement. The United States indicated that it had evidence of the involvement of North Korea, and the White House announced that it would adopt a proportional response.⁹ In reaction to this cyber operation allegedly executed by North Korea, the United States adopted new sanctions against North Korea; additionally, it is considered having adopted an unofficial covert response in the form of unilateral extrajudicial measures. In this instance, the United States attributed the cyber operation to North Korea and responded to it, without disclosing the evidence.\n\nThe 2016 Democratic National Committee (DNC) hack marked an even bigger watershed in US practice as the United States decided, for the first time, to disclose evidence corroborating the attribution of a cyber operation to another State, the Russian Federation. On 22 July 2016, a few days before the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, Wikileaks published 19,252 emails and 8,034 attachments from the DNC, the governing body of the Democratic Party. The leak contained emails and documents from seven key DNC staff members suggesting that the DNC leadership had worked to advantage Hillary Clinton over Bernie\n\n⁸ David E Sanger and Nicole Perlroth, ‘U.S. Said to Find North Korea Ordered Cyberattack on Sony’, *The New York Times* (17 December 2014) www.nytimes.com/2014/12/18/world/asia/us-links-north-korea-to-sony-hacking.html.\n\n⁹ Dave Boyer, ‘White House Threatens “Proportional” Response to North Korea Cyberattacks on Sony Pictures’, *The Washington Times* (18 December 2014) www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/18/white-house-threatens-proportional-response-north-/\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press",

The recent disclosures of alleged hacked e-mails on sites like DCLeaks.com and WikiLeaks and by the Guccifer 2.0 online persona are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process. Such activity is not new to Moscow – the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there. We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia’s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.^[10]^\n\nOn 10 October 2016, the White House announced that the president was considering a proportional response to the Russian cyber operations.^[11]^ Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, added that ‘[i]t is unlikely that our response would be announced in advance,’ and that ‘the president can choose response options that we never announce’.^[12]^ The US allegations were met with legitimate criticism as no evidence supporting allegations of Russian responsibility for the DNC hack was publicly released.

While this may be only an isolated case, it may also signal an evolution in the US approach: the collection and publication of evidence to support the attribution of cyber operations even outside of the context of a dispute settlement mechanism or judicial proceeding. For this reason, it is more important than ever to study the standards of evidence in international law and how they may be applied to cyber operations.\n\n## 3.2 Evidence in International Law\n\nHistorically, States have used evidence to support their allegations even outside of a judicial proceeding.¹⁴ This has been the practice, for instance, of international fact-finding commissions, such as the ones established after the 2008 armed conflict in Georgia.¹⁵ The development of international justice has strengthened this practice and made the international community demand an increasingly higher standard of proof.\n\nStates increasingly rely on international fact-finding commissions following international incidents that may have led to inter-state disputes, and this development is reflected in various branches and aspects of international law. The crash of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 in Ukraine in 2014 offers an interesting case study regarding State practice on the establishment of fact-finding commissions as well as on the collection and assessment of evidence outside of judicial proceedings. This example is also symptomatic of the challenges posed by technical and scientific evidence.\n\nOn 17 July 2014, Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 departed from Amsterdam-Schiphol Airport towards its destination, Kuala Lumpur. However, the aircraft never reached its destination having crashed in eastern Ukraine, in the Donetsk region. At that time, this area was still the scene of an armed conflict between the combatants of the People's Republic of Donetsk and the Ukrainian army. There were no survivors among the 283 passengers and 15 crew members. The circumstances of the crash were unclear and conflicting narratives were proposed.

The work of the JIT was carried out in close collaboration with the observers of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and the emergency services of the People’s Republic of Donetsk. The team first recovered pieces of the wreckage as well as the black boxes of the aircraft from the separatists and repatriated them to the Netherlands for analysis.¹⁸ The OVV published its final report on 13 October 2015.¹⁹ The analysis of the black boxes, the reconstituted wreckage of the aircraft and other materials collected allowed the OVV to assert that the crash was caused by a surface missile – a 9M38 missile equipped with a 9N314M-type warhead installed on a BUK-type ground-air system – fired from a zone controlled by separatists, but where fighting with the Ukrainian army was underway. The conclusions of the OVV report were highly controversial. Almaz-Antey, the Russian manufacturer of the incriminated BUK missile system, carried out its own investigation, reconstructing in particular the effects of the explosion on a similar aircraft removed from traffic. From this study, it claimed that the missile had been fired from an area under the control of the Ukrainian army.²⁰ Moreover, the Russian Federal Air Transport Agency (Rosaviatsiya) was also sceptical, and stated that it wanted to conduct its own investigation.

Subsequently, the JIT issued a call for witnesses to obtain information on the presence and location of the BUK missile system in the area, which led to the collection of testimony from a large number of individuals. In addition, the JIT listened to telephone tappings of conversations about the missile system. The European Space Agency (ESA) provided satellite imagery and experts to facilitate the work of the investigators. The various testimonies, telephone tappings and satellite images enabled the JIT to conclude that the BUK missile system in question had been brought in from Russian territory and removed on the same day as the disaster. The evidence also allowed the JIT to identify with precision the location from which the missile was fired: an area indeed controlled by the separatists.²¹ The various strands of evidence collected by the JIT helped it to establish the circumstances surrounding the crash of flight MH17. However, the evidence could only do so much; it did not establish the identity of the individuals responsible for the missile firing, nor did it establish whether a State was complicit.\n\nIt is worth noting that some recommend the creation of a centralised mechanism for the attribution of cyber operations, the functioning of which would be similar to that of an international fact-finding investigation. For example, Microsoft published a white paper in 2016 suggesting, among other things, that such a mechanism be created following the model of the investigation mechanism of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).²² They argue that the proposed mechanism would create a synergy between the expertise of States, private actors and academics in order to work together to identify the perpetrators of malicious cyber operations:\n\nThere could be a similar mechanism by which governments and the private sector can provide evidence to support technical attribution and obtain some level of validation through rigorous peer review. At its core, this organization would consist of technical experts from across governments, the private sector, academia, and civil society with the capability to examine tactics, techniques, and procedures used by nation-state attackers, as well as indicators of compromise that suggest a given attack was by\n\n²¹ ‘JIT: MH17 Shot Down with Missile Fired from Pro-Russian Rebel Controlled Field’ (NL Times, 28 September 2016) http://nltimes.nl/2016/09/28/jit-mh17-shot-missile-fired-pro-russian-rebel-controlled-field.\n\n²² Scott Charney et al, ‘From Articulation to Implementation: Enabling Progress on Cybersecurity Norms’ (Microsoft 2016) 10–12 www.microsoft.com/en-us/cybersecurity/content-hub/enabling-progress-on-cybersecurity-norms.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press",

In some cases, based on agreed-upon criteria, it might publish its findings. Some will of course oppose this approach. Governments in particular may be reluctant to empower an independent organization to make findings that may be both politically important and politically charged.²³\n\nIn law, evidence ‘tends to prove the existence or nonexistence of some fact’.²⁴ In the case of cyber operations, the facts are generally articulated around two main axes: the identification of the cyber operation and its consequences and the attribution of the cyber operation.\n\nAs pointed out by the UNGGE in its 2015 report, ‘In case of ICT incidents, States should consider all relevant information, including the larger context of the event, the challenges of attribution in the ICT environment and the nature and extent of the consequences.’²⁵ Indeed, the fact that an investigation relates to a cyber operation does not mean that evidence should be collected solely within cyberspace. Evidence gathered in the real world can also be relevant, even crucial, in determining the facts and attribution of a cyber operation.\n\nEvidence may consist of documentary evidence, physical evidence, expert or witness testimony, and hearsay evidence.

This provision states that a document that can be considered ‘part of a publication readily available’ under Article 56 (4) of the Rules of Court ‘may be in any format (printed or electronic), form (physical or on-line, such as posted on the internet) or on any data medium (on paper, on digital or any other media)’. Practice direction IXbis demonstrates the Court’s openness to digital evidence, without giving further details.\n\n## 3.3.1 Typology of Documentary Evidence That May Be Collected in Relation to Cyber Operations\n\nThe majority of evidence that would be produced by a State regarding a cyber operation, both for the purpose of establishing the facts and for attribution, could be in a written form – i.e. documentary evidence – and would therefore not pose any particular procedural problem in proceedings before a court.\n\nHowever, an important clarification must be made at this stage. This remark concerns only the presentation of evidence and neither its collection and admissibility nor the capacity of judges to assess it. The latter will be analysed later in this chapter.\n\nDuring the event of a cyber operation, a number of traces are usually left and may be collected as evidence. Most of these traces can be presented in the form of written documents to constitute documentary evidence.²⁸\n\nIn the case of a computer virus, the computer code of the virus can be analysed and presented as evidence. Computer codes consisting of multiple lines of code can easily be considered as written evidence.\n\nAdditionally, IP addresses may be collected and presented in a cyber-related dispute. These IP addresses may be used to identify the different computers and servers involved in the cyber operation, either because these computers and servers were used for its launch or transit, or\n\n²⁸ See, for instance, Marco Roscini, ‘Evidentiary Issues in International Disputes Related to State Responsibility for Cyber Operations’ (2015) 50 Texas International Law Journal 233.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press",

The presentation of these IP addresses may be accompanied by the server logs, consisting of lists of activities performed by the relevant servers including the general time of connection of each IP address. These elements may be particularly useful in establishing the facts and timeline.\n\nThese different pieces of evidence are usually summarised in a report that places them in context in order to establish the facts. Moreover, this cyber-related evidence may be accompanied by non-digital evidence aimed, for instance, at establishing the damage suffered by the victim of the cyber operation, or the relationship between the computers involved and individuals and whether these individuals were acting on behalf of a State.\n\nThe purpose of the previous paragraphs was to demonstrate the forms in which digital evidence may be presented during proceedings before an international court or tribunal. The difficulty involved in the identification and collection of this type of evidence should not be underestimated. The process may entail a great deal of technical expertise. A further difficulty in the collection of cyber evidence involves proving the authenticity and integrity of the evidence.²⁹ This is a task reserved for the experts who may take part in the judicial proceedings.\n\nTo date, no dispute between States relating to a cyber operation has given rise to a judicial proceeding. However, in several instances of cyber operations alleged to be either state sponsored or even state conducted, States and non-state actors, such as cybersecurity firms, have collected evidence and presented it in reports detailing these cyber operations and attributing them to groups or individuals. These various reports provide a basis for the analysis of what elements may be presented by a State in the context of a judicial proceeding on a state-sponsored cyber operation.\n\nIn 2013, the US cybersecurity firm Mandiant released a report detailing an investigation on computer security breaches allegedly sponsored by the Chinese government that occurred (between 2004 and 2013) at hundreds of organisations around the world.³⁰ The investigation focused on cyber espionage activities considered to be the result of a single group referred to by the Mandiant teams as APT 1.

To carry out this investigation, Mandiant collected various computer tools, URLs and IP addresses used by APT 1 to perpetrate and relay its cyber operations, and logging data on different servers. This information made it possible to identify the structure and the modus operandi of APT 1:\n\nAPT1 maintains an extensive infrastructure of computer systems around the world.\n\n- APT1 controls thousands of systems in support of their computer intrusion activities.\n- In the last two years we have observed APT1 establish a minimum of 937 Command and Control (C2) servers hosted on 849 distinct IP addresses in 13 countries. The majority of these 849 unique IP addresses were registered to organizations in China (709), followed by the U.S. (109).\n- In the last three years we have observed APT1 use fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) resolving to 988 unique IP addresses.\n- Over a two-year period (January 2011 to January 2013) we confirmed 1,905 instances of APT1 actors logging into their attack infrastructure from 832 different IP addresses with Remote Desktop, a tool that provides a remote user with an interactive graphical interface to a system.\n- In the last several years we have confirmed 2,551 FQDNs attributed to APT1.³¹\n\nOnce the structure and activities of APT 1 were established, Mandiant focused on the question of attribution. Investigators determined that 97 per cent of APT 1's remote access used the 'Chinese (Simplified) – US Keyboard' setting. In addition, 98 per cent of the IP addresses connecting remotely to the computer systems controlled by APT 1 were Chinese and almost all the IP addresses used to communicate with the target computer systems were Chinese and located in the Shanghai area. In addition, investigators were able to identify the computer traces left by three individuals considered to be members of APT 1.³² The elements used to identify these individuals included multiple IP addresses, email addresses, URLs and their respective modus operandi. Using this digital evidence, as well as non-digital evidence related to the functioning of the Chinese army and the identified location, Mandiant concluded that APT\n\n³¹ ibid 4.\n³² ibid 51–58.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press",

It is essential to involve experts who can not only analyse the data but also explain their conclusions to non-specialists of computer science, such as to the parties and judges involved in a judicial proceeding. This issue will be developed in the section dedicated to experts.\n\nThe malware Stuxnet,³⁴ identified in 2010, which physically damaged several centrifuges of an Iranian nuclear plant, and its subsequent investigation, serve as an interesting example. This malware is alleged to have been a joint cyber operation involving the United States and Israel, the purpose of which was to derail the Iranian nuclear programme and force the country to abandon the military dimension of its nuclear ambition. However, neither Iran nor any other State has officially attributed this cyber operation to the United States, Israel or any other State, and no State has claimed paternity for this malware. Stuxnet was first identified in June 2010 by a Belarusian cybersecurity company, VirusBlokAda, and was subsequently analysed by experts from various cybersecurity companies, including Kaspersky and Symantec. The latter published a report detailing the functioning of Stuxnet.³⁵ An important part of this report dug into and analysed the computer code of Stuxnet, and identified two elements that may hint at a potential link between Israel and the malware.\n\nFirstly, they identified the project path ‘b:\\myrtus\\src\\objfre_w2k_x86\\i386\\guava.pdb’ in the driver file. The name of the folder is ‘myrtus’ and one of the files is ‘guava’, guava being a tropical tree of the myrtaceae family – that is to say of the myrtle family. The report further notes that:\n\n³³ ibid 59–60.\n\n³⁴ On Stuxnet see, generally, Kim Zetter, Countdown to Zero Day: Stuxnet and the Launch of the World’s First Digital Weapon (Crown 2014); see also David E Sanger, Confront and Conceal: Obama’s Secret Wars and Surprising Use of American Power (Crown 2012).\n\n³⁵ Nicolas Falliere, Liam O Murchu and Eric Chien, ‘W32.Stuxnet Dossier (Version 1.4)’ (Symantec 2011) www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/w32_stuxnet_dossier.pdf.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press",

Hadassah means “myrtle” in Hebrew.’ Esther learned of a plot to assassinate the king and ‘told the king of Haman’s plan to massacre all Jews in the Persian Empire … The Jews went on to kill only their would-be executioners.’ Symantec cautions readers on drawing any attribution conclusions. Attackers would have the natural desire to implicate another party.³⁶\n\nIn other words, the names ‘myrtus’ and ‘guava’ could hypothetically refer to Queen Esther of the Old Testament, and thus could be understood as a reference to the situation of the Jewish people in Persia, the State that preceded the Islamic Republic of Iran.\n\nSecondly, Stuxnet established a registry key value of 19790509, which would allow Stuxnet’s future intrusion attempts to identify whether the targeted computer was already infected:\n\n[i]f this value is equal to 19790509 the threat will exit. This is thought to be an infection marker or a ‘do not infect’ marker. If this is set correctly infection will not occur. The value may be a random string and represent nothing, but also appears to match the format of date markers used in the threat. As a date, the value may be May 9, 1979. This date could be an arbitrary date, a birth date, or some other significant date. While on May 9, 1979 a variety of historical events occurred, according to Wikipedia ‘Habib Elghanian was executed by a firing squad in Tehran sending shock waves through the closely knit Iranian Jewish community. He was the first Jew and one of the first civilians to be executed by the new Islamic government. This prompted the mass exodus of the once 100,000 member strong Jewish community of Iran which continues to this day.’ Symantec cautions readers on drawing any attribution conclusions. Attackers would have the natural desire to implicate another party.³⁷\n\nIn summary, these two elements found in the lines of the Stuxnet computer code could be references to historical events involving Iran and its Jewish population, and have therefore been analysed by some as implicating Israel in the creation of Stuxnet. These clues and their analysis should nevertheless be treated with caution. While they may point to the responsible party, they may also have been put there deliberately by the creators of the code to lead investigators into wrongly implicating Israel. Thus, this type of evidence should not be considered as clear proof of Israeli responsibility, but merely a nudge in that direction.\n\n³⁶ ibid 24.\n³⁷ ibid 18.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press",

It also shows how important it is to approach technical evidence critically. Cyber operations are indeed a highly technical phenomenon, but this does not mean that their analysis and attribution should be limited to a technical approach. On the contrary, it is essential that, alongside technical experts, experts from other disciplines are also involved in an investigation.\n\n## 3.3.3 The Validity of Unlawfully Collected Evidence\n\nCyberspace is characterised by the interconnection of computer networks, making it possible to remotely access various connected networks and computer systems. This feature makes access to digital evidence easier on a technical level. It also facilitates the task of the perpetrator of a cyber operation wishing to erase or blur their tracks. It is indeed relatively easy for them to access the clues they may have left and to move, manipulate or destroy them.³⁸ It is therefore essential for the victim of a cyber operation wishing to seize and secure potential evidence to act as quickly and thoroughly as possible before the perpetrator erases their tracks. For this reason, investigators must act with a certain discretion so as not to accelerate the perpetrator's attempts to modify and remove the evidence they may have left behind.\n\nOne of the main features of cyberspace that affects the seizure of technical evidence in criminal, terrorist and inter-state cases is the transnational dimension of cyberspace.³⁹ Indeed, a cyber operation conducted or sponsored by one State against another will probably transit through computer systems and networks located in third-party States. The procedure for the collection of technical evidence by the victim State from computer systems and networks located within its territory is governed by that State's domestic law.⁴⁰ Conversely, the collection of evidence from computer systems and networks located abroad (and outside of the victim State's jurisdiction) may be deemed unlawful, and\n\n³⁸ Christiane Féral-Schuhl, *Cyberdroit 2011/2012.

More specifically, it would probably constitute a violation of the latter State’s territorial sovereignty. The wrongfulness of the seizure may nevertheless be mitigated or even precluded when the responsible State can prove that the seizure occurred in the context of a circumstance precluding wrongfulness. For instance, a victim State that seizes evidence from the network of the State responsible for a cyber operation may claim that their seizure of evidence (in violation of the latter State’s jurisdiction) constitutes a countermeasure. However, this may prove a difficult line of defence. The victim State may claim that it was necessary to seize evidence before the responsible State had a chance to remove or tamper with it. The responsible State has a prime opportunity to do so if the victim State requests its cooperation or if the responsible State is aware of the seizure operation. Necessity may be invoked to preclude the wrongfulness of an act performed by a State to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril. It appears thus fragile ground to justify a cyber operation aimed at seizing evidence in the computer systems of another State. The fragility of these two potential justifications for such acts imposes to therefore analyse the admissibility and validity of evidence collected unlawfully.\n\nWould evidence that is illegally obtained be considered legitimate before a court? More specifically, would illegally obtained evidence be admissible in contentious proceedings before the ICJ? There is no answer to this question in the Statute and Rules of the Court. However, in the Corfu Channel case the judges accepted evidence that was unlawfully acquired by the United Kingdom.⁴¹ It must be pointed out, however, that the judges did not rule on the validity of the evidence. In this case, the United Kingdom justified the illegal seizure of the evidence as follows:\n\nAccording to that [United Kingdom] Government, the corpora delicti must be secured as quickly as possible, for fear they should be taken away, without leaving traces, by the authors of the minelaying or by the Albanian authorities.

However, the Court still accepted and considered the illegally obtained evidence. It is interesting to note that the line of defence used by the British government approximates to the one that could be used by a State for the illegal seizure of computer evidence, as discussed above. It is likely that the Court’s position will remain unchanged in a case involving a similar seizure of evidence, and that therefore the wrongfulness of those actions would not be precluded.\n\nThis point is very important because a significant amount of evidence, digital or otherwise, provided by States regarding a cyber operation, could be acquired illegally. With respect to digital evidence, it has already been shown that collection from servers under the jurisdiction of other States (without their consent) may constitute an internationally wrongful act. States could also present evidence collected more or less lawfully by their intelligence services. If espionage is not unlawful under international law, it may give rise to conduct violating certain norms of international law, in particular the territorial sovereignty of the targeted State or the principle of non-intervention.⁴³\n\nThe hack of Sony Pictures Entertainment in 2014 is a good illustration. As seen earlier, the United States attributed this cyber operation to North Korea without publicly presenting evidence supporting their accusation. This lack of evidence could be explained by the fact that the United States was able to identify North Korea as responsible for the cyber operation through the surveillance of North Korean networks by the National Security Agency (NSA).⁴⁴ In other words, the attribution was made possible not by technical evidence collected after the cyber operation, but rather by collecting information on North Korean activities conducted prior to the cyber operation concerned.

In this sense, neither the Statute nor the Rules of Court clarify who may be called as an expert in a case before the ICJ. A definition can be found in the Agreement between the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea and the Federal Republic of Germany regarding the Headquarters of the Tribunal, which states that an ‘expert’ is ‘a person called at the instance of a party to a dispute or at the instance of the Tribunal to present testimony in the form of expert opinions, based on special knowledge, skills, experience or training’ (Article 1(l)).\n\nIn a dispute related to a cyber operation, it is essential to involve experts for two main reasons. Firstly, it is possible that neither the judges nor counsel have the requisite knowledge to understand the technical details of the dispute. Secondly, it is essential that the computer evidence provided by the parties be analysed by qualified experts who can attest to its authenticity and provide the relevant analysis.\n\nIn a case before the ICJ, experts can be involved in four different ways: they may be appointed by the parties; the judges may consult them in an informal manner; or decide to involve them in the proceedings; and finally, it is possible for the judges to appoint assessors who sit in on the proceedings but do not have the right to vote.\n\n## 3.4.1 Experts Appointed by the Parties\n\nMost of the computer-based evidence that may be collected and presented in relation to a cyber operation should be collected and analysed by experts to ensure that it is authentic and to establish the facts in the\n\n⁴⁵ Giorgio Gaja, ‘Assessing Expert Evidence in the ICJ’ (2017) 15 The Law &amp; Practice of International Courts and Tribunals 409, *passim*; Malintoppi (n 27) 430–434.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press",

Consequently, States wishing to collect such evidence will have recourse to experts generally available within the State's computer-security services or through the contracting of private cybersecurity companies. For example, the Democratic Party decided to use the private company CrowdStrike to analyse the hack that it suffered in 2016, and it was on the basis of the evidence gathered by that company that US authorities attributed the cyber operation to Russian intelligence services.\n\nBeyond the investigation, and the process of gathering and analysing evidence, it is essential that experts are involved in the presentation of evidence, especially in the event of a judicial proceeding. Indeed, their participation and their explanations render such evidence intelligible to people who are not familiar with computer science. Their participation in judicial proceedings also permits an adversarial dialogue between the experts of the two parties.\n\n## 3.4.2 'Invisible' Experts Consulted by the Court\n\nThe ICJ, like other international jurisdictions, has to deal with disputes involving an important technical dimension requiring some specific expertise. This is especially the case for border disputes. The subject has been analysed by Robert Yewdall Jennings, who notes that:\n\nthe Court has not infrequently employed cartographers, hydrographers, geographers, linguists, and even specialised legal experts to assist in the understanding of the issue in a case before it; and has not on the whole felt any need to make this public knowledge or even to apprise the parties.^[46]^\n\nIn some cases involving a strong technical dimension, the judges of the ICJ have consulted informal experts to assist them, but these experts were not officially involved in the proceedings. Generally, such experts act as temporary members of the Registry of the Court and their findings are not communicated to the parties or made public.^[47]^\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press",

Under circumstances such as in the present case, adopting such a practice would deprive the Court of the above-mentioned advantages of transparency, openness, procedural fairness, and the ability for the Parties to comment upon or otherwise assist the Court in understanding the evidence before it. These are concerns based not purely on abstract principle, but on the good administration of justice.⁵⁰\n\nA distinction should be drawn between situations in which invisible experts are consulted on technical issues relevant – but not decisive – to the case, and situations in which they may critically influence the outcome of the case.⁵¹ However, this distinction has not yet been made.\n\nThe distinction proposed above would be particularly relevant in a dispute relating to a cyber operation. Judges may have recourse to invisible experts to assist them in their understanding of the functioning of the Internet and relevant computer systems, specifically to help them in developing a general knowledge of the subject matter of the dispute.

Such disputes may involve a significant amount of highly technical evidence, the collection and assessment of which by the parties and by the judges, in the case of judicial proceedings, may be challenging. Conversely, the presentation of technical evidence relating to cyber operations is not particularly challenging, as most of it may be easily presented as documentary evidence.\n\nStates could, however, be reluctant to make such evidence public during judicial proceedings. Firstly, from the point of view of the State, by revealing the collected evidence, it is likely to give indications about its computing capabilities. Secondly, by publicly disclosing information about a cyber operation, there is a risk that the vulnerabilities exploited by this cyber operation would be taken advantage of by other actors to perpetrate cyber operations.

Thus, by revealing during a judicial proceeding the functioning of a cyber operation and the vulnerabilities exploited, the State risks revealing elements that could be used to jeopardise the security and stability of cyberspace. In this context, it may be necessary to consider keeping some evidence confidential in order to safeguard the security and stability of cyberspace.\n\nThe establishment of the facts and the attribution of a cyber operation carry an important technical dimension, but it would be a mistake to reduce them merely to technical processes. It is therefore essential that, alongside the technical experts, experts from other disciplines with a good understanding of the functioning of cyberspace and cyber operations are involved in these processes, and potentially involved in judicial proceedings. Indeed, these experts would help to bridge the technical and legal dimensions of the dispute. This is also the aim of the present chapter, which bridges the technical dimension of attribution analysed in the previous chapter and the legal dimension of attribution studied in the next.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press",

This leads to the question of how such evidence may be used and considered admissible in a judicial proceeding, or more generally in an international dispute, related to a cyber operation.\nThe development of State activities in cyberspace, notably offensive cyber operations, has led to international disputes between States. To date, a State has neither disputed a cyber operation before an international court or tribunal nor raised the issue before the UN Security Council. Generally, victim States have chosen to respond through extra-juridical measures, such as cyber countermeasures or measures of retorsion.¹ However, there is the possibility that a State, in future, may bring a charge of harmful cyber operations before an international court or tribunal or before the UN Security Council.\nDifferent procedures for the collection, presentation and assessment of evidence exist depending on the international court or tribunal selected and the circumstances of the case.² The assertion presented hereunder is that the International Court of Justice (ICJ) would be the most suitable judicial organ to deal with an international dispute arising from cyber operations conducted by one State against another. Thus, this chapter considers the procedures for the collection and assessment of evidence that may be applied in the event of a case before the ICJ. Before the ICJ, all parties are equal and thus have equal rights to submit and present their legal case. Moreover, each party bears the burden of proof regarding\n¹ See infra Chapter 10.\n² Rüdiger Wolfrum and Mirka Möldner, ‘International Courts and Tribunals, Evidence’, Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law (MPEPIL), https://opil.ouplaw.com/view/10.1093/law:epil/9780199231690/law-9780199231690-e26 (OUP 2013).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTHE QUESTION OF EVIDENCE\ntheir case in accordance with the Statute and Rules of the Court.³ In the Minquiers and Ecrehos case, the ICJ specified that ‘each Party has to prove its alleged title and the facts upon which it relies’.⁴\nThe procedure regarding the production and assessment of evidence for a contentious case before the ICJ is prescribed by Articles 48 to 52 of the Statute of the Court⁵ and clarified in the Rules of the Court.⁶ In addition, Practice Directions for use by States, which had appeared before being adopted by the ICJ in 2001, have since been amended several times. While the Practice Directions are non-binding, they clarify procedure before the Court. It must be noted that the ICJ is not bound to the evidence and facts submitted by the parties and may also arbitrarily decide to collect and use evidence autonomously.⁷\nThis chapter is comprised of four sections dealing, respectively, with State practice regarding evidence related to cyber operations (3.1), evidence in international law (3.2), documentary evidence (3.3) and expert opinion evidence (3.4).\n## 3.1 State Practice on Evidence Relating to Cyber Operations\nThe nascent State practice on responding to state-sponsored cyber operations seems to demonstrate that States are increasingly aware of the need to support their accusations with evidence proving the facts and the alleged paternity of the cyber operations concerned. This is particularly crucial regarding cyber conduct, as cyberspace offers numerous opportunities to hide or forge the real paternity of a cyber operation, notably by using proxy computer systems or botnets located in other countries. Some perpetrators have even inserted misleading hints into the computer code of a virus in an attempt to shift the blame onto a third party. This behaviour, as well as the possible misinterpretation of available evidence,\n³ Robert Kolb, *La Cour internationale de Justice* (A Pedone 2014) 956–958.\n⁴ *Minquiers and Ecrehos* (France v.

For many years, the USA did not officially respond to cyber operations targeting their interests, and thus did not disclose publicly any evidence proving the facts and possible attribution. The 2014 Sony Pictures Entertainment hack marked a watershed in US practice. The American subsidiary of the Japanese conglomerate Sony Corporation was hacked and a significant amount of data was stolen from the company. This data was then publicly released by the hackers in November 2014. The hackers demanded the cancellation of the planned release of the film *The Interview*, a comedy about the assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. US officials alleged that the attack was sponsored by North Korea.⁸ North Korea, however, denied any involvement. The United States indicated that it had evidence of the involvement of North Korea, and the White House announced that it would adopt a proportional response.⁹ In reaction to this cyber operation allegedly executed by North Korea, the United States adopted new sanctions against North Korea; additionally, it is considered having adopted an unofficial covert response in the form of unilateral extrajudicial measures. In this instance, the United States attributed the cyber operation to North Korea and responded to it, without disclosing the evidence.\nThe 2016 Democratic National Committee (DNC) hack marked an even bigger watershed in US practice as the United States decided, for the first time, to disclose evidence corroborating the attribution of a cyber operation to another State, the Russian Federation. On 22 July 2016, a few days before the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, Wikileaks published 19,252 emails and 8,034 attachments from the DNC, the governing body of the Democratic Party. The leak contained emails and documents from seven key DNC staff members suggesting that the DNC leadership had worked to advantage Hillary Clinton over Bernie\n⁸ David E Sanger and Nicole Perlroth, ‘U.S. Said to Find North Korea Ordered Cyberattack on Sony’, *The New York Times* (17 December 2014) www.nytimes.com/2014/12/18/world/asia/us-links-north-korea-to-sony-hacking.html.\n⁹ Dave Boyer, ‘White House Threatens “Proportional” Response to North Korea Cyberattacks on Sony Pictures’, *The Washington Times* (18 December 2014) www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/18/white-house-threatens-proportional-response-north-/\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTHE QUESTION OF EVIDENCE\nSanders. On 7 October 2016, a ‘Joint Statement from the Department of Homeland Security and Office of the Director of National Intelligence on Election Security’ was released, stating:\nThe U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations. The recent disclosures of alleged hacked e-mails on sites like DCLeaks.com and WikiLeaks and by the Guccifer 2.0 online persona are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process. Such activity is not new to Moscow – the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there. We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia’s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.^[10]^\nOn 10 October 2016, the White House announced that the president was considering a proportional response to the Russian cyber operations.^[11]^ Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, added that ‘[i]t is unlikely that our response would be announced in advance,’ and that ‘the president can choose response options that we never announce’.^[12]^ The US allegations were met with legitimate criticism as no evidence supporting allegations of Russian responsibility for the DNC hack was publicly released. As a consequence, on 29 December 2016, the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation released a ‘Joint Analysis Report’ exposing some of the evidence supporting their allegations of the involvement of Russian intelligence services FSB and GRU, as well as their modus operandi.^[13]^ This document supported the joint statement of October 2016, in which they expressed confidence that\n^[10]^ ‘Joint Statement’, para 1 (Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation 2016) www.dhs.gov/news/2016/10/07/joint-statement-department-homeland-security-and-office-director-national; see also Ellen Nakashima, ‘U.S. Government Officially Accuses Russia of Hacking Campaign to Interfere with Elections’, *Washington Post* (7 October 2016) www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-government-officially-accuses-russia-of-hacking-campaign-to-influence-elections/2016/10/07/4e0b9654-8cbf-11e6-875e-2c1bfe943b66_story.html.\n^[11]^ Julie Hirschfeld Davis and Gardiner Harris, ‘Obama Considers “Proportional” Response to Russian Hacking in U.S. Election’, *The New York Times* (11 October 2016) www.nytimes.com/2016/10/12/us/politics/obama-russia-hack-election.html.\n^[12]^ Jack Goldsmith, ‘Thoughts on White House Pledge to Respond to DNC Hack’ (Lawfare, 12 October 2016) www.lawfareblog.com/thoughts-white-house-pledge-respond-dnc-hack.\n^[13]^ United States, ‘Joint Analysis Report: GRIZZLY STEPPE – Russian Malicious Cyber Activity’ (Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation 2016)\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nEVIDENCE IN INTERNATIONAL LAW\n91\nthere was Russian involvement in the DNC hack. While this may be only an isolated case, it may also signal an evolution in the US approach: the collection and publication of evidence to support the attribution of cyber operations even outside of the context of a dispute settlement mechanism or judicial proceeding. For this reason, it is more important than ever to study the standards of evidence in international law and how they may be applied to cyber operations.\n## 3.2 Evidence in International Law\nHistorically, States have used evidence to support their allegations even outside of a judicial proceeding.¹⁴ This has been the practice, for instance, of international fact-finding commissions, such as the ones established after the 2008 armed conflict in Georgia.¹⁵ The development of international justice has strengthened this practice and made the international community demand an increasingly higher standard of proof.\nStates increasingly rely on international fact-finding commissions following international incidents that may have led to inter-state disputes, and this development is reflected in various branches and aspects of international law. The crash of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 in Ukraine in 2014 offers an interesting case study regarding State practice on the establishment of fact-finding commissions as well as on the collection and assessment of evidence outside of judicial proceedings. This example is also symptomatic of the challenges posed by technical and scientific evidence.\nOn 17 July 2014, Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 departed from Amsterdam-Schiphol Airport towards its destination, Kuala Lumpur. However, the aircraft never reached its destination having crashed in eastern Ukraine, in the Donetsk region. At that time, this area was still the scene of an armed conflict between the combatants of the People's Republic of Donetsk and the Ukrainian army. There were no survivors among the 283 passengers and 15 crew members. The circumstances of the crash were unclear and conflicting narratives were proposed. Initially,\nwww.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/JAR_16-20296A_GRIZZLY%20STEPPE-2016-1229.pdf.\n¹⁴ Joseph C Witenberg, ‘La théorie des preuves devant les juridictions internationales’ (1936) 56 RCADI 1, 6–7.\n¹⁵ ‘Report of the International Fact-Finding Commission on the Conflict in Georgia’ (2009) www.ceiig.ch/Report.html.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTHE QUESTION OF EVIDENCE\nthe pro-Russian separatists and the Ukrainian army accused one another of having caused the crash by missile fire.¹⁶ The day after the disaster, members of the UN Security Council called for an ‘independent, comprehensive and credible international investigation’.¹⁷\nA Joint Investigation Team (JIT), coordinated by the Dutch Safety Board (OVV – Onderzoeksraad Voor Veiligheid), was established. The work of the JIT was carried out in close collaboration with the observers of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and the emergency services of the People’s Republic of Donetsk. The team first recovered pieces of the wreckage as well as the black boxes of the aircraft from the separatists and repatriated them to the Netherlands for analysis.¹⁸ The OVV published its final report on 13 October 2015.¹⁹ The analysis of the black boxes, the reconstituted wreckage of the aircraft and other materials collected allowed the OVV to assert that the crash was caused by a surface missile – a 9M38 missile equipped with a 9N314M-type warhead installed on a BUK-type ground-air system – fired from a zone controlled by separatists, but where fighting with the Ukrainian army was underway. The conclusions of the OVV report were highly controversial. Almaz-Antey, the Russian manufacturer of the incriminated BUK missile system, carried out its own investigation, reconstructing in particular the effects of the explosion on a similar aircraft removed from traffic. From this study, it claimed that the missile had been fired from an area under the control of the Ukrainian army.²⁰ Moreover, the Russian Federal Air Transport Agency (Rosaviatsiya) was also sceptical, and stated that it wanted to conduct its own investigation.

Subsequently, the JIT issued a call for witnesses to obtain information on the presence and location of the BUK missile system in the area, which led to the collection of testimony from a large number of individuals. In addition, the JIT listened to telephone tappings of conversations about the missile system. The European Space Agency (ESA) provided satellite imagery and experts to facilitate the work of the investigators. The various testimonies, telephone tappings and satellite images enabled the JIT to conclude that the BUK missile system in question had been brought in from Russian territory and removed on the same day as the disaster. The evidence also allowed the JIT to identify with precision the location from which the missile was fired: an area indeed controlled by the separatists.²¹ The various strands of evidence collected by the JIT helped it to establish the circumstances surrounding the crash of flight MH17. However, the evidence could only do so much; it did not establish the identity of the individuals responsible for the missile firing, nor did it establish whether a State was complicit.\nIt is worth noting that some recommend the creation of a centralised mechanism for the attribution of cyber operations, the functioning of which would be similar to that of an international fact-finding investigation. For example, Microsoft published a white paper in 2016 suggesting, among other things, that such a mechanism be created following the model of the investigation mechanism of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).²² They argue that the proposed mechanism would create a synergy between the expertise of States, private actors and academics in order to work together to identify the perpetrators of malicious cyber operations:\nThere could be a similar mechanism by which governments and the private sector can provide evidence to support technical attribution and obtain some level of validation through rigorous peer review. At its core, this organization would consist of technical experts from across governments, the private sector, academia, and civil society with the capability to examine tactics, techniques, and procedures used by nation-state attackers, as well as indicators of compromise that suggest a given attack was by\n²¹ ‘JIT: MH17 Shot Down with Missile Fired from Pro-Russian Rebel Controlled Field’ (NL Times, 28 September 2016) http://nltimes.nl/2016/09/28/jit-mh17-shot-missile-fired-pro-russian-rebel-controlled-field.\n²² Scott Charney et al, ‘From Articulation to Implementation: Enabling Progress on Cybersecurity Norms’ (Microsoft 2016) 10–12 www.microsoft.com/en-us/cybersecurity/content-hub/enabling-progress-on-cybersecurity-norms.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTHE QUESTION OF EVIDENCE\na nation-state. Its essential output would be a technical analysis of the attack and evidence of attribution. In some cases, based on agreed-upon criteria, it might publish its findings. Some will of course oppose this approach. Governments in particular may be reluctant to empower an independent organization to make findings that may be both politically important and politically charged.²³\nIn law, evidence ‘tends to prove the existence or nonexistence of some fact’.²⁴ In the case of cyber operations, the facts are generally articulated around two main axes: the identification of the cyber operation and its consequences and the attribution of the cyber operation.\nAs pointed out by the UNGGE in its 2015 report, ‘In case of ICT incidents, States should consider all relevant information, including the larger context of the event, the challenges of attribution in the ICT environment and the nature and extent of the consequences.’²⁵ Indeed, the fact that an investigation relates to a cyber operation does not mean that evidence should be collected solely within cyberspace. Evidence gathered in the real world can also be relevant, even crucial, in determining the facts and attribution of a cyber operation.\nEvidence may consist of documentary evidence, physical evidence, expert or witness testimony, and hearsay evidence. This chapter focuses on the two main forms of evidence that may be relevant in the cyber context: documentary evidence and testimonial evidence from experts.\n## 3.3 Documentary Evidence\nThe term ‘documentary evidence’ refers to evidence in the form of written documents that support the alleged facts.²⁶ It should be emphasised that documentary evidence is the main form of evidence presented before the ICJ.²⁷ The Statute and Rules of the Court contain several provisions on the production of documents as documentary evidence\n²³ ibid 11.\n²⁴ Jonathan Law (ed), A Dictionary of Law (online version) (8th edn, OUP 2015), ‘Evidence’; see also Jean Salmon (ed), Dictionnaire de droit international public (Bruylant 2001) 874.\n²⁵ UNGA, ‘Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security’ (22 July 2015) UN Doc A/70/174.\n²⁶ Witenberg (n 14) 59.\n²⁷ Loretta Malintoppi, ‘Fact Finding and Evidence before the International Court of Justice (Notably in Scientific-Related Disputes)’ (2016) 7 Journal of International Dispute Settlement 421, 422.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE\nwithout, however, defining the types of authorised documents, thus leaving the parties and judges an important margin of discretion.\nThe various texts relating to the procedure and the production of evidence in a proceeding before the ICJ do not contain any specific provision related to digital evidence, with the exception of Practice direction IXbis. This provision states that a document that can be considered ‘part of a publication readily available’ under Article 56 (4) of the Rules of Court ‘may be in any format (printed or electronic), form (physical or on-line, such as posted on the internet) or on any data medium (on paper, on digital or any other media)’. Practice direction IXbis demonstrates the Court’s openness to digital evidence, without giving further details.\n## 3.3.1 Typology of Documentary Evidence That May Be Collected in Relation to Cyber Operations\nThe majority of evidence that would be produced by a State regarding a cyber operation, both for the purpose of establishing the facts and for attribution, could be in a written form – i.e. documentary evidence – and would therefore not pose any particular procedural problem in proceedings before a court.\nHowever, an important clarification must be made at this stage. This remark concerns only the presentation of evidence and neither its collection and admissibility nor the capacity of judges to assess it. The latter will be analysed later in this chapter.\nDuring the event of a cyber operation, a number of traces are usually left and may be collected as evidence. Most of these traces can be presented in the form of written documents to constitute documentary evidence.²⁸\nIn the case of a computer virus, the computer code of the virus can be analysed and presented as evidence. Computer codes consisting of multiple lines of code can easily be considered as written evidence.\nAdditionally, IP addresses may be collected and presented in a cyber-related dispute. These IP addresses may be used to identify the different computers and servers involved in the cyber operation, either because these computers and servers were used for its launch or transit, or\n²⁸ See, for instance, Marco Roscini, ‘Evidentiary Issues in International Disputes Related to State Responsibility for Cyber Operations’ (2015) 50 Texas International Law Journal 233.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTHE QUESTION OF EVIDENCE\nbecause they were the target of the cyber operation. The presentation of these IP addresses may be accompanied by the server logs, consisting of lists of activities performed by the relevant servers including the general time of connection of each IP address. These elements may be particularly useful in establishing the facts and timeline.\nThese different pieces of evidence are usually summarised in a report that places them in context in order to establish the facts. Moreover, this cyber-related evidence may be accompanied by non-digital evidence aimed, for instance, at establishing the damage suffered by the victim of the cyber operation, or the relationship between the computers involved and individuals and whether these individuals were acting on behalf of a State.\nThe purpose of the previous paragraphs was to demonstrate the forms in which digital evidence may be presented during proceedings before an international court or tribunal. The difficulty involved in the identification and collection of this type of evidence should not be underestimated. The process may entail a great deal of technical expertise. A further difficulty in the collection of cyber evidence involves proving the authenticity and integrity of the evidence.²⁹ This is a task reserved for the experts who may take part in the judicial proceedings.\nTo date, no dispute between States relating to a cyber operation has given rise to a judicial proceeding. However, in several instances of cyber operations alleged to be either state sponsored or even state conducted, States and non-state actors, such as cybersecurity firms, have collected evidence and presented it in reports detailing these cyber operations and attributing them to groups or individuals. These various reports provide a basis for the analysis of what elements may be presented by a State in the context of a judicial proceeding on a state-sponsored cyber operation.\nIn 2013, the US cybersecurity firm Mandiant released a report detailing an investigation on computer security breaches allegedly sponsored by the Chinese government that occurred (between 2004 and 2013) at hundreds of organisations around the world.³⁰ The investigation focused on cyber espionage activities considered to be the result of a single group referred to by the Mandiant teams as APT 1. The objective was to\n²⁹ ibid 239.\n³⁰ Mandiant Intelligence Center Report, ‘APT1: Exposing One of China’s Cyber Espionage Units’ (Mandiant 2013) 1 http://intelreport.mandiant.com/Mandiant_APT1_Report.pdf.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE\n97\ndetermine the extent of APT 1's activities, its members and if it was acting on the behalf of a State. To carry out this investigation, Mandiant collected various computer tools, URLs and IP addresses used by APT 1 to perpetrate and relay its cyber operations, and logging data on different servers. This information made it possible to identify the structure and the modus operandi of APT 1:\nAPT1 maintains an extensive infrastructure of computer systems around the world.\n- APT1 controls thousands of systems in support of their computer intrusion activities.\n- In the last two years we have observed APT1 establish a minimum of 937 Command and Control (C2) servers hosted on 849 distinct IP addresses in 13 countries. The majority of these 849 unique IP addresses were registered to organizations in China (709), followed by the U.S. (109).\n- In the last three years we have observed APT1 use fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) resolving to 988 unique IP addresses.\n- Over a two-year period (January 2011 to January 2013) we confirmed 1,905 instances of APT1 actors logging into their attack infrastructure from 832 different IP addresses with Remote Desktop, a tool that provides a remote user with an interactive graphical interface to a system.\n- In the last several years we have confirmed 2,551 FQDNs attributed to APT1.³¹\nOnce the structure and activities of APT 1 were established, Mandiant focused on the question of attribution. Investigators determined that 97 per cent of APT 1's remote access used the 'Chinese (Simplified) – US Keyboard' setting. In addition, 98 per cent of the IP addresses connecting remotely to the computer systems controlled by APT 1 were Chinese and almost all the IP addresses used to communicate with the target computer systems were Chinese and located in the Shanghai area. In addition, investigators were able to identify the computer traces left by three individuals considered to be members of APT 1.³² The elements used to identify these individuals included multiple IP addresses, email addresses, URLs and their respective modus operandi. Using this digital evidence, as well as non-digital evidence related to the functioning of the Chinese army and the identified location, Mandiant concluded that APT\n³¹ ibid 4.\n³² ibid 51–58.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTHE QUESTION OF EVIDENCE\n1 was probably Unit 61398 of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA), and therefore tied directly to the Chinese government.³³\n## 3.3.2 The Necessary Caution in the Collection and Assessment of Evidence\nAs with any evidence, one must proceed cautiously with the collection and analysis of digital evidence. It is essential to involve experts who can not only analyse the data but also explain their conclusions to non-specialists of computer science, such as to the parties and judges involved in a judicial proceeding. This issue will be developed in the section dedicated to experts.\nThe malware Stuxnet,³⁴ identified in 2010, which physically damaged several centrifuges of an Iranian nuclear plant, and its subsequent investigation, serve as an interesting example. This malware is alleged to have been a joint cyber operation involving the United States and Israel, the purpose of which was to derail the Iranian nuclear programme and force the country to abandon the military dimension of its nuclear ambition. However, neither Iran nor any other State has officially attributed this cyber operation to the United States, Israel or any other State, and no State has claimed paternity for this malware. Stuxnet was first identified in June 2010 by a Belarusian cybersecurity company, VirusBlokAda, and was subsequently analysed by experts from various cybersecurity companies, including Kaspersky and Symantec. The latter published a report detailing the functioning of Stuxnet.³⁵ An important part of this report dug into and analysed the computer code of Stuxnet, and identified two elements that may hint at a potential link between Israel and the malware.\nFirstly, they identified the project path ‘b:\\myrtus\\src\\objfre_w2k_x86\\i386\\guava.pdb’ in the driver file. The name of the folder is ‘myrtus’ and one of the files is ‘guava’, guava being a tropical tree of the myrtaceae family – that is to say of the myrtle family. The report further notes that:\n³³ ibid 59–60.\n³⁴ On Stuxnet see, generally, Kim Zetter, Countdown to Zero Day: Stuxnet and the Launch of the World’s First Digital Weapon (Crown 2014); see also David E Sanger, Confront and Conceal: Obama’s Secret Wars and Surprising Use of American Power (Crown 2012).\n³⁵ Nicolas Falliere, Liam O Murchu and Eric Chien, ‘W32.Stuxnet Dossier (Version 1.4)’ (Symantec 2011) www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/w32_stuxnet_dossier.pdf.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE\n99\naccording to Wikipedia, ‘Esther was originally named Hadassah. Hadassah means “myrtle” in Hebrew.’ Esther learned of a plot to assassinate the king and ‘told the king of Haman’s plan to massacre all Jews in the Persian Empire … The Jews went on to kill only their would-be executioners.’ Symantec cautions readers on drawing any attribution conclusions. Attackers would have the natural desire to implicate another party.³⁶\nIn other words, the names ‘myrtus’ and ‘guava’ could hypothetically refer to Queen Esther of the Old Testament, and thus could be understood as a reference to the situation of the Jewish people in Persia, the State that preceded the Islamic Republic of Iran.\nSecondly, Stuxnet established a registry key value of 19790509, which would allow Stuxnet’s future intrusion attempts to identify whether the targeted computer was already infected:\n[i]f this value is equal to 19790509 the threat will exit. This is thought to be an infection marker or a ‘do not infect’ marker. If this is set correctly infection will not occur. The value may be a random string and represent nothing, but also appears to match the format of date markers used in the threat. As a date, the value may be May 9, 1979. This date could be an arbitrary date, a birth date, or some other significant date. While on May 9, 1979 a variety of historical events occurred, according to Wikipedia ‘Habib Elghanian was executed by a firing squad in Tehran sending shock waves through the closely knit Iranian Jewish community. He was the first Jew and one of the first civilians to be executed by the new Islamic government. This prompted the mass exodus of the once 100,000 member strong Jewish community of Iran which continues to this day.’ Symantec cautions readers on drawing any attribution conclusions. Attackers would have the natural desire to implicate another party.³⁷\nIn summary, these two elements found in the lines of the Stuxnet computer code could be references to historical events involving Iran and its Jewish population, and have therefore been analysed by some as implicating Israel in the creation of Stuxnet. These clues and their analysis should nevertheless be treated with caution. While they may point to the responsible party, they may also have been put there deliberately by the creators of the code to lead investigators into wrongly implicating Israel. Thus, this type of evidence should not be considered as clear proof of Israeli responsibility, but merely a nudge in that direction.\n³⁶ ibid 24.\n³⁷ ibid 18.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTHE QUESTION OF EVIDENCE\nThe example of Stuxnet demonstrates the importance of involving competent experts in the search for and analysis of technical evidence. It also shows how important it is to approach technical evidence critically. Cyber operations are indeed a highly technical phenomenon, but this does not mean that their analysis and attribution should be limited to a technical approach. On the contrary, it is essential that, alongside technical experts, experts from other disciplines are also involved in an investigation.\n## 3.3.3 The Validity of Unlawfully Collected Evidence\nCyberspace is characterised by the interconnection of computer networks, making it possible to remotely access various connected networks and computer systems. This feature makes access to digital evidence easier on a technical level. It also facilitates the task of the perpetrator of a cyber operation wishing to erase or blur their tracks. It is indeed relatively easy for them to access the clues they may have left and to move, manipulate or destroy them.³⁸ It is therefore essential for the victim of a cyber operation wishing to seize and secure potential evidence to act as quickly and thoroughly as possible before the perpetrator erases their tracks. For this reason, investigators must act with a certain discretion so as not to accelerate the perpetrator's attempts to modify and remove the evidence they may have left behind.\nOne of the main features of cyberspace that affects the seizure of technical evidence in criminal, terrorist and inter-state cases is the transnational dimension of cyberspace.³⁹ Indeed, a cyber operation conducted or sponsored by one State against another will probably transit through computer systems and networks located in third-party States. The procedure for the collection of technical evidence by the victim State from computer systems and networks located within its territory is governed by that State's domestic law.⁴⁰ Conversely, the collection of evidence from computer systems and networks located abroad (and outside of the victim State's jurisdiction) may be deemed unlawful, and\n³⁸ Christiane Féral-Schuhl, *Cyberdroit 2011/2012. Le droit à l'épreuve de l'internet* (6th edn, Dalloz 2010) 992.\n³⁹ Jonathan Bourguignon, 'La recherche de la preuve informatique et l'exercice des compétences extraterritoriales de l'Etat' in Société Française pour le Droit International, *Internet et le droit international* (Colloque de Rouen, Pedone 2014) 357–372.\n⁴⁰ Féral-Schuhl (n 38) 992 et seq.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE\n101\nindeed is often conducted without the consent of the State that has jurisdiction.\nA State’s seizure of evidence from computer systems and networks located within the jurisdiction of another State and in the absence of the said State’s consent would most likely constitute an internationally wrongful act. More specifically, it would probably constitute a violation of the latter State’s territorial sovereignty. The wrongfulness of the seizure may nevertheless be mitigated or even precluded when the responsible State can prove that the seizure occurred in the context of a circumstance precluding wrongfulness. For instance, a victim State that seizes evidence from the network of the State responsible for a cyber operation may claim that their seizure of evidence (in violation of the latter State’s jurisdiction) constitutes a countermeasure. However, this may prove a difficult line of defence. The victim State may claim that it was necessary to seize evidence before the responsible State had a chance to remove or tamper with it. The responsible State has a prime opportunity to do so if the victim State requests its cooperation or if the responsible State is aware of the seizure operation. Necessity may be invoked to preclude the wrongfulness of an act performed by a State to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril. It appears thus fragile ground to justify a cyber operation aimed at seizing evidence in the computer systems of another State. The fragility of these two potential justifications for such acts imposes to therefore analyse the admissibility and validity of evidence collected unlawfully.\nWould evidence that is illegally obtained be considered legitimate before a court? More specifically, would illegally obtained evidence be admissible in contentious proceedings before the ICJ? There is no answer to this question in the Statute and Rules of the Court. However, in the Corfu Channel case the judges accepted evidence that was unlawfully acquired by the United Kingdom.⁴¹ It must be pointed out, however, that the judges did not rule on the validity of the evidence. In this case, the United Kingdom justified the illegal seizure of the evidence as follows:\nAccording to that [United Kingdom] Government, the corpora delicti must be secured as quickly as possible, for fear they should be taken away, without leaving traces, by the authors of the minelaying or by the Albanian authorities. This justification took two distinct forms in the United Kingdom Government’s arguments. It was presented first as a\n⁴¹ Corfu Channel (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v. Albania) (Judgment on the Merits) [1949] ICJ Reports 4, 34.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTHE QUESTION OF EVIDENCE\nnew and special application of the theory of intervention, by means of which the State intervening would secure possession of evidence in the territory of another State, in order to submit it to an international tribunal and thus facilitate its task.\nThe United Kingdom Agent, in his speech in reply, has further classified ‘Operation Retail’ among methods of self-protection or self-help.⁴²\nThe Court rejected these two justifications and considered the conduct of the United Kingdom to be unlawful. However, the Court still accepted and considered the illegally obtained evidence. It is interesting to note that the line of defence used by the British government approximates to the one that could be used by a State for the illegal seizure of computer evidence, as discussed above. It is likely that the Court’s position will remain unchanged in a case involving a similar seizure of evidence, and that therefore the wrongfulness of those actions would not be precluded.\nThis point is very important because a significant amount of evidence, digital or otherwise, provided by States regarding a cyber operation, could be acquired illegally. With respect to digital evidence, it has already been shown that collection from servers under the jurisdiction of other States (without their consent) may constitute an internationally wrongful act. States could also present evidence collected more or less lawfully by their intelligence services. If espionage is not unlawful under international law, it may give rise to conduct violating certain norms of international law, in particular the territorial sovereignty of the targeted State or the principle of non-intervention.⁴³\nThe hack of Sony Pictures Entertainment in 2014 is a good illustration. As seen earlier, the United States attributed this cyber operation to North Korea without publicly presenting evidence supporting their accusation. This lack of evidence could be explained by the fact that the United States was able to identify North Korea as responsible for the cyber operation through the surveillance of North Korean networks by the National Security Agency (NSA).⁴⁴ In other words, the attribution was made possible not by technical evidence collected after the cyber operation, but rather by collecting information on North Korean activities conducted prior to the cyber operation concerned. This collection of\n⁴² Corfu Channel (Merits) (n 41) 34–35.\n⁴³ Fabien Lafouasse, L’espionnage dans le droit international (Nouveau monde 2012).\n⁴⁴ David E Sanger and Martin Fackler, ‘N.S.A.

In this sense, neither the Statute nor the Rules of Court clarify who may be called as an expert in a case before the ICJ. A definition can be found in the Agreement between the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea and the Federal Republic of Germany regarding the Headquarters of the Tribunal, which states that an ‘expert’ is ‘a person called at the instance of a party to a dispute or at the instance of the Tribunal to present testimony in the form of expert opinions, based on special knowledge, skills, experience or training’ (Article 1(l)).\nIn a dispute related to a cyber operation, it is essential to involve experts for two main reasons. Firstly, it is possible that neither the judges nor counsel have the requisite knowledge to understand the technical details of the dispute. Secondly, it is essential that the computer evidence provided by the parties be analysed by qualified experts who can attest to its authenticity and provide the relevant analysis.\nIn a case before the ICJ, experts can be involved in four different ways: they may be appointed by the parties; the judges may consult them in an informal manner; or decide to involve them in the proceedings; and finally, it is possible for the judges to appoint assessors who sit in on the proceedings but do not have the right to vote.\n## 3.4.1 Experts Appointed by the Parties\nMost of the computer-based evidence that may be collected and presented in relation to a cyber operation should be collected and analysed by experts to ensure that it is authentic and to establish the facts in the\n⁴⁵ Giorgio Gaja, ‘Assessing Expert Evidence in the ICJ’ (2017) 15 The Law &amp; Practice of International Courts and Tribunals 409, *passim*; Malintoppi (n 27) 430–434.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTHE QUESTION OF EVIDENCE\nmost accurate manner. Consequently, States wishing to collect such evidence will have recourse to experts generally available within the State's computer-security services or through the contracting of private cybersecurity companies. For example, the Democratic Party decided to use the private company CrowdStrike to analyse the hack that it suffered in 2016, and it was on the basis of the evidence gathered by that company that US authorities attributed the cyber operation to Russian intelligence services.\nBeyond the investigation, and the process of gathering and analysing evidence, it is essential that experts are involved in the presentation of evidence, especially in the event of a judicial proceeding. Indeed, their participation and their explanations render such evidence intelligible to people who are not familiar with computer science. Their participation in judicial proceedings also permits an adversarial dialogue between the experts of the two parties.\n## 3.4.2 'Invisible' Experts Consulted by the Court\nThe ICJ, like other international jurisdictions, has to deal with disputes involving an important technical dimension requiring some specific expertise. This is especially the case for border disputes. The subject has been analysed by Robert Yewdall Jennings, who notes that:\nthe Court has not infrequently employed cartographers, hydrographers, geographers, linguists, and even specialised legal experts to assist in the understanding of the issue in a case before it; and has not on the whole felt any need to make this public knowledge or even to apprise the parties.^[46]^\nIn some cases involving a strong technical dimension, the judges of the ICJ have consulted informal experts to assist them, but these experts were not officially involved in the proceedings. Generally, such experts act as temporary members of the Registry of the Court and their findings are not communicated to the parties or made public.^[47]^\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nEXPERT OPINION EVIDENCE\n105\nThe participation of these ‘experts fantômes’⁴⁸ has been criticised,⁴⁹ in particular by a number of judges. For example, Judges Awn Shawkat Al-Khasawneh and Bruno Simma, in their Joint Dissenting Opinion in the Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay case, pointed out that:\nWhile such consultation of ‘invisible’ experts may be pardonable if the input they provide relates to the scientific margins of a case, the situation is quite different in complex scientific disputes, as is the case here. Under circumstances such as in the present case, adopting such a practice would deprive the Court of the above-mentioned advantages of transparency, openness, procedural fairness, and the ability for the Parties to comment upon or otherwise assist the Court in understanding the evidence before it. These are concerns based not purely on abstract principle, but on the good administration of justice.⁵⁰\nA distinction should be drawn between situations in which invisible experts are consulted on technical issues relevant – but not decisive – to the case, and situations in which they may critically influence the outcome of the case.⁵¹ However, this distinction has not yet been made.\nThe distinction proposed above would be particularly relevant in a dispute relating to a cyber operation. Judges may have recourse to invisible experts to assist them in their understanding of the functioning of the Internet and relevant computer systems, specifically to help them in developing a general knowledge of the subject matter of the dispute. Conversely, it would be desirable for matters related to the evidence provided by the parties, as well as technical problems specifically related to the case, to be dealt with by experts appointed by the Court and taking part in the proceedings. In such cases, as developed below, expert opinions are communicated to the parties who can then comment on them. This would be particularly relevant and important for disputes regarding cyber operations, as the proceedings may involve a large amount of technical evidence, the assessment of which by experts may be crucial.\n⁴⁸ The expression ‘experts fantômes’ is borrowed from Judges Awn Shawkat Al-Khasawneh and Bruno Simma: Joint Dissenting Opinion, Judges Al-Khasawneh and Simma in *Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay* (Argentina v. Uruguay) (Judgment) [2010] ICJ Reports 14, 114.\n⁴⁹ Lucas Carlos Lima, ‘Expert Advisor or Non-voting Adjudicator? The Potential Function of Assessors in the Procedure of the International Court of Justice’ (2016) 99 Rivista di diritto internazionale 1123, 1134; James Gerard Devaney, *Fact-Finding before the International Court of Justice* (CUP 2016) 83–88.\n⁵⁰ Joint Dissenting Opinion, Judges Al-Khasawneh and Simma in *Pulp Mills* (Judgment) (n 48) 114.\n⁵¹ Gaja (n 45) 414.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTHE QUESTION OF EVIDENCE\n## 3.4.3 Experts Appointed by the Court\nIn a case before the ICJ, it is possible for judges to appoint experts.^[52]^ This possibility is provided for in Article 50 of the Statute of the Court, which states that '[t]he Court may, at any time, entrust any individual, body, bureau, commission, or other organisation that it may select, with the task of carrying out an enquiry or giving an expert opinion'. Article 67 of the Rules of Court clarifies the position regarding the appointment of experts by judges:\n1. If the Court considers it necessary to arrange for an enquiry or an expert opinion, it shall, after hearing the parties, issue an order to this effect, defining the subject of the enquiry or expert opinion, stating the number and mode of appointment of the persons to hold the enquiry or of the experts, and laying down the procedure to be followed. Where appropriate, the Court shall require persons appointed to carry out an enquiry, or to give an expert opinion, to make a solemn declaration.\n2. Every report or record of an enquiry and every expert opinion shall be communicated to the parties, which shall be given the opportunity of commenting upon it.\nThus, unlike invisible experts, these experts are officially appointed by the Court and their findings are made public, thereby permitting the parties to submit observations.\nThe Court has appointed experts in a very limited number of cases,^[53]^ as Lucas Carlos Lima points out:\nExperts ex curia were appointed by the ICJ in only three cases. In the Corfu Channel (United Kingdom v. Albania) case, the Court nominated three naval experts, who conducted a site visit and subsequently presented a report which the parties had the opportunity to comment upon. In the case of the Delimitation of the Maritime Boundary in the Gulf of Maine Area (Canada/United States of America), the Chamber of the Court appointed a naval expert to assist in the delimitation of the boundary between the two countries and his technical report was attached to the judgment. In the Maritime Delimitation in the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua), the Court appointed two experts\n^[52]^ This is also possible before other international courts and tribunals: Louis Savadogo, 'Le recours des juridictions internationales à des experts' (2004) 50 Annuaire français de droit international 231, 233.\n^[53]^ Devaney (n 49) 20–23.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nEXPERT OPINION EVIDENCE\n107\nto collect ‘all the factual elements relating to the state of the coast’ between the two countries, requiring them to ‘prepare a written report [...] [that] shall be communicated to the Parties, which shall be given the opportunity of commenting upon it’.⁵⁴\nA number of scholars and ICJ judges have expressed their support for the use of Court-appointed experts, particularly in the context of litigation involving a critical technical dimension.⁵⁵\nThe use of Court-appointed experts, to analyse technical arguments presented by the parties to a dispute relating to a cyber operation, would have the advantage of providing the judges with an objective analysis of the evidence and allow them to concentrate on the legal issues.\n## 3.4.4 Assessors Appointed by the Court\nICJ judges may appoint assessors, who may sit with the Court but do not have the right to vote. This possibility is opened by Article 30(2) of the Statute of the Court, according to which ‘[t]he Rules of the Court may provide for assessors to sit with the Court or with any of its chambers, without the right to vote’. This provision is clarified by Article 9 of the Rules of Court, which provides that this possibility is available in contentious and advisory cases and that these assessors ‘shall be appointed by secret ballot and by a majority of the votes of the judges composing the Court for the case’. Neither the Statute nor the Rules of the Court specify whether the State Parties are to be involved in the procedure for appointing assessors.\nAs Giorgio Gaja points out, no assessor has ever been appointed in a case before the ICJ.⁵⁶ He argues that there are two reasons for this: firstly, even if they do not have the right to vote, the assessors could be seen as wielding too much influence over the decision of the judges; secondly, the parties and their experts would not be informed and thus they would not be able to comment on the opinions expressed by the assessors.\nIn most disputes regarding cyber operations, which may be brought before the ICJ, the technical expertise provided by the experts appointed by the parties or by the Court would probably be sufficient, and it would\n⁵⁴ Lima (n 49) 1131.

Such disputes may involve a significant amount of highly technical evidence, the collection and assessment of which by the parties and by the judges, in the case of judicial proceedings, may be challenging. Conversely, the presentation of technical evidence relating to cyber operations is not particularly challenging, as most of it may be easily presented as documentary evidence.\nStates could, however, be reluctant to make such evidence public during judicial proceedings. Firstly, from the point of view of the State, by revealing the collected evidence, it is likely to give indications about its computing capabilities. Secondly, by publicly disclosing information about a cyber operation, there is a risk that the vulnerabilities exploited by this cyber operation would be taken advantage of by other actors to perpetrate cyber operations. This has been demonstrated by WannaCry$^{57}$ and the wave of cyber operations that affected a large number of people, institutions and businesses in May 2017.$^{58}$ EternalBlue, the vulnerability exploited by some cyber operations and revealed in the summer of 2016, was obtained from the NSA through a hack by the Shadow Brokers.$^{59}$ Microsoft had released a fix for this vulnerability,$^{60}$ but it seems that\n57 Microsoft, ‘Ransom:Win32/WannaCrypt (Updated 10 January 2018)’ (Windows Defender Security Intelligence, 12 May 2017) www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/threats/malware-encyclopedia-description?Name=Ransom:Win32/WannaCrypt.

Thus, by revealing during a judicial proceeding the functioning of a cyber operation and the vulnerabilities exploited, the State risks revealing elements that could be used to jeopardise the security and stability of cyberspace. In this context, it may be necessary to consider keeping some evidence confidential in order to safeguard the security and stability of cyberspace.\nThe establishment of the facts and the attribution of a cyber operation carry an important technical dimension, but it would be a mistake to reduce them merely to technical processes. It is therefore essential that, alongside the technical experts, experts from other disciplines with a good understanding of the functioning of cyberspace and cyber operations are involved in these processes, and potentially involved in judicial proceedings. Indeed, these experts would help to bridge the technical and legal dimensions of the dispute. This is also the aim of the present chapter, which bridges the technical dimension of attribution analysed in the previous chapter and the legal dimension of attribution studied in the next.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press",

  "flat_text": "The evidence collected to identify the computers and individuals involved in a cyber operation may also be used to determine whether they were acting on behalf of a State. This leads to the question of how such evidence may be used and considered admissible in a judicial proceeding, or more generally in an international dispute, related to a cyber operation.\nThe development of State activities in cyberspace, notably offensive cyber operations, has led to international disputes between States. To date, a State has neither disputed a cyber operation before an international court or tribunal nor raised the issue before the UN Security Council. Generally, victim States have chosen to respond through extra-juridical measures, such as cyber countermeasures or measures of retorsion. However, there is the possibility that a State, in future, may bring a charge of harmful cyber operations before an international court or tribunal or before the UN Security Council.\nDifferent procedures for the collection, presentation and assessment of evidence exist depending on the international court or tribunal selected and the circumstances of the case. The assertion presented hereunder is that the International Court of Justice (ICJ) would be the most suitable judicial organ to deal with an international dispute arising from cyber operations conducted by one State against another. Thus, this chapter considers the procedures for the collection and assessment of evidence that may be applied in the event of a case before the ICJ. Before the ICJ, all parties are equal and thus have equal rights to submit and present their legal case. Moreover, each party bears the burden of proof regarding\n See infra Chapter 10.\n Rüdiger Wolfrum and Mirka Möldner, ‘International Courts and Tribunals, Evidence’, Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law (MPEPIL), https://opil.ouplaw.com/view/10.1093/law:epil/9780199231690/law-9780199231690-e26 (OUP 2013).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTHE QUESTION OF EVIDENCE\ntheir case in accordance with the Statute and Rules of the Court. In the Minquiers and Ecrehos case, the ICJ specified that ‘each Party has to prove its alleged title and the facts upon which it relies’.\nThe procedure regarding the production and assessment of evidence for a contentious case before the ICJ is prescribed by Articles 48 to 52 of the Statute of the Court and clarified in the Rules of the Court. In addition, Practice Directions for use by States, which had appeared before being adopted by the ICJ in 2001, have since been amended several times. While the Practice Directions are non-binding, they clarify procedure before the Court. It must be noted that the ICJ is not bound to the evidence and facts submitted by the parties and may also arbitrarily decide to collect and use evidence autonomously.\nThis chapter is comprised of four sections dealing, respectively, with State practice regarding evidence related to cyber operations (3.1), evidence in international law (3.2), documentary evidence (3.3) and expert opinion evidence (3.4).\n## 3.1 State Practice on Evidence Relating to Cyber Operations\nThe nascent State practice on responding to state-sponsored cyber operations seems to demonstrate that States are increasingly aware of the need to support their accusations with evidence proving the facts and the alleged paternity of the cyber operations concerned. This is particularly crucial regarding cyber conduct, as cyberspace offers numerous opportunities to hide or forge the real paternity of a cyber operation, notably by using proxy computer systems or botnets located in other countries. Some perpetrators have even inserted misleading hints into the computer code of a virus in an attempt to shift the blame onto a third party.

For many years, the USA did not officially respond to cyber operations targeting their interests, and thus did not disclose publicly any evidence proving the facts and possible attribution. The 2014 Sony Pictures Entertainment hack marked a watershed in US practice. The American subsidiary of the Japanese conglomerate Sony Corporation was hacked and a significant amount of data was stolen from the company. This data was then publicly released by the hackers in November 2014. The hackers demanded the cancellation of the planned release of the film *The Interview*, a comedy about the assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. US officials alleged that the attack was sponsored by North Korea. North Korea, however, denied any involvement. The United States indicated that it had evidence of the involvement of North Korea, and the White House announced that it would adopt a proportional response. In reaction to this cyber operation allegedly executed by North Korea, the United States adopted new sanctions against North Korea; additionally, it is considered having adopted an unofficial covert response in the form of unilateral extrajudicial measures. In this instance, the United States attributed the cyber operation to North Korea and responded to it, without disclosing the evidence.\nThe 2016 Democratic National Committee (DNC) hack marked an even bigger watershed in US practice as the United States decided, for the first time, to disclose evidence corroborating the attribution of a cyber operation to another State, the Russian Federation. On 22 July 2016, a few days before the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, Wikileaks published 19,252 emails and 8,034 attachments from the DNC, the governing body of the Democratic Party. The leak contained emails and documents from seven key DNC staff members suggesting that the DNC leadership had worked to advantage Hillary Clinton over Bernie\n David E Sanger and Nicole Perlroth, ‘U.S. Said to Find North Korea Ordered Cyberattack on Sony’, *The New York Times* (17 December 2014) www.nytimes.com/2014/12/18/world/asia/us-links-north-korea-to-sony-hacking.html.\n Dave Boyer, ‘White House Threatens “Proportional” Response to North Korea Cyberattacks on Sony Pictures’, *The Washington Times* (18 December 2014) www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/18/white-house-threatens-proportional-response-north-/\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTHE QUESTION OF EVIDENCE\nSanders. On 7 October 2016, a ‘Joint Statement from the Department of Homeland Security and Office of the Director of National Intelligence on Election Security’ was released, stating:\nThe U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations. The recent disclosures of alleged hacked e-mails on sites like DCLeaks.com and WikiLeaks and by the Guccifer 2.0 online persona are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process. Such activity is not new to Moscow – the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there. We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia’s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.^[10]^\nOn 10 October 2016, the White House announced that the president was considering a proportional response to the Russian cyber operations.^[11]^ Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, added that ‘[i]t is unlikely that our response would be announced in advance,’ and that ‘the president can choose response options that we never announce’.^[12]^ The US allegations were met with legitimate criticism as no evidence supporting allegations of Russian responsibility for the DNC hack was publicly released. As a consequence, on 29 December 2016, the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation released a ‘Joint Analysis Report’ exposing some of the evidence supporting their allegations of the involvement of Russian intelligence services FSB and GRU, as well as their modus operandi.^[13]^ This document supported the joint statement of October 2016, in which they expressed confidence that\n^[10]^ ‘Joint Statement’, para 1 (Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation 2016) www.dhs.gov/news/2016/10/07/joint-statement-department-homeland-security-and-office-director-national; see also Ellen Nakashima, ‘U.S. Government Officially Accuses Russia of Hacking Campaign to Interfere with Elections’, *Washington Post* (7 October 2016) www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-government-officially-accuses-russia-of-hacking-campaign-to-influence-elections/2016/10/07/4e0b9654-8cbf-11e6-875e-2c1bfe943b66_story.html.\n^[11]^ Julie Hirschfeld Davis and Gardiner Harris, ‘Obama Considers “Proportional” Response to Russian Hacking in U.S. Election’, *The New York Times* (11 October 2016) www.nytimes.com/2016/10/12/us/politics/obama-russia-hack-election.html.\n^[12]^ Jack Goldsmith, ‘Thoughts on White House Pledge to Respond to DNC Hack’ (Lawfare, 12 October 2016) www.lawfareblog.com/thoughts-white-house-pledge-respond-dnc-hack.\n^[13]^ United States, ‘Joint Analysis Report: GRIZZLY STEPPE – Russian Malicious Cyber Activity’ (Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation 2016)\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nEVIDENCE IN INTERNATIONAL LAW\n\n## 3.2 Evidence in International Law\nHistorically, States have used evidence to support their allegations even outside of a judicial proceeding. This has been the practice, for instance, of international fact-finding commissions, such as the ones established after the 2008 armed conflict in Georgia. The development of international justice has strengthened this practice and made the international community demand an increasingly higher standard of proof.\nStates increasingly rely on international fact-finding commissions following international incidents that may have led to inter-state disputes, and this development is reflected in various branches and aspects of international law. The crash of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 in Ukraine in 2014 offers an interesting case study regarding State practice on the establishment of fact-finding commissions as well as on the collection and assessment of evidence outside of judicial proceedings. This example is also symptomatic of the challenges posed by technical and scientific evidence.\nOn 17 July 2014, Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 departed from Amsterdam-Schiphol Airport towards its destination, Kuala Lumpur. However, the aircraft never reached its destination having crashed in eastern Ukraine, in the Donetsk region. At that time, this area was still the scene of an armed conflict between the combatants of the People's Republic of Donetsk and the Ukrainian army. There were no survivors among the 283 passengers and 15 crew members. The circumstances of the crash were unclear and conflicting narratives were proposed. Initially,\nwww.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/JAR_16-20296A_GRIZZLY%20STEPPE-2016-1229.pdf.\n Joseph C Witenberg, ‘La théorie des preuves devant les juridictions internationales’ (1936) 56 RCADI 1, 6–7.\n ‘Report of the International Fact-Finding Commission on the Conflict in Georgia’ (2009) www.ceiig.ch/Report.html.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTHE QUESTION OF EVIDENCE\nthe pro-Russian separatists and the Ukrainian army accused one another of having caused the crash by missile fire. The day after the disaster, members of the UN Security Council called for an ‘independent, comprehensive and credible international investigation’.\nA Joint Investigation Team (JIT), coordinated by the Dutch Safety Board (OVV – Onderzoeksraad Voor Veiligheid), was established. The work of the JIT was carried out in close collaboration with the observers of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and the emergency services of the People’s Republic of Donetsk. The team first recovered pieces of the wreckage as well as the black boxes of the aircraft from the separatists and repatriated them to the Netherlands for analysis. The OVV published its final report on 13 October 2015. The analysis of the black boxes, the reconstituted wreckage of the aircraft and other materials collected allowed the OVV to assert that the crash was caused by a surface missile – a 9M38 missile equipped with a 9N314M-type warhead installed on a BUK-type ground-air system – fired from a zone controlled by separatists, but where fighting with the Ukrainian army was underway. The conclusions of the OVV report were highly controversial. Almaz-Antey, the Russian manufacturer of the incriminated BUK missile system, carried out its own investigation, reconstructing in particular the effects of the explosion on a similar aircraft removed from traffic. From this study, it claimed that the missile had been fired from an area under the control of the Ukrainian army. Moreover, the Russian Federal Air Transport Agency (Rosaviatsiya) was also sceptical, and stated that it wanted to conduct its own investigation.

For example, Microsoft published a white paper in 2016 suggesting, among other things, that such a mechanism be created following the model of the investigation mechanism of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). They argue that the proposed mechanism would create a synergy between the expertise of States, private actors and academics in order to work together to identify the perpetrators of malicious cyber operations:\nThere could be a similar mechanism by which governments and the private sector can provide evidence to support technical attribution and obtain some level of validation through rigorous peer review. At its core, this organization would consist of technical experts from across governments, the private sector, academia, and civil society with the capability to examine tactics, techniques, and procedures used by nation-state attackers, as well as indicators of compromise that suggest a given attack was by\n ‘JIT: MH17 Shot Down with Missile Fired from Pro-Russian Rebel Controlled Field’ (NL Times, 28 September 2016) http://nltimes.nl/2016/09/28/jit-mh17-shot-missile-fired-pro-russian-rebel-controlled-field.\n Scott Charney et al, ‘From Articulation to Implementation: Enabling Progress on Cybersecurity Norms’ (Microsoft 2016) 10–12 www.microsoft.com/en-us/cybersecurity/content-hub/enabling-progress-on-cybersecurity-norms.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTHE QUESTION OF EVIDENCE\na nation-state. Its essential output would be a technical analysis of the attack and evidence of attribution. In some cases, based on agreed-upon criteria, it might publish its findings. Some will of course oppose this approach. Governments in particular may be reluctant to empower an independent organization to make findings that may be both politically important and politically charged.\nIn law, evidence ‘tends to prove the existence or nonexistence of some fact’. In the case of cyber operations, the facts are generally articulated around two main axes: the identification of the cyber operation and its consequences and the attribution of the cyber operation.\nAs pointed out by the UNGGE in its 2015 report, ‘In case of ICT incidents, States should consider all relevant information, including the larger context of the event, the challenges of attribution in the ICT environment and the nature and extent of the consequences.’ Indeed, the fact that an investigation relates to a cyber operation does not mean that evidence should be collected solely within cyberspace. Evidence gathered in the real world can also be relevant, even crucial, in determining the facts and attribution of a cyber operation.\nEvidence may consist of documentary evidence, physical evidence, expert or witness testimony, and hearsay evidence. This chapter focuses on the two main forms of evidence that may be relevant in the cyber context: documentary evidence and testimonial evidence from experts.\n## 3.3 Documentary Evidence\nThe term ‘documentary evidence’ refers to evidence in the form of written documents that support the alleged facts. It should be emphasised that documentary evidence is the main form of evidence presented before the ICJ. The Statute and Rules of the Court contain several provisions on the production of documents as documentary evidence\n ibid 11.\n Jonathan Law (ed), A Dictionary of Law (online version) (8th edn, OUP 2015), ‘Evidence’; see also Jean Salmon (ed), Dictionnaire de droit international public (Bruylant 2001) 874.\n UNGA, ‘Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security’ (22 July 2015) UN Doc A/70/174.\n Witenberg (n 14) 59.\n Loretta Malintoppi, ‘Fact Finding and Evidence before the International Court of Justice (Notably in Scientific-Related Disputes)’ (2016) 7 Journal of International Dispute Settlement 421, 422.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE\nwithout, however, defining the types of authorised documents, thus leaving the parties and judges an important margin of discretion.\nThe various texts relating to the procedure and the production of evidence in a proceeding before the ICJ do not contain any specific provision related to digital evidence, with the exception of Practice direction IXbis. This provision states that a document that can be considered ‘part of a publication readily available’ under Article 56 (4) of the Rules of Court ‘may be in any format (printed or electronic), form (physical or on-line, such as posted on the internet) or on any data medium (on paper, on digital or any other media)’. Practice direction IXbis demonstrates the Court’s openness to digital evidence, without giving further details.\n## 3.3.1 Typology of Documentary Evidence That May Be Collected in Relation to Cyber Operations\nThe majority of evidence that would be produced by a State regarding a cyber operation, both for the purpose of establishing the facts and for attribution, could be in a written form – i.e. documentary evidence – and would therefore not pose any particular procedural problem in proceedings before a court.\nHowever, an important clarification must be made at this stage. This remark concerns only the presentation of evidence and neither its collection and admissibility nor the capacity of judges to assess it. The latter will be analysed later in this chapter.\nDuring the event of a cyber operation, a number of traces are usually left and may be collected as evidence. Most of these traces can be presented in the form of written documents to constitute documentary evidence.\nIn the case of a computer virus, the computer code of the virus can be analysed and presented as evidence. Computer codes consisting of multiple lines of code can easily be considered as written evidence.\nAdditionally, IP addresses may be collected and presented in a cyber-related dispute. These IP addresses may be used to identify the different computers and servers involved in the cyber operation, either because these computers and servers were used for its launch or transit, or\n See, for instance, Marco Roscini, ‘Evidentiary Issues in International Disputes Related to State Responsibility for Cyber Operations’ (2015) 50 Texas International Law Journal 233.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTHE QUESTION OF EVIDENCE\nbecause they were the target of the cyber operation. The presentation of these IP addresses may be accompanied by the server logs, consisting of lists of activities performed by the relevant servers including the general time of connection of each IP address. These elements may be particularly useful in establishing the facts and timeline.\nThese different pieces of evidence are usually summarised in a report that places them in context in order to establish the facts. Moreover, this cyber-related evidence may be accompanied by non-digital evidence aimed, for instance, at establishing the damage suffered by the victim of the cyber operation, or the relationship between the computers involved and individuals and whether these individuals were acting on behalf of a State.\nThe purpose of the previous paragraphs was to demonstrate the forms in which digital evidence may be presented during proceedings before an international court or tribunal. The difficulty involved in the identification and collection of this type of evidence should not be underestimated. The process may entail a great deal of technical expertise. A further difficulty in the collection of cyber evidence involves proving the authenticity and integrity of the evidence. This is a task reserved for the experts who may take part in the judicial proceedings.\nTo date, no dispute between States relating to a cyber operation has given rise to a judicial proceeding. However, in several instances of cyber operations alleged to be either state sponsored or even state conducted, States and non-state actors, such as cybersecurity firms, have collected evidence and presented it in reports detailing these cyber operations and attributing them to groups or individuals. These various reports provide a basis for the analysis of what elements may be presented by a State in the context of a judicial proceeding on a state-sponsored cyber operation.\nIn 2013, the US cybersecurity firm Mandiant released a report detailing an investigation on computer security breaches allegedly sponsored by the Chinese government that occurred (between 2004 and 2013) at hundreds of organisations around the world. The investigation focused on cyber espionage activities considered to be the result of a single group referred to by the Mandiant teams as APT 1. The objective was to\n ibid 239.\n Mandiant Intelligence Center Report, ‘APT1: Exposing One of China’s Cyber Espionage Units’ (Mandiant 2013) 1 http://intelreport.mandiant.com/Mandiant_APT1_Report.pdf.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE\n\nAPT1 maintains an extensive infrastructure of computer systems around the world.\n- APT1 controls thousands of systems in support of their computer intrusion activities.\n- In the last two years we have observed APT1 establish a minimum of 937 Command and Control (C2) servers hosted on 849 distinct IP addresses in 13 countries. The majority of these 849 unique IP addresses were registered to organizations in China (709), followed by the U.S. (109).\n- In the last three years we have observed APT1 use fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) resolving to 988 unique IP addresses.\n- Over a two-year period (January 2011 to January 2013) we confirmed 1,905 instances of APT1 actors logging into their attack infrastructure from 832 different IP addresses with Remote Desktop, a tool that provides a remote user with an interactive graphical interface to a system.\n- In the last several years we have confirmed 2,551 FQDNs attributed to APT1.\nOnce the structure and activities of APT 1 were established, Mandiant focused on the question of attribution. Investigators determined that 97 per cent of APT 1's remote access used the 'Chinese (Simplified) – US Keyboard' setting. In addition, 98 per cent of the IP addresses connecting remotely to the computer systems controlled by APT 1 were Chinese and almost all the IP addresses used to communicate with the target computer systems were Chinese and located in the Shanghai area. In addition, investigators were able to identify the computer traces left by three individuals considered to be members of APT 1. The elements used to identify these individuals included multiple IP addresses, email addresses, URLs and their respective modus operandi. Using this digital evidence, as well as non-digital evidence related to the functioning of the Chinese army and the identified location, Mandiant concluded that APT\n ibid 4.\n ibid 51–58.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTHE QUESTION OF EVIDENCE\n\n## 3.3.2 The Necessary Caution in the Collection and Assessment of Evidence\nAs with any evidence, one must proceed cautiously with the collection and analysis of digital evidence. It is essential to involve experts who can not only analyse the data but also explain their conclusions to non-specialists of computer science, such as to the parties and judges involved in a judicial proceeding. This issue will be developed in the section dedicated to experts.\nThe malware Stuxnet, identified in 2010, which physically damaged several centrifuges of an Iranian nuclear plant, and its subsequent investigation, serve as an interesting example. This malware is alleged to have been a joint cyber operation involving the United States and Israel, the purpose of which was to derail the Iranian nuclear programme and force the country to abandon the military dimension of its nuclear ambition. However, neither Iran nor any other State has officially attributed this cyber operation to the United States, Israel or any other State, and no State has claimed paternity for this malware. Stuxnet was first identified in June 2010 by a Belarusian cybersecurity company, VirusBlokAda, and was subsequently analysed by experts from various cybersecurity companies, including Kaspersky and Symantec. The latter published a report detailing the functioning of Stuxnet. An important part of this report dug into and analysed the computer code of Stuxnet, and identified two elements that may hint at a potential link between Israel and the malware.\nFirstly, they identified the project path ‘b:\\myrtus\\src\\objfre_w2k_x86\\i386\\guava.pdb’ in the driver file. The name of the folder is ‘myrtus’ and one of the files is ‘guava’, guava being a tropical tree of the myrtaceae family – that is to say of the myrtle family. The report further notes that:\n ibid 59–60.\n On Stuxnet see, generally, Kim Zetter, Countdown to Zero Day: Stuxnet and the Launch of the World’s First Digital Weapon (Crown 2014); see also David E Sanger, Confront and Conceal: Obama’s Secret Wars and Surprising Use of American Power (Crown 2012).\n Nicolas Falliere, Liam O Murchu and Eric Chien, ‘W32.Stuxnet Dossier (Version 1.4)’ (Symantec 2011) www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/w32_stuxnet_dossier.pdf.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE\n\nIn other words, the names ‘myrtus’ and ‘guava’ could hypothetically refer to Queen Esther of the Old Testament, and thus could be understood as a reference to the situation of the Jewish people in Persia, the State that preceded the Islamic Republic of Iran.\nSecondly, Stuxnet established a registry key value of 19790509, which would allow Stuxnet’s future intrusion attempts to identify whether the targeted computer was already infected:\n[i]f this value is equal to 19790509 the threat will exit. This is thought to be an infection marker or a ‘do not infect’ marker. If this is set correctly infection will not occur. The value may be a random string and represent nothing, but also appears to match the format of date markers used in the threat. As a date, the value may be May 9, 1979. This date could be an arbitrary date, a birth date, or some other significant date. While on May 9, 1979 a variety of historical events occurred, according to Wikipedia ‘Habib Elghanian was executed by a firing squad in Tehran sending shock waves through the closely knit Iranian Jewish community. He was the first Jew and one of the first civilians to be executed by the new Islamic government. This prompted the mass exodus of the once 100,000 member strong Jewish community of Iran which continues to this day.’ Symantec cautions readers on drawing any attribution conclusions. Attackers would have the natural desire to implicate another party.\nIn summary, these two elements found in the lines of the Stuxnet computer code could be references to historical events involving Iran and its Jewish population, and have therefore been analysed by some as implicating Israel in the creation of Stuxnet. These clues and their analysis should nevertheless be treated with caution. While they may point to the responsible party, they may also have been put there deliberately by the creators of the code to lead investigators into wrongly implicating Israel. Thus, this type of evidence should not be considered as clear proof of Israeli responsibility, but merely a nudge in that direction.\n ibid 24.\n ibid 18.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTHE QUESTION OF EVIDENCE\nThe example of Stuxnet demonstrates the importance of involving competent experts in the search for and analysis of technical evidence. It also shows how important it is to approach technical evidence critically. Cyber operations are indeed a highly technical phenomenon, but this does not mean that their analysis and attribution should be limited to a technical approach. On the contrary, it is essential that, alongside technical experts, experts from other disciplines are also involved in an investigation.\n## 3.3.3 The Validity of Unlawfully Collected Evidence\nCyberspace is characterised by the interconnection of computer networks, making it possible to remotely access various connected networks and computer systems. This feature makes access to digital evidence easier on a technical level. It also facilitates the task of the perpetrator of a cyber operation wishing to erase or blur their tracks. It is indeed relatively easy for them to access the clues they may have left and to move, manipulate or destroy them. It is therefore essential for the victim of a cyber operation wishing to seize and secure potential evidence to act as quickly and thoroughly as possible before the perpetrator erases their tracks. For this reason, investigators must act with a certain discretion so as not to accelerate the perpetrator's attempts to modify and remove the evidence they may have left behind.\nOne of the main features of cyberspace that affects the seizure of technical evidence in criminal, terrorist and inter-state cases is the transnational dimension of cyberspace. Indeed, a cyber operation conducted or sponsored by one State against another will probably transit through computer systems and networks located in third-party States. The procedure for the collection of technical evidence by the victim State from computer systems and networks located within its territory is governed by that State's domestic law. Conversely, the collection of evidence from computer systems and networks located abroad (and outside of the victim State's jurisdiction) may be deemed unlawful, and\n Christiane Féral-Schuhl, *Cyberdroit 2011/2012. Le droit à l'épreuve de l'internet* (6th edn, Dalloz 2010) 992.\n Jonathan Bourguignon, 'La recherche de la preuve informatique et l'exercice des compétences extraterritoriales de l'Etat' in Société Française pour le Droit International, *Internet et le droit international* (Colloque de Rouen, Pedone 2014) 357–372.\n Féral-Schuhl (n 38) 992 et seq.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE\n\nA State’s seizure of evidence from computer systems and networks located within the jurisdiction of another State and in the absence of the said State’s consent would most likely constitute an internationally wrongful act. More specifically, it would probably constitute a violation of the latter State’s territorial sovereignty. The wrongfulness of the seizure may nevertheless be mitigated or even precluded when the responsible State can prove that the seizure occurred in the context of a circumstance precluding wrongfulness. For instance, a victim State that seizes evidence from the network of the State responsible for a cyber operation may claim that their seizure of evidence (in violation of the latter State’s jurisdiction) constitutes a countermeasure. However, this may prove a difficult line of defence. The victim State may claim that it was necessary to seize evidence before the responsible State had a chance to remove or tamper with it. The responsible State has a prime opportunity to do so if the victim State requests its cooperation or if the responsible State is aware of the seizure operation. Necessity may be invoked to preclude the wrongfulness of an act performed by a State to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril. It appears thus fragile ground to justify a cyber operation aimed at seizing evidence in the computer systems of another State. The fragility of these two potential justifications for such acts imposes to therefore analyse the admissibility and validity of evidence collected unlawfully.\nWould evidence that is illegally obtained be considered legitimate before a court? More specifically, would illegally obtained evidence be admissible in contentious proceedings before the ICJ? There is no answer to this question in the Statute and Rules of the Court. However, in the Corfu Channel case the judges accepted evidence that was unlawfully acquired by the United Kingdom. It must be pointed out, however, that the judges did not rule on the validity of the evidence. In this case, the United Kingdom justified the illegal seizure of the evidence as follows:\nAccording to that [United Kingdom] Government, the corpora delicti must be secured as quickly as possible, for fear they should be taken away, without leaving traces, by the authors of the minelaying or by the Albanian authorities. This justification took two distinct forms in the United Kingdom Government’s arguments. It was presented first as a\n Corfu Channel (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v. Albania) (Judgment on the Merits) [1949] ICJ Reports 4, 34.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTHE QUESTION OF EVIDENCE\nnew and special application of the theory of intervention, by means of which the State intervening would secure possession of evidence in the territory of another State, in order to submit it to an international tribunal and thus facilitate its task.\nThe United Kingdom Agent, in his speech in reply, has further classified ‘Operation Retail’ among methods of self-protection or self-help.\nThe Court rejected these two justifications and considered the conduct of the United Kingdom to be unlawful. However, the Court still accepted and considered the illegally obtained evidence. It is interesting to note that the line of defence used by the British government approximates to the one that could be used by a State for the illegal seizure of computer evidence, as discussed above. It is likely that the Court’s position will remain unchanged in a case involving a similar seizure of evidence, and that therefore the wrongfulness of those actions would not be precluded.\nThis point is very important because a significant amount of evidence, digital or otherwise, provided by States regarding a cyber operation, could be acquired illegally. With respect to digital evidence, it has already been shown that collection from servers under the jurisdiction of other States (without their consent) may constitute an internationally wrongful act. States could also present evidence collected more or less lawfully by their intelligence services. If espionage is not unlawful under international law, it may give rise to conduct violating certain norms of international law, in particular the territorial sovereignty of the targeted State or the principle of non-intervention.\nThe hack of Sony Pictures Entertainment in 2014 is a good illustration. As seen earlier, the United States attributed this cyber operation to North Korea without publicly presenting evidence supporting their accusation. This lack of evidence could be explained by the fact that the United States was able to identify North Korea as responsible for the cyber operation through the surveillance of North Korean networks by the National Security Agency (NSA). In other words, the attribution was made possible not by technical evidence collected after the cyber operation, but rather by collecting information on North Korean activities conducted prior to the cyber operation concerned.

In this sense, neither the Statute nor the Rules of Court clarify who may be called as an expert in a case before the ICJ. A definition can be found in the Agreement between the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea and the Federal Republic of Germany regarding the Headquarters of the Tribunal, which states that an ‘expert’ is ‘a person called at the instance of a party to a dispute or at the instance of the Tribunal to present testimony in the form of expert opinions, based on special knowledge, skills, experience or training’ (Article 1(l)).\nIn a dispute related to a cyber operation, it is essential to involve experts for two main reasons. Firstly, it is possible that neither the judges nor counsel have the requisite knowledge to understand the technical details of the dispute. Secondly, it is essential that the computer evidence provided by the parties be analysed by qualified experts who can attest to its authenticity and provide the relevant analysis.\nIn a case before the ICJ, experts can be involved in four different ways: they may be appointed by the parties; the judges may consult them in an informal manner; or decide to involve them in the proceedings; and finally, it is possible for the judges to appoint assessors who sit in on the proceedings but do not have the right to vote.\n## 3.4.1 Experts Appointed by the Parties\nMost of the computer-based evidence that may be collected and presented in relation to a cyber operation should be collected and analysed by experts to ensure that it is authentic and to establish the facts in the\n Giorgio Gaja, ‘Assessing Expert Evidence in the ICJ’ (2017) 15 The Law &amp; Practice of International Courts and Tribunals 409, *passim*; Malintoppi (n 27) 430–434.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTHE QUESTION OF EVIDENCE\nmost accurate manner. Consequently, States wishing to collect such evidence will have recourse to experts generally available within the State's computer-security services or through the contracting of private cybersecurity companies. For example, the Democratic Party decided to use the private company CrowdStrike to analyse the hack that it suffered in 2016, and it was on the basis of the evidence gathered by that company that US authorities attributed the cyber operation to Russian intelligence services.\nBeyond the investigation, and the process of gathering and analysing evidence, it is essential that experts are involved in the presentation of evidence, especially in the event of a judicial proceeding. Indeed, their participation and their explanations render such evidence intelligible to people who are not familiar with computer science. Their participation in judicial proceedings also permits an adversarial dialogue between the experts of the two parties.\n## 3.4.2 'Invisible' Experts Consulted by the Court\nThe ICJ, like other international jurisdictions, has to deal with disputes involving an important technical dimension requiring some specific expertise. This is especially the case for border disputes. The subject has been analysed by Robert Yewdall Jennings, who notes that:\nthe Court has not infrequently employed cartographers, hydrographers, geographers, linguists, and even specialised legal experts to assist in the understanding of the issue in a case before it; and has not on the whole felt any need to make this public knowledge or even to apprise the parties.^[46]^\nIn some cases involving a strong technical dimension, the judges of the ICJ have consulted informal experts to assist them, but these experts were not officially involved in the proceedings. Generally, such experts act as temporary members of the Registry of the Court and their findings are not communicated to the parties or made public.^[47]^\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nEXPERT OPINION EVIDENCE\n\nWhile such consultation of ‘invisible’ experts may be pardonable if the input they provide relates to the scientific margins of a case, the situation is quite different in complex scientific disputes, as is the case here. Under circumstances such as in the present case, adopting such a practice would deprive the Court of the above-mentioned advantages of transparency, openness, procedural fairness, and the ability for the Parties to comment upon or otherwise assist the Court in understanding the evidence before it. These are concerns based not purely on abstract principle, but on the good administration of justice.\nA distinction should be drawn between situations in which invisible experts are consulted on technical issues relevant – but not decisive – to the case, and situations in which they may critically influence the outcome of the case. However, this distinction has not yet been made.\nThe distinction proposed above would be particularly relevant in a dispute relating to a cyber operation. Judges may have recourse to invisible experts to assist them in their understanding of the functioning of the Internet and relevant computer systems, specifically to help them in developing a general knowledge of the subject matter of the dispute. Conversely, it would be desirable for matters related to the evidence provided by the parties, as well as technical problems specifically related to the case, to be dealt with by experts appointed by the Court and taking part in the proceedings. In such cases, as developed below, expert opinions are communicated to the parties who can then comment on them. This would be particularly relevant and important for disputes regarding cyber operations, as the proceedings may involve a large amount of technical evidence, the assessment of which by experts may be crucial.\n The expression ‘experts fantômes’ is borrowed from Judges Awn Shawkat Al-Khasawneh and Bruno Simma: Joint Dissenting Opinion, Judges Al-Khasawneh and Simma in *Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay* (Argentina v. Uruguay) (Judgment) [2010] ICJ Reports 14, 114.\n Lucas Carlos Lima, ‘Expert Advisor or Non-voting Adjudicator?

Article 67 of the Rules of Court clarifies the position regarding the appointment of experts by judges:\n1. If the Court considers it necessary to arrange for an enquiry or an expert opinion, it shall, after hearing the parties, issue an order to this effect, defining the subject of the enquiry or expert opinion, stating the number and mode of appointment of the persons to hold the enquiry or of the experts, and laying down the procedure to be followed. Where appropriate, the Court shall require persons appointed to carry out an enquiry, or to give an expert opinion, to make a solemn declaration.\n2. Every report or record of an enquiry and every expert opinion shall be communicated to the parties, which shall be given the opportunity of commenting upon it.\nThus, unlike invisible experts, these experts are officially appointed by the Court and their findings are made public, thereby permitting the parties to submit observations.\nThe Court has appointed experts in a very limited number of cases,^[53]^ as Lucas Carlos Lima points out:\nExperts ex curia were appointed by the ICJ in only three cases. In the Corfu Channel (United Kingdom v. Albania) case, the Court nominated three naval experts, who conducted a site visit and subsequently presented a report which the parties had the opportunity to comment upon. In the case of the Delimitation of the Maritime Boundary in the Gulf of Maine Area (Canada/United States of America), the Chamber of the Court appointed a naval expert to assist in the delimitation of the boundary between the two countries and his technical report was attached to the judgment. In the Maritime Delimitation in the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua), the Court appointed two experts\n^[52]^ This is also possible before other international courts and tribunals: Louis Savadogo, 'Le recours des juridictions internationales à des experts' (2004) 50 Annuaire français de droit international 231, 233.\n^[53]^ Devaney (n 49) 20–23.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nEXPERT OPINION EVIDENCE\n\nA number of scholars and ICJ judges have expressed their support for the use of Court-appointed experts, particularly in the context of litigation involving a critical technical dimension.\nThe use of Court-appointed experts, to analyse technical arguments presented by the parties to a dispute relating to a cyber operation, would have the advantage of providing the judges with an objective analysis of the evidence and allow them to concentrate on the legal issues.\n## 3.4.4 Assessors Appointed by the Court\nICJ judges may appoint assessors, who may sit with the Court but do not have the right to vote. This possibility is opened by Article 30(2) of the Statute of the Court, according to which ‘[t]he Rules of the Court may provide for assessors to sit with the Court or with any of its chambers, without the right to vote’. This provision is clarified by Article 9 of the Rules of Court, which provides that this possibility is available in contentious and advisory cases and that these assessors ‘shall be appointed by secret ballot and by a majority of the votes of the judges composing the Court for the case’. Neither the Statute nor the Rules of the Court specify whether the State Parties are to be involved in the procedure for appointing assessors.\nAs Giorgio Gaja points out, no assessor has ever been appointed in a case before the ICJ. He argues that there are two reasons for this: firstly, even if they do not have the right to vote, the assessors could be seen as wielding too much influence over the decision of the judges; secondly, the parties and their experts would not be informed and thus they would not be able to comment on the opinions expressed by the assessors.\nIn most disputes regarding cyber operations, which may be brought before the ICJ, the technical expertise provided by the experts appointed by the parties or by the Court would probably be sufficient, and it would\n Lima (n 49) 1131. The three cases he is referring to are: Corfu Channel (Merits) (n 41); Delimitation of the Maritime Boundary in the Gulf of Maine Area (Canada/United States of America) (Judgment) [1984] ICJ Reports 246; Territorial and Maritime Dispute between Nicaragua and Honduras in the Caribbean Sea (Nicaragua v.

Such disputes may involve a significant amount of highly technical evidence, the collection and assessment of which by the parties and by the judges, in the case of judicial proceedings, may be challenging. Conversely, the presentation of technical evidence relating to cyber operations is not particularly challenging, as most of it may be easily presented as documentary evidence.\nStates could, however, be reluctant to make such evidence public during judicial proceedings. Firstly, from the point of view of the State, by revealing the collected evidence, it is likely to give indications about its computing capabilities. Secondly, by publicly disclosing information about a cyber operation, there is a risk that the vulnerabilities exploited by this cyber operation would be taken advantage of by other actors to perpetrate cyber operations. This has been demonstrated by WannaCry$^{57}$ and the wave of cyber operations that affected a large number of people, institutions and businesses in May 2017.$^{58}$ EternalBlue, the vulnerability exploited by some cyber operations and revealed in the summer of 2016, was obtained from the NSA through a hack by the Shadow Brokers.$^{59}$ Microsoft had released a fix for this vulnerability,$^{60}$ but it seems that\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nThe establishment of the facts and the attribution of a cyber operation carry an important technical dimension, but it would be a mistake to reduce them merely to technical processes. It is therefore essential that, alongside the technical experts, experts from other disciplines with a good understanding of the functioning of cyberspace and cyber operations are involved in these processes, and potentially involved in judicial proceedings. Indeed, these experts would help to bridge the technical and legal dimensions of the dispute. This is also the aim of the present chapter, which bridges the technical dimension of attribution analysed in the previous chapter and the legal dimension of attribution studied in the next.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press",

This leads to the question of how such evidence may be used and considered admissible in a judicial proceeding, or more generally in an international dispute, related to a cyber operation.\nThe development of State activities in cyberspace, notably offensive cyber operations, has led to international disputes between States. To date, a State has neither disputed a cyber operation before an international court or tribunal nor raised the issue before the UN Security Council. Generally, victim States have chosen to respond through extra-juridical measures, such as cyber countermeasures or measures of retorsion. However, there is the possibility that a State, in future, may bring a charge of harmful cyber operations before an international court or tribunal or before the UN Security Council.\nDifferent procedures for the collection, presentation and assessment of evidence exist depending on the international court or tribunal selected and the circumstances of the case. The assertion presented hereunder is that the International Court of Justice (ICJ) would be the most suitable judicial organ to deal with an international dispute arising from cyber operations conducted by one State against another. Thus, this chapter considers the procedures for the collection and assessment of evidence that may be applied in the event of a case before the ICJ. Before the ICJ, all parties are equal and thus have equal rights to submit and present their legal case.

In the Minquiers and Ecrehos case, the ICJ specified that ‘each Party has to prove its alleged title and the facts upon which it relies’.\nThe procedure regarding the production and assessment of evidence for a contentious case before the ICJ is prescribed by Articles 48 to 52 of the Statute of the Court and clarified in the Rules of the Court. In addition, Practice Directions for use by States, which had appeared before being adopted by the ICJ in 2001, have since been amended several times. While the Practice Directions are non-binding, they clarify procedure before the Court. It must be noted that the ICJ is not bound to the evidence and facts submitted by the parties and may also arbitrarily decide to collect and use evidence autonomously.\nThis chapter is comprised of four sections dealing, respectively, with State practice regarding evidence related to cyber operations (3.1), evidence in international law (3.2), documentary evidence (3.3) and expert opinion evidence (3.4).\n## 3.1 State Practice on Evidence Relating to Cyber Operations\nThe nascent State practice on responding to state-sponsored cyber operations seems to demonstrate that States are increasingly aware of the need to support their accusations with evidence proving the facts and the alleged paternity of the cyber operations concerned. This is particularly crucial regarding cyber conduct, as cyberspace offers numerous opportunities to hide or forge the real paternity of a cyber operation, notably by using proxy computer systems or botnets located in other countries. Some perpetrators have even inserted misleading hints into the computer code of a virus in an attempt to shift the blame onto a third party. This behaviour, as well as the possible misinterpretation of available evidence,\n Robert Kolb, *La Cour internationale de Justice* (A Pedone 2014) 956–958.\n *Minquiers and Ecrehos* (France v.

For many years, the USA did not officially respond to cyber operations targeting their interests, and thus did not disclose publicly any evidence proving the facts and possible attribution. The 2014 Sony Pictures Entertainment hack marked a watershed in US practice. The American subsidiary of the Japanese conglomerate Sony Corporation was hacked and a significant amount of data was stolen from the company. This data was then publicly released by the hackers in November 2014. The hackers demanded the cancellation of the planned release of the film *The Interview*, a comedy about the assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. US officials alleged that the attack was sponsored by North Korea. North Korea, however, denied any involvement. The United States indicated that it had evidence of the involvement of North Korea, and the White House announced that it would adopt a proportional response. In reaction to this cyber operation allegedly executed by North Korea, the United States adopted new sanctions against North Korea; additionally, it is considered having adopted an unofficial covert response in the form of unilateral extrajudicial measures. In this instance, the United States attributed the cyber operation to North Korea and responded to it, without disclosing the evidence.\nThe 2016 Democratic National Committee (DNC) hack marked an even bigger watershed in US practice as the United States decided, for the first time, to disclose evidence corroborating the attribution of a cyber operation to another State, the Russian Federation. On 22 July 2016, a few days before the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, Wikileaks published 19,252 emails and 8,034 attachments from the DNC, the governing body of the Democratic Party. The leak contained emails and documents from seven key DNC staff members suggesting that the DNC leadership had worked to advantage Hillary Clinton over Bernie\n David E Sanger and Nicole Perlroth, ‘U.S. Said to Find North Korea Ordered Cyberattack on Sony’, *The New York Times* (17 December 2014) www.nytimes.com/2014/12/18/world/asia/us-links-north-korea-to-sony-hacking.html.\n Dave Boyer, ‘White House Threatens “Proportional” Response to North Korea Cyberattacks on Sony Pictures’, *The Washington Times* (18 December 2014) www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/18/white-house-threatens-proportional-response-north-/\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTHE QUESTION OF EVIDENCE\nSanders. On 7 October 2016, a ‘Joint Statement from the Department of Homeland Security and Office of the Director of National Intelligence on Election Security’ was released, stating:\nThe U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations. The recent disclosures of alleged hacked e-mails on sites like DCLeaks.com and WikiLeaks and by the Guccifer 2.0 online persona are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process.

This has been the practice, for instance, of international fact-finding commissions, such as the ones established after the 2008 armed conflict in Georgia. The development of international justice has strengthened this practice and made the international community demand an increasingly higher standard of proof.\nStates increasingly rely on international fact-finding commissions following international incidents that may have led to inter-state disputes, and this development is reflected in various branches and aspects of international law. The crash of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 in Ukraine in 2014 offers an interesting case study regarding State practice on the establishment of fact-finding commissions as well as on the collection and assessment of evidence outside of judicial proceedings. This example is also symptomatic of the challenges posed by technical and scientific evidence.\nOn 17 July 2014, Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 departed from Amsterdam-Schiphol Airport towards its destination, Kuala Lumpur. However, the aircraft never reached its destination having crashed in eastern Ukraine, in the Donetsk region. At that time, this area was still the scene of an armed conflict between the combatants of the People's Republic of Donetsk and the Ukrainian army. There were no survivors among the 283 passengers and 15 crew members. The circumstances of the crash were unclear and conflicting narratives were proposed. Initially,\nwww.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/JAR_16-20296A_GRIZZLY%20STEPPE-2016-1229.pdf.\n Joseph C Witenberg, ‘La théorie des preuves devant les juridictions internationales’ (1936) 56 RCADI 1, 6–7.\n ‘Report of the International Fact-Finding Commission on the Conflict in Georgia’ (2009) www.ceiig.ch/Report.html.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTHE QUESTION OF EVIDENCE\nthe pro-Russian separatists and the Ukrainian army accused one another of having caused the crash by missile fire. The day after the disaster, members of the UN Security Council called for an ‘independent, comprehensive and credible international investigation’.\nA Joint Investigation Team (JIT), coordinated by the Dutch Safety Board (OVV – Onderzoeksraad Voor Veiligheid), was established. The work of the JIT was carried out in close collaboration with the observers of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and the emergency services of the People’s Republic of Donetsk. The team first recovered pieces of the wreckage as well as the black boxes of the aircraft from the separatists and repatriated them to the Netherlands for analysis. The OVV published its final report on 13 October 2015. The analysis of the black boxes, the reconstituted wreckage of the aircraft and other materials collected allowed the OVV to assert that the crash was caused by a surface missile – a 9M38 missile equipped with a 9N314M-type warhead installed on a BUK-type ground-air system – fired from a zone controlled by separatists, but where fighting with the Ukrainian army was underway. The conclusions of the OVV report were highly controversial. Almaz-Antey, the Russian manufacturer of the incriminated BUK missile system, carried out its own investigation, reconstructing in particular the effects of the explosion on a similar aircraft removed from traffic. From this study, it claimed that the missile had been fired from an area under the control of the Ukrainian army. Moreover, the Russian Federal Air Transport Agency (Rosaviatsiya) was also sceptical, and stated that it wanted to conduct its own investigation.

For example, Microsoft published a white paper in 2016 suggesting, among other things, that such a mechanism be created following the model of the investigation mechanism of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). They argue that the proposed mechanism would create a synergy between the expertise of States, private actors and academics in order to work together to identify the perpetrators of malicious cyber operations:\nThere could be a similar mechanism by which governments and the private sector can provide evidence to support technical attribution and obtain some level of validation through rigorous peer review. At its core, this organization would consist of technical experts from across governments, the private sector, academia, and civil society with the capability to examine tactics, techniques, and procedures used by nation-state attackers, as well as indicators of compromise that suggest a given attack was by\n ‘JIT: MH17 Shot Down with Missile Fired from Pro-Russian Rebel Controlled Field’ (NL Times, 28 September 2016) http://nltimes.nl/2016/09/28/jit-mh17-shot-missile-fired-pro-russian-rebel-controlled-field.\n Scott Charney et al, ‘From Articulation to Implementation: Enabling Progress on Cybersecurity Norms’ (Microsoft 2016) 10–12 www.microsoft.com/en-us/cybersecurity/content-hub/enabling-progress-on-cybersecurity-norms.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTHE QUESTION OF EVIDENCE\na nation-state. Its essential output would be a technical analysis of the attack and evidence of attribution. In some cases, based on agreed-upon criteria, it might publish its findings. Some will of course oppose this approach. Governments in particular may be reluctant to empower an independent organization to make findings that may be both politically important and politically charged.\nIn law, evidence ‘tends to prove the existence or nonexistence of some fact’. In the case of cyber operations, the facts are generally articulated around two main axes: the identification of the cyber operation and its consequences and the attribution of the cyber operation.\nAs pointed out by the UNGGE in its 2015 report, ‘In case of ICT incidents, States should consider all relevant information, including the larger context of the event, the challenges of attribution in the ICT environment and the nature and extent of the consequences.’ Indeed, the fact that an investigation relates to a cyber operation does not mean that evidence should be collected solely within cyberspace. Evidence gathered in the real world can also be relevant, even crucial, in determining the facts and attribution of a cyber operation.\nEvidence may consist of documentary evidence, physical evidence, expert or witness testimony, and hearsay evidence. This chapter focuses on the two main forms of evidence that may be relevant in the cyber context: documentary evidence and testimonial evidence from experts.\n## 3.3 Documentary Evidence\nThe term ‘documentary evidence’ refers to evidence in the form of written documents that support the alleged facts. It should be emphasised that documentary evidence is the main form of evidence presented before the ICJ. The Statute and Rules of the Court contain several provisions on the production of documents as documentary evidence\n ibid 11.\n Jonathan Law (ed), A Dictionary of Law (online version) (8th edn, OUP 2015), ‘Evidence’; see also Jean Salmon (ed), Dictionnaire de droit international public (Bruylant 2001) 874.\n UNGA, ‘Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security’ (22 July 2015) UN Doc A/70/174.\n Witenberg (n 14) 59.\n Loretta Malintoppi, ‘Fact Finding and Evidence before the International Court of Justice (Notably in Scientific-Related Disputes)’ (2016) 7 Journal of International Dispute Settlement 421, 422.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE\nwithout, however, defining the types of authorised documents, thus leaving the parties and judges an important margin of discretion.\nThe various texts relating to the procedure and the production of evidence in a proceeding before the ICJ do not contain any specific provision related to digital evidence, with the exception of Practice direction IXbis. This provision states that a document that can be considered ‘part of a publication readily available’ under Article 56 (4) of the Rules of Court ‘may be in any format (printed or electronic), form (physical or on-line, such as posted on the internet) or on any data medium (on paper, on digital or any other media)’. Practice direction IXbis demonstrates the Court’s openness to digital evidence, without giving further details.\n## 3.3.1 Typology of Documentary Evidence That May Be Collected in Relation to Cyber Operations\nThe majority of evidence that would be produced by a State regarding a cyber operation, both for the purpose of establishing the facts and for attribution, could be in a written form – i.e. documentary evidence – and would therefore not pose any particular procedural problem in proceedings before a court.\nHowever, an important clarification must be made at this stage. This remark concerns only the presentation of evidence and neither its collection and admissibility nor the capacity of judges to assess it. The latter will be analysed later in this chapter.\nDuring the event of a cyber operation, a number of traces are usually left and may be collected as evidence. Most of these traces can be presented in the form of written documents to constitute documentary evidence.\nIn the case of a computer virus, the computer code of the virus can be analysed and presented as evidence. Computer codes consisting of multiple lines of code can easily be considered as written evidence.\nAdditionally, IP addresses may be collected and presented in a cyber-related dispute. These IP addresses may be used to identify the different computers and servers involved in the cyber operation, either because these computers and servers were used for its launch or transit, or\n See, for instance, Marco Roscini, ‘Evidentiary Issues in International Disputes Related to State Responsibility for Cyber Operations’ (2015) 50 Texas International Law Journal 233.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTHE QUESTION OF EVIDENCE\nbecause they were the target of the cyber operation. The presentation of these IP addresses may be accompanied by the server logs, consisting of lists of activities performed by the relevant servers including the general time of connection of each IP address. These elements may be particularly useful in establishing the facts and timeline.\nThese different pieces of evidence are usually summarised in a report that places them in context in order to establish the facts. Moreover, this cyber-related evidence may be accompanied by non-digital evidence aimed, for instance, at establishing the damage suffered by the victim of the cyber operation, or the relationship between the computers involved and individuals and whether these individuals were acting on behalf of a State.\nThe purpose of the previous paragraphs was to demonstrate the forms in which digital evidence may be presented during proceedings before an international court or tribunal. The difficulty involved in the identification and collection of this type of evidence should not be underestimated. The process may entail a great deal of technical expertise. A further difficulty in the collection of cyber evidence involves proving the authenticity and integrity of the evidence. This is a task reserved for the experts who may take part in the judicial proceedings.\nTo date, no dispute between States relating to a cyber operation has given rise to a judicial proceeding. However, in several instances of cyber operations alleged to be either state sponsored or even state conducted, States and non-state actors, such as cybersecurity firms, have collected evidence and presented it in reports detailing these cyber operations and attributing them to groups or individuals. These various reports provide a basis for the analysis of what elements may be presented by a State in the context of a judicial proceeding on a state-sponsored cyber operation.\nIn 2013, the US cybersecurity firm Mandiant released a report detailing an investigation on computer security breaches allegedly sponsored by the Chinese government that occurred (between 2004 and 2013) at hundreds of organisations around the world. The investigation focused on cyber espionage activities considered to be the result of a single group referred to by the Mandiant teams as APT 1. The objective was to\n ibid 239.\n Mandiant Intelligence Center Report, ‘APT1: Exposing One of China’s Cyber Espionage Units’ (Mandiant 2013) 1 http://intelreport.mandiant.com/Mandiant_APT1_Report.pdf.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE\n\nAPT1 maintains an extensive infrastructure of computer systems around the world.\n- APT1 controls thousands of systems in support of their computer intrusion activities.\n- In the last two years we have observed APT1 establish a minimum of 937 Command and Control (C2) servers hosted on 849 distinct IP addresses in 13 countries. The majority of these 849 unique IP addresses were registered to organizations in China (709), followed by the U.S. (109).\n- In the last three years we have observed APT1 use fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) resolving to 988 unique IP addresses.\n- Over a two-year period (January 2011 to January 2013) we confirmed 1,905 instances of APT1 actors logging into their attack infrastructure from 832 different IP addresses with Remote Desktop, a tool that provides a remote user with an interactive graphical interface to a system.\n- In the last several years we have confirmed 2,551 FQDNs attributed to APT1.\nOnce the structure and activities of APT 1 were established, Mandiant focused on the question of attribution. Investigators determined that 97 per cent of APT 1's remote access used the 'Chinese (Simplified) – US Keyboard' setting. In addition, 98 per cent of the IP addresses connecting remotely to the computer systems controlled by APT 1 were Chinese and almost all the IP addresses used to communicate with the target computer systems were Chinese and located in the Shanghai area. In addition, investigators were able to identify the computer traces left by three individuals considered to be members of APT 1. The elements used to identify these individuals included multiple IP addresses, email addresses, URLs and their respective modus operandi. Using this digital evidence, as well as non-digital evidence related to the functioning of the Chinese army and the identified location, Mandiant concluded that APT\n ibid 4.\n ibid 51–58.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTHE QUESTION OF EVIDENCE\n\n## 3.3.2 The Necessary Caution in the Collection and Assessment of Evidence\nAs with any evidence, one must proceed cautiously with the collection and analysis of digital evidence. It is essential to involve experts who can not only analyse the data but also explain their conclusions to non-specialists of computer science, such as to the parties and judges involved in a judicial proceeding. This issue will be developed in the section dedicated to experts.\nThe malware Stuxnet, identified in 2010, which physically damaged several centrifuges of an Iranian nuclear plant, and its subsequent investigation, serve as an interesting example. This malware is alleged to have been a joint cyber operation involving the United States and Israel, the purpose of which was to derail the Iranian nuclear programme and force the country to abandon the military dimension of its nuclear ambition. However, neither Iran nor any other State has officially attributed this cyber operation to the United States, Israel or any other State, and no State has claimed paternity for this malware. Stuxnet was first identified in June 2010 by a Belarusian cybersecurity company, VirusBlokAda, and was subsequently analysed by experts from various cybersecurity companies, including Kaspersky and Symantec. The latter published a report detailing the functioning of Stuxnet. An important part of this report dug into and analysed the computer code of Stuxnet, and identified two elements that may hint at a potential link between Israel and the malware.\nFirstly, they identified the project path ‘b:\\myrtus\\src\\objfre_w2k_x86\\i386\\guava.pdb’ in the driver file. The name of the folder is ‘myrtus’ and one of the files is ‘guava’, guava being a tropical tree of the myrtaceae family – that is to say of the myrtle family. The report further notes that:\n ibid 59–60.\n On Stuxnet see, generally, Kim Zetter, Countdown to Zero Day: Stuxnet and the Launch of the World’s First Digital Weapon (Crown 2014); see also David E Sanger, Confront and Conceal: Obama’s Secret Wars and Surprising Use of American Power (Crown 2012).\n Nicolas Falliere, Liam O Murchu and Eric Chien, ‘W32.Stuxnet Dossier (Version 1.4)’ (Symantec 2011) www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/w32_stuxnet_dossier.pdf.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE\n\nIn other words, the names ‘myrtus’ and ‘guava’ could hypothetically refer to Queen Esther of the Old Testament, and thus could be understood as a reference to the situation of the Jewish people in Persia, the State that preceded the Islamic Republic of Iran.\nSecondly, Stuxnet established a registry key value of 19790509, which would allow Stuxnet’s future intrusion attempts to identify whether the targeted computer was already infected:\n[i]f this value is equal to 19790509 the threat will exit. This is thought to be an infection marker or a ‘do not infect’ marker. If this is set correctly infection will not occur. The value may be a random string and represent nothing, but also appears to match the format of date markers used in the threat. As a date, the value may be May 9, 1979. This date could be an arbitrary date, a birth date, or some other significant date. While on May 9, 1979 a variety of historical events occurred, according to Wikipedia ‘Habib Elghanian was executed by a firing squad in Tehran sending shock waves through the closely knit Iranian Jewish community. He was the first Jew and one of the first civilians to be executed by the new Islamic government. This prompted the mass exodus of the once 100,000 member strong Jewish community of Iran which continues to this day.’ Symantec cautions readers on drawing any attribution conclusions. Attackers would have the natural desire to implicate another party.\nIn summary, these two elements found in the lines of the Stuxnet computer code could be references to historical events involving Iran and its Jewish population, and have therefore been analysed by some as implicating Israel in the creation of Stuxnet. These clues and their analysis should nevertheless be treated with caution. While they may point to the responsible party, they may also have been put there deliberately by the creators of the code to lead investigators into wrongly implicating Israel. Thus, this type of evidence should not be considered as clear proof of Israeli responsibility, but merely a nudge in that direction.\n ibid 24.\n ibid 18.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTHE QUESTION OF EVIDENCE\nThe example of Stuxnet demonstrates the importance of involving competent experts in the search for and analysis of technical evidence. It also shows how important it is to approach technical evidence critically. Cyber operations are indeed a highly technical phenomenon, but this does not mean that their analysis and attribution should be limited to a technical approach. On the contrary, it is essential that, alongside technical experts, experts from other disciplines are also involved in an investigation.\n## 3.3.3 The Validity of Unlawfully Collected Evidence\nCyberspace is characterised by the interconnection of computer networks, making it possible to remotely access various connected networks and computer systems. This feature makes access to digital evidence easier on a technical level. It also facilitates the task of the perpetrator of a cyber operation wishing to erase or blur their tracks. It is indeed relatively easy for them to access the clues they may have left and to move, manipulate or destroy them. It is therefore essential for the victim of a cyber operation wishing to seize and secure potential evidence to act as quickly and thoroughly as possible before the perpetrator erases their tracks. For this reason, investigators must act with a certain discretion so as not to accelerate the perpetrator's attempts to modify and remove the evidence they may have left behind.\nOne of the main features of cyberspace that affects the seizure of technical evidence in criminal, terrorist and inter-state cases is the transnational dimension of cyberspace. Indeed, a cyber operation conducted or sponsored by one State against another will probably transit through computer systems and networks located in third-party States. The procedure for the collection of technical evidence by the victim State from computer systems and networks located within its territory is governed by that State's domestic law. Conversely, the collection of evidence from computer systems and networks located abroad (and outside of the victim State's jurisdiction) may be deemed unlawful, and\n Christiane Féral-Schuhl, *Cyberdroit 2011/2012. Le droit à l'épreuve de l'internet* (6th edn, Dalloz 2010) 992.\n Jonathan Bourguignon, 'La recherche de la preuve informatique et l'exercice des compétences extraterritoriales de l'Etat' in Société Française pour le Droit International, *Internet et le droit international* (Colloque de Rouen, Pedone 2014) 357–372.\n Féral-Schuhl (n 38) 992 et seq.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE\n\nA State’s seizure of evidence from computer systems and networks located within the jurisdiction of another State and in the absence of the said State’s consent would most likely constitute an internationally wrongful act. More specifically, it would probably constitute a violation of the latter State’s territorial sovereignty. The wrongfulness of the seizure may nevertheless be mitigated or even precluded when the responsible State can prove that the seizure occurred in the context of a circumstance precluding wrongfulness. For instance, a victim State that seizes evidence from the network of the State responsible for a cyber operation may claim that their seizure of evidence (in violation of the latter State’s jurisdiction) constitutes a countermeasure. However, this may prove a difficult line of defence. The victim State may claim that it was necessary to seize evidence before the responsible State had a chance to remove or tamper with it. The responsible State has a prime opportunity to do so if the victim State requests its cooperation or if the responsible State is aware of the seizure operation. Necessity may be invoked to preclude the wrongfulness of an act performed by a State to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril. It appears thus fragile ground to justify a cyber operation aimed at seizing evidence in the computer systems of another State. The fragility of these two potential justifications for such acts imposes to therefore analyse the admissibility and validity of evidence collected unlawfully.\nWould evidence that is illegally obtained be considered legitimate before a court? More specifically, would illegally obtained evidence be admissible in contentious proceedings before the ICJ? There is no answer to this question in the Statute and Rules of the Court. However, in the Corfu Channel case the judges accepted evidence that was unlawfully acquired by the United Kingdom. It must be pointed out, however, that the judges did not rule on the validity of the evidence. In this case, the United Kingdom justified the illegal seizure of the evidence as follows:\nAccording to that [United Kingdom] Government, the corpora delicti must be secured as quickly as possible, for fear they should be taken away, without leaving traces, by the authors of the minelaying or by the Albanian authorities. This justification took two distinct forms in the United Kingdom Government’s arguments. It was presented first as a\n Corfu Channel (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v. Albania) (Judgment on the Merits) [1949] ICJ Reports 4, 34.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTHE QUESTION OF EVIDENCE\nnew and special application of the theory of intervention, by means of which the State intervening would secure possession of evidence in the territory of another State, in order to submit it to an international tribunal and thus facilitate its task.\nThe United Kingdom Agent, in his speech in reply, has further classified ‘Operation Retail’ among methods of self-protection or self-help.\nThe Court rejected these two justifications and considered the conduct of the United Kingdom to be unlawful. However, the Court still accepted and considered the illegally obtained evidence. It is interesting to note that the line of defence used by the British government approximates to the one that could be used by a State for the illegal seizure of computer evidence, as discussed above. It is likely that the Court’s position will remain unchanged in a case involving a similar seizure of evidence, and that therefore the wrongfulness of those actions would not be precluded.\nThis point is very important because a significant amount of evidence, digital or otherwise, provided by States regarding a cyber operation, could be acquired illegally. With respect to digital evidence, it has already been shown that collection from servers under the jurisdiction of other States (without their consent) may constitute an internationally wrongful act. States could also present evidence collected more or less lawfully by their intelligence services. If espionage is not unlawful under international law, it may give rise to conduct violating certain norms of international law, in particular the territorial sovereignty of the targeted State or the principle of non-intervention.\nThe hack of Sony Pictures Entertainment in 2014 is a good illustration. As seen earlier, the United States attributed this cyber operation to North Korea without publicly presenting evidence supporting their accusation. This lack of evidence could be explained by the fact that the United States was able to identify North Korea as responsible for the cyber operation through the surveillance of North Korean networks by the National Security Agency (NSA). In other words, the attribution was made possible not by technical evidence collected after the cyber operation, but rather by collecting information on North Korean activities conducted prior to the cyber operation concerned.

In this sense, neither the Statute nor the Rules of Court clarify who may be called as an expert in a case before the ICJ. A definition can be found in the Agreement between the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea and the Federal Republic of Germany regarding the Headquarters of the Tribunal, which states that an ‘expert’ is ‘a person called at the instance of a party to a dispute or at the instance of the Tribunal to present testimony in the form of expert opinions, based on special knowledge, skills, experience or training’ (Article 1(l)).\nIn a dispute related to a cyber operation, it is essential to involve experts for two main reasons. Firstly, it is possible that neither the judges nor counsel have the requisite knowledge to understand the technical details of the dispute. Secondly, it is essential that the computer evidence provided by the parties be analysed by qualified experts who can attest to its authenticity and provide the relevant analysis.\nIn a case before the ICJ, experts can be involved in four different ways: they may be appointed by the parties; the judges may consult them in an informal manner; or decide to involve them in the proceedings; and finally, it is possible for the judges to appoint assessors who sit in on the proceedings but do not have the right to vote.\n## 3.4.1 Experts Appointed by the Parties\nMost of the computer-based evidence that may be collected and presented in relation to a cyber operation should be collected and analysed by experts to ensure that it is authentic and to establish the facts in the\n Giorgio Gaja, ‘Assessing Expert Evidence in the ICJ’ (2017) 15 The Law &amp; Practice of International Courts and Tribunals 409, *passim*; Malintoppi (n 27) 430–434.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTHE QUESTION OF EVIDENCE\nmost accurate manner. Consequently, States wishing to collect such evidence will have recourse to experts generally available within the State's computer-security services or through the contracting of private cybersecurity companies. For example, the Democratic Party decided to use the private company CrowdStrike to analyse the hack that it suffered in 2016, and it was on the basis of the evidence gathered by that company that US authorities attributed the cyber operation to Russian intelligence services.\nBeyond the investigation, and the process of gathering and analysing evidence, it is essential that experts are involved in the presentation of evidence, especially in the event of a judicial proceeding. Indeed, their participation and their explanations render such evidence intelligible to people who are not familiar with computer science. Their participation in judicial proceedings also permits an adversarial dialogue between the experts of the two parties.\n## 3.4.2 'Invisible' Experts Consulted by the Court\nThe ICJ, like other international jurisdictions, has to deal with disputes involving an important technical dimension requiring some specific expertise. This is especially the case for border disputes. The subject has been analysed by Robert Yewdall Jennings, who notes that:\nthe Court has not infrequently employed cartographers, hydrographers, geographers, linguists, and even specialised legal experts to assist in the understanding of the issue in a case before it; and has not on the whole felt any need to make this public knowledge or even to apprise the parties.^[46]^\nIn some cases involving a strong technical dimension, the judges of the ICJ have consulted informal experts to assist them, but these experts were not officially involved in the proceedings. Generally, such experts act as temporary members of the Registry of the Court and their findings are not communicated to the parties or made public.^[47]^\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nEXPERT OPINION EVIDENCE\n\nWhile such consultation of ‘invisible’ experts may be pardonable if the input they provide relates to the scientific margins of a case, the situation is quite different in complex scientific disputes, as is the case here. Under circumstances such as in the present case, adopting such a practice would deprive the Court of the above-mentioned advantages of transparency, openness, procedural fairness, and the ability for the Parties to comment upon or otherwise assist the Court in understanding the evidence before it. These are concerns based not purely on abstract principle, but on the good administration of justice.\nA distinction should be drawn between situations in which invisible experts are consulted on technical issues relevant – but not decisive – to the case, and situations in which they may critically influence the outcome of the case. However, this distinction has not yet been made.\nThe distinction proposed above would be particularly relevant in a dispute relating to a cyber operation. Judges may have recourse to invisible experts to assist them in their understanding of the functioning of the Internet and relevant computer systems, specifically to help them in developing a general knowledge of the subject matter of the dispute. Conversely, it would be desirable for matters related to the evidence provided by the parties, as well as technical problems specifically related to the case, to be dealt with by experts appointed by the Court and taking part in the proceedings. In such cases, as developed below, expert opinions are communicated to the parties who can then comment on them. This would be particularly relevant and important for disputes regarding cyber operations, as the proceedings may involve a large amount of technical evidence, the assessment of which by experts may be crucial.\n The expression ‘experts fantômes’ is borrowed from Judges Awn Shawkat Al-Khasawneh and Bruno Simma: Joint Dissenting Opinion, Judges Al-Khasawneh and Simma in *Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay* (Argentina v. Uruguay) (Judgment) [2010] ICJ Reports 14, 114.\n Lucas Carlos Lima, ‘Expert Advisor or Non-voting Adjudicator? The Potential Function of Assessors in the Procedure of the International Court of Justice’ (2016) 99 Rivista di diritto internazionale 1123, 1134; James Gerard Devaney, *Fact-Finding before the International Court of Justice* (CUP 2016) 83–88.\n Joint Dissenting Opinion, Judges Al-Khasawneh and Simma in *Pulp Mills* (Judgment) (n 48) 114.\n Gaja (n 45) 414.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTHE QUESTION OF EVIDENCE\n## 3.4.3 Experts Appointed by the Court\nIn a case before the ICJ, it is possible for judges to appoint experts.^[52]^ This possibility is provided for in Article 50 of the Statute of the Court, which states that '[t]he Court may, at any time, entrust any individual, body, bureau, commission, or other organisation that it may select, with the task of carrying out an enquiry or giving an expert opinion'. Article 67 of the Rules of Court clarifies the position regarding the appointment of experts by judges:\n1. If the Court considers it necessary to arrange for an enquiry or an expert opinion, it shall, after hearing the parties, issue an order to this effect, defining the subject of the enquiry or expert opinion, stating the number and mode of appointment of the persons to hold the enquiry or of the experts, and laying down the procedure to be followed. Where appropriate, the Court shall require persons appointed to carry out an enquiry, or to give an expert opinion, to make a solemn declaration.\n2. Every report or record of an enquiry and every expert opinion shall be communicated to the parties, which shall be given the opportunity of commenting upon it.\nThus, unlike invisible experts, these experts are officially appointed by the Court and their findings are made public, thereby permitting the parties to submit observations.\nThe Court has appointed experts in a very limited number of cases,^[53]^ as Lucas Carlos Lima points out:\nExperts ex curia were appointed by the ICJ in only three cases. In the Corfu Channel (United Kingdom v. Albania) case, the Court nominated three naval experts, who conducted a site visit and subsequently presented a report which the parties had the opportunity to comment upon. In the case of the Delimitation of the Maritime Boundary in the Gulf of Maine Area (Canada/United States of America), the Chamber of the Court appointed a naval expert to assist in the delimitation of the boundary between the two countries and his technical report was attached to the judgment. In the Maritime Delimitation in the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua), the Court appointed two experts\n^[52]^ This is also possible before other international courts and tribunals: Louis Savadogo, 'Le recours des juridictions internationales à des experts' (2004) 50 Annuaire français de droit international 231, 233.\n^[53]^ Devaney (n 49) 20–23.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nEXPERT OPINION EVIDENCE\n\nA number of scholars and ICJ judges have expressed their support for the use of Court-appointed experts, particularly in the context of litigation involving a critical technical dimension.\nThe use of Court-appointed experts, to analyse technical arguments presented by the parties to a dispute relating to a cyber operation, would have the advantage of providing the judges with an objective analysis of the evidence and allow them to concentrate on the legal issues.\n## 3.4.4 Assessors Appointed by the Court\nICJ judges may appoint assessors, who may sit with the Court but do not have the right to vote. This possibility is opened by Article 30(2) of the Statute of the Court, according to which ‘[t]he Rules of the Court may provide for assessors to sit with the Court or with any of its chambers, without the right to vote’. This provision is clarified by Article 9 of the Rules of Court, which provides that this possibility is available in contentious and advisory cases and that these assessors ‘shall be appointed by secret ballot and by a majority of the votes of the judges composing the Court for the case’. Neither the Statute nor the Rules of the Court specify whether the State Parties are to be involved in the procedure for appointing assessors.\nAs Giorgio Gaja points out, no assessor has ever been appointed in a case before the ICJ. He argues that there are two reasons for this: firstly, even if they do not have the right to vote, the assessors could be seen as wielding too much influence over the decision of the judges; secondly, the parties and their experts would not be informed and thus they would not be able to comment on the opinions expressed by the assessors.\nIn most disputes regarding cyber operations, which may be brought before the ICJ, the technical expertise provided by the experts appointed by the parties or by the Court would probably be sufficient, and it would\n Lima (n 49) 1131. The three cases he is referring to are: Corfu Channel (Merits) (n 41); Delimitation of the Maritime Boundary in the Gulf of Maine Area (Canada/United States of America) (Judgment) [1984] ICJ Reports 246; Territorial and Maritime Dispute between Nicaragua and Honduras in the Caribbean Sea (Nicaragua v. Honduras) (Judgment) [2007] ICJ Reports 659.\n Devaney (n 49) 218, 230–240.\n Gaja (n 45) 418; see also Lima (n 49) 1124, 1130.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTHE QUESTION OF EVIDENCE\ntherefore not be necessary for assessors to assist judges in the decision-making process.\n## 3.5 Concluding Remarks on the Question of Evidence\nThis chapter analysed the question of evidence in relation to a dispute regarding cyber operations. Such disputes may involve a significant amount of highly technical evidence, the collection and assessment of which by the parties and by the judges, in the case of judicial proceedings, may be challenging. Conversely, the presentation of technical evidence relating to cyber operations is not particularly challenging, as most of it may be easily presented as documentary evidence.\nStates could, however, be reluctant to make such evidence public during judicial proceedings. Firstly, from the point of view of the State, by revealing the collected evidence, it is likely to give indications about its computing capabilities. Secondly, by publicly disclosing information about a cyber operation, there is a risk that the vulnerabilities exploited by this cyber operation would be taken advantage of by other actors to perpetrate cyber operations. This has been demonstrated by WannaCry$^{57}$ and the wave of cyber operations that affected a large number of people, institutions and businesses in May 2017.$^{58}$ EternalBlue, the vulnerability exploited by some cyber operations and revealed in the summer of 2016, was obtained from the NSA through a hack by the Shadow Brokers.$^{59}$ Microsoft had released a fix for this vulnerability,$^{60}$ but it seems that\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nThe establishment of the facts and the attribution of a cyber operation carry an important technical dimension, but it would be a mistake to reduce them merely to technical processes. It is therefore essential that, alongside the technical experts, experts from other disciplines with a good understanding of the functioning of cyberspace and cyber operations are involved in these processes, and potentially involved in judicial proceedings. Indeed, these experts would help to bridge the technical and legal dimensions of the dispute. This is also the aim of the present chapter, which bridges the technical dimension of attribution analysed in the previous chapter and the legal dimension of attribution studied in the next.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press",

      "flat_text": "The evidence collected to identify the computers and individuals involved in a cyber operation may also be used to determine whether they were acting on behalf of a State. This leads to the question of how such evidence may be used and considered admissible in a judicial proceeding, or more generally in an international dispute, related to a cyber operation.\nThe development of State activities in cyberspace, notably offensive cyber operations, has led to international disputes between States. To date, a State has neither disputed a cyber operation before an international court or tribunal nor raised the issue before the UN Security Council. Generally, victim States have chosen to respond through extra-juridical measures, such as cyber countermeasures or measures of retorsion. However, there is the possibility that a State, in future, may bring a charge of harmful cyber operations before an international court or tribunal or before the UN Security Council.\nDifferent procedures for the collection, presentation and assessment of evidence exist depending on the international court or tribunal selected and the circumstances of the case. The assertion presented hereunder is that the International Court of Justice (ICJ) would be the most suitable judicial organ to deal with an international dispute arising from cyber operations conducted by one State against another. Thus, this chapter considers the procedures for the collection and assessment of evidence that may be applied in the event of a case before the ICJ. Before the ICJ, all parties are equal and thus have equal rights to submit and present their legal case.

In the Minquiers and Ecrehos case, the ICJ specified that ‘each Party has to prove its alleged title and the facts upon which it relies’.\nThe procedure regarding the production and assessment of evidence for a contentious case before the ICJ is prescribed by Articles 48 to 52 of the Statute of the Court and clarified in the Rules of the Court. In addition, Practice Directions for use by States, which had appeared before being adopted by the ICJ in 2001, have since been amended several times. While the Practice Directions are non-binding, they clarify procedure before the Court. It must be noted that the ICJ is not bound to the evidence and facts submitted by the parties and may also arbitrarily decide to collect and use evidence autonomously.\nThis chapter is comprised of four sections dealing, respectively, with State practice regarding evidence related to cyber operations (3.1), evidence in international law (3.2), documentary evidence (3.3) and expert opinion evidence (3.4).\n## 3.1 State Practice on Evidence Relating to Cyber Operations\nThe nascent State practice on responding to state-sponsored cyber operations seems to demonstrate that States are increasingly aware of the need to support their accusations with evidence proving the facts and the alleged paternity of the cyber operations concerned. This is particularly crucial regarding cyber conduct, as cyberspace offers numerous opportunities to hide or forge the real paternity of a cyber operation, notably by using proxy computer systems or botnets located in other countries. Some perpetrators have even inserted misleading hints into the computer code of a virus in an attempt to shift the blame onto a third party.

For many years, the USA did not officially respond to cyber operations targeting their interests, and thus did not disclose publicly any evidence proving the facts and possible attribution. The 2014 Sony Pictures Entertainment hack marked a watershed in US practice. The American subsidiary of the Japanese conglomerate Sony Corporation was hacked and a significant amount of data was stolen from the company. This data was then publicly released by the hackers in November 2014. The hackers demanded the cancellation of the planned release of the film *The Interview*, a comedy about the assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. US officials alleged that the attack was sponsored by North Korea. North Korea, however, denied any involvement. The United States indicated that it had evidence of the involvement of North Korea, and the White House announced that it would adopt a proportional response. In reaction to this cyber operation allegedly executed by North Korea, the United States adopted new sanctions against North Korea; additionally, it is considered having adopted an unofficial covert response in the form of unilateral extrajudicial measures. In this instance, the United States attributed the cyber operation to North Korea and responded to it, without disclosing the evidence.\nThe 2016 Democratic National Committee (DNC) hack marked an even bigger watershed in US practice as the United States decided, for the first time, to disclose evidence corroborating the attribution of a cyber operation to another State, the Russian Federation. On 22 July 2016, a few days before the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, Wikileaks published 19,252 emails and 8,034 attachments from the DNC, the governing body of the Democratic Party. The leak contained emails and documents from seven key DNC staff members suggesting that the DNC leadership had worked to advantage Hillary Clinton over Bernie\n David E Sanger and Nicole Perlroth, ‘U.S. Said to Find North Korea Ordered Cyberattack on Sony’, *The New York Times* (17 December 2014) www.nytimes.com/2014/12/18/world/asia/us-links-north-korea-to-sony-hacking.html.\n Dave Boyer, ‘White House Threatens “Proportional” Response to North Korea Cyberattacks on Sony Pictures’, *The Washington Times* (18 December 2014) www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/18/white-house-threatens-proportional-response-north-/\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTHE QUESTION OF EVIDENCE\nSanders. On 7 October 2016, a ‘Joint Statement from the Department of Homeland Security and Office of the Director of National Intelligence on Election Security’ was released, stating:\nThe U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations. The recent disclosures of alleged hacked e-mails on sites like DCLeaks.com and WikiLeaks and by the Guccifer 2.0 online persona are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process. Such activity is not new to Moscow – the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there. We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia’s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.^[10]^\nOn 10 October 2016, the White House announced that the president was considering a proportional response to the Russian cyber operations.^[11]^ Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, added that ‘[i]t is unlikely that our response would be announced in advance,’ and that ‘the president can choose response options that we never announce’.^[12]^ The US allegations were met with legitimate criticism as no evidence supporting allegations of Russian responsibility for the DNC hack was publicly released. As a consequence, on 29 December 2016, the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation released a ‘Joint Analysis Report’ exposing some of the evidence supporting their allegations of the involvement of Russian intelligence services FSB and GRU, as well as their modus operandi.^[13]^ This document supported the joint statement of October 2016, in which they expressed confidence that\n^[10]^ ‘Joint Statement’, para 1 (Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation 2016) www.dhs.gov/news/2016/10/07/joint-statement-department-homeland-security-and-office-director-national; see also Ellen Nakashima, ‘U.S. Government Officially Accuses Russia of Hacking Campaign to Interfere with Elections’, *Washington Post* (7 October 2016) www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-government-officially-accuses-russia-of-hacking-campaign-to-influence-elections/2016/10/07/4e0b9654-8cbf-11e6-875e-2c1bfe943b66_story.html.\n^[11]^ Julie Hirschfeld Davis and Gardiner Harris, ‘Obama Considers “Proportional” Response to Russian Hacking in U.S. Election’, *The New York Times* (11 October 2016) www.nytimes.com/2016/10/12/us/politics/obama-russia-hack-election.html.\n^[12]^ Jack Goldsmith, ‘Thoughts on White House Pledge to Respond to DNC Hack’ (Lawfare, 12 October 2016) www.lawfareblog.com/thoughts-white-house-pledge-respond-dnc-hack.\n^[13]^ United States, ‘Joint Analysis Report: GRIZZLY STEPPE – Russian Malicious Cyber Activity’ (Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation 2016)\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nEVIDENCE IN INTERNATIONAL LAW\n\n## 3.2 Evidence in International Law\nHistorically, States have used evidence to support their allegations even outside of a judicial proceeding. This has been the practice, for instance, of international fact-finding commissions, such as the ones established after the 2008 armed conflict in Georgia. The development of international justice has strengthened this practice and made the international community demand an increasingly higher standard of proof.\nStates increasingly rely on international fact-finding commissions following international incidents that may have led to inter-state disputes, and this development is reflected in various branches and aspects of international law. The crash of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 in Ukraine in 2014 offers an interesting case study regarding State practice on the establishment of fact-finding commissions as well as on the collection and assessment of evidence outside of judicial proceedings. This example is also symptomatic of the challenges posed by technical and scientific evidence.\nOn 17 July 2014, Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 departed from Amsterdam-Schiphol Airport towards its destination, Kuala Lumpur. However, the aircraft never reached its destination having crashed in eastern Ukraine, in the Donetsk region. At that time, this area was still the scene of an armed conflict between the combatants of the People's Republic of Donetsk and the Ukrainian army. There were no survivors among the 283 passengers and 15 crew members. The circumstances of the crash were unclear and conflicting narratives were proposed. Initially,\nwww.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/JAR_16-20296A_GRIZZLY%20STEPPE-2016-1229.pdf.\n Joseph C Witenberg, ‘La théorie des preuves devant les juridictions internationales’ (1936) 56 RCADI 1, 6–7.\n ‘Report of the International Fact-Finding Commission on the Conflict in Georgia’ (2009) www.ceiig.ch/Report.html.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTHE QUESTION OF EVIDENCE\nthe pro-Russian separatists and the Ukrainian army accused one another of having caused the crash by missile fire. The day after the disaster, members of the UN Security Council called for an ‘independent, comprehensive and credible international investigation’.\nA Joint Investigation Team (JIT), coordinated by the Dutch Safety Board (OVV – Onderzoeksraad Voor Veiligheid), was established. The work of the JIT was carried out in close collaboration with the observers of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and the emergency services of the People’s Republic of Donetsk. The team first recovered pieces of the wreckage as well as the black boxes of the aircraft from the separatists and repatriated them to the Netherlands for analysis. The OVV published its final report on 13 October 2015. The analysis of the black boxes, the reconstituted wreckage of the aircraft and other materials collected allowed the OVV to assert that the crash was caused by a surface missile – a 9M38 missile equipped with a 9N314M-type warhead installed on a BUK-type ground-air system – fired from a zone controlled by separatists, but where fighting with the Ukrainian army was underway. The conclusions of the OVV report were highly controversial. Almaz-Antey, the Russian manufacturer of the incriminated BUK missile system, carried out its own investigation, reconstructing in particular the effects of the explosion on a similar aircraft removed from traffic. From this study, it claimed that the missile had been fired from an area under the control of the Ukrainian army. Moreover, the Russian Federal Air Transport Agency (Rosaviatsiya) was also sceptical, and stated that it wanted to conduct its own investigation.

For example, Microsoft published a white paper in 2016 suggesting, among other things, that such a mechanism be created following the model of the investigation mechanism of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). They argue that the proposed mechanism would create a synergy between the expertise of States, private actors and academics in order to work together to identify the perpetrators of malicious cyber operations:\nThere could be a similar mechanism by which governments and the private sector can provide evidence to support technical attribution and obtain some level of validation through rigorous peer review. At its core, this organization would consist of technical experts from across governments, the private sector, academia, and civil society with the capability to examine tactics, techniques, and procedures used by nation-state attackers, as well as indicators of compromise that suggest a given attack was by\n ‘JIT: MH17 Shot Down with Missile Fired from Pro-Russian Rebel Controlled Field’ (NL Times, 28 September 2016) http://nltimes.nl/2016/09/28/jit-mh17-shot-missile-fired-pro-russian-rebel-controlled-field.\n Scott Charney et al, ‘From Articulation to Implementation: Enabling Progress on Cybersecurity Norms’ (Microsoft 2016) 10–12 www.microsoft.com/en-us/cybersecurity/content-hub/enabling-progress-on-cybersecurity-norms.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTHE QUESTION OF EVIDENCE\na nation-state. Its essential output would be a technical analysis of the attack and evidence of attribution. In some cases, based on agreed-upon criteria, it might publish its findings. Some will of course oppose this approach. Governments in particular may be reluctant to empower an independent organization to make findings that may be both politically important and politically charged.\nIn law, evidence ‘tends to prove the existence or nonexistence of some fact’. In the case of cyber operations, the facts are generally articulated around two main axes: the identification of the cyber operation and its consequences and the attribution of the cyber operation.\nAs pointed out by the UNGGE in its 2015 report, ‘In case of ICT incidents, States should consider all relevant information, including the larger context of the event, the challenges of attribution in the ICT environment and the nature and extent of the consequences.’ Indeed, the fact that an investigation relates to a cyber operation does not mean that evidence should be collected solely within cyberspace. Evidence gathered in the real world can also be relevant, even crucial, in determining the facts and attribution of a cyber operation.\nEvidence may consist of documentary evidence, physical evidence, expert or witness testimony, and hearsay evidence. This chapter focuses on the two main forms of evidence that may be relevant in the cyber context: documentary evidence and testimonial evidence from experts.\n## 3.3 Documentary Evidence\nThe term ‘documentary evidence’ refers to evidence in the form of written documents that support the alleged facts. It should be emphasised that documentary evidence is the main form of evidence presented before the ICJ. The Statute and Rules of the Court contain several provisions on the production of documents as documentary evidence\n ibid 11.\n Jonathan Law (ed), A Dictionary of Law (online version) (8th edn, OUP 2015), ‘Evidence’; see also Jean Salmon (ed), Dictionnaire de droit international public (Bruylant 2001) 874.\n UNGA, ‘Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security’ (22 July 2015) UN Doc A/70/174.\n Witenberg (n 14) 59.\n Loretta Malintoppi, ‘Fact Finding and Evidence before the International Court of Justice (Notably in Scientific-Related Disputes)’ (2016) 7 Journal of International Dispute Settlement 421, 422.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE\nwithout, however, defining the types of authorised documents, thus leaving the parties and judges an important margin of discretion.\nThe various texts relating to the procedure and the production of evidence in a proceeding before the ICJ do not contain any specific provision related to digital evidence, with the exception of Practice direction IXbis. This provision states that a document that can be considered ‘part of a publication readily available’ under Article 56 (4) of the Rules of Court ‘may be in any format (printed or electronic), form (physical or on-line, such as posted on the internet) or on any data medium (on paper, on digital or any other media)’. Practice direction IXbis demonstrates the Court’s openness to digital evidence, without giving further details.\n## 3.3.1 Typology of Documentary Evidence That May Be Collected in Relation to Cyber Operations\nThe majority of evidence that would be produced by a State regarding a cyber operation, both for the purpose of establishing the facts and for attribution, could be in a written form – i.e. documentary evidence – and would therefore not pose any particular procedural problem in proceedings before a court.\nHowever, an important clarification must be made at this stage. This remark concerns only the presentation of evidence and neither its collection and admissibility nor the capacity of judges to assess it. The latter will be analysed later in this chapter.\nDuring the event of a cyber operation, a number of traces are usually left and may be collected as evidence. Most of these traces can be presented in the form of written documents to constitute documentary evidence.\nIn the case of a computer virus, the computer code of the virus can be analysed and presented as evidence. Computer codes consisting of multiple lines of code can easily be considered as written evidence.\nAdditionally, IP addresses may be collected and presented in a cyber-related dispute. These IP addresses may be used to identify the different computers and servers involved in the cyber operation, either because these computers and servers were used for its launch or transit, or\n See, for instance, Marco Roscini, ‘Evidentiary Issues in International Disputes Related to State Responsibility for Cyber Operations’ (2015) 50 Texas International Law Journal 233.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTHE QUESTION OF EVIDENCE\nbecause they were the target of the cyber operation. The presentation of these IP addresses may be accompanied by the server logs, consisting of lists of activities performed by the relevant servers including the general time of connection of each IP address. These elements may be particularly useful in establishing the facts and timeline.\nThese different pieces of evidence are usually summarised in a report that places them in context in order to establish the facts. Moreover, this cyber-related evidence may be accompanied by non-digital evidence aimed, for instance, at establishing the damage suffered by the victim of the cyber operation, or the relationship between the computers involved and individuals and whether these individuals were acting on behalf of a State.\nThe purpose of the previous paragraphs was to demonstrate the forms in which digital evidence may be presented during proceedings before an international court or tribunal. The difficulty involved in the identification and collection of this type of evidence should not be underestimated. The process may entail a great deal of technical expertise. A further difficulty in the collection of cyber evidence involves proving the authenticity and integrity of the evidence. This is a task reserved for the experts who may take part in the judicial proceedings.\nTo date, no dispute between States relating to a cyber operation has given rise to a judicial proceeding. However, in several instances of cyber operations alleged to be either state sponsored or even state conducted, States and non-state actors, such as cybersecurity firms, have collected evidence and presented it in reports detailing these cyber operations and attributing them to groups or individuals. These various reports provide a basis for the analysis of what elements may be presented by a State in the context of a judicial proceeding on a state-sponsored cyber operation.\nIn 2013, the US cybersecurity firm Mandiant released a report detailing an investigation on computer security breaches allegedly sponsored by the Chinese government that occurred (between 2004 and 2013) at hundreds of organisations around the world. The investigation focused on cyber espionage activities considered to be the result of a single group referred to by the Mandiant teams as APT 1. The objective was to\n ibid 239.\n Mandiant Intelligence Center Report, ‘APT1: Exposing One of China’s Cyber Espionage Units’ (Mandiant 2013) 1 http://intelreport.mandiant.com/Mandiant_APT1_Report.pdf.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE\n\nAPT1 maintains an extensive infrastructure of computer systems around the world.\n- APT1 controls thousands of systems in support of their computer intrusion activities.\n- In the last two years we have observed APT1 establish a minimum of 937 Command and Control (C2) servers hosted on 849 distinct IP addresses in 13 countries. The majority of these 849 unique IP addresses were registered to organizations in China (709), followed by the U.S. (109).\n- In the last three years we have observed APT1 use fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) resolving to 988 unique IP addresses.\n- Over a two-year period (January 2011 to January 2013) we confirmed 1,905 instances of APT1 actors logging into their attack infrastructure from 832 different IP addresses with Remote Desktop, a tool that provides a remote user with an interactive graphical interface to a system.\n- In the last several years we have confirmed 2,551 FQDNs attributed to APT1.\nOnce the structure and activities of APT 1 were established, Mandiant focused on the question of attribution. Investigators determined that 97 per cent of APT 1's remote access used the 'Chinese (Simplified) – US Keyboard' setting. In addition, 98 per cent of the IP addresses connecting remotely to the computer systems controlled by APT 1 were Chinese and almost all the IP addresses used to communicate with the target computer systems were Chinese and located in the Shanghai area. In addition, investigators were able to identify the computer traces left by three individuals considered to be members of APT 1. The elements used to identify these individuals included multiple IP addresses, email addresses, URLs and their respective modus operandi. Using this digital evidence, as well as non-digital evidence related to the functioning of the Chinese army and the identified location, Mandiant concluded that APT\n ibid 4.\n ibid 51–58.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTHE QUESTION OF EVIDENCE\n\n## 3.3.2 The Necessary Caution in the Collection and Assessment of Evidence\nAs with any evidence, one must proceed cautiously with the collection and analysis of digital evidence. It is essential to involve experts who can not only analyse the data but also explain their conclusions to non-specialists of computer science, such as to the parties and judges involved in a judicial proceeding. This issue will be developed in the section dedicated to experts.\nThe malware Stuxnet, identified in 2010, which physically damaged several centrifuges of an Iranian nuclear plant, and its subsequent investigation, serve as an interesting example. This malware is alleged to have been a joint cyber operation involving the United States and Israel, the purpose of which was to derail the Iranian nuclear programme and force the country to abandon the military dimension of its nuclear ambition. However, neither Iran nor any other State has officially attributed this cyber operation to the United States, Israel or any other State, and no State has claimed paternity for this malware. Stuxnet was first identified in June 2010 by a Belarusian cybersecurity company, VirusBlokAda, and was subsequently analysed by experts from various cybersecurity companies, including Kaspersky and Symantec. The latter published a report detailing the functioning of Stuxnet. An important part of this report dug into and analysed the computer code of Stuxnet, and identified two elements that may hint at a potential link between Israel and the malware.\nFirstly, they identified the project path ‘b:\\myrtus\\src\\objfre_w2k_x86\\i386\\guava.pdb’ in the driver file. The name of the folder is ‘myrtus’ and one of the files is ‘guava’, guava being a tropical tree of the myrtaceae family – that is to say of the myrtle family. The report further notes that:\n ibid 59–60.\n On Stuxnet see, generally, Kim Zetter, Countdown to Zero Day: Stuxnet and the Launch of the World’s First Digital Weapon (Crown 2014); see also David E Sanger, Confront and Conceal: Obama’s Secret Wars and Surprising Use of American Power (Crown 2012).\n Nicolas Falliere, Liam O Murchu and Eric Chien, ‘W32.Stuxnet Dossier (Version 1.4)’ (Symantec 2011) www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/w32_stuxnet_dossier.pdf.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE\n\nIn other words, the names ‘myrtus’ and ‘guava’ could hypothetically refer to Queen Esther of the Old Testament, and thus could be understood as a reference to the situation of the Jewish people in Persia, the State that preceded the Islamic Republic of Iran.\nSecondly, Stuxnet established a registry key value of 19790509, which would allow Stuxnet’s future intrusion attempts to identify whether the targeted computer was already infected:\n[i]f this value is equal to 19790509 the threat will exit. This is thought to be an infection marker or a ‘do not infect’ marker. If this is set correctly infection will not occur. The value may be a random string and represent nothing, but also appears to match the format of date markers used in the threat. As a date, the value may be May 9, 1979. This date could be an arbitrary date, a birth date, or some other significant date. While on May 9, 1979 a variety of historical events occurred, according to Wikipedia ‘Habib Elghanian was executed by a firing squad in Tehran sending shock waves through the closely knit Iranian Jewish community. He was the first Jew and one of the first civilians to be executed by the new Islamic government. This prompted the mass exodus of the once 100,000 member strong Jewish community of Iran which continues to this day.’ Symantec cautions readers on drawing any attribution conclusions. Attackers would have the natural desire to implicate another party.\nIn summary, these two elements found in the lines of the Stuxnet computer code could be references to historical events involving Iran and its Jewish population, and have therefore been analysed by some as implicating Israel in the creation of Stuxnet. These clues and their analysis should nevertheless be treated with caution. While they may point to the responsible party, they may also have been put there deliberately by the creators of the code to lead investigators into wrongly implicating Israel. Thus, this type of evidence should not be considered as clear proof of Israeli responsibility, but merely a nudge in that direction.\n ibid 24.\n ibid 18.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTHE QUESTION OF EVIDENCE\nThe example of Stuxnet demonstrates the importance of involving competent experts in the search for and analysis of technical evidence. It also shows how important it is to approach technical evidence critically. Cyber operations are indeed a highly technical phenomenon, but this does not mean that their analysis and attribution should be limited to a technical approach. On the contrary, it is essential that, alongside technical experts, experts from other disciplines are also involved in an investigation.\n## 3.3.3 The Validity of Unlawfully Collected Evidence\nCyberspace is characterised by the interconnection of computer networks, making it possible to remotely access various connected networks and computer systems. This feature makes access to digital evidence easier on a technical level. It also facilitates the task of the perpetrator of a cyber operation wishing to erase or blur their tracks. It is indeed relatively easy for them to access the clues they may have left and to move, manipulate or destroy them. It is therefore essential for the victim of a cyber operation wishing to seize and secure potential evidence to act as quickly and thoroughly as possible before the perpetrator erases their tracks. For this reason, investigators must act with a certain discretion so as not to accelerate the perpetrator's attempts to modify and remove the evidence they may have left behind.\nOne of the main features of cyberspace that affects the seizure of technical evidence in criminal, terrorist and inter-state cases is the transnational dimension of cyberspace. Indeed, a cyber operation conducted or sponsored by one State against another will probably transit through computer systems and networks located in third-party States. The procedure for the collection of technical evidence by the victim State from computer systems and networks located within its territory is governed by that State's domestic law. Conversely, the collection of evidence from computer systems and networks located abroad (and outside of the victim State's jurisdiction) may be deemed unlawful, and\n Christiane Féral-Schuhl, *Cyberdroit 2011/2012. Le droit à l'épreuve de l'internet* (6th edn, Dalloz 2010) 992.\n Jonathan Bourguignon, 'La recherche de la preuve informatique et l'exercice des compétences extraterritoriales de l'Etat' in Société Française pour le Droit International, *Internet et le droit international* (Colloque de Rouen, Pedone 2014) 357–372.\n Féral-Schuhl (n 38) 992 et seq.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE\n\nA State’s seizure of evidence from computer systems and networks located within the jurisdiction of another State and in the absence of the said State’s consent would most likely constitute an internationally wrongful act. More specifically, it would probably constitute a violation of the latter State’s territorial sovereignty. The wrongfulness of the seizure may nevertheless be mitigated or even precluded when the responsible State can prove that the seizure occurred in the context of a circumstance precluding wrongfulness. For instance, a victim State that seizes evidence from the network of the State responsible for a cyber operation may claim that their seizure of evidence (in violation of the latter State’s jurisdiction) constitutes a countermeasure. However, this may prove a difficult line of defence. The victim State may claim that it was necessary to seize evidence before the responsible State had a chance to remove or tamper with it. The responsible State has a prime opportunity to do so if the victim State requests its cooperation or if the responsible State is aware of the seizure operation. Necessity may be invoked to preclude the wrongfulness of an act performed by a State to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril. It appears thus fragile ground to justify a cyber operation aimed at seizing evidence in the computer systems of another State. The fragility of these two potential justifications for such acts imposes to therefore analyse the admissibility and validity of evidence collected unlawfully.\nWould evidence that is illegally obtained be considered legitimate before a court? More specifically, would illegally obtained evidence be admissible in contentious proceedings before the ICJ? There is no answer to this question in the Statute and Rules of the Court. However, in the Corfu Channel case the judges accepted evidence that was unlawfully acquired by the United Kingdom. It must be pointed out, however, that the judges did not rule on the validity of the evidence. In this case, the United Kingdom justified the illegal seizure of the evidence as follows:\nAccording to that [United Kingdom] Government, the corpora delicti must be secured as quickly as possible, for fear they should be taken away, without leaving traces, by the authors of the minelaying or by the Albanian authorities. This justification took two distinct forms in the United Kingdom Government’s arguments. It was presented first as a\n Corfu Channel (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v. Albania) (Judgment on the Merits) [1949] ICJ Reports 4, 34.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTHE QUESTION OF EVIDENCE\nnew and special application of the theory of intervention, by means of which the State intervening would secure possession of evidence in the territory of another State, in order to submit it to an international tribunal and thus facilitate its task.\nThe United Kingdom Agent, in his speech in reply, has further classified ‘Operation Retail’ among methods of self-protection or self-help.\nThe Court rejected these two justifications and considered the conduct of the United Kingdom to be unlawful. However, the Court still accepted and considered the illegally obtained evidence. It is interesting to note that the line of defence used by the British government approximates to the one that could be used by a State for the illegal seizure of computer evidence, as discussed above. It is likely that the Court’s position will remain unchanged in a case involving a similar seizure of evidence, and that therefore the wrongfulness of those actions would not be precluded.\nThis point is very important because a significant amount of evidence, digital or otherwise, provided by States regarding a cyber operation, could be acquired illegally. With respect to digital evidence, it has already been shown that collection from servers under the jurisdiction of other States (without their consent) may constitute an internationally wrongful act. States could also present evidence collected more or less lawfully by their intelligence services. If espionage is not unlawful under international law, it may give rise to conduct violating certain norms of international law, in particular the territorial sovereignty of the targeted State or the principle of non-intervention.\nThe hack of Sony Pictures Entertainment in 2014 is a good illustration. As seen earlier, the United States attributed this cyber operation to North Korea without publicly presenting evidence supporting their accusation. This lack of evidence could be explained by the fact that the United States was able to identify North Korea as responsible for the cyber operation through the surveillance of North Korean networks by the National Security Agency (NSA). In other words, the attribution was made possible not by technical evidence collected after the cyber operation, but rather by collecting information on North Korean activities conducted prior to the cyber operation concerned.

In this sense, neither the Statute nor the Rules of Court clarify who may be called as an expert in a case before the ICJ. A definition can be found in the Agreement between the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea and the Federal Republic of Germany regarding the Headquarters of the Tribunal, which states that an ‘expert’ is ‘a person called at the instance of a party to a dispute or at the instance of the Tribunal to present testimony in the form of expert opinions, based on special knowledge, skills, experience or training’ (Article 1(l)).\nIn a dispute related to a cyber operation, it is essential to involve experts for two main reasons. Firstly, it is possible that neither the judges nor counsel have the requisite knowledge to understand the technical details of the dispute. Secondly, it is essential that the computer evidence provided by the parties be analysed by qualified experts who can attest to its authenticity and provide the relevant analysis.\nIn a case before the ICJ, experts can be involved in four different ways: they may be appointed by the parties; the judges may consult them in an informal manner; or decide to involve them in the proceedings; and finally, it is possible for the judges to appoint assessors who sit in on the proceedings but do not have the right to vote.\n## 3.4.1 Experts Appointed by the Parties\nMost of the computer-based evidence that may be collected and presented in relation to a cyber operation should be collected and analysed by experts to ensure that it is authentic and to establish the facts in the\n Giorgio Gaja, ‘Assessing Expert Evidence in the ICJ’ (2017) 15 The Law &amp; Practice of International Courts and Tribunals 409, *passim*; Malintoppi (n 27) 430–434.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTHE QUESTION OF EVIDENCE\nmost accurate manner. Consequently, States wishing to collect such evidence will have recourse to experts generally available within the State's computer-security services or through the contracting of private cybersecurity companies. For example, the Democratic Party decided to use the private company CrowdStrike to analyse the hack that it suffered in 2016, and it was on the basis of the evidence gathered by that company that US authorities attributed the cyber operation to Russian intelligence services.\nBeyond the investigation, and the process of gathering and analysing evidence, it is essential that experts are involved in the presentation of evidence, especially in the event of a judicial proceeding. Indeed, their participation and their explanations render such evidence intelligible to people who are not familiar with computer science. Their participation in judicial proceedings also permits an adversarial dialogue between the experts of the two parties.\n## 3.4.2 'Invisible' Experts Consulted by the Court\nThe ICJ, like other international jurisdictions, has to deal with disputes involving an important technical dimension requiring some specific expertise. This is especially the case for border disputes. The subject has been analysed by Robert Yewdall Jennings, who notes that:\nthe Court has not infrequently employed cartographers, hydrographers, geographers, linguists, and even specialised legal experts to assist in the understanding of the issue in a case before it; and has not on the whole felt any need to make this public knowledge or even to apprise the parties.^[46]^\nIn some cases involving a strong technical dimension, the judges of the ICJ have consulted informal experts to assist them, but these experts were not officially involved in the proceedings. Generally, such experts act as temporary members of the Registry of the Court and their findings are not communicated to the parties or made public.^[47]^\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nEXPERT OPINION EVIDENCE\n\nWhile such consultation of ‘invisible’ experts may be pardonable if the input they provide relates to the scientific margins of a case, the situation is quite different in complex scientific disputes, as is the case here. Under circumstances such as in the present case, adopting such a practice would deprive the Court of the above-mentioned advantages of transparency, openness, procedural fairness, and the ability for the Parties to comment upon or otherwise assist the Court in understanding the evidence before it. These are concerns based not purely on abstract principle, but on the good administration of justice.\nA distinction should be drawn between situations in which invisible experts are consulted on technical issues relevant – but not decisive – to the case, and situations in which they may critically influence the outcome of the case. However, this distinction has not yet been made.\nThe distinction proposed above would be particularly relevant in a dispute relating to a cyber operation. Judges may have recourse to invisible experts to assist them in their understanding of the functioning of the Internet and relevant computer systems, specifically to help them in developing a general knowledge of the subject matter of the dispute. Conversely, it would be desirable for matters related to the evidence provided by the parties, as well as technical problems specifically related to the case, to be dealt with by experts appointed by the Court and taking part in the proceedings. In such cases, as developed below, expert opinions are communicated to the parties who can then comment on them. This would be particularly relevant and important for disputes regarding cyber operations, as the proceedings may involve a large amount of technical evidence, the assessment of which by experts may be crucial.\n The expression ‘experts fantômes’ is borrowed from Judges Awn Shawkat Al-Khasawneh and Bruno Simma: Joint Dissenting Opinion, Judges Al-Khasawneh and Simma in *Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay* (Argentina v. Uruguay) (Judgment) [2010] ICJ Reports 14, 114.\n Lucas Carlos Lima, ‘Expert Advisor or Non-voting Adjudicator?

Article 67 of the Rules of Court clarifies the position regarding the appointment of experts by judges:\n1. If the Court considers it necessary to arrange for an enquiry or an expert opinion, it shall, after hearing the parties, issue an order to this effect, defining the subject of the enquiry or expert opinion, stating the number and mode of appointment of the persons to hold the enquiry or of the experts, and laying down the procedure to be followed. Where appropriate, the Court shall require persons appointed to carry out an enquiry, or to give an expert opinion, to make a solemn declaration.\n2. Every report or record of an enquiry and every expert opinion shall be communicated to the parties, which shall be given the opportunity of commenting upon it.\nThus, unlike invisible experts, these experts are officially appointed by the Court and their findings are made public, thereby permitting the parties to submit observations.\nThe Court has appointed experts in a very limited number of cases,^[53]^ as Lucas Carlos Lima points out:\nExperts ex curia were appointed by the ICJ in only three cases. In the Corfu Channel (United Kingdom v. Albania) case, the Court nominated three naval experts, who conducted a site visit and subsequently presented a report which the parties had the opportunity to comment upon. In the case of the Delimitation of the Maritime Boundary in the Gulf of Maine Area (Canada/United States of America), the Chamber of the Court appointed a naval expert to assist in the delimitation of the boundary between the two countries and his technical report was attached to the judgment. In the Maritime Delimitation in the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua), the Court appointed two experts\n^[52]^ This is also possible before other international courts and tribunals: Louis Savadogo, 'Le recours des juridictions internationales à des experts' (2004) 50 Annuaire français de droit international 231, 233.\n^[53]^ Devaney (n 49) 20–23.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nEXPERT OPINION EVIDENCE\n\nA number of scholars and ICJ judges have expressed their support for the use of Court-appointed experts, particularly in the context of litigation involving a critical technical dimension.\nThe use of Court-appointed experts, to analyse technical arguments presented by the parties to a dispute relating to a cyber operation, would have the advantage of providing the judges with an objective analysis of the evidence and allow them to concentrate on the legal issues.\n## 3.4.4 Assessors Appointed by the Court\nICJ judges may appoint assessors, who may sit with the Court but do not have the right to vote. This possibility is opened by Article 30(2) of the Statute of the Court, according to which ‘[t]he Rules of the Court may provide for assessors to sit with the Court or with any of its chambers, without the right to vote’. This provision is clarified by Article 9 of the Rules of Court, which provides that this possibility is available in contentious and advisory cases and that these assessors ‘shall be appointed by secret ballot and by a majority of the votes of the judges composing the Court for the case’. Neither the Statute nor the Rules of the Court specify whether the State Parties are to be involved in the procedure for appointing assessors.\nAs Giorgio Gaja points out, no assessor has ever been appointed in a case before the ICJ. He argues that there are two reasons for this: firstly, even if they do not have the right to vote, the assessors could be seen as wielding too much influence over the decision of the judges; secondly, the parties and their experts would not be informed and thus they would not be able to comment on the opinions expressed by the assessors.\nIn most disputes regarding cyber operations, which may be brought before the ICJ, the technical expertise provided by the experts appointed by the parties or by the Court would probably be sufficient, and it would\n Lima (n 49) 1131.

Such disputes may involve a significant amount of highly technical evidence, the collection and assessment of which by the parties and by the judges, in the case of judicial proceedings, may be challenging. Conversely, the presentation of technical evidence relating to cyber operations is not particularly challenging, as most of it may be easily presented as documentary evidence.\nStates could, however, be reluctant to make such evidence public during judicial proceedings. Firstly, from the point of view of the State, by revealing the collected evidence, it is likely to give indications about its computing capabilities. Secondly, by publicly disclosing information about a cyber operation, there is a risk that the vulnerabilities exploited by this cyber operation would be taken advantage of by other actors to perpetrate cyber operations. This has been demonstrated by WannaCry$^{57}$ and the wave of cyber operations that affected a large number of people, institutions and businesses in May 2017.$^{58}$ EternalBlue, the vulnerability exploited by some cyber operations and revealed in the summer of 2016, was obtained from the NSA through a hack by the Shadow Brokers.$^{59}$ Microsoft had released a fix for this vulnerability,$^{60}$ but it seems that\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nThe establishment of the facts and the attribution of a cyber operation carry an important technical dimension, but it would be a mistake to reduce them merely to technical processes. It is therefore essential that, alongside the technical experts, experts from other disciplines with a good understanding of the functioning of cyberspace and cyber operations are involved in these processes, and potentially involved in judicial proceedings. Indeed, these experts would help to bridge the technical and legal dimensions of the dispute. This is also the aim of the present chapter, which bridges the technical dimension of attribution analysed in the previous chapter and the legal dimension of attribution studied in the next.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press"

This leads to the question of how such evidence may be used and considered admissible in a judicial proceeding, or more generally in an international dispute, related to a cyber operation.\nThe development of State activities in cyberspace, notably offensive cyber operations, has led to international disputes between States. To date, a State has neither disputed a cyber operation before an international court or tribunal nor raised the issue before the UN Security Council. Generally, victim States have chosen to respond through extra-juridical measures, such as cyber countermeasures or measures of retorsion.¹ However, there is the possibility that a State, in future, may bring a charge of harmful cyber operations before an international court or tribunal or before the UN Security Council.\nDifferent procedures for the collection, presentation and assessment of evidence exist depending on the international court or tribunal selected and the circumstances of the case.² The assertion presented hereunder is that the International Court of Justice (ICJ) would be the most suitable judicial organ to deal with an international dispute arising from cyber operations conducted by one State against another. Thus, this chapter considers the procedures for the collection and assessment of evidence that may be applied in the event of a case before the ICJ. Before the ICJ, all parties are equal and thus have equal rights to submit and present their legal case. Moreover, each party bears the burden of proof regarding\n¹ See infra Chapter 10.\n² Rüdiger Wolfrum and Mirka Möldner, ‘International Courts and Tribunals, Evidence’, Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law (MPEPIL), https://opil.ouplaw.com/view/10.1093/law:epil/9780199231690/law-9780199231690-e26 (OUP 2013).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTHE QUESTION OF EVIDENCE\ntheir case in accordance with the Statute and Rules of the Court.³ In the Minquiers and Ecrehos case, the ICJ specified that ‘each Party has to prove its alleged title and the facts upon which it relies’.⁴\nThe procedure regarding the production and assessment of evidence for a contentious case before the ICJ is prescribed by Articles 48 to 52 of the Statute of the Court⁵ and clarified in the Rules of the Court.⁶ In addition, Practice Directions for use by States, which had appeared before being adopted by the ICJ in 2001, have since been amended several times. While the Practice Directions are non-binding, they clarify procedure before the Court. It must be noted that the ICJ is not bound to the evidence and facts submitted by the parties and may also arbitrarily decide to collect and use evidence autonomously.⁷\nThis chapter is comprised of four sections dealing, respectively, with State practice regarding evidence related to cyber operations (3.1), evidence in international law (3.2), documentary evidence (3.3) and expert opinion evidence (3.4).\n## 3.1 State Practice on Evidence Relating to Cyber Operations\nThe nascent State practice on responding to state-sponsored cyber operations seems to demonstrate that States are increasingly aware of the need to support their accusations with evidence proving the facts and the alleged paternity of the cyber operations concerned. This is particularly crucial regarding cyber conduct, as cyberspace offers numerous opportunities to hide or forge the real paternity of a cyber operation, notably by using proxy computer systems or botnets located in other countries. Some perpetrators have even inserted misleading hints into the computer code of a virus in an attempt to shift the blame onto a third party. This behaviour, as well as the possible misinterpretation of available evidence,\n³ Robert Kolb, *La Cour internationale de Justice* (A Pedone 2014) 956–958.\n⁴ *Minquiers and Ecrehos* (France v.

For many years, the USA did not officially respond to cyber operations targeting their interests, and thus did not disclose publicly any evidence proving the facts and possible attribution. The 2014 Sony Pictures Entertainment hack marked a watershed in US practice. The American subsidiary of the Japanese conglomerate Sony Corporation was hacked and a significant amount of data was stolen from the company. This data was then publicly released by the hackers in November 2014. The hackers demanded the cancellation of the planned release of the film *The Interview*, a comedy about the assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. US officials alleged that the attack was sponsored by North Korea.⁸ North Korea, however, denied any involvement. The United States indicated that it had evidence of the involvement of North Korea, and the White House announced that it would adopt a proportional response.⁹ In reaction to this cyber operation allegedly executed by North Korea, the United States adopted new sanctions against North Korea; additionally, it is considered having adopted an unofficial covert response in the form of unilateral extrajudicial measures. In this instance, the United States attributed the cyber operation to North Korea and responded to it, without disclosing the evidence.\nThe 2016 Democratic National Committee (DNC) hack marked an even bigger watershed in US practice as the United States decided, for the first time, to disclose evidence corroborating the attribution of a cyber operation to another State, the Russian Federation. On 22 July 2016, a few days before the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, Wikileaks published 19,252 emails and 8,034 attachments from the DNC, the governing body of the Democratic Party. The leak contained emails and documents from seven key DNC staff members suggesting that the DNC leadership had worked to advantage Hillary Clinton over Bernie\n⁸ David E Sanger and Nicole Perlroth, ‘U.S. Said to Find North Korea Ordered Cyberattack on Sony’, *The New York Times* (17 December 2014) www.nytimes.com/2014/12/18/world/asia/us-links-north-korea-to-sony-hacking.html.\n⁹ Dave Boyer, ‘White House Threatens “Proportional” Response to North Korea Cyberattacks on Sony Pictures’, *The Washington Times* (18 December 2014) www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/18/white-house-threatens-proportional-response-north-/\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTHE QUESTION OF EVIDENCE\nSanders. On 7 October 2016, a ‘Joint Statement from the Department of Homeland Security and Office of the Director of National Intelligence on Election Security’ was released, stating:\nThe U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations. The recent disclosures of alleged hacked e-mails on sites like DCLeaks.com and WikiLeaks and by the Guccifer 2.0 online persona are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process. Such activity is not new to Moscow – the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there. We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia’s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.^^\nOn 10 October 2016, the White House announced that the president was considering a proportional response to the Russian cyber operations.^^ Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, added that ‘[i]t is unlikely that our response would be announced in advance,’ and that ‘the president can choose response options that we never announce’.^^ The US allegations were met with legitimate criticism as no evidence supporting allegations of Russian responsibility for the DNC hack was publicly released. As a consequence, on 29 December 2016, the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation released a ‘Joint Analysis Report’ exposing some of the evidence supporting their allegations of the involvement of Russian intelligence services FSB and GRU, as well as their modus operandi.^^ This document supported the joint statement of October 2016, in which they expressed confidence that\n^^ ‘Joint Statement’, para 1 (Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation 2016) www.dhs.gov/news/2016/10/07/joint-statement-department-homeland-security-and-office-director-national; see also Ellen Nakashima, ‘U.S. Government Officially Accuses Russia of Hacking Campaign to Interfere with Elections’, *Washington Post* (7 October 2016) www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-government-officially-accuses-russia-of-hacking-campaign-to-influence-elections/2016/10/07/4e0b9654-8cbf-11e6-875e-2c1bfe943b66_story.html.\n^^ Julie Hirschfeld Davis and Gardiner Harris, ‘Obama Considers “Proportional” Response to Russian Hacking in U.S. Election’, *The New York Times* (11 October 2016) www.nytimes.com/2016/10/12/us/politics/obama-russia-hack-election.html.\n^^ Jack Goldsmith, ‘Thoughts on White House Pledge to Respond to DNC Hack’ (Lawfare, 12 October 2016) www.lawfareblog.com/thoughts-white-house-pledge-respond-dnc-hack.\n^^ United States, ‘Joint Analysis Report: GRIZZLY STEPPE – Russian Malicious Cyber Activity’ (Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation 2016)\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nEVIDENCE IN INTERNATIONAL LAW\n91\nthere was Russian involvement in the DNC hack. While this may be only an isolated case, it may also signal an evolution in the US approach: the collection and publication of evidence to support the attribution of cyber operations even outside of the context of a dispute settlement mechanism or judicial proceeding. For this reason, it is more important than ever to study the standards of evidence in international law and how they may be applied to cyber operations.\n## 3.2 Evidence in International Law\nHistorically, States have used evidence to support their allegations even outside of a judicial proceeding.¹⁴ This has been the practice, for instance, of international fact-finding commissions, such as the ones established after the 2008 armed conflict in Georgia.¹⁵ The development of international justice has strengthened this practice and made the international community demand an increasingly higher standard of proof.\nStates increasingly rely on international fact-finding commissions following international incidents that may have led to inter-state disputes, and this development is reflected in various branches and aspects of international law. The crash of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 in Ukraine in 2014 offers an interesting case study regarding State practice on the establishment of fact-finding commissions as well as on the collection and assessment of evidence outside of judicial proceedings. This example is also symptomatic of the challenges posed by technical and scientific evidence.\nOn 17 July 2014, Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 departed from Amsterdam-Schiphol Airport towards its destination, Kuala Lumpur. However, the aircraft never reached its destination having crashed in eastern Ukraine, in the Donetsk region. At that time, this area was still the scene of an armed conflict between the combatants of the People's Republic of Donetsk and the Ukrainian army. There were no survivors among the 283 passengers and 15 crew members. The circumstances of the crash were unclear and conflicting narratives were proposed. Initially,\nwww.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/JAR_16-20296A_GRIZZLY%20STEPPE-2016-1229.pdf.\n¹⁴ Joseph C Witenberg, ‘La théorie des preuves devant les juridictions internationales’ (1936) 56 RCADI 1, 6–7.\n¹⁵ ‘Report of the International Fact-Finding Commission on the Conflict in Georgia’ (2009) www.ceiig.ch/Report.html.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTHE QUESTION OF EVIDENCE\nthe pro-Russian separatists and the Ukrainian army accused one another of having caused the crash by missile fire.¹⁶ The day after the disaster, members of the UN Security Council called for an ‘independent, comprehensive and credible international investigation’.¹⁷\nA Joint Investigation Team (JIT), coordinated by the Dutch Safety Board (OVV – Onderzoeksraad Voor Veiligheid), was established. The work of the JIT was carried out in close collaboration with the observers of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and the emergency services of the People’s Republic of Donetsk. The team first recovered pieces of the wreckage as well as the black boxes of the aircraft from the separatists and repatriated them to the Netherlands for analysis.¹⁸ The OVV published its final report on 13 October 2015.¹⁹ The analysis of the black boxes, the reconstituted wreckage of the aircraft and other materials collected allowed the OVV to assert that the crash was caused by a surface missile – a 9M38 missile equipped with a 9N314M-type warhead installed on a BUK-type ground-air system – fired from a zone controlled by separatists, but where fighting with the Ukrainian army was underway. The conclusions of the OVV report were highly controversial. Almaz-Antey, the Russian manufacturer of the incriminated BUK missile system, carried out its own investigation, reconstructing in particular the effects of the explosion on a similar aircraft removed from traffic. From this study, it claimed that the missile had been fired from an area under the control of the Ukrainian army.²⁰ Moreover, the Russian Federal Air Transport Agency (Rosaviatsiya) was also sceptical, and stated that it wanted to conduct its own investigation.

Subsequently, the JIT issued a call for witnesses to obtain information on the presence and location of the BUK missile system in the area, which led to the collection of testimony from a large number of individuals. In addition, the JIT listened to telephone tappings of conversations about the missile system. The European Space Agency (ESA) provided satellite imagery and experts to facilitate the work of the investigators. The various testimonies, telephone tappings and satellite images enabled the JIT to conclude that the BUK missile system in question had been brought in from Russian territory and removed on the same day as the disaster. The evidence also allowed the JIT to identify with precision the location from which the missile was fired: an area indeed controlled by the separatists.²¹ The various strands of evidence collected by the JIT helped it to establish the circumstances surrounding the crash of flight MH17. However, the evidence could only do so much; it did not establish the identity of the individuals responsible for the missile firing, nor did it establish whether a State was complicit.\nIt is worth noting that some recommend the creation of a centralised mechanism for the attribution of cyber operations, the functioning of which would be similar to that of an international fact-finding investigation. For example, Microsoft published a white paper in 2016 suggesting, among other things, that such a mechanism be created following the model of the investigation mechanism of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).²² They argue that the proposed mechanism would create a synergy between the expertise of States, private actors and academics in order to work together to identify the perpetrators of malicious cyber operations:\nThere could be a similar mechanism by which governments and the private sector can provide evidence to support technical attribution and obtain some level of validation through rigorous peer review. At its core, this organization would consist of technical experts from across governments, the private sector, academia, and civil society with the capability to examine tactics, techniques, and procedures used by nation-state attackers, as well as indicators of compromise that suggest a given attack was by\n²¹ ‘JIT: MH17 Shot Down with Missile Fired from Pro-Russian Rebel Controlled Field’ (NL Times, 28 September 2016) http://nltimes.nl/2016/09/28/jit-mh17-shot-missile-fired-pro-russian-rebel-controlled-field.\n²² Scott Charney et al, ‘From Articulation to Implementation: Enabling Progress on Cybersecurity Norms’ (Microsoft 2016) 10–12 www.microsoft.com/en-us/cybersecurity/content-hub/enabling-progress-on-cybersecurity-norms.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTHE QUESTION OF EVIDENCE\na nation-state. Its essential output would be a technical analysis of the attack and evidence of attribution. In some cases, based on agreed-upon criteria, it might publish its findings. Some will of course oppose this approach. Governments in particular may be reluctant to empower an independent organization to make findings that may be both politically important and politically charged.²³\nIn law, evidence ‘tends to prove the existence or nonexistence of some fact’.²⁴ In the case of cyber operations, the facts are generally articulated around two main axes: the identification of the cyber operation and its consequences and the attribution of the cyber operation.\nAs pointed out by the UNGGE in its 2015 report, ‘In case of ICT incidents, States should consider all relevant information, including the larger context of the event, the challenges of attribution in the ICT environment and the nature and extent of the consequences.’²⁵ Indeed, the fact that an investigation relates to a cyber operation does not mean that evidence should be collected solely within cyberspace. Evidence gathered in the real world can also be relevant, even crucial, in determining the facts and attribution of a cyber operation.\nEvidence may consist of documentary evidence, physical evidence, expert or witness testimony, and hearsay evidence. This chapter focuses on the two main forms of evidence that may be relevant in the cyber context: documentary evidence and testimonial evidence from experts.\n## 3.3 Documentary Evidence\nThe term ‘documentary evidence’ refers to evidence in the form of written documents that support the alleged facts.²⁶ It should be emphasised that documentary evidence is the main form of evidence presented before the ICJ.²⁷ The Statute and Rules of the Court contain several provisions on the production of documents as documentary evidence\n²³ ibid 11.\n²⁴ Jonathan Law (ed), A Dictionary of Law (online version) (8th edn, OUP 2015), ‘Evidence’; see also Jean Salmon (ed), Dictionnaire de droit international public (Bruylant 2001) 874.\n²⁵ UNGA, ‘Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security’ (22 July 2015) UN Doc A/70/174.\n²⁶ Witenberg (n 14) 59.\n²⁷ Loretta Malintoppi, ‘Fact Finding and Evidence before the International Court of Justice (Notably in Scientific-Related Disputes)’ (2016) 7 Journal of International Dispute Settlement 421, 422.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE\nwithout, however, defining the types of authorised documents, thus leaving the parties and judges an important margin of discretion.\nThe various texts relating to the procedure and the production of evidence in a proceeding before the ICJ do not contain any specific provision related to digital evidence, with the exception of Practice direction IXbis. This provision states that a document that can be considered ‘part of a publication readily available’ under Article 56 (4) of the Rules of Court ‘may be in any format (printed or electronic), form (physical or on-line, such as posted on the internet) or on any data medium (on paper, on digital or any other media)’. Practice direction IXbis demonstrates the Court’s openness to digital evidence, without giving further details.\n## 3.3.1 Typology of Documentary Evidence That May Be Collected in Relation to Cyber Operations\nThe majority of evidence that would be produced by a State regarding a cyber operation, both for the purpose of establishing the facts and for attribution, could be in a written form – i.e. documentary evidence – and would therefore not pose any particular procedural problem in proceedings before a court.\nHowever, an important clarification must be made at this stage. This remark concerns only the presentation of evidence and neither its collection and admissibility nor the capacity of judges to assess it. The latter will be analysed later in this chapter.\nDuring the event of a cyber operation, a number of traces are usually left and may be collected as evidence. Most of these traces can be presented in the form of written documents to constitute documentary evidence.²⁸\nIn the case of a computer virus, the computer code of the virus can be analysed and presented as evidence. Computer codes consisting of multiple lines of code can easily be considered as written evidence.\nAdditionally, IP addresses may be collected and presented in a cyber-related dispute. These IP addresses may be used to identify the different computers and servers involved in the cyber operation, either because these computers and servers were used for its launch or transit, or\n²⁸ See, for instance, Marco Roscini, ‘Evidentiary Issues in International Disputes Related to State Responsibility for Cyber Operations’ (2015) 50 Texas International Law Journal 233.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTHE QUESTION OF EVIDENCE\nbecause they were the target of the cyber operation. The presentation of these IP addresses may be accompanied by the server logs, consisting of lists of activities performed by the relevant servers including the general time of connection of each IP address. These elements may be particularly useful in establishing the facts and timeline.\nThese different pieces of evidence are usually summarised in a report that places them in context in order to establish the facts. Moreover, this cyber-related evidence may be accompanied by non-digital evidence aimed, for instance, at establishing the damage suffered by the victim of the cyber operation, or the relationship between the computers involved and individuals and whether these individuals were acting on behalf of a State.\nThe purpose of the previous paragraphs was to demonstrate the forms in which digital evidence may be presented during proceedings before an international court or tribunal. The difficulty involved in the identification and collection of this type of evidence should not be underestimated. The process may entail a great deal of technical expertise. A further difficulty in the collection of cyber evidence involves proving the authenticity and integrity of the evidence.²⁹ This is a task reserved for the experts who may take part in the judicial proceedings.\nTo date, no dispute between States relating to a cyber operation has given rise to a judicial proceeding. However, in several instances of cyber operations alleged to be either state sponsored or even state conducted, States and non-state actors, such as cybersecurity firms, have collected evidence and presented it in reports detailing these cyber operations and attributing them to groups or individuals. These various reports provide a basis for the analysis of what elements may be presented by a State in the context of a judicial proceeding on a state-sponsored cyber operation.\nIn 2013, the US cybersecurity firm Mandiant released a report detailing an investigation on computer security breaches allegedly sponsored by the Chinese government that occurred (between 2004 and 2013) at hundreds of organisations around the world.³⁰ The investigation focused on cyber espionage activities considered to be the result of a single group referred to by the Mandiant teams as APT 1. The objective was to\n²⁹ ibid 239.\n³⁰ Mandiant Intelligence Center Report, ‘APT1: Exposing One of China’s Cyber Espionage Units’ (Mandiant 2013) 1 http://intelreport.mandiant.com/Mandiant_APT1_Report.pdf.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE\n97\ndetermine the extent of APT 1's activities, its members and if it was acting on the behalf of a State. To carry out this investigation, Mandiant collected various computer tools, URLs and IP addresses used by APT 1 to perpetrate and relay its cyber operations, and logging data on different servers. This information made it possible to identify the structure and the modus operandi of APT 1:\nAPT1 maintains an extensive infrastructure of computer systems around the world.\n- APT1 controls thousands of systems in support of their computer intrusion activities.\n- In the last two years we have observed APT1 establish a minimum of 937 Command and Control (C2) servers hosted on 849 distinct IP addresses in 13 countries. The majority of these 849 unique IP addresses were registered to organizations in China (709), followed by the U.S. (109).\n- In the last three years we have observed APT1 use fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) resolving to 988 unique IP addresses.\n- Over a two-year period (January 2011 to January 2013) we confirmed 1,905 instances of APT1 actors logging into their attack infrastructure from 832 different IP addresses with Remote Desktop, a tool that provides a remote user with an interactive graphical interface to a system.\n- In the last several years we have confirmed 2,551 FQDNs attributed to APT1.³¹\nOnce the structure and activities of APT 1 were established, Mandiant focused on the question of attribution. Investigators determined that 97 per cent of APT 1's remote access used the 'Chinese (Simplified) – US Keyboard' setting. In addition, 98 per cent of the IP addresses connecting remotely to the computer systems controlled by APT 1 were Chinese and almost all the IP addresses used to communicate with the target computer systems were Chinese and located in the Shanghai area. In addition, investigators were able to identify the computer traces left by three individuals considered to be members of APT 1.³² The elements used to identify these individuals included multiple IP addresses, email addresses, URLs and their respective modus operandi. Using this digital evidence, as well as non-digital evidence related to the functioning of the Chinese army and the identified location, Mandiant concluded that APT\n³¹ ibid 4.\n³² ibid 51–58.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTHE QUESTION OF EVIDENCE\n1 was probably Unit 61398 of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA), and therefore tied directly to the Chinese government.³³\n## 3.3.2 The Necessary Caution in the Collection and Assessment of Evidence\nAs with any evidence, one must proceed cautiously with the collection and analysis of digital evidence. It is essential to involve experts who can not only analyse the data but also explain their conclusions to non-specialists of computer science, such as to the parties and judges involved in a judicial proceeding. This issue will be developed in the section dedicated to experts.\nThe malware Stuxnet,³⁴ identified in 2010, which physically damaged several centrifuges of an Iranian nuclear plant, and its subsequent investigation, serve as an interesting example. This malware is alleged to have been a joint cyber operation involving the United States and Israel, the purpose of which was to derail the Iranian nuclear programme and force the country to abandon the military dimension of its nuclear ambition. However, neither Iran nor any other State has officially attributed this cyber operation to the United States, Israel or any other State, and no State has claimed paternity for this malware. Stuxnet was first identified in June 2010 by a Belarusian cybersecurity company, VirusBlokAda, and was subsequently analysed by experts from various cybersecurity companies, including Kaspersky and Symantec. The latter published a report detailing the functioning of Stuxnet.³⁵ An important part of this report dug into and analysed the computer code of Stuxnet, and identified two elements that may hint at a potential link between Israel and the malware.\nFirstly, they identified the project path ‘b:\\myrtus\\src\\objfre_w2k_x86\\i386\\guava.pdb’ in the driver file. The name of the folder is ‘myrtus’ and one of the files is ‘guava’, guava being a tropical tree of the myrtaceae family – that is to say of the myrtle family. The report further notes that:\n³³ ibid 59–60.\n³⁴ On Stuxnet see, generally, Kim Zetter, Countdown to Zero Day: Stuxnet and the Launch of the World’s First Digital Weapon (Crown 2014); see also David E Sanger, Confront and Conceal: Obama’s Secret Wars and Surprising Use of American Power (Crown 2012).\n³⁵ Nicolas Falliere, Liam O Murchu and Eric Chien, ‘W32.Stuxnet Dossier (Version 1.4)’ (Symantec 2011) www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/w32_stuxnet_dossier.pdf.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE\n99\naccording to Wikipedia, ‘Esther was originally named Hadassah. Hadassah means “myrtle” in Hebrew.’ Esther learned of a plot to assassinate the king and ‘told the king of Haman’s plan to massacre all Jews in the Persian Empire … The Jews went on to kill only their would-be executioners.’ Symantec cautions readers on drawing any attribution conclusions. Attackers would have the natural desire to implicate another party.³⁶\nIn other words, the names ‘myrtus’ and ‘guava’ could hypothetically refer to Queen Esther of the Old Testament, and thus could be understood as a reference to the situation of the Jewish people in Persia, the State that preceded the Islamic Republic of Iran.\nSecondly, Stuxnet established a registry key value of 19790509, which would allow Stuxnet’s future intrusion attempts to identify whether the targeted computer was already infected:\n[i]f this value is equal to 19790509 the threat will exit. This is thought to be an infection marker or a ‘do not infect’ marker. If this is set correctly infection will not occur. The value may be a random string and represent nothing, but also appears to match the format of date markers used in the threat. As a date, the value may be May 9, 1979. This date could be an arbitrary date, a birth date, or some other significant date. While on May 9, 1979 a variety of historical events occurred, according to Wikipedia ‘Habib Elghanian was executed by a firing squad in Tehran sending shock waves through the closely knit Iranian Jewish community. He was the first Jew and one of the first civilians to be executed by the new Islamic government. This prompted the mass exodus of the once 100,000 member strong Jewish community of Iran which continues to this day.’ Symantec cautions readers on drawing any attribution conclusions. Attackers would have the natural desire to implicate another party.³⁷\nIn summary, these two elements found in the lines of the Stuxnet computer code could be references to historical events involving Iran and its Jewish population, and have therefore been analysed by some as implicating Israel in the creation of Stuxnet. These clues and their analysis should nevertheless be treated with caution. While they may point to the responsible party, they may also have been put there deliberately by the creators of the code to lead investigators into wrongly implicating Israel. Thus, this type of evidence should not be considered as clear proof of Israeli responsibility, but merely a nudge in that direction.\n³⁶ ibid 24.\n³⁷ ibid 18.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTHE QUESTION OF EVIDENCE\nThe example of Stuxnet demonstrates the importance of involving competent experts in the search for and analysis of technical evidence. It also shows how important it is to approach technical evidence critically. Cyber operations are indeed a highly technical phenomenon, but this does not mean that their analysis and attribution should be limited to a technical approach. On the contrary, it is essential that, alongside technical experts, experts from other disciplines are also involved in an investigation.\n## 3.3.3 The Validity of Unlawfully Collected Evidence\nCyberspace is characterised by the interconnection of computer networks, making it possible to remotely access various connected networks and computer systems. This feature makes access to digital evidence easier on a technical level. It also facilitates the task of the perpetrator of a cyber operation wishing to erase or blur their tracks. It is indeed relatively easy for them to access the clues they may have left and to move, manipulate or destroy them.³⁸ It is therefore essential for the victim of a cyber operation wishing to seize and secure potential evidence to act as quickly and thoroughly as possible before the perpetrator erases their tracks. For this reason, investigators must act with a certain discretion so as not to accelerate the perpetrator's attempts to modify and remove the evidence they may have left behind.\nOne of the main features of cyberspace that affects the seizure of technical evidence in criminal, terrorist and inter-state cases is the transnational dimension of cyberspace.³⁹ Indeed, a cyber operation conducted or sponsored by one State against another will probably transit through computer systems and networks located in third-party States. The procedure for the collection of technical evidence by the victim State from computer systems and networks located within its territory is governed by that State's domestic law.⁴⁰ Conversely, the collection of evidence from computer systems and networks located abroad (and outside of the victim State's jurisdiction) may be deemed unlawful, and\n³⁸ Christiane Féral-Schuhl, *Cyberdroit 2011/2012. Le droit à l'épreuve de l'internet* (6th edn, Dalloz 2010) 992.\n³⁹ Jonathan Bourguignon, 'La recherche de la preuve informatique et l'exercice des compétences extraterritoriales de l'Etat' in Société Française pour le Droit International, *Internet et le droit international* (Colloque de Rouen, Pedone 2014) 357–372.\n⁴⁰ Féral-Schuhl (n 38) 992 et seq.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE\n101\nindeed is often conducted without the consent of the State that has jurisdiction.\nA State’s seizure of evidence from computer systems and networks located within the jurisdiction of another State and in the absence of the said State’s consent would most likely constitute an internationally wrongful act. More specifically, it would probably constitute a violation of the latter State’s territorial sovereignty. The wrongfulness of the seizure may nevertheless be mitigated or even precluded when the responsible State can prove that the seizure occurred in the context of a circumstance precluding wrongfulness. For instance, a victim State that seizes evidence from the network of the State responsible for a cyber operation may claim that their seizure of evidence (in violation of the latter State’s jurisdiction) constitutes a countermeasure. However, this may prove a difficult line of defence. The victim State may claim that it was necessary to seize evidence before the responsible State had a chance to remove or tamper with it. The responsible State has a prime opportunity to do so if the victim State requests its cooperation or if the responsible State is aware of the seizure operation. Necessity may be invoked to preclude the wrongfulness of an act performed by a State to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril. It appears thus fragile ground to justify a cyber operation aimed at seizing evidence in the computer systems of another State. The fragility of these two potential justifications for such acts imposes to therefore analyse the admissibility and validity of evidence collected unlawfully.\nWould evidence that is illegally obtained be considered legitimate before a court? More specifically, would illegally obtained evidence be admissible in contentious proceedings before the ICJ? There is no answer to this question in the Statute and Rules of the Court. However, in the Corfu Channel case the judges accepted evidence that was unlawfully acquired by the United Kingdom.⁴¹ It must be pointed out, however, that the judges did not rule on the validity of the evidence. In this case, the United Kingdom justified the illegal seizure of the evidence as follows:\nAccording to that [United Kingdom] Government, the corpora delicti must be secured as quickly as possible, for fear they should be taken away, without leaving traces, by the authors of the minelaying or by the Albanian authorities. This justification took two distinct forms in the United Kingdom Government’s arguments. It was presented first as a\n⁴¹ Corfu Channel (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v. Albania) (Judgment on the Merits)  ICJ Reports 4, 34.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTHE QUESTION OF EVIDENCE\nnew and special application of the theory of intervention, by means of which the State intervening would secure possession of evidence in the territory of another State, in order to submit it to an international tribunal and thus facilitate its task.\nThe United Kingdom Agent, in his speech in reply, has further classified ‘Operation Retail’ among methods of self-protection or self-help.⁴²\nThe Court rejected these two justifications and considered the conduct of the United Kingdom to be unlawful. However, the Court still accepted and considered the illegally obtained evidence. It is interesting to note that the line of defence used by the British government approximates to the one that could be used by a State for the illegal seizure of computer evidence, as discussed above. It is likely that the Court’s position will remain unchanged in a case involving a similar seizure of evidence, and that therefore the wrongfulness of those actions would not be precluded.\nThis point is very important because a significant amount of evidence, digital or otherwise, provided by States regarding a cyber operation, could be acquired illegally. With respect to digital evidence, it has already been shown that collection from servers under the jurisdiction of other States (without their consent) may constitute an internationally wrongful act. States could also present evidence collected more or less lawfully by their intelligence services. If espionage is not unlawful under international law, it may give rise to conduct violating certain norms of international law, in particular the territorial sovereignty of the targeted State or the principle of non-intervention.⁴³\nThe hack of Sony Pictures Entertainment in 2014 is a good illustration. As seen earlier, the United States attributed this cyber operation to North Korea without publicly presenting evidence supporting their accusation. This lack of evidence could be explained by the fact that the United States was able to identify North Korea as responsible for the cyber operation through the surveillance of North Korean networks by the National Security Agency (NSA).⁴⁴ In other words, the attribution was made possible not by technical evidence collected after the cyber operation, but rather by collecting information on North Korean activities conducted prior to the cyber operation concerned.

In this sense, neither the Statute nor the Rules of Court clarify who may be called as an expert in a case before the ICJ. A definition can be found in the Agreement between the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea and the Federal Republic of Germany regarding the Headquarters of the Tribunal, which states that an ‘expert’ is ‘a person called at the instance of a party to a dispute or at the instance of the Tribunal to present testimony in the form of expert opinions, based on special knowledge, skills, experience or training’ (Article 1(l)).\nIn a dispute related to a cyber operation, it is essential to involve experts for two main reasons. Firstly, it is possible that neither the judges nor counsel have the requisite knowledge to understand the technical details of the dispute. Secondly, it is essential that the computer evidence provided by the parties be analysed by qualified experts who can attest to its authenticity and provide the relevant analysis.\nIn a case before the ICJ, experts can be involved in four different ways: they may be appointed by the parties; the judges may consult them in an informal manner; or decide to involve them in the proceedings; and finally, it is possible for the judges to appoint assessors who sit in on the proceedings but do not have the right to vote.\n## 3.4.1 Experts Appointed by the Parties\nMost of the computer-based evidence that may be collected and presented in relation to a cyber operation should be collected and analysed by experts to ensure that it is authentic and to establish the facts in the\n⁴⁵ Giorgio Gaja, ‘Assessing Expert Evidence in the ICJ’ (2017) 15 The Law &amp; Practice of International Courts and Tribunals 409, *passim*; Malintoppi (n 27) 430–434.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTHE QUESTION OF EVIDENCE\nmost accurate manner. Consequently, States wishing to collect such evidence will have recourse to experts generally available within the State's computer-security services or through the contracting of private cybersecurity companies. For example, the Democratic Party decided to use the private company CrowdStrike to analyse the hack that it suffered in 2016, and it was on the basis of the evidence gathered by that company that US authorities attributed the cyber operation to Russian intelligence services.\nBeyond the investigation, and the process of gathering and analysing evidence, it is essential that experts are involved in the presentation of evidence, especially in the event of a judicial proceeding. Indeed, their participation and their explanations render such evidence intelligible to people who are not familiar with computer science. Their participation in judicial proceedings also permits an adversarial dialogue between the experts of the two parties.\n## 3.4.2 'Invisible' Experts Consulted by the Court\nThe ICJ, like other international jurisdictions, has to deal with disputes involving an important technical dimension requiring some specific expertise. This is especially the case for border disputes. The subject has been analysed by Robert Yewdall Jennings, who notes that:\nthe Court has not infrequently employed cartographers, hydrographers, geographers, linguists, and even specialised legal experts to assist in the understanding of the issue in a case before it; and has not on the whole felt any need to make this public knowledge or even to apprise the parties.^^\nIn some cases involving a strong technical dimension, the judges of the ICJ have consulted informal experts to assist them, but these experts were not officially involved in the proceedings. Generally, such experts act as temporary members of the Registry of the Court and their findings are not communicated to the parties or made public.^^\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nEXPERT OPINION EVIDENCE\n105\nThe participation of these ‘experts fantômes’⁴⁸ has been criticised,⁴⁹ in particular by a number of judges. For example, Judges Awn Shawkat Al-Khasawneh and Bruno Simma, in their Joint Dissenting Opinion in the Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay case, pointed out that:\nWhile such consultation of ‘invisible’ experts may be pardonable if the input they provide relates to the scientific margins of a case, the situation is quite different in complex scientific disputes, as is the case here. Under circumstances such as in the present case, adopting such a practice would deprive the Court of the above-mentioned advantages of transparency, openness, procedural fairness, and the ability for the Parties to comment upon or otherwise assist the Court in understanding the evidence before it. These are concerns based not purely on abstract principle, but on the good administration of justice.⁵⁰\nA distinction should be drawn between situations in which invisible experts are consulted on technical issues relevant – but not decisive – to the case, and situations in which they may critically influence the outcome of the case.⁵¹ However, this distinction has not yet been made.\nThe distinction proposed above would be particularly relevant in a dispute relating to a cyber operation. Judges may have recourse to invisible experts to assist them in their understanding of the functioning of the Internet and relevant computer systems, specifically to help them in developing a general knowledge of the subject matter of the dispute. Conversely, it would be desirable for matters related to the evidence provided by the parties, as well as technical problems specifically related to the case, to be dealt with by experts appointed by the Court and taking part in the proceedings. In such cases, as developed below, expert opinions are communicated to the parties who can then comment on them. This would be particularly relevant and important for disputes regarding cyber operations, as the proceedings may involve a large amount of technical evidence, the assessment of which by experts may be crucial.\n⁴⁸ The expression ‘experts fantômes’ is borrowed from Judges Awn Shawkat Al-Khasawneh and Bruno Simma: Joint Dissenting Opinion, Judges Al-Khasawneh and Simma in *Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay* (Argentina v. Uruguay) (Judgment)  ICJ Reports 14, 114.\n⁴⁹ Lucas Carlos Lima, ‘Expert Advisor or Non-voting Adjudicator? The Potential Function of Assessors in the Procedure of the International Court of Justice’ (2016) 99 Rivista di diritto internazionale 1123, 1134; James Gerard Devaney, *Fact-Finding before the International Court of Justice* (CUP 2016) 83–88.\n⁵⁰ Joint Dissenting Opinion, Judges Al-Khasawneh and Simma in *Pulp Mills* (Judgment) (n 48) 114.\n⁵¹ Gaja (n 45) 414.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTHE QUESTION OF EVIDENCE\n## 3.4.3 Experts Appointed by the Court\nIn a case before the ICJ, it is possible for judges to appoint experts.^^ This possibility is provided for in Article 50 of the Statute of the Court, which states that '[t]he Court may, at any time, entrust any individual, body, bureau, commission, or other organisation that it may select, with the task of carrying out an enquiry or giving an expert opinion'. Article 67 of the Rules of Court clarifies the position regarding the appointment of experts by judges:\n1. If the Court considers it necessary to arrange for an enquiry or an expert opinion, it shall, after hearing the parties, issue an order to this effect, defining the subject of the enquiry or expert opinion, stating the number and mode of appointment of the persons to hold the enquiry or of the experts, and laying down the procedure to be followed. Where appropriate, the Court shall require persons appointed to carry out an enquiry, or to give an expert opinion, to make a solemn declaration.\n2. Every report or record of an enquiry and every expert opinion shall be communicated to the parties, which shall be given the opportunity of commenting upon it.\nThus, unlike invisible experts, these experts are officially appointed by the Court and their findings are made public, thereby permitting the parties to submit observations.\nThe Court has appointed experts in a very limited number of cases,^^ as Lucas Carlos Lima points out:\nExperts ex curia were appointed by the ICJ in only three cases. In the Corfu Channel (United Kingdom v. Albania) case, the Court nominated three naval experts, who conducted a site visit and subsequently presented a report which the parties had the opportunity to comment upon. In the case of the Delimitation of the Maritime Boundary in the Gulf of Maine Area (Canada/United States of America), the Chamber of the Court appointed a naval expert to assist in the delimitation of the boundary between the two countries and his technical report was attached to the judgment. In the Maritime Delimitation in the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua), the Court appointed two experts\n^^ This is also possible before other international courts and tribunals: Louis Savadogo, 'Le recours des juridictions internationales à des experts' (2004) 50 Annuaire français de droit international 231, 233.\n^^ Devaney (n 49) 20–23.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nEXPERT OPINION EVIDENCE\n107\nto collect ‘all the factual elements relating to the state of the coast’ between the two countries, requiring them to ‘prepare a written report [...] [that] shall be communicated to the Parties, which shall be given the opportunity of commenting upon it’.⁵⁴\nA number of scholars and ICJ judges have expressed their support for the use of Court-appointed experts, particularly in the context of litigation involving a critical technical dimension.⁵⁵\nThe use of Court-appointed experts, to analyse technical arguments presented by the parties to a dispute relating to a cyber operation, would have the advantage of providing the judges with an objective analysis of the evidence and allow them to concentrate on the legal issues.\n## 3.4.4 Assessors Appointed by the Court\nICJ judges may appoint assessors, who may sit with the Court but do not have the right to vote. This possibility is opened by Article 30(2) of the Statute of the Court, according to which ‘[t]he Rules of the Court may provide for assessors to sit with the Court or with any of its chambers, without the right to vote’. This provision is clarified by Article 9 of the Rules of Court, which provides that this possibility is available in contentious and advisory cases and that these assessors ‘shall be appointed by secret ballot and by a majority of the votes of the judges composing the Court for the case’. Neither the Statute nor the Rules of the Court specify whether the State Parties are to be involved in the procedure for appointing assessors.\nAs Giorgio Gaja points out, no assessor has ever been appointed in a case before the ICJ.⁵⁶ He argues that there are two reasons for this: firstly, even if they do not have the right to vote, the assessors could be seen as wielding too much influence over the decision of the judges; secondly, the parties and their experts would not be informed and thus they would not be able to comment on the opinions expressed by the assessors.\nIn most disputes regarding cyber operations, which may be brought before the ICJ, the technical expertise provided by the experts appointed by the parties or by the Court would probably be sufficient, and it would\n⁵⁴ Lima (n 49) 1131.

Such disputes may involve a significant amount of highly technical evidence, the collection and assessment of which by the parties and by the judges, in the case of judicial proceedings, may be challenging. Conversely, the presentation of technical evidence relating to cyber operations is not particularly challenging, as most of it may be easily presented as documentary evidence.\nStates could, however, be reluctant to make such evidence public during judicial proceedings. Firstly, from the point of view of the State, by revealing the collected evidence, it is likely to give indications about its computing capabilities. Secondly, by publicly disclosing information about a cyber operation, there is a risk that the vulnerabilities exploited by this cyber operation would be taken advantage of by other actors to perpetrate cyber operations. This has been demonstrated by WannaCry$^{57}$ and the wave of cyber operations that affected a large number of people, institutions and businesses in May 2017.$^{58}$ EternalBlue, the vulnerability exploited by some cyber operations and revealed in the summer of 2016, was obtained from the NSA through a hack by the Shadow Brokers.$^{59}$ Microsoft had released a fix for this vulnerability,$^{60}$ but it seems that\n57 Microsoft, ‘Ransom:Win32/WannaCrypt (Updated 10 January 2018)’ (Windows Defender Security Intelligence, 12 May 2017) www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/threats/malware-encyclopedia-description?Name=Ransom:Win32/WannaCrypt.

Thus, by revealing during a judicial proceeding the functioning of a cyber operation and the vulnerabilities exploited, the State risks revealing elements that could be used to jeopardise the security and stability of cyberspace. In this context, it may be necessary to consider keeping some evidence confidential in order to safeguard the security and stability of cyberspace.\nThe establishment of the facts and the attribution of a cyber operation carry an important technical dimension, but it would be a mistake to reduce them merely to technical processes. It is therefore essential that, alongside the technical experts, experts from other disciplines with a good understanding of the functioning of cyberspace and cyber operations are involved in these processes, and potentially involved in judicial proceedings. Indeed, these experts would help to bridge the technical and legal dimensions of the dispute. This is also the aim of the present chapter, which bridges the technical dimension of attribution analysed in the previous chapter and the legal dimension of attribution studied in the next.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press"

      "flat_text": "The evidence collected to identify the computers and individuals involved in a cyber operation may also be used to determine whether they were acting on behalf of a State. This leads to the question of how such evidence may be used and considered admissible in a judicial proceeding, or more generally in an international dispute, related to a cyber operation.\nThe development of State activities in cyberspace, notably offensive cyber operations, has led to international disputes between States. To date, a State has neither disputed a cyber operation before an international court or tribunal nor raised the issue before the UN Security Council. Generally, victim States have chosen to respond through extra-juridical measures, such as cyber countermeasures or measures of retorsion.¹ However, there is the possibility that a State, in future, may bring a charge of harmful cyber operations before an international court or tribunal or before the UN Security Council.\nDifferent procedures for the collection, presentation and assessment of evidence exist depending on the international court or tribunal selected and the circumstances of the case.² The assertion presented hereunder is that the International Court of Justice (ICJ) would be the most suitable judicial organ to deal with an international dispute arising from cyber operations conducted by one State against another. Thus, this chapter considers the procedures for the collection and assessment of evidence that may be applied in the event of a case before the ICJ. Before the ICJ, all parties are equal and thus have equal rights to submit and present their legal case. Moreover, each party bears the burden of proof regarding ¹ See infra Chapter 10.\n² Rüdiger Wolfrum and Mirka Möldner, ‘International Courts and Tribunals, Evidence’, Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law (MPEPIL), https://opil.ouplaw.com/view/10.1093/law:epil/9780199231690/law-9780199231690-e26.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press THE QUESTION OF EVIDENCE their case in accordance with the Statute and Rules of the Court.³ In the Minquiers and Ecrehos case, the ICJ specified that ‘each Party has to prove its alleged title and the facts upon which it relies’.⁴ The procedure regarding the production and assessment of evidence for a contentious case before the ICJ is prescribed by Articles 48 to 52 of the Statute of the Court⁵ and clarified in the Rules of the Court.⁶ In addition, Practice Directions for use by States, which had appeared before being adopted by the ICJ in 2001, have since been amended several times. While the Practice Directions are non-binding, they clarify procedure before the Court. It must be noted that the ICJ is not bound to the evidence and facts submitted by the parties and may also arbitrarily decide to collect and use evidence autonomously.⁷ This chapter is comprised of four sections dealing, respectively, with State practice regarding evidence related to cyber operations (3.1), evidence in international law (3.2), documentary evidence (3.3) and expert opinion evidence (3.4).\n## 3.1 State Practice on Evidence Relating to Cyber Operations The nascent State practice on responding to state-sponsored cyber operations seems to demonstrate that States are increasingly aware of the need to support their accusations with evidence proving the facts and the alleged paternity of the cyber operations concerned. This is particularly crucial regarding cyber conduct, as cyberspace offers numerous opportunities to hide or forge the real paternity of a cyber operation, notably by using proxy computer systems or botnets located in other countries. Some perpetrators have even inserted misleading hints into the computer code of a virus in an attempt to shift the blame onto a third party.

For many years, the USA did not officially respond to cyber operations targeting their interests, and thus did not disclose publicly any evidence proving the facts and possible attribution. The 2014 Sony Pictures Entertainment hack marked a watershed in US practice. The American subsidiary of the Japanese conglomerate Sony Corporation was hacked and a significant amount of data was stolen from the company. This data was then publicly released by the hackers in November 2014. The hackers demanded the cancellation of the planned release of the film *The Interview*, a comedy about the assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. US officials alleged that the attack was sponsored by North Korea.⁸ North Korea, however, denied any involvement. The United States indicated that it had evidence of the involvement of North Korea, and the White House announced that it would adopt a proportional response.⁹ In reaction to this cyber operation allegedly executed by North Korea, the United States adopted new sanctions against North Korea; additionally, it is considered having adopted an unofficial covert response in the form of unilateral extrajudicial measures. In this instance, the United States attributed the cyber operation to North Korea and responded to it, without disclosing the evidence.\nThe 2016 Democratic National Committee (DNC) hack marked an even bigger watershed in US practice as the United States decided, for the first time, to disclose evidence corroborating the attribution of a cyber operation to another State, the Russian Federation. On 22 July 2016, a few days before the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, Wikileaks published 19,252 emails and 8,034 attachments from the DNC, the governing body of the Democratic Party. The leak contained emails and documents from seven key DNC staff members suggesting that the DNC leadership had worked to advantage Hillary Clinton over Bernie ⁸ David E Sanger and Nicole Perlroth, ‘U.S. Said to Find North Korea Ordered Cyberattack on Sony’, *The New York Times* (17 December 2014) www.nytimes.com/2014/12/18/world/asia/us-links-north-korea-to-sony-hacking.html.\n⁹ Dave Boyer, ‘White House Threatens “Proportional” Response to North Korea Cyberattacks on Sony Pictures’, *The Washington Times* (18 December 2014) www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/18/white-house-threatens-proportional-response-north-/ https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press THE QUESTION OF EVIDENCE Sanders. On 7 October 2016, a ‘Joint Statement from the Department of Homeland Security and Office of the Director of National Intelligence on Election Security’ was released, stating: The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations. The recent disclosures of alleged hacked e-mails on sites like DCLeaks.com and WikiLeaks and by the Guccifer 2.0 online persona are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process. Such activity is not new to Moscow – the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there. We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia’s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.^[10]^ On 10 October 2016, the White House announced that the president was considering a proportional response to the Russian cyber operations.^[11]^ Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, added that ‘[i]t is unlikely that our response would be announced in advance,’ and that ‘the president can choose response options that we never announce’.^[12]^ The US allegations were met with legitimate criticism as no evidence supporting allegations of Russian responsibility for the DNC hack was publicly released. As a consequence, on 29 December 2016, the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation released a ‘Joint Analysis Report’ exposing some of the evidence supporting their allegations of the involvement of Russian intelligence services FSB and GRU, as well as their modus operandi.^[13]^ This document supported the joint statement of October 2016, in which they expressed confidence that ^[10]^ ‘Joint Statement’, para 1 (Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation 2016) www.dhs.gov/news/2016/10/07/joint-statement-department-homeland-security-and-office-director-national; see also Ellen Nakashima, ‘U.S. Government Officially Accuses Russia of Hacking Campaign to Interfere with Elections’, *Washington Post* (7 October 2016) www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-government-officially-accuses-russia-of-hacking-campaign-to-influence-elections/2016/10/07/4e0b9654-8cbf-11e6-875e-2c1bfe943b66_story.html.\n^[11]^ Julie Hirschfeld Davis and Gardiner Harris, ‘Obama Considers “Proportional” Response to Russian Hacking in U.S. Election’, *The New York Times* (11 October 2016) www.nytimes.com/2016/10/12/us/politics/obama-russia-hack-election.html.\n^[12]^ Jack Goldsmith, ‘Thoughts on White House Pledge to Respond to DNC Hack’ (Lawfare, 12 October 2016) www.lawfareblog.com/thoughts-white-house-pledge-respond-dnc-hack.\n^[13]^ United States, ‘Joint Analysis Report: GRIZZLY STEPPE – Russian Malicious Cyber Activity’ (Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation 2016) https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press EVIDENCE IN INTERNATIONAL LAW\n\n## 3.2 Evidence in International Law\nHistorically, States have used evidence to support their allegations even outside of a judicial proceeding.¹⁴ This has been the practice, for instance, of international fact-finding commissions, such as the ones established after the 2008 armed conflict in Georgia.¹⁵ The development of international justice has strengthened this practice and made the international community demand an increasingly higher standard of proof.\nStates increasingly rely on international fact-finding commissions following international incidents that may have led to inter-state disputes, and this development is reflected in various branches and aspects of international law. The crash of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 in Ukraine in 2014 offers an interesting case study regarding State practice on the establishment of fact-finding commissions as well as on the collection and assessment of evidence outside of judicial proceedings. This example is also symptomatic of the challenges posed by technical and scientific evidence.\nOn 17 July 2014, Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 departed from Amsterdam-Schiphol Airport towards its destination, Kuala Lumpur. However, the aircraft never reached its destination having crashed in eastern Ukraine, in the Donetsk region. At that time, this area was still the scene of an armed conflict between the combatants of the People's Republic of Donetsk and the Ukrainian army. There were no survivors among the 283 passengers and 15 crew members. The circumstances of the crash were unclear and conflicting narratives were proposed. Initially,\nwww.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/JAR_16-20296A_GRIZZLY%20STEPPE-2016-1229.pdf.\n¹⁴ Joseph C Witenberg, ‘La théorie des preuves devant les juridictions internationales’ (1936) 56 RCADI 1, 6–7.\n¹⁵ ‘Report of the International Fact-Finding Commission on the Conflict in Georgia’ (2009) www.ceiig.ch/Report.html.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTHE QUESTION OF EVIDENCE\nthe pro-Russian separatists and the Ukrainian army accused one another of having caused the crash by missile fire.¹⁶ The day after the disaster, members of the UN Security Council called for an ‘independent, comprehensive and credible international investigation’.¹⁷\nA Joint Investigation Team (JIT), coordinated by the Dutch Safety Board (OVV – Onderzoeksraad Voor Veiligheid), was established. The work of the JIT was carried out in close collaboration with the observers of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and the emergency services of the People’s Republic of Donetsk. The team first recovered pieces of the wreckage as well as the black boxes of the aircraft from the separatists and repatriated them to the Netherlands for analysis.¹⁸ The OVV published its final report on 13 October 2015.¹⁹ The analysis of the black boxes, the reconstituted wreckage of the aircraft and other materials collected allowed the OVV to assert that the crash was caused by a surface missile – a 9M38 missile equipped with a 9N314M-type warhead installed on a BUK-type ground-air system – fired from a zone controlled by separatists, but where fighting with the Ukrainian army was underway. The conclusions of the OVV report were highly controversial. Almaz-Antey, the Russian manufacturer of the incriminated BUK missile system, carried out its own investigation, reconstructing in particular the effects of the explosion on a similar aircraft removed from traffic. From this study, it claimed that the missile had been fired from an area under the control of the Ukrainian army.²⁰ Moreover, the Russian Federal Air Transport Agency (Rosaviatsiya) was also sceptical, and stated that it wanted to conduct its own investigation.

For example, Microsoft published a white paper in 2016 suggesting, among other things, that such a mechanism be created following the model of the investigation mechanism of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).²² They argue that the proposed mechanism would create a synergy between the expertise of States, private actors and academics in order to work together to identify the perpetrators of malicious cyber operations: There could be a similar mechanism by which governments and the private sector can provide evidence to support technical attribution and obtain some level of validation through rigorous peer review. At its core, this organization would consist of technical experts from across governments, the private sector, academia, and civil society with the capability to examine tactics, techniques, and procedures used by nation-state attackers, as well as indicators of compromise that suggest a given attack was by ²¹ ‘JIT: MH17 Shot Down with Missile Fired from Pro-Russian Rebel Controlled Field’ (NL Times, 28 September 2016) http://nltimes.nl/2016/09/28/jit-mh17-shot-missile-fired-pro-russian-rebel-controlled-field.\n²² Scott Charney et al, ‘From Articulation to Implementation: Enabling Progress on Cybersecurity Norms’ 10–12 www.microsoft.com/en-us/cybersecurity/content-hub/enabling-progress-on-cybersecurity-norms.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press THE QUESTION OF EVIDENCE a nation-state. Its essential output would be a technical analysis of the attack and evidence of attribution. In some cases, based on agreed-upon criteria, it might publish its findings. Some will of course oppose this approach. Governments in particular may be reluctant to empower an independent organization to make findings that may be both politically important and politically charged.²³ In law, evidence ‘tends to prove the existence or nonexistence of some fact’.²⁴ In the case of cyber operations, the facts are generally articulated around two main axes: the identification of the cyber operation and its consequences and the attribution of the cyber operation.\nAs pointed out by the UNGGE in its 2015 report, ‘In case of ICT incidents, States should consider all relevant information, including the larger context of the event, the challenges of attribution in the ICT environment and the nature and extent of the consequences.’²⁵ Indeed, the fact that an investigation relates to a cyber operation does not mean that evidence should be collected solely within cyberspace. Evidence gathered in the real world can also be relevant, even crucial, in determining the facts and attribution of a cyber operation.\nEvidence may consist of documentary evidence, physical evidence, expert or witness testimony, and hearsay evidence. This chapter focuses on the two main forms of evidence that may be relevant in the cyber context: documentary evidence and testimonial evidence from experts.\n## 3.3 Documentary Evidence The term ‘documentary evidence’ refers to evidence in the form of written documents that support the alleged facts.²⁶ It should be emphasised that documentary evidence is the main form of evidence presented before the ICJ.²⁷ The Statute and Rules of the Court contain several provisions on the production of documents as documentary evidence ²³ ibid 11.\n²⁴ Jonathan Law (ed), A Dictionary of Law (online version) (8th edn, OUP 2015), ‘Evidence’; see also Jean Salmon (ed), Dictionnaire de droit international public 874.\n²⁵ UNGA, ‘Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security’ (22 July 2015) UN Doc A/70/174.\n²⁶ Witenberg (n 14) 59.\n²⁷ Loretta Malintoppi, ‘Fact Finding and Evidence before the International Court of Justice (Notably in Scientific-Related Disputes)’ (2016) 7 Journal of International Dispute Settlement 421, 422.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE without, however, defining the types of authorised documents, thus leaving the parties and judges an important margin of discretion.\nThe various texts relating to the procedure and the production of evidence in a proceeding before the ICJ do not contain any specific provision related to digital evidence, with the exception of Practice direction IXbis. This provision states that a document that can be considered ‘part of a publication readily available’ under Article 56 (4) of the Rules of Court ‘may be in any format (printed or electronic), form (physical or on-line, such as posted on the internet) or on any data medium (on paper, on digital or any other media)’. Practice direction IXbis demonstrates the Court’s openness to digital evidence, without giving further details.\n## 3.3.1 Typology of Documentary Evidence That May Be Collected in Relation to Cyber Operations The majority of evidence that would be produced by a State regarding a cyber operation, both for the purpose of establishing the facts and for attribution, could be in a written form – i.e. documentary evidence – and would therefore not pose any particular procedural problem in proceedings before a court.\nHowever, an important clarification must be made at this stage. This remark concerns only the presentation of evidence and neither its collection and admissibility nor the capacity of judges to assess it. The latter will be analysed later in this chapter.\nDuring the event of a cyber operation, a number of traces are usually left and may be collected as evidence. Most of these traces can be presented in the form of written documents to constitute documentary evidence.²⁸ In the case of a computer virus, the computer code of the virus can be analysed and presented as evidence. Computer codes consisting of multiple lines of code can easily be considered as written evidence.\nAdditionally, IP addresses may be collected and presented in a cyber-related dispute. These IP addresses may be used to identify the different computers and servers involved in the cyber operation, either because these computers and servers were used for its launch or transit, or ²⁸ See, for instance, Marco Roscini, ‘Evidentiary Issues in International Disputes Related to State Responsibility for Cyber Operations’ (2015) 50 Texas International Law Journal 233.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press THE QUESTION OF EVIDENCE because they were the target of the cyber operation. The presentation of these IP addresses may be accompanied by the server logs, consisting of lists of activities performed by the relevant servers including the general time of connection of each IP address. These elements may be particularly useful in establishing the facts and timeline.\nThese different pieces of evidence are usually summarised in a report that places them in context in order to establish the facts. Moreover, this cyber-related evidence may be accompanied by non-digital evidence aimed, for instance, at establishing the damage suffered by the victim of the cyber operation, or the relationship between the computers involved and individuals and whether these individuals were acting on behalf of a State.\nThe purpose of the previous paragraphs was to demonstrate the forms in which digital evidence may be presented during proceedings before an international court or tribunal. The difficulty involved in the identification and collection of this type of evidence should not be underestimated. The process may entail a great deal of technical expertise. A further difficulty in the collection of cyber evidence involves proving the authenticity and integrity of the evidence.²⁹ This is a task reserved for the experts who may take part in the judicial proceedings.\nTo date, no dispute between States relating to a cyber operation has given rise to a judicial proceeding. However, in several instances of cyber operations alleged to be either state sponsored or even state conducted, States and non-state actors, such as cybersecurity firms, have collected evidence and presented it in reports detailing these cyber operations and attributing them to groups or individuals. These various reports provide a basis for the analysis of what elements may be presented by a State in the context of a judicial proceeding on a state-sponsored cyber operation.\nIn 2013, the US cybersecurity firm Mandiant released a report detailing an investigation on computer security breaches allegedly sponsored by the Chinese government that occurred (between 2004 and 2013) at hundreds of organisations around the world.³⁰ The investigation focused on cyber espionage activities considered to be the result of a single group referred to by the Mandiant teams as APT 1. The objective was to ²⁹ ibid 239.\n³⁰ Mandiant Intelligence Center Report, ‘APT1: Exposing One of China’s Cyber Espionage Units’ 1 http://intelreport.mandiant.com/Mandiant_APT1_Report.pdf.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE APT1 maintains an extensive infrastructure of computer systems around the world.\n- APT1 controls thousands of systems in support of their computer intrusion activities.\n- In the last two years we have observed APT1 establish a minimum of 937 Command and Control (C2) servers hosted on 849 distinct IP addresses in 13 countries. The majority of these 849 unique IP addresses were registered to organizations in China (709), followed by the U.S. (109).\n- In the last three years we have observed APT1 use fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) resolving to 988 unique IP addresses.\n- Over a two-year period we confirmed 1,905 instances of APT1 actors logging into their attack infrastructure from 832 different IP addresses with Remote Desktop, a tool that provides a remote user with an interactive graphical interface to a system.\n- In the last several years we have confirmed 2,551 FQDNs attributed to APT1.³¹ Once the structure and activities of APT 1 were established, Mandiant focused on the question of attribution. Investigators determined that 97 per cent of APT 1's remote access used the 'Chinese (Simplified) – US Keyboard' setting. In addition, 98 per cent of the IP addresses connecting remotely to the computer systems controlled by APT 1 were Chinese and almost all the IP addresses used to communicate with the target computer systems were Chinese and located in the Shanghai area. In addition, investigators were able to identify the computer traces left by three individuals considered to be members of APT 1.³² The elements used to identify these individuals included multiple IP addresses, email addresses, URLs and their respective modus operandi. Using this digital evidence, as well as non-digital evidence related to the functioning of the Chinese army and the identified location, Mandiant concluded that APT ³¹ ibid 4.\n³² ibid 51–58.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press THE QUESTION OF EVIDENCE\n\n## 3.3.2 The Necessary Caution in the Collection and Assessment of Evidence\nAs with any evidence, one must proceed cautiously with the collection and analysis of digital evidence. It is essential to involve experts who can not only analyse the data but also explain their conclusions to non-specialists of computer science, such as to the parties and judges involved in a judicial proceeding. This issue will be developed in the section dedicated to experts.\nThe malware Stuxnet,³⁴ identified in 2010, which physically damaged several centrifuges of an Iranian nuclear plant, and its subsequent investigation, serve as an interesting example. This malware is alleged to have been a joint cyber operation involving the United States and Israel, the purpose of which was to derail the Iranian nuclear programme and force the country to abandon the military dimension of its nuclear ambition. However, neither Iran nor any other State has officially attributed this cyber operation to the United States, Israel or any other State, and no State has claimed paternity for this malware. Stuxnet was first identified in June 2010 by a Belarusian cybersecurity company, VirusBlokAda, and was subsequently analysed by experts from various cybersecurity companies, including Kaspersky and Symantec. The latter published a report detailing the functioning of Stuxnet.³⁵ An important part of this report dug into and analysed the computer code of Stuxnet, and identified two elements that may hint at a potential link between Israel and the malware.\nFirstly, they identified the project path ‘b:\\myrtus\\src\\objfre_w2k_x86\\i386\\guava.pdb’ in the driver file. The name of the folder is ‘myrtus’ and one of the files is ‘guava’, guava being a tropical tree of the myrtaceae family – that is to say of the myrtle family. The report further notes that:\n³³ ibid 59–60.\n³⁴ On Stuxnet see, generally, Kim Zetter, Countdown to Zero Day: Stuxnet and the Launch of the World’s First Digital Weapon ; see also David E Sanger, Confront and Conceal: Obama’s Secret Wars and Surprising Use of American Power .\n³⁵ Nicolas Falliere, Liam O Murchu and Eric Chien, ‘W32.Stuxnet Dossier (Version 1.4)’  www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/w32_stuxnet_dossier.pdf.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE\n\nIn other words, the names ‘myrtus’ and ‘guava’ could hypothetically refer to Queen Esther of the Old Testament, and thus could be understood as a reference to the situation of the Jewish people in Persia, the State that preceded the Islamic Republic of Iran.\nSecondly, Stuxnet established a registry key value of 19790509, which would allow Stuxnet’s future intrusion attempts to identify whether the targeted computer was already infected: [i]f this value is equal to 19790509 the threat will exit. This is thought to be an infection marker or a ‘do not infect’ marker. If this is set correctly infection will not occur. The value may be a random string and represent nothing, but also appears to match the format of date markers used in the threat. As a date, the value may be May 9, 1979. This date could be an arbitrary date, a birth date, or some other significant date. While on May 9, 1979 a variety of historical events occurred, according to Wikipedia ‘Habib Elghanian was executed by a firing squad in Tehran sending shock waves through the closely knit Iranian Jewish community. He was the first Jew and one of the first civilians to be executed by the new Islamic government. This prompted the mass exodus of the once 100,000 member strong Jewish community of Iran which continues to this day.’ Symantec cautions readers on drawing any attribution conclusions. Attackers would have the natural desire to implicate another party.³⁷ In summary, these two elements found in the lines of the Stuxnet computer code could be references to historical events involving Iran and its Jewish population, and have therefore been analysed by some as implicating Israel in the creation of Stuxnet. These clues and their analysis should nevertheless be treated with caution. While they may point to the responsible party, they may also have been put there deliberately by the creators of the code to lead investigators into wrongly implicating Israel. Thus, this type of evidence should not be considered as clear proof of Israeli responsibility, but merely a nudge in that direction.\n³⁶ ibid 24.\n³⁷ ibid 18.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press THE QUESTION OF EVIDENCE The example of Stuxnet demonstrates the importance of involving competent experts in the search for and analysis of technical evidence. It also shows how important it is to approach technical evidence critically. Cyber operations are indeed a highly technical phenomenon, but this does not mean that their analysis and attribution should be limited to a technical approach. On the contrary, it is essential that, alongside technical experts, experts from other disciplines are also involved in an investigation.\n## 3.3.3 The Validity of Unlawfully Collected Evidence Cyberspace is characterised by the interconnection of computer networks, making it possible to remotely access various connected networks and computer systems. This feature makes access to digital evidence easier on a technical level. It also facilitates the task of the perpetrator of a cyber operation wishing to erase or blur their tracks. It is indeed relatively easy for them to access the clues they may have left and to move, manipulate or destroy them.³⁸ It is therefore essential for the victim of a cyber operation wishing to seize and secure potential evidence to act as quickly and thoroughly as possible before the perpetrator erases their tracks. For this reason, investigators must act with a certain discretion so as not to accelerate the perpetrator's attempts to modify and remove the evidence they may have left behind.\nOne of the main features of cyberspace that affects the seizure of technical evidence in criminal, terrorist and inter-state cases is the transnational dimension of cyberspace.³⁹ Indeed, a cyber operation conducted or sponsored by one State against another will probably transit through computer systems and networks located in third-party States. The procedure for the collection of technical evidence by the victim State from computer systems and networks located within its territory is governed by that State's domestic law.⁴⁰ Conversely, the collection of evidence from computer systems and networks located abroad (and outside of the victim State's jurisdiction) may be deemed unlawful, and ³⁸ Christiane Féral-Schuhl, *Cyberdroit 2011/2012. Le droit à l'épreuve de l'internet* (6th edn, Dalloz 2010) 992.\n³⁹ Jonathan Bourguignon, 'La recherche de la preuve informatique et l'exercice des compétences extraterritoriales de l'Etat' in Société Française pour le Droit International, *Internet et le droit international* (Colloque de Rouen, Pedone 2014) 357–372.\n⁴⁰ Féral-Schuhl (n 38) 992 et seq.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE A State’s seizure of evidence from computer systems and networks located within the jurisdiction of another State and in the absence of the said State’s consent would most likely constitute an internationally wrongful act. More specifically, it would probably constitute a violation of the latter State’s territorial sovereignty. The wrongfulness of the seizure may nevertheless be mitigated or even precluded when the responsible State can prove that the seizure occurred in the context of a circumstance precluding wrongfulness. For instance, a victim State that seizes evidence from the network of the State responsible for a cyber operation may claim that their seizure of evidence (in violation of the latter State’s jurisdiction) constitutes a countermeasure. However, this may prove a difficult line of defence. The victim State may claim that it was necessary to seize evidence before the responsible State had a chance to remove or tamper with it. The responsible State has a prime opportunity to do so if the victim State requests its cooperation or if the responsible State is aware of the seizure operation. Necessity may be invoked to preclude the wrongfulness of an act performed by a State to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril. It appears thus fragile ground to justify a cyber operation aimed at seizing evidence in the computer systems of another State. The fragility of these two potential justifications for such acts imposes to therefore analyse the admissibility and validity of evidence collected unlawfully.\nWould evidence that is illegally obtained be considered legitimate before a court? More specifically, would illegally obtained evidence be admissible in contentious proceedings before the ICJ? There is no answer to this question in the Statute and Rules of the Court. However, in the Corfu Channel case the judges accepted evidence that was unlawfully acquired by the United Kingdom.⁴¹ It must be pointed out, however, that the judges did not rule on the validity of the evidence. In this case, the United Kingdom justified the illegal seizure of the evidence as follows: According to that [United Kingdom] Government, the corpora delicti must be secured as quickly as possible, for fear they should be taken away, without leaving traces, by the authors of the minelaying or by the Albanian authorities. This justification took two distinct forms in the United Kingdom Government’s arguments. It was presented first as a ⁴¹ Corfu Channel (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v. Albania) (Judgment on the Merits) [1949] ICJ Reports 4, 34.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press THE QUESTION OF EVIDENCE new and special application of the theory of intervention, by means of which the State intervening would secure possession of evidence in the territory of another State, in order to submit it to an international tribunal and thus facilitate its task.\nThe United Kingdom Agent, in his speech in reply, has further classified ‘Operation Retail’ among methods of self-protection or self-help.⁴² The Court rejected these two justifications and considered the conduct of the United Kingdom to be unlawful. However, the Court still accepted and considered the illegally obtained evidence. It is interesting to note that the line of defence used by the British government approximates to the one that could be used by a State for the illegal seizure of computer evidence, as discussed above. It is likely that the Court’s position will remain unchanged in a case involving a similar seizure of evidence, and that therefore the wrongfulness of those actions would not be precluded.\nThis point is very important because a significant amount of evidence, digital or otherwise, provided by States regarding a cyber operation, could be acquired illegally. With respect to digital evidence, it has already been shown that collection from servers under the jurisdiction of other States (without their consent) may constitute an internationally wrongful act. States could also present evidence collected more or less lawfully by their intelligence services. If espionage is not unlawful under international law, it may give rise to conduct violating certain norms of international law, in particular the territorial sovereignty of the targeted State or the principle of non-intervention.⁴³ The hack of Sony Pictures Entertainment in 2014 is a good illustration. As seen earlier, the United States attributed this cyber operation to North Korea without publicly presenting evidence supporting their accusation. This lack of evidence could be explained by the fact that the United States was able to identify North Korea as responsible for the cyber operation through the surveillance of North Korean networks by the National Security Agency (NSA).⁴⁴ In other words, the attribution was made possible not by technical evidence collected after the cyber operation, but rather by collecting information on North Korean activities conducted prior to the cyber operation concerned. This collection of ⁴² Corfu Channel (Merits) (n 41) 34–35.\n⁴³ Fabien Lafouasse, L’espionnage dans le droit international (Nouveau monde 2012).\n⁴⁴ David E Sanger and Martin Fackler, ‘N.S.A. Breached North Korean Networks before Sony Attack, Officials Say’, The New York Times (18 January 2015) www.nytimes.com/2015/01/19/world/asia/nsa-tapped-into-north-korean-networks-before-sony-attack-officials-say.html.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press EXPERT OPINION EVIDENCE\n\n## 3.4 Expert Opinion Evidence\nWhile ‘evidence’ generally refers to documentary evidence, the importance of expert opinions, especially in disputes involving technical or scientific evidence, should not be underestimated.⁴⁵\nThere is no universally accepted definition of an expert in the context of an international court or tribunal. In this sense, neither the Statute nor the Rules of Court clarify who may be called as an expert in a case before the ICJ. A definition can be found in the Agreement between the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea and the Federal Republic of Germany regarding the Headquarters of the Tribunal, which states that an ‘expert’ is ‘a person called at the instance of a party to a dispute or at the instance of the Tribunal to present testimony in the form of expert opinions, based on special knowledge, skills, experience or training’ (Article 1(l)).\nIn a dispute related to a cyber operation, it is essential to involve experts for two main reasons. Firstly, it is possible that neither the judges nor counsel have the requisite knowledge to understand the technical details of the dispute. Secondly, it is essential that the computer evidence provided by the parties be analysed by qualified experts who can attest to its authenticity and provide the relevant analysis.\nIn a case before the ICJ, experts can be involved in four different ways: they may be appointed by the parties; the judges may consult them in an informal manner; or decide to involve them in the proceedings; and finally, it is possible for the judges to appoint assessors who sit in on the proceedings but do not have the right to vote.\n## 3.4.1 Experts Appointed by the Parties\nMost of the computer-based evidence that may be collected and presented in relation to a cyber operation should be collected and analysed by experts to ensure that it is authentic and to establish the facts in the\n⁴⁵ Giorgio Gaja, ‘Assessing Expert Evidence in the ICJ’ (2017) 15 The Law &amp; Practice of International Courts and Tribunals 409, *passim*; Malintoppi (n 27) 430–434.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTHE QUESTION OF EVIDENCE\nmost accurate manner. Consequently, States wishing to collect such evidence will have recourse to experts generally available within the State's computer-security services or through the contracting of private cybersecurity companies. For example, the Democratic Party decided to use the private company CrowdStrike to analyse the hack that it suffered in 2016, and it was on the basis of the evidence gathered by that company that US authorities attributed the cyber operation to Russian intelligence services.\nBeyond the investigation, and the process of gathering and analysing evidence, it is essential that experts are involved in the presentation of evidence, especially in the event of a judicial proceeding. Indeed, their participation and their explanations render such evidence intelligible to people who are not familiar with computer science. Their participation in judicial proceedings also permits an adversarial dialogue between the experts of the two parties.\n## 3.4.2 'Invisible' Experts Consulted by the Court\nThe ICJ, like other international jurisdictions, has to deal with disputes involving an important technical dimension requiring some specific expertise. This is especially the case for border disputes. The subject has been analysed by Robert Yewdall Jennings, who notes that:\nthe Court has not infrequently employed cartographers, hydrographers, geographers, linguists, and even specialised legal experts to assist in the understanding of the issue in a case before it; and has not on the whole felt any need to make this public knowledge or even to apprise the parties.^[46]^\nIn some cases involving a strong technical dimension, the judges of the ICJ have consulted informal experts to assist them, but these experts were not officially involved in the proceedings. Generally, such experts act as temporary members of the Registry of the Court and their findings are not communicated to the parties or made public.^[47]^\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nEXPERT OPINION EVIDENCE\n\nWhile such consultation of ‘invisible’ experts may be pardonable if the input they provide relates to the scientific margins of a case, the situation is quite different in complex scientific disputes, as is the case here. Under circumstances such as in the present case, adopting such a practice would deprive the Court of the above-mentioned advantages of transparency, openness, procedural fairness, and the ability for the Parties to comment upon or otherwise assist the Court in understanding the evidence before it. These are concerns based not purely on abstract principle, but on the good administration of justice.⁵⁰ A distinction should be drawn between situations in which invisible experts are consulted on technical issues relevant – but not decisive – to the case, and situations in which they may critically influence the outcome of the case.⁵¹ However, this distinction has not yet been made.\nThe distinction proposed above would be particularly relevant in a dispute relating to a cyber operation. Judges may have recourse to invisible experts to assist them in their understanding of the functioning of the Internet and relevant computer systems, specifically to help them in developing a general knowledge of the subject matter of the dispute. Conversely, it would be desirable for matters related to the evidence provided by the parties, as well as technical problems specifically related to the case, to be dealt with by experts appointed by the Court and taking part in the proceedings. In such cases, as developed below, expert opinions are communicated to the parties who can then comment on them. This would be particularly relevant and important for disputes regarding cyber operations, as the proceedings may involve a large amount of technical evidence, the assessment of which by experts may be crucial.\n⁴⁸ The expression ‘experts fantômes’ is borrowed from Judges Awn Shawkat Al-Khasawneh and Bruno Simma: Joint Dissenting Opinion, Judges Al-Khasawneh and Simma in *Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay* (Argentina v. Uruguay) (Judgment) [2010] ICJ Reports 14, 114.\n⁴⁹ Lucas Carlos Lima, ‘Expert Advisor or Non-voting Adjudicator? The Potential Function of Assessors in the Procedure of the International Court of Justice’ (2016) 99 Rivista di diritto internazionale 1123, 1134; James Gerard Devaney, *Fact-Finding before the International Court of Justice* 83–88.\n⁵⁰ Joint Dissenting Opinion, Judges Al-Khasawneh and Simma in *Pulp Mills* (Judgment) (n 48) 114.\n⁵¹ Gaja (n 45) 414.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press THE QUESTION OF EVIDENCE ## 3.4.3 Experts Appointed by the Court In a case before the ICJ, it is possible for judges to appoint experts.^[52]^ This possibility is provided for in Article 50 of the Statute of the Court, which states that '[t]he Court may, at any time, entrust any individual, body, bureau, commission, or other organisation that it may select, with the task of carrying out an enquiry or giving an expert opinion'. Article 67 of the Rules of Court clarifies the position regarding the appointment of experts by judges: Thus, unlike invisible experts, these experts are officially appointed by the Court and their findings are made public, thereby permitting the parties to submit observations.\nThe Court has appointed experts in a very limited number of cases,^[53]^ as Lucas Carlos Lima points out: Experts ex curia were appointed by the ICJ in only three cases. In the Corfu Channel (United Kingdom v. Albania) case, the Court nominated three naval experts, who conducted a site visit and subsequently presented a report which the parties had the opportunity to comment upon. In the case of the Delimitation of the Maritime Boundary in the Gulf of Maine Area (Canada/United States of America), the Chamber of the Court appointed a naval expert to assist in the delimitation of the boundary between the two countries and his technical report was attached to the judgment. In the Maritime Delimitation in the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua), the Court appointed two experts ^[52]^ This is also possible before other international courts and tribunals: Louis Savadogo, 'Le recours des juridictions internationales à des experts' (2004) 50 Annuaire français de droit international 231, 233.\n^[53]^ Devaney (n 49) 20–23.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press EXPERT OPINION EVIDENCE A number of scholars and ICJ judges have expressed their support for the use of Court-appointed experts, particularly in the context of litigation involving a critical technical dimension.⁵⁵ The use of Court-appointed experts, to analyse technical arguments presented by the parties to a dispute relating to a cyber operation, would have the advantage of providing the judges with an objective analysis of the evidence and allow them to concentrate on the legal issues.\n## 3.4.4 Assessors Appointed by the Court ICJ judges may appoint assessors, who may sit with the Court but do not have the right to vote. This possibility is opened by Article 30(2) of the Statute of the Court, according to which ‘[t]he Rules of the Court may provide for assessors to sit with the Court or with any of its chambers, without the right to vote’. This provision is clarified by Article 9 of the Rules of Court, which provides that this possibility is available in contentious and advisory cases and that these assessors ‘shall be appointed by secret ballot and by a majority of the votes of the judges composing the Court for the case’. Neither the Statute nor the Rules of the Court specify whether the State Parties are to be involved in the procedure for appointing assessors.\nAs Giorgio Gaja points out, no assessor has ever been appointed in a case before the ICJ.⁵⁶ He argues that there are two reasons for this: firstly, even if they do not have the right to vote, the assessors could be seen as wielding too much influence over the decision of the judges; secondly, the parties and their experts would not be informed and thus they would not be able to comment on the opinions expressed by the assessors.\nIn most disputes regarding cyber operations, which may be brought before the ICJ, the technical expertise provided by the experts appointed by the parties or by the Court would probably be sufficient, and it would ⁵⁴ Lima (n 49) 1131. The three cases he is referring to are: Corfu Channel (Merits) (n 41); Delimitation of the Maritime Boundary in the Gulf of Maine Area (Canada/United States of America) (Judgment) [1984] ICJ Reports 246; Territorial and Maritime Dispute between Nicaragua and Honduras in the Caribbean Sea (Nicaragua v. Honduras) (Judgment) [2007] ICJ Reports 659.\n⁵⁵ Devaney (n 49) 218, 230–240.\n⁵⁶ Gaja (n 45) 418; see also Lima (n 49) 1124, 1130.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press THE QUESTION OF EVIDENCE therefore not be necessary for assessors to assist judges in the decision-making process.\n## 3.5 Concluding Remarks on the Question of Evidence This chapter analysed the question of evidence in relation to a dispute regarding cyber operations. Such disputes may involve a significant amount of highly technical evidence, the collection and assessment of which by the parties and by the judges, in the case of judicial proceedings, may be challenging. Conversely, the presentation of technical evidence relating to cyber operations is not particularly challenging, as most of it may be easily presented as documentary evidence.\nStates could, however, be reluctant to make such evidence public during judicial proceedings. Firstly, from the point of view of the State, by revealing the collected evidence, it is likely to give indications about its computing capabilities. Secondly, by publicly disclosing information about a cyber operation, there is a risk that the vulnerabilities exploited by this cyber operation would be taken advantage of by other actors to perpetrate cyber operations. This has been demonstrated by WannaCry and the wave of cyber operations that affected a large number of people, institutions and businesses in May 2017. EternalBlue, the vulnerability exploited by some cyber operations and revealed in the summer of 2016, was obtained from the NSA through a hack by the Shadow Brokers. Microsoft had released a fix for this vulnerability, but it seems that https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press CONCLUDING REMARKS The establishment of the facts and the attribution of a cyber operation carry an important technical dimension, but it would be a mistake to reduce them merely to technical processes. It is therefore essential that, alongside the technical experts, experts from other disciplines with a good understanding of the functioning of cyberspace and cyber operations are involved in these processes, and potentially involved in judicial proceedings. Indeed, these experts would help to bridge the technical and legal dimensions of the dispute. This is also the aim of the present chapter, which bridges the technical dimension of attribution analysed in the previous chapter and the legal dimension of attribution studied in the next.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press"
