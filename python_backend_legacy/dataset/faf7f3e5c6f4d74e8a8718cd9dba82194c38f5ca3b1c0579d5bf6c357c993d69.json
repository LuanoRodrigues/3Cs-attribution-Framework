Helal\nAssociate Professor of Law, The Ohio State University, Columbus, The United States of America; Member, Permanent Court of Arbitration; Member, African Union Commission on International Law (AUCIL); Special Rapporteur of the African Union on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis article explores debates among States on the application of the prohibition on intervention in cyberspace. It focuses on coercion as an element of the prohibition on intervention and identifies the different definitions of coercion that States have adopted in national and regional position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace. This article also specifically discusses the views of States on the threshold of coercion, which is the degree of harm or the effects that the conduct of a State must cause (or threaten to cause) to amount to a violation of the prohibition on intervention. This article argues that the definitions and thresholds of coercion that States have adopted in debates on the application of international law in cyberspace should be viewed as proposals for the development of the law in this area, as opposed to restatements of established law. Instead, this article proposes that all forms of intervention should be governed by a ‘unified threshold of coercion’ that applies to both forcible and non-forcible intervention.\n\n## Keywords\n\nprohibition on intervention – cyberspace – coercion – prohibition on the threat or use of force\n\n© KONINKLIJKE BRILL BV, LEIDEN, 2024 | DOI:10.1163/18757413_02701019",

States from every region and from every political bloc have accused their adversaries (and sometimes even their allies) of intervening in their affairs.[8]\n\nIn recent years, there has been a growing interest among States and scholars in the principle of non-intervention. One reason is that cyberspace has become a domain of conflict and competition. Information and communication technologies (ICTs) are being used both as weapons of war and as instruments of non-forcible intervention.[9] States, state-sponsored non-State actors, and non-State groups and individuals acting independently have employed ICTs against foreign States, citizens, and companies to achieve various political, economic, criminal, scientific, and financial objectives. ICTs have been used to disrupt critical infrastructure, spread disinformation and propaganda to sow social discord, interfere in elections, acquire industrial and trade secrets, steal scientific research and intellectual property, and to gain profit through activities such as ransomware attacks. As a result, there is a growing corpus of state practice and expressions of opinio juris, in addition to a sizable body of scholarship, on how the prohibition on intervention applies in cyberspace. This article engages with these discussions.\n\nSpecifically, this article has two objectives.

These position papers were issued, at least partially, in response to calls by the UN Open-Ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (OEWG) for States to express their opinions on how international law applies in cyberspace.¹² The OEWG is one of the two principal forums in which discussions at the UN on the regulation of cyberspace are conducted, the other being the UN Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security (GGE).¹³\n\nIn addition to being of interest to scholars who specialize in the regulation of cyberspace, these national and regional position papers also deserve special attention from generalist scholars of international law. Most of these position papers are not framed as expressions of State views on *lex specialis* that apply only in cyberspace. Rather, they contain detailed statements on the scope and content of a wide range of *lex generalis* followed by discussions on how these rules of general international law apply in cyberspace. This makes these position papers a rich source of *opinio juris* on various primary and secondary rules\n\n¹¹ p. 11 A.

Some of the rules covered by these position papers include sovereignty, the prohibition on the threat or use of force, the peaceful settlement of disputes, human rights, the laws of armed conflict, the rules of attribution, and of course, the prohibition on intervention, which is the subject of this article.\n\nExamining these national and regional position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace reveals that, while the prohibition on intervention is accepted as a rule of general international law, there remains considerable uncertainty regarding the exact scope and content of this rule. In particular, there are notable differences among States on the definition of coercion. Some States have defined coercion as conduct that modifies the behavior of a State by causing it to act involuntarily or by compelling it to act in a manner that it would not have voluntarily engaged in but for the coercive conduct of a foreign State. Other States have defined coercion as conduct that deprives a State of its freedom of choice or control over matters within its domestic jurisdiction. A third and broader approach, which was adopted by the African Union, defines coercion as any conduct that imposes restraints on the will of a foreign State.\n\nIn addition to articulating theoretical definitions of coercion, some States provided examples of conduct that, in their view, amounted to coercion. These examples shed further light on how the concept of coercion applies to real-world situations in which ICTs are used as instruments of statecraft. In particular, these examples clarify the views of States on the threshold of effects or the degree of pressure that a State must be subjected to in order for conduct to be considered coercive. As I show below, there is currently no consensus among States on the effects that the conduct of the coercing State must have on the coerced State to constitute an act of unlawful intervention. Some States adopted relatively high thresholds that require the conduct in question to have significant effects on the coerced State. For example, for some States, merely seeking to sway public opinion during an election campaign does not necessarily amount to unlawful intervention. Rather, to those States, electoral interference must rise to the level of altering election results or preventing a segment of the population from voting in order to constitute an act of intervention.[14] On the other hand, other States adopted lower thresholds to determine when\n\n14 See for example P.

For example, one State noted that 'hack and leak' operations to influence public opinion could constitute a violation of the prohibition on intervention.¹⁵ The African Union also adopted a relatively low threshold of coercion that does not require the behavior of a foreign State to have significant effects on a State in order to amount to unlawful intervention.\n\nIn short, national and regional position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace indicate that there are divergences among States on how the prohibition on intervention governs state conduct in cyberspace. There is no agreement on a theoretical definition of coercion, there is no consensus on the threshold of effects that determines when specific state conduct that is designed to influence the behavior of other States constitutes coercion, and there is some uncertainty on how non-intervention relates to other rules such as the prohibition on the threat or use of force and the obligation to respect the territorial sovereignty of States.\n\nHaving catalogued the views that States have, heretofore, expressed on non-intervention and coercion in cyberspace, the second objective of this article is to critically appraise the understandings of coercion that States have adopted in their national and regional position papers. Specifically, this article makes the following two arguments.\n\nFirst, this article contends that – as a matter of formal law – the positions expressed by States on the meaning of coercion should be viewed as proposals de lege ferenda, and not as restatements of established lex lata. This is because, as I explain below, nothing in the history of the development of the prohibition of intervention lends support to the definitions of coercion that States have espoused.

Then, building on decades of advocacy principally by non-aligned States, the prohibition on intervention became a rule of general international law with the adoption of the 1970 Friendly Relations Declaration. However, at no point during the evolution of the prohibition on intervention did States define coercion as conduct that causes a State to behave involuntarily or that deprives a State of its freedom of choice or control over matters within its domestic jurisdiction. Indeed, the history of the development of this rule indicates that States never even conceived of coercion as the conceptual cornerstone of non-intervention.\n\nSecond, this article argues that the definitions of coercion adopted by some States are conceptually flawed. Echoing the ICJ's judgment in the Nicaragua Case,¹⁶ virtually all States agree that the prohibition on intervention proscribes coercion whether undertaken through armed force or through non-forcible means, such as economic or political instruments of statecraft. Many States also underscored that the use of armed force is the gravest form of intervention. Yet – paradoxically – applying the definitions of coercion espoused by many (especially Western) States would lead to a situation where the gravest form of intervention – armed force – is governed by a lower threshold than non-forcible forms of intervention that are considered less grave.\n\nAs discussed below, nothing in *jus ad bellum* requires an act that amounts to armed intervention to be of such gravity that it causes a State to behave involuntarily or deprives it of control over matters within its domestic jurisdiction, which are the definitions of coercion adopted by some States. Indeed, attacking a single military unit could constitute a violation of the prohibition on the threat or use of force and could even amount to an armed attack,¹⁷ regardless of its effect on the behavior of the target State. On the other hand, applying the definitions of coercion adopted by some States would require non-forcible forms of intervention to reach a level of gravity and intensity that causes (or threatens to cause) a State to act involuntarily or that deprives it of freedom of choice. As I explain below, these definitions entail an unreasonably high\n\n¹⁶ Nicaragua v. USA, at para. 215 ('Intervention is wrongful when it uses methods of coercion in regard to such choices, which must remain free ones. The element of coercion, which defines, and indeed forms the very essence of, prohibited intervention, is particularly obvious in the case of an intervention which uses force, either in the direct form of military action, or in the indirect form of support for subversive or terrorist armed activities within another State').\n\n¹⁷ As the ICJ noted in the *Oil Platforms Case*, '[t]he Court does not exclude the possibility that the mining of a single military vessel might be sufficient to bring into play the \"inherent right of self-defence\". *Oil Platforms* (Islamic Republic of Iran v.

Based on this approach, non-forcible conduct would be considered coercive if its impact is comparable to the scale and effects of conduct that amounts to a violation of the threat or use of force.

Three approaches to defining coercion have appeared in these position papers.\n\n## 2.1 Coercion as Conduct that Modifies the Behavior of a State\n\nThe first approach defines coercion as conduct that compels a State to modify its behavior. Among the States that adopted this approach, there were slight variations in the exact definition of coercion that those States formulated. Some States defined coercion as acts that aim to compel a State to act involuntarily. Estonia's position paper expressed this view. It stated:\n\nWhen discussing if a cyber operation constitutes an unlawful intervention into the external or internal affairs of another state, the element of coercion is a key factor [...] Stemming from that, cyber operations that aim to force another nation to act in an involuntary manner or to refrain from acting in a certain manner, and target the other nation's domaine réservé (e.g., national democratic processes such as elections, or military, security or critical infrastructure systems) could constitute such an intervention.²³\n\nAustria's national statement was similar to Estonia's. It stated: '[c]oercion occurs when a state seeks to compel another state to change its behaviour with respect to its internal or external affairs, i.e. to force that state to act in an involuntary manner or involuntarily refrain from acting in a particular way'.²⁴ Some States that adopted this understanding of coercion also included a 'but for' test in their definition of coercion. According to those States, an act would be coercive if it aimed at compelling a State to behave in a manner that it would not otherwise have engaged in voluntarily. Norway's position paper expressed this view:\n\ncoercion, and thus of unauthorized intervention, has not yet fully crystallized in international law [...] there is no clear definition of the element of coercion').\n\n²³ UNGA, 'Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions', at 25.\n\n²⁴ Austrian Government, 'Position Paper of the Republic of Austria: Cyber Activities and International Law' (April 2024), available at <https: docs-library.unoda.org=\"\" open-ended_working_group_on_information_and_communication_technologies_-_(2021)=\"\" open-end_working_group_on_information_and_communication_technologies_-_(2021)=\"\" /austrian_position_Paper_-_cyber_activities_and_international_law_(final_23.04.2024).pdf=\"\">, at 5.</https:>",

A cyber operation must therefore not be carried out to compel the target State to take a course of action, whether by act or omission, in a way that it would not otherwise voluntarily have pursued (coercion) in matters relating to its internal or external affairs (domaine réservé).25\n\nThe Netherlands adopted a similar position. It defined coercion as an act 'compelling a state to take a course of action (whether an act or an omission) that it would not otherwise voluntarily pursue. The goal of the intervention must be to effect change in the behavior of the target state'.26 Denmark also defined coercion as an act that 'has a potential for compelling the target state to engage in an action that it would otherwise not take'.27 Switzerland and Poland also used similar terms. To Switzerland, coercion is conduct that 'seeks to cause another to act (or refrain from acting) in a way it would not otherwise',28 and Poland stated that coercion 'aims at influencing the state's decisions belonging to its domaine réservé', and added that cyberoperations 'potentially leading to the state's conduct that would not occur otherwise, may be considered a prohibited intervention'.29\n\nOther States that understood coercion as conduct that is designed to modify the behavior of another State used relatively generic terms to define coercion. Romania, for example, defined coercion simply as an act the purpose of which is to 'effectively change the behavior of the target state'.30 Israel's Deputy Attorney General also opined that coercion 'has been taken to mean that State A cannot take actions to \"coerce\" State B in pursuing a course of action, or refraining from a course of action, in matters pertaining to State B's core internal affairs'.31 Singapore's national statement defined coercion in similar terms.

It asserted that 'a State employs coercive means to compel another State to undertake or desist from a specific action, in matters falling under its domain réserve'.33 In other words, for these States, an act is coercive simply if it is intended to cause another State to change its behavior. These States did not, however, explicitly include a requirement that the conduct in question must compel a State to act involuntarily or force it to engage in behavior that it would not have engaged in voluntarily but-for the coercive conduct of a foreign State.\n\nGermany adopted a generally similar understanding of coercion. Although it did not refer to modifying the behavior of a State or causing it to act involuntarily, Germany described coercion as the exercise of a certain level of pressure that has a significant impact on the decision-making process of a State to the extent that it manipulates or undermines the will of the State. Germany's position paper stated the following:\n\nGenerally, Germany is of the opinion that cyber measures may constitute a prohibited intervention under international law if they are comparable in scale and effects to coercion in non-cyber contexts.\n\nCoercion implies that a State's internal processes regarding aspects pertaining to its domaine réservé are significantly influenced or thwarted and that its will is manifestly bent by the foreign State's conduct. However, as is widely accepted, the element of coercion must not be assumed prematurely. Even harsher forms of communication such as pointed commentary and sharp criticism as well as (persistent) attempts to obtain, through discussion, a certain reaction or the performance of a certain measure from another State do not as such qualify as coercion. Moreover, the acting State must intend to intervene in the internal affairs of the target State – otherwise the scope of the non-intervention principle would be unduly broad.34\n\nDespite these variations in the exact formulation of these definitions, these understandings of coercion share the common characteristic of focusing on\n\n32 UNGA, ‘Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions’, at 83.\n\n33 Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, ‘Italian Position Paper on “International Law and Cyberspace”’ (2021), available at <https: 11=\"\" doc=\"\" italian_position_paper_on_international_law_and_cyberspace.pdf=\"\" machine=\"\" research=\"\" www.esteri.it=\"\" 2021=\"\">, at 4–5.\n\n34 UNGA, ‘Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions’, at 34.</https:>",

Marko Milanovic calls this the extortion model of coercion. 'These definitions point to undermining the victim state's will as the essence of coercion (\"involuntary,\" \"voluntary\"), so as to effect a change in its behavior'.35\n\nSeveral States that adopted this definition of coercion also provided examples of conduct that, in their view, amounted to intervention. As noted above in the introduction to this article, these examples provide greater clarity on how States operationalize and apply the definitions of coercion that they adopted. In its position paper, Finland position paper identified the following forms of coercion:\n\n[W]hile the conduct of elections belongs undisputedly to the internal affairs of each State, all methods of electoral interference do not display the element of coercion. Hacking of voter databases or manipulation of vote counts in order to alter the election results has nevertheless been recognized as a fairly clear case. To be comparable to a real world intervention, cyber interference must also be of a serious nature [...] Military or economic pressure may also qualify as coercion. Hostile cyber interference done with the purpose of promoting or supporting armed action in another State could constitute an example of prohibited intervention, provided that it seeks to force a certain policy change.[36]\n\nDenmark's position paper provided similar examples of coercive intervention:\n\nAs emphasized by the Court in the Nicaragua judgment coercive acts involving the use of force are particularly obvious examples of unlawful interventions. Denmark considers that coercion is not limited to means of direct or indirect use of force and that also measures below this threshold may constitute coercion. Cyber activities that do not amount to use of force can therefore also be coercive.\n\nAn example of unlawful intervention in the cyber domain could be where a State coercively interferes in the internal political process of another.

In addition to tampering with election systems to alter the results of an election, Norway stated:\n\n[C]arrying out cyber operations with the intent of altering election results in another State, for example by manipulating election systems or unduly influencing public opinion through the dissemination of confidential information obtained through cyber operations ('hack and leak'), would be in violation of the prohibition of intervention.

Italy noted that the prohibition on intervention required further study, especially ‘with regard to influence activities aimed, for instance, at undermining a State’s ability to safeguard public health during a pandemic, or at manipulating voting behavior’.41 Singapore also stated that ‘non-exhaustive examples’ of violations of the prohibition on intervention include ‘interference in Singapore’s electoral processes through cyber means, or cyber-attacks against our infrastructure’.42 Similarly, Switzerland noted that establishing whether a cyberoperation amounted to an act of intervention should be determined on a case-by-case basis, especially in situations of ‘economic coercion, which could be the case if a company that is systemically relevant was paralyzed through a cyber operation’.43\n\n## 2.2 Coercion as Conduct that Deprives a State of Freedom of Choice or Control\n\nThe second understanding of coercion that has emerged out of national position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace defines coercion as an act that deprives a State of its ability to control or to exercise freedom of choice regarding matters within its domaine réservé.

Its position paper stated: ‘[c]oercive means are those that effectively deprive or are intended to deprive the State of the ability to control, decide upon or govern matters of an inherently sovereign nature’.44 In order to establish that a breach of the prohibition on intervention has indeed occurred, Australia required evidence that the conduct of the coercing State had some measurable impact or discernable effect on the target State.45 Canada expressed a similar position. Its position paper explained that a cyberoperation would be coercive if it is ‘designed to deprive the affected State of its freedom of choice’.46 Canada also noted that, in order to amount to an act of\n\n41 Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, ‘Italian Position Paper on “International Law and Cyberspace”’.\n\n42 UNGA, ‘Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions’, at 83.\n\n43 Ibid., at 88.\n\n44 Ibid., at 5.\n\n45 Ibid., at 5.

The Czech Republic defined coercion in similar terms. It stated:\n\nCoercion is an activity intended to deprive, either directly or indirectly, the State of its ability to exercise control or govern matters within its internal and external affairs [...] The difference between actions that violate sovereignty and actions that violate the prohibition of intervention is that the latter is coercive, i.e., intentionally aims to influence the State's free will and choice.49\n\nBrazil, Costa Rica, and the UK also adopted similar definitions of coercion. The UK Attorney General said the following about coercion:\n\nSome have characterized coercion as forcing a State to act differently from how it otherwise would – that is, compelling it into a specific act or omission. Imagine, for example, a cyber operation to delay another State's election, or to prevent it from distributing tax revenues to fund essential services. To my mind, these are certainly forms of coercion.\n\nBut I want to be clear today that coercion can be broader than this.

It stated that coercion can occur in a 'multitude of ways where one State, directly or indirectly through support for non-State actors, deprives another State of the capacity to make free and informed choices pertaining to its internal affairs'.⁵¹ Like the UK, Costa Rica used the word deprives, but it did not use the word control in relation to matters within its domaine réservé. Rather, it referred to the capacity of a State to make free and informed choices. Brazil used different terminology. Instead of referring to depriving a State its ability to freely decide on matters within its domaine réservé, Brazil stated that, to constitute intervention, a cyberoperation 'against another State must involve an element of coercion affecting the right of the victim State to freely choose its political, economic, social and cultural system, and to formulate its foreign policy'.⁵²\n\nMarko Milanovic calls this the control model of coercion:\n\nCoercion-as-control does not work by influencing the decision-making calculus of the coerced state.

Nonetheless, it can also occur in a multitude of ways where one State, directly or indirectly through support for non-State actors, deprives another State of the capacity to make free and informed choices pertaining to its internal or external affairs. Coercion may occur when a State provides financial or other forms of support to secessionist, subversive or violent groups in the territory of another State, when it exercises significant political or economic pressure on another State, or when it engages in or supports subversive or hostile propaganda or the dissemination of false news that interfere in the internal or external affairs of another State [...]\n\nA prominent example of a breach of non-intervention are ransomware attacks crippling or simply interfering with a State's ability to run public services, such as finance, education, and social security.

Other types of disinformation, such as those affecting a State's health policies, may also amount to a prohibited intervention. Posts inciting individuals or other States to wage wars of aggression or to disrupt or subvert the internal order of another State may likewise breach the principle of non-intervention.57\n\nThe UK also provided a wide range of examples of acts of coercion. It identified forms of intervention that affected four areas of state policy: 'energy security; essential medical care; economic stability; and democratic processes'.58 In relation to 'essential energy supplies' 'essential medical services' and 'economic stability' the UK listed the following cyberoperations as potentially breaching the prohibition on intervention:\n\n[D]isruption of systems controlling emergency medical transport (e.g., telephone dispatchers); causing hospital computer systems to cease functioning; disruption of supply chains for essential medicines and vaccines; preventing the supply of power to housing, healthcare, education, civil administration and banking facilities and infrastructure; causing the energy supply chain to stop functioning at national level through damage or prevention of access to pipelines, interchanges, and depots; or preventing the operation of power generation infrastructure.\n\nTurning to economic stability, covert cyber operations by a foreign State that coercively interfere with a State's freedom to manage its domestic economy, or to ensure provision of domestic financial services crucial to the State's financial system, would breach the rule on non-intervention. Such cyber operations could include disruption to the networks controlling a State's fundamental ability to conduct monetary policy or to raise and distribute revenue, for instance through taxation. Or disruption to systems which support lending, saving and insurance across the economy.59\n\nIn relation to democratic processes, the UK noted that 'covert cyber operations by a foreign State which coercively interfere with free and fair electoral processes would constitute a prohibited intervention'.

Assessing whether the use by one or more States of ICTs in cyberspace to influence the conduct of a foreign State amounts to coercion is a determination that should be undertaken on a case-by-case basis'.63 The Common African Position also stated the following:\n\nWhile the definition of coercion in this context requires further study and deliberation between States, the African Union is of the view that it is not necessary, in order to constitute coercion, that the conduct of a State must rise to the level of completely depriving a foreign State of its freedom of choice or to compel that State to either act or refrain from acting involuntarily. Coercion may also occur through threats of intervention. Furthermore, there is no requirement that, in order to constitute a violation of the prohibition on intervention, an act of coercion must actually succeed in compelling the State subjected to such acts to change its conduct.

The Common African Position defined coercion as conduct that ‘impose[s] restraints on the will of a foreign State’. This is broadly analogous to the notion of impinging on the freedom of choice of States, which is central to the coercion-as-control model. However, the Common African Position also indicates that the purpose of intervention is to ‘influence the conduct of a foreign State’. This echoes definitions that understand coercion as conduct that aims at modifying the behavior of a State by subverting, manipulating, or undermining its decision-making processes.\n\nCompared to other definitions of coercion, however, the Common African Position was purposively designed to broaden the protective scope of the prohibition on intervention. It does so by adopting a lower threshold of (actual or threatened) effects that must be crossed for conduct to amount to coercion. This is clearly expressed in the following sentence: ‘the African Union is of the view that it is not necessary, in order to constitute coercion, that the conduct of a State must rise to the level of completely depriving a foreign State of its freedom of choice or to compel that State to either act or refrain from acting involuntarily’.⁶⁵\n\nIn other words, the principal point of divergence between the Common African Position and the positions of other States relates to the threshold of coercion. For the member States of the African Union, intervention is any conduct undertaken by a State that imposes restraints on another State in relation to matters within its domestic jurisdiction. However, those restraints need not be of such severity that they cause a State to act involuntarily nor do they need to reach a level of intensity that completely deprives that State of its freedom of choice or control over matters within its domestic jurisdiction.\n\nIt is notable that, in an initial draft of the Common African Position that this author had prepared while serving as the African Union Special Rapporteur on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace, coercion was defined in the following terms: ‘coercion, in the context of the prohibition on intervention, should be defined as a policy that is designed to impose material restraints on the will of a foreign State’.

The member States determined that the word 'restraints' sufficiently and accurately captured the essence of the prohibition on intervention. Many States described non-intervention as a rule that is intended to protect the policy autonomy of States and to enable States to manage their internal and external affairs free from 'restraints' that might be imposed by other States. The AU member States also agreed that, when read in the context of the entire section on non-intervention in the Common African Position, the prohibition on intervention was not over-inclusive.\n\n## 2.4 The Element of Intent\n\nMany States also included the element of the intent in their definitions of coercion. New Zealand articulated this element unambiguously. Its position paper affirmed that the 'coercive intention of the state actor is a critical element of the rule' and underscored that 'intention may in some circumstances be inferred from the effects of cyber activity'.⁶⁸ Similarly, Costa Rica's position paper noted that '[f]or such breaches [of the prohibition on intervention] to occur, it suffices that a State intends to coerce another State, employs coercive methods, or eventually causes coercive effects in another State'.⁶⁹ Czechia's position paper used similar terms.

For instance, Norway stated that holding elections is an example of an activity that falls within the *domaine réservé* of a State. Therefore, according to Norway, 'carrying out cyber operations with the intent of altering election results in another State' would violate the prohibition on intervention.[71] Furthermore, Canada,[72] Denmark,[73] and the US,[74] understood coercion as conduct that is *designed* to achieve a specific purpose or effect (such as modifying the behavior of the target State). As noted above, the Common African Position also understood coercion as conduct that is *'designed* to impose restraints on the will of a foreign State'. The use of the term *'designed'* by these position papers introduces the element of intent into the definition of coercion. It indicates that the coercing State is acting purposefully and intentionally and employing its resources in a systematic and strategic manner to achieve specific policy objectives.\n\nOther States used similar phrases that also make the intent of the coercing State an element of the definition of coercion. The Netherlands $^{75}$ and Romania $^{76}$ defined coercion as conduct *'the goal'* of which is changing the behavior of the target State. Likewise, Estonia and Poland described coercion as conduct that *'aimed'* at achieving a specific objective.

It indicates that the coercing State has identified a policy objective – an aim or a goal – which it is seeking to achieve by engaging in cyberoperations against another State.\n\n## 2.5 Sovereignty, Intervention, and the Use of Force: Demarcating the Doctrinal Boundaries\n\nIn addition to articulating definitions of coercion and offering examples of conduct that amounts to coercion, many States addressed the question of the relation between, on one hand, the prohibition on intervention and, on the other, the obligation to respect the territorial sovereignty of States and the prohibition on the threat or use of force. The content and scope of application of these three rules overlap significantly. As the ICJ observed in the Nicaragua Case, '[t]he effects of the principle of respect for territorial sovereignty inevitably overlap with those of the principles of the prohibition of the use of force and of non-intervention'.79\n\nTo disentangle the interconnection between these three rules, many States expressed views on the threshold of effects that must be crossed for conduct to amount to a violation of each of these rules. Surveying national and regional position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace reveals that States have approached this question from three different angles. The first relates to categories of conduct that – by their very nature – do not constitute a breach of the prohibition on intervention because they fall below the threshold of coercion. Nonetheless, some States noted that conduct that does not amount to intervention because it falls below the threshold of coercion may still be wrongful because it violates the principle of state sovereignty. The second is the higher threshold of coercion, which many States identified as the point at which non-intervention intersects with the prohibition on the threat or use of force. The third relates to the threshold at which non-forcible conduct – such as information operations, election interference, or economic sanctions – amount to coercion.\n\n78 Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 'The Republic of Poland's Position on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace'.\n\n79 Nicaragua v.

Several Western States argued that practices designed to persuade a State to change its behavior or to influence its policies are lawful, even if such practices involve criticism of that State. These Western States argued that such conduct is commonplace in international relations, which means that it should not be condemned as a form of intervention.⁸⁰ This was a point of convergence among Western States regardless of the definitions of coercion they adopted.\n\nFor example, in its position paper, Czechia, which defined coercion as acts that deprive a State of control over matters within its *domaine réservé*, stated that '[m]ere influencing, criticism or persuasion do not meet the requirements to be qualified as prohibited intervention'.⁸¹ Similarly, Denmark, which defined coercion as conduct that causes a State to behave in a manner it would not have engaged in voluntarily, stated that 'a distinction must be drawn between activities that merely involve influencing, as opposed to compelling, the voluntary actions of a target State. Acts of influence, such as persuasion, criticism, and public diplomacy are insufficient to qualify as an intervention'.⁸² Germany also noted that 'harsher forms of communication such as pointed commentary and sharp criticism as well as (persistent) attempts to obtain, through discussion, a certain reaction or the performance of a certain measure from another State do not as such qualify as coercion'.⁸³ Sweden also opined that 'criticism or other ways of influencing through diplomatic means' does not qualify as coercion.⁸⁴ Likewise, Canada, which was among the States that defined coercion as depriving a State of control over its *domaine réservé*, stated that '[c]oercion must be distinguished from other conduct such as public diplomacy, criticism, persuasion, and propaganda'.⁸⁵ The UK also distinguished between coercive conduct, which is unlawful, and the freedom of States 'to make their views known about processes in other countries – delivering hard, sometimes\n\n⁸⁰ See for example: Finnish Ministry for Foreign Affairs, 'Finland's Views on International Law and Cyberspace', at 463 ('[t]he requirement of coercion leaves out lesser forms of influence and persuasion that are commonplace in international relations').\n\n⁸¹ Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 'Position Paper on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace', at para. 13.\n\n⁸² Danish Government, 'Denmark's Position Paper on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace', at 450.\n\n⁸³ UNGA, 'Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions', at 34.\n\n⁸⁴ Swedish Government Offices, 'Position Paper on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace', at 3.\n\n⁸⁵ Canadian Government, 'International Law Applicable in Cyberspace'.",

It stated: ‘offers or calls to peacefully settle disputes through negotiation, enquiry, mediation, conciliation, good offices, arbitration, and judicial settlement, and diplomatic discussions and communications are presumed not to constitute acts of coercion’.⁸⁸ The first portion of this sentence is based on Article 33 of the UN Charter. It indicates that efforts to settle disputes peacefully are not considered coercive. The second portion of this sentence – ‘diplomatic discussions and communications are presumed not to constitute acts of coercion’ – was designed to signal that diplomatic correspondences, whether written or verbal, are generally not considered coercive. The keyword here is *presumed*, which was inserted because history is replete with cases in which diplomatic communications were employed as instruments of coercion. Perhaps the most (in)famous ultimatum ever – the Austro-Hungarian ultimatum to Serbia that started World War I – was delivered via a diplomatic note.⁸⁹ Similarly, in a series of meetings that were held in 1945 and 1946 between Soviet and Turkish diplomats, the USSR attempted to coerce Turkey into redrawing the international frontier between the two States and granting the USSR access to and control over the Turkish straits.⁹⁰\n\nThis sentence in the Common African Position was also intended to signal that the member States of the African Union did not share the view adopted by Western States that other practices such as public diplomacy, criticism, propaganda, unwelcome messages and other conduct that, for instance, the UK described as ‘part and parcel of international relations’ could never be coercive.\n\nThis approach in the Common African Position is consistent with the positions expressed by African and other developing States during the negotiations on the 1970 Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning\n\n⁸⁶ Braverman, ‘International Law in Future Frontiers’.\n⁸⁷ Austrian Government, ‘Position Paper of the Republic of Austria’, at 5.\n⁸⁸ ‘Common African Position’, at para. 32.\n⁸⁹ See ‘Austria’s Ultimatum to Serbia: Full Text of the Document That Started the World War, and Serbia’s Reply to It’ (1918) 9 Current History 554–558.\n⁹⁰ O.

This is because most acts of unlawful intervention that could be undertaken through cyberspace are likely to fall below the threshold of forcible intervention. For example, activities such as election interference or disinformation campaigns will almost always fall below the threshold of the use of force.¹⁰⁸ In fact, this is precisely the area – conduct below the threshold of the use of force, but above the threshold of violations of territorial sovereignty – where the prohibition on intervention is most relevant.\n\n¹⁰⁵ Helal, ‘Common African Position’, at para. 29.\n\n¹⁰⁶ UNGA, ‘Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions’, at 18.\n\n¹⁰⁷ Costa Rican Ministry of Foreign Affairs, ‘Costa Rica’s Position on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace’, at 7.\n\n¹⁰⁸ M.

This lack of consistency is evident even among States that adopted the same definition of coercion. In other words, even where there is some convergence among States on the meaning of coercion at a theoretical level, there are notable divergences on how the concept of coercion applies in real-world situations.\n\nAmong the States that defined coercion as conduct that modifies the behavior of a State or causes it to act involuntarily, there were notable differences in the terminology used to describe the threshold that applies to non-forcible coercion. Germany contended that, to constitute an act of intervention, a cyberoperation must be 'comparable in scale and effect to coercion in non-cyber contexts'. According to Germany, to meet the threshold of coercion, a cyberoperation must have the effect of 'significantly influenc[ing] or thwart[ing]' the decision-making process of a State to the point where its 'will is manifestly bent'.[109] Although it did not specify a definite threshold that non-forcible conduct must meet to constitute an act of intervention, Switzerland noted that a cyberoperation could amount to economic coercion if it paralyzed the operation of a 'company that is systemically relevant'.[110]\n\nOn the other hand, Poland indicated that, to constitute coercion, the foreign State's conduct must 'adversely affect' the 'functioning and security of the political, economic, military or social system of a state'.[111] Norway also provided examples of non-forcible coercive conduct that included 'manipulating election systems', 'unduly influencing public opinion', and 'causing a temporary shutdown' of critical infrastructure.[112]\n\nDenmark and Romania, both of which also defined coercion as conduct that modifies the behavior of a State or causes it to act involuntarily, did not explicitly identify a specific threshold at which non-forcible conduct could be considered coercive. Instead, Romania stated that an act of intervention must be intended to 'effectively change' the behavior of a State and underscored that 'there has to be a causal nexus between the coercive act and the effect on the internal or external affairs of the target State'.[113] Denmark's position paper also stated that 'an act may be considered of a coercive nature when the act\n\n109 UNGA, 'Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions', at 34.\n110 Ibid., at 88.\n111 Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 'The Republic of Poland's Position on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace'.\n112 UNGA, 'Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions', at 68.\n113 Ibid., at 77.",

The phrase ‘significantly influencing or thwarting’ that was used by Germany and the words ‘paralysis’ and ‘systemically relevant’ that Switzerland used signify a notably higher threshold of coercion than the term ‘adverse effects’ that was used by Poland and the phrases ‘manipulating election systems’ and ‘unduly influencing public opinion’ that Norway used. Denmark appears to have adopted an even lower threshold of coercion. For Denmark, a cyberoperation need not have an actual effect on the target State to be considered wrongful under the prohibition on intervention. Rather, a cyberoperation that merely has the ‘potential for compelling’ a State crosses the threshold of coercion. On the other hand, for Romania, the ‘potential’ to compel a State is insufficient. Rather, to constitute intervention, Romania requires that a State must be the target of a cyberoperation that has a measurable effect on the coerced State and that is causally connected to the behavior of the coercing State.\n\nThere are similar inconsistencies among the States that defined coercion as conduct that deprives a State of its freedom of choice or control over its domaine réservé. Australia, New Zealand, and Canada adopted broadly similar definitions of the threshold of coercion. According to Australia, conduct is coercive if it ‘effectively deprive[s]’ or is ‘intended to deprive’ a State of control over matters of an inherently sovereign nature.¹¹⁵ As discussed above, for Australia, examples of coercion include: ‘manipulating the electoral system to alter the results of an election’ or undermining the ‘fundamental operation of Parliament’ or the ‘stability of States’ financial systems.¹¹⁶ Similarly, for New Zealand, conduct is coercive if it has ‘significant effects’ on a State’s domaine réservé.¹¹⁷ Examples of acts that meet this threshold include ‘manipulating the voting tally’ in an election, preventing a ‘significant part of the electorate’ from voting, and causing ‘significant damage’ or ‘loss of functionality’ to critical infrastructure.¹¹⁸ According to Canada, intervention is conduct that has ‘coercive\n\n¹¹⁴ Danish Government, ‘Denmark’s Position Paper on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace’, at 450.\n\n¹¹⁵ UNGA, ‘Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions’, at 5.\n\n¹¹⁶ Ibid.\n\n¹¹⁷ New Zealand Foreign Affairs and Trade, ‘The Application of International Law to State Activity in Cyberspace’, at para. 9(b).\n\n¹¹⁸ Ibid.",

Again, as noted above, for Canada, examples of coercion include influencing the outcome of an election through a cyberoperation that 'hacks and disables a State's election commission' or by 'preventing a significant number of citizens from voting', in addition to 'disrupt[ing] the functioning of a major gas pipeline' to affect a State's negotiating position.[119] Finland provided similar examples of coercion. It noted that to constitute intervention in an election, the conduct of a foreign State must 'be of a serious nature', examples of which are altering electoral results through 'hacking of voter databases or manipulation of vote'.[120]\n\nBrazil, Czechia, Costa Rica, and the UK used different terms to describe the threshold of coercion. Brazil understood coercion as conduct 'affecting the right' of a State to choose its political, economic, social and cultural system and to formulate its foreign policy.[121] Czechia stated that an act is coercive if it 'intentionally aims to influence the State's free will and choice'.[122] For Costa Rica, conduct amounts to coercion if it impinges on a State's ability to make 'free and informed choices'. As noted above, Costa Rica also provided several examples of coercive conduct. These included: 'subversive or hostile propaganda', 'dissemination of false news', 'significant political or economic pressure', 'crippling or simply interfering' with public services, 'interfering with ballots or voter databases', and 'electoral disinformation campaigns'.[123] Like Costa Rica, the UK provided a wide-range of examples of coercive conduct. These included 'disruption of systems controlling emergency medical transport', 'causing hospital computer systems to cease functioning', 'disruption of supply chains for essential medicines and vaccines', 'preventing the operation of power generation infrastructure' or disrupting power supplies to 'housing, healthcare, education, civil administration and banking facilities and infrastructure', interfering with 'financial services' that are crucial to a State's financial system, and disrupting a State's 'fundamental ability to conduct monetary policy'.[124]\n\nTo this writer, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada adopted a higher threshold of coercion than that which Brazil, Czechia, Costa Rica, and the UK adopted.

Moreover, for those States, election interference must actually alter the results of an election to amount to intervention. Brazil, Czechia, Costa Rica, and the UK, however, used terms and phrases such as 'affecting', 'aims to influence', and 'free and informed choices' to describe the effects of the conduct of a foreign State. These terms signify a lower threshold of coercion. Indeed, unlike Australia, New Zealand, and Canada, the position papers of Brazil, Czechia, Costa Rica, and the UK did not require election interference to rise to the level of changing the results of an election to amount to intervention. Rather, these States used terms that would condemn as unlawful a broader range of forms of election interference. The UK, for instance, stated that covert operations that 'interfere with free and fair electoral processes' are a form of coercion,[125] while Costa Rica stated that launching disinformation campaigns and the dissemination of false news could constitute forms of unlawful electoral interference.\n\nAs noted above, the Common African Position did not identify a specific threshold at which non-forcible conduct amounts to coercion. Rather, the Common African Position noted that the definition of coercion requires further study among States, and explicitly rejected the thresholds that other States adopted in their position papers. The Common African Position stated: 'it is not necessary, in order to constitute coercion, that the conduct of a State must rise to the level of completely depriving a foreign State of its freedom of choice or to compel that State to either act or refrain from acting involuntarily'.[126]\n\nThis review of national and regional position papers reveals that there are three points of convergence among States on the question of the thresholds that delineate the boundaries of the prohibition on intervention. First, there is a consensus that the threat or use of force always crosses the threshold of coercion. Second, there is a consensus that non-intervention is a broad rule that covers both forcible and non-forcible forms of coercion. Third, there is a consensus that there are certain forms of conduct that, by their very nature, fall below the threshold of coercion. There is no consensus, however, on a specific list or catalogue of acts that are ipso facto non-coercive. However, given the positions expressed by Western States, it is reasonable to conclude that there is at least a general concurrence on the view expressed in the Common African Position that calls to settle disputes peacefully are not coercive. Beyond that, the main point of divergence among States relates to the threshold at which non-forcible conduct amounts to coercion.

As noted above, the utility of the prohibition on intervention is that it protects States against conduct that is more serious than an infringement on the territorial sovereignty of a State but that does not rise to the level of a threat or use of force. This issue – the threshold at which non-forcible conduct amounts to coercion – has not been addressed by the ICJ and remains a subject of scholarly debate.128\n\nSome scholars have argued that coercion is unsuited to function as an element of the prohibition on intervention, at least as it applies in cyberspace. For example, Duncan Hollis has opined that coercion may not be readily applicable to influence operations that use cyberspace to manipulate public opinion or disrupt the domestic political processes of a foreign State, such as Russia's interference in the 2016 US presidential election.129 Similarly, Ido Kilovaty has written that 'the norm of non-intervention, in its current narrow understanding, is almost irrelevant in a world where States increasingly resort to cyber operations as a method of interference [...] Coercion cannot contain the diversity of threats posed by new technologies. A new standard is, therefore, required'.130\n\nIn my view, we do not need a new standard. The challenge facing the application of the prohibition on intervention in cyberspace, and in other domains such as economic sanctions, is that there is no agreement among States on either the definition of coercion or on the minimum threshold of effects that must be met for conduct to constitute coercion. Any understanding of non-intervention must include a conceptual tool that distinguishes between unlawful intervention and lawful conduct that influences the policies of States. Whether that conceptual tool is called 'coercion', 'dictatorial interference',131\n\n127 Canadian Government, 'International Law Applicable in Cyberspace'.\n\n128 A.

What matters is the threshold of effects that defines and captures the essence of ‘coercion’, which can be applied to determine when specific conduct amounts to intervention. This is the question that Section 3 of this article addresses.\n\n## 3 Towards a Unified Threshold of Coercion\n\nIt is impossible, given the limitations of space, to comprehensively address the question of the threshold of coercion that applies to non-forcible conduct. This is a topic that requires further research. Nonetheless, in this section, this article will offer a general sketch of a threshold that could be employed to determine when non-forcible conduct amounts to coercion, thereby violating the prohibition on intervention. Specifically, this section proposes the adoption of a single, unified threshold of coercion that applies equally to both forcible and non-forcible intervention. According to this approach, non-forcible conduct would amount to coercion if its scale and effects are comparable to conduct that amounts to a violation of the prohibition on the threat or use of force.\n\nTwo considerations support this approach. The first is historical. Throughout its evolution, the prohibition on intervention was understood as a cognate of the prohibition on the threat or use of force.¹³⁴ Non-intervention was designed to extend the protections afforded to States under the prohibition on the threat or use of force to non-forcible – but no less pernicious – instruments of statecraft. The second consideration is conceptual. The definitions of coercion that appear in national position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace that some States have issued impose an unreasonably high threshold of effects that must be met for non-forcible conduct to amount to an act of intervention. Defining coercion as causing a State to act ‘involuntarily’ or ‘depriving’ it of freedom of choice requires causing effects or\n\n¹³² R. Buchan and N.

Such understandings of coercion would significantly reduce the scope of the prohibition on intervention, and lead to the paradoxical outcome where non-forcible methods of intervention are governed by a higher threshold of coercion than armed intervention, which is the gravest form of intervention. This is because nothing in *jus ad bellum* requires the effects of a threat or use of force to be of such gravity that it causes a State to act involuntarily or deprives it of freedom of choice.\n\nBefore proceeding, one point merits special emphasis. The unified threshold of coercion that I propose here should not be understood as signaling that the prohibition on the use of force and the prohibition on intervention are coterminous. At least one writer has recently suggested that ‘under the *lex lata* the prohibition on intervention only applies to acts amounting to a use of force or constituting support for the violent overthrow of a foreign regime’.¹³⁵ I disagree. As discussed below, at least since the adoption of the 1970 Friendly Relations Declaration, there has been a consensus among States that non-intervention is a broad rule that proscribes all forms of intervention, whether undertaken through forcible or non-forcible means. However, because there is no agreement among States on the meaning of coercion, there is continued uncertainty regarding when non-forcible conduct amounts to unlawful intervention. The unified threshold of coercion addresses this question by proposing a single test that applies to all forms of intervention, including armed force, or the use of political, economic, or informational instruments of statecraft, or some combination thereof.\n\n## 3.1 Coercion in the History of the Prohibition on Intervention\n\nAs argued in detail in another study by the present author, until the *Nicaragua Case* was decided by the ICJ in 1986, the concept of coercion was not defined, nor was it viewed as the cornerstone of the prohibition on intervention.¹³⁶ Moreover, throughout its evolution, States never understood intervention as conduct that causes a State to act involuntarily or that deprives it of its freedom of choice or control over its domestic jurisdiction. This is why, to this writer, the definitions of coercion that States have included in their national and regional position papers should be viewed as proposals *de lege ferenda*, and not restatements of established *lex lata*.

This overview begins with three Inter-American treaties that first included non-intervention as a distinct rule of international law, followed by the 1970 Friendly Relations Declaration, the adoption of which marked the acceptance of the prohibition on intervention as a rule of general international law.\n\nThe prohibition on intervention originated as a rule of conventional international law in the Inter-American system. It was first codified in Article 8 of the 1933 Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States, which reads as follows: 'No State has the right to intervene in the internal or external affairs of another'.[137] The prohibition on intervention was further reaffirmed and its scope was expanded with the adoption of the 1936 Additional Protocol Relative to Non-Intervention, Article I of which states: 'The High Contracting Parties declare inadmissible the intervention of any one of them, directly or indirectly, and for whatever reason, in the internal or external affairs of any other of the Parties'.[138]\n\nThe principal purpose of these provisions was to overturn the right of States to resort to acts of intervention, which was established under 19th century international law. At the time, States were permitted wage war or to engage in so-called measures short of war – i.e., acts of intervention – for an expansive range of reasons.[139] These included preserving the balance of power, repelling attacks against a State's territory, preempting an imminent armed attack, obtaining reparation for injuries inflicted on the interests or honor of the State, protecting the lives and property of citizens, securing the repayment of debts, and preventing mass atrocities.[140] Intervention was accepted as permissible\n\n137 Convention on the Rights and Duties of States Adopted by the Seventh International Conference of American States (signed 26 December 1933, entered into force 26 December 1934) 165 LNTS 19, at 21.\n138 Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Division of International Law, International Conferences of American States: First Supplement, 1933-1940 (Carnegie Endowment for International Peace 1940), at 191.\n139 See for example J.

However, during the negotiations on the 1933 Montevideo Convention, a subcommittee composed of Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, Ecuador, El-Salvador, Haiti, and Peru that had been entrusted with drafting the convention prepared a report that provides an insight into how the negotiating parties understood the term 'intervention'.

To this writer, it indicates that the drafters of the 1933 Montevideo Convention understood intervention as encompassing the use of armed force and any non-forcible conduct the effects of which are comparable to the use of force. This understanding of intervention was echoed by several States during the negotiations on the convention. Ecuador, for example stated: 'We have outlawed war. What is intervention but a kind of war, disguised and wary.'^[147]^ Argentina also stated: 'What is intervention, then, but violence? [...] Intervention is violence.'^[148]^ El Salvador also defined intervention in identical terms. It stated: 'Because the American conscience is such that territorial acquisitions originated by violence cannot be recognized; that violence has generally come to disturb the life of our countries in the form of intervention.'^[149]^ Peru shared this understanding of intervention. It argued in favor of adopting Article 8 of the 1933 Montevideo Convention because 'war is proscribed, so is violence, but not the use of arms, the diplomatic measures or any other means of effective compulsion.'^[150]^\n\nThe Charter of the Organization of American States, which was adopted in 1948,^[151]^ incorporated and expanded on the provisions on non-intervention in the 1933 Montevideo Convention and the 1936 Non-Intervention Protocol. Article 19 and 20 of the OAS Charter state:\n\n## Article 19\n\nNo State or group of States has the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatever, in the internal or external affairs of any other State.

Like its antecedents, the principal purpose of the first sentence of Article 19 was to reaffirm that, at least in Inter-American international law, the right of intervention that was recognized in 19th century international law was abolished. The inclusion of the phrase 'for whatever reason', which first appeared in the 1936 Non-Intervention Protocol, also indicated that non-intervention was an absolute rule that admitted no exceptions. Accordingly, the grounds that had previously been invoked to justify intervention – such as protecting citizens abroad, collecting debts, or enforcing international law – were no longer valid.\n\nThe second sentence of Article 19 clarified a principle that was only implicit in the 1933 Montevideo Convention and the 1936 Non-Intervention Protocol. It confirmed that non-intervention proscribed both the use of armed force and any other instrument of statecraft to engage in acts of intervention. Although, as noted above, the subcommittee that drafted the 1933 Montevideo Convention had affirmed that intervention could be undertaken 'through diplomatic representation, by armed force, or any other means involving effective force', this was not explicitly stated in either the 1933 Montevideo Convention or the 1936 Non-Intervention Protocol. The second sentence of Article 19 was also intended to prohibit acts of subversion that seek to impinge on the political independence of a State by subjugating it or transforming it into a satellite of a foreign power or that undermine its capacity to manage its political, economic, and cultural affairs autonomously.[152]\n\n152 The inclusion of this sentence was probably driven by political developments that occurred during the Bogota Conference during which the OAS Charter was drafted. On April 9, 1948, while the conference was ongoing, the leader of the Colombian Liberal Party, Jorge Gaitán was assassinated. This sparked violent riots during which Colombia's Capitol building, in which the Bogota Conference was being held, was burned down. Almost immediately, communist agitators were blamed and the US claimed that Moscow",

Coercion was not used, however, in order to signify the defining characteristic of intervention, nor was it designed to function as the conceptual tool that distinguishes between unlawful intervention and lawful conduct that seeks to influence the behavior of States. Rather, the authors of the OAS Charter drafted Article 20 with two objectives in mind. First, this provision was intended to proscribe economic sanctions that are imposed unilaterally by a State in response to an injury inflicted upon it by another State, and second, it was intended to outlaw the use of economic or political instruments of statecraft to pressure a State into giving concessions against its will. This becomes apparent from the negotiating history of Article 20.\n\nThis provision was formulated on the basis of two proposals that were submitted by Brazil and Cuba during the negotiations on the OAS Charter.

Initially, many (mostly Western) States answered this question in the affirmative. To those States, the prohibition on intervention was limited to proscribing the direct and indirect use of armed force by States.¹⁶³ Conversely, Non-Aligned and Eastern Bloc States, insisted that non-intervention was a broader rule that prohibited all forms of the use of force and other non-forcible forms of conduct. Ultimately, the broader understanding of non-intervention was adopted. It was accepted that this rule outlawed the use of any instrument of statecraft – whether forcible or non-forcible – that may be employed to infringe on the domestic jurisdiction of States. There was, however, no attempt during these negotiations to formulate a threshold that determines when non-forcible conduct amounts to intervention. Instead, most States either identified specific forms of conduct that, in their view, amounted to intervention, or simply described intervention as the exertion of pressure against a State.¹⁶⁴\n\n¹⁶³ 1964) UN Doc.

Ibid., at 10. Mexico also noted that, in addition to outlawing the use of force, the prohibition on intervention was designed to outlaw ‘coercive measures of an economic or political nature’. Mexico did not, however, offer a definition of coercion. Rather, it stated that in order to distinguish between lawful pressure and unlawful intervention the ‘criterion of the illegality of such coercion was the object sought’.

Intervention was never understood as an act that causes a State to behave involuntarily or that deprives it of freedom of choice or control over matters within its domestic jurisdiction. That is why the definitions of coercion and the approaches of applying the prohibition on intervention that appear in these position papers should be viewed as proposals for the progressive development of international law in this area. In other words, these are proposals *de lege ferenda*.\n\n## 3.2 Coercion as Conduct Comparable to the Use of Force\n\nIn addition to being unfounded in *lex lata*, defining coercion as acts that cause a State to behave involuntarily or that deprive a State of its freedom of choice or control over matters its domestic jurisdiction is conceptually flawed for two reasons. First, it would be incoherent to apply to non-forcible intervention that is undertaken through instruments such as information operations or economic sanctions a threshold of coercion that is higher than that which applies to the use of armed force, which is the gravest form of intervention. Second, even if one were to ignore the inconsistency between the thresholds of forcible and non-forcible intervention, the definitions of coercion that apply to the latter that some States have adopted are unreasonably high and severely restrict the scope of application of the prohibition on intervention. This section addresses these two points.\n\nAs noted above, virtually all position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace affirmed that the threat or use of force is *ipso facto* coercive. Many States also underscored that the use of force is the gravest form of coercion. This reflects the principle that the prohibition on the use of force is a peremptory rule of international law. Paradoxically, however, if, as many States propose, coercion is defined as conduct that causes a State to behave involuntarily or that deprives it of freedom of choice or control, non-forcible conduct would be governed by a higher threshold than that which applies to armed intervention.

The only requirement is that the conduct in question must involve the use of armed force by a State that causes death or injury to individuals or physical damage to property. Nonetheless, this writer agrees with Christian Henderson and Erin Pobjie that an inquiry into the scale and effects of a putative use of force might be necessary in order to determine whether the conduct in question is an instance of the use of force by a State in its international relations, as the term is used in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, or an instance of the use of force for the purposes of law enforcement.

Pobjie, Prohibited Force: The Meaning of 'Use of Force' in International Law (Cambridge University Press 2024), at 142. As Erin Pobjie notes, the gravity element is 'relevant to the contextual element of whether the act occurs in \"international relations\". For example, acts of a higher gravity are more likely to be perceived by States as of a military rather than law enforcement nature and thus as engaging their international relations [...] Also, acts of higher gravity may evince a hostile or coercive intention (discussed in the following section) with respect to another State and thus engage \"international relations\" on that basis'.\n171 O.

The threshold that must be met for an act to constitute an instance of the use of force is low. Even the threshold for an armed attack, the gravest form of the use of force, is relatively low.175 As the International Law Association noted, 'it appears that the gravity threshold attached to armed attacks is not markedly high, and would include most uses of force likely to cause casualties or significant property damage'.176\n\nCompared to the threshold of the use of force, the definitions of coercion that many States have adopted in their national position papers impose a much higher threshold of coercion for non-forcible conduct. Nothing in *jus ad bellum* requires the use of force to be of such gravity that it *significantly influences* or *thwarts* the decision-making processes of a State to the extent that its will is *manifestly bent*, which is the definition of coercion adopted by Germany. Similarly, *jus ad bellum* does not require the State to be subjected to a level of compulsion that causes it to 'act in an involuntary manner or to refrain from acting in a certain manner', which is the definition of coercion adopted by Estonia and several other States. Nor is it necessary under *jus ad bellum* for a State to be exposed to such pressure that *deprives* it of freedom of choice or *compels* or *imposes* an outcome on the State, which is the definition of coercion adopted by Canada.\n\n173 T.

To meet the threshold of causing a State to act involuntarily or to deprive it of freedom of choice or control over its domestic jurisdiction, the conduct of the coercing State must be of such intensity that it overwhelms the coerced State and leaves it with no viable choice but to submit to the demands of the coercing State.¹⁷⁷ In both jurisprudence and philosophy, involuntariness is generally understood as being a situation where an actor lacks a meaningful choice or has no reasonable alternative but to comply with the demands of another actor.¹⁷⁸ Applying these definitions would significantly reduce the scope of the prohibition on intervention, thereby permitting a wide-range of non-forcible conduct both in cyberspace and beyond.\n\nTake the definition of coercion in Canada's national position paper on the application of international law in cyberspace. As noted above, Canada defined coercion as conduct that compels or imposes an outcome on the affected State or deprives it of its freedom of choice. Canada also provided the following example of an act of unlawful intervention in an election: '[a]n\n\n¹⁷⁷ The definitions of coercion adopted by most States (coercion as conduct that causes a State to act involuntarily and coercion as conduct that deprives a State of freedom of choice or control) appear to echo the definition of coercion that the ILC adopted in its Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts. The ILC stated that coercion 'has the same essential character as force majeure', which it defined as a situation where the conduct of a State is 'involuntary or at least involves no element of free choice'. As the ILC explained, the degree of pressure required for a State to be placed in a position where its conduct is 'involuntary' or lacking the 'element of free choice' is one of 'irresistible force'. To be clear, States have not cited the Articles on State Responsibility as an authority to support their definitions of coercion. Nonetheless, there is a striking resemblance between the ILC's definition of coercion and the definitions adopted by many States in their position papers. In my view, this is a threshold of pressure that is far higher than anything required by the jus ad bellum. For the ILC's discussion of the concepts of coercion and force majeure, see UN ILC, 'Report of the International Law Commission: Fifty-Third Session' (23 April–1 June and 2 July–10 August 2001) GAOR 56th Session Supp. 10 (A/56/10), at 69, 77–78.\n\n¹⁷⁸ The literature of coercion and voluntariness in both law and philosophy is vast and varied.

The foreign interference catalogued in this report did not impose any particular choice on Canada nor did it significantly affect the outcome of an election. Likewise, this conduct would not meet the threshold of causing a State to act involuntarily.

The question, however, is what exactly does 'imposing restraints' entail and at what point can one say that the exertion of pressure on a State has reached the point of 'imposing restraints' on its will?\n\nTo this writer – and I must emphasize that this is the author's view, not that of the member States of the African Union – the threshold of coercion for non-forcible conduct should be defined as being comparable to the minimum effects of conduct that amounts to a threat or use of force. In other words, for non-forcible conduct – such as political, economic, or informational measures – to amount to intervention, the effects of the conduct in question should be comparable to that which is entailed by the threat or use of force. I call this the unified threshold of coercion. The practical effect of adopting the unified threshold of coercion is that any non-forcible conduct that causes effects on a scale that is comparable to conduct that amounts to a violation of the prohibition on the threat or use of force would constitute a breach of the prohibition on intervention.\n\nTo further explain, other reports by the Canadian government provide understandings of foreign interference that, to this writer, approximates the degree of effects that would meet the unified threshold of coercion, thereby amounting to a breach of the prohibition on intervention. In one report published by the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians, foreign interference was defined in the following terms: '[f]oreign interference involves foreign states, or persons/entities operating on their behalf, attempting to covertly influence decisions, events or outcomes to better suit their strategic interests'.[183] This report also stated: 'foreign interference includes attempts to covertly influence, intimidate, manipulate, interfere, corrupt or discredit individuals, organizations and governments to further the interests of a foreign country'.[184] It also underscored that 'foreign interference should be understood as a long-term effort, akin to espionage, using inducements or threats. Both dynamics enable the manipulation of targets when required, for example, through requests for inappropriate or special favours'.[185] This report\n\n183 Government of Canada, 'National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians: Special Report on Foreign Interference in Canada's Democratic Processes and Institutions' (3 June 2024), available at <https: reports=\"\" rp-2024-06-03=\"\" special-report-foreign-interference.pdf=\"\" www.nsicop-cpsnr.ca=\"\"> (accessed 11 August 2024), at 5.\n\n184 Ibid.\n\n185 Ibid., at 6.</https:>",

These include:\n\nForeign interference activities are distinct from acceptable diplomatic advocacy and lobbying. The latter activities are known to the host state and occur through recognized channels to achieve specific policy outcomes or objectives. It is normal for foreign diplomats in Canada, for example, to reach out to elected officials across the political spectrum, to pressure policymakers, to use local media to promote their national interests or to engage with and support domestic organizations.^[186]^\n\nAn earlier report, also published by the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians of Canada, states the following: '[f]oreign interference activities can include using deceptive means to cultivate relationships with elected officials and others perceived to processes influence in the political process; seek to influence the reporting of Canadian media outlets; seek, in some cases, to affect the outcome of elections; and coerce or induce diaspora communities to advance foreign interests in Canada'.^[187]^ The understandings of foreign interference in these reports are palpably broader than the definition of coercion in most national position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace, including Canada's. To this writer, these reports describe the kinds of conduct that were intended to be covered by the Common African Position, and which would be covered by the unified threshold of coercion proposed here.\n\nTwo considerations lend support to this understanding of coercion. First, adopting a unified threshold of coercion that applies to both forcible and non-forcible intervention is consistent with the history of the evolution of the prohibition on intervention. Throughout the negotiations on instruments in which non-intervention was codified, States consistently viewed acts of intervention as being analogous to the use of force.^[188]^ For example, as noted above, the drafters of the 1933 Montevideo Convention described intervention\n\n186 Ibid.\n187 Government of Canada, 'National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians: Annual Report 2019' (12 March 2020), available at <https: reports=\"\" rp-2020-03-12-ar=\"\" intro-en.html=\"\" www.nsicop-cpsnr.ca=\"\"> (accessed 11 August 2024), at 55.\n188 I.

It indicates that the authors of the Montevideo Convention understood non-forcible intervention to be the functional equivalent of armed force.\n\nMoreover, during the debates on the Montevideo Convention, several Latin American States underscored that non-intervention was closely associated to the prohibition on the use of force. For example, Argentina stated: 'What is intervention, then, but violence? [...] Intervention is violence.'[189] El Salvador also affirmed that '[b]ecause the American conscience is such that territorial acquisitions originated by violence cannot be recognized; that violence has generally come to disturb the life of our countries in the form of intervention'.[190] Peru also emphasized that 'war is proscribed, so is violence, but not the use of arms, the diplomatic measures or any other means of effective compulsion'.[191] Ecuador also highlighted that '[w]hat is intervention but a kind of war, disguised and wary' and argued that, having outlawed aggression pursuant to the 1933 Anti-War Treaty of Non-Aggression and Conciliation, it was only natural for the States of the western hemisphere to proscribe intervention.[192] Similarly, during the negotiations on the OAS Charter, Cuba called economic coercion 'treacherous, silent, and underhanded aggression'.[193]\n\nMany States expressed similar views during the negotiations on both the 1965 Declaration on Non-Intervention and the 1970 Friendly Relations Declaration.

The ICJ has stated that ‘a rule of international law, whether customary or conventional, does not operate in a vacuum; it operates in relation to facts and in the context of a wider framework of legal rules of which it forms only a part’.¹⁹⁸ Writing in more colorful terms, James Crawford observed that ‘customary rules usually hunt in packs, connected by some familial relationship and interacting with each other’.¹⁹⁹\n\nNon-intervention and the non-use of force belong to the same normative ‘pack’.

Far from it. Although both rules share the same policy purposes, the prohibition on intervention is broader than the prohibition on the threat or use of force. Non-intervention applies to any policy or practice, whether forcible and non-forcible, that impinges on the political independence or territorial integrity of States. In a sense, therefore, the prohibition on the threat or use of force should be viewed as a *lex specialis* that applies to a specific genus of intervention (namely, *armed* intervention).

It focuses on coercion as an element of the prohibition on intervention and identifies the different definitions of coercion that States have adopted in national and regional position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace. This article also specifically discusses the views of States on the threshold of coercion, which is the degree of harm or the effects that the conduct of a State must cause (or threaten to cause) to amount to a violation of the prohibition on intervention. This article argues that the definitions and thresholds of coercion that States have adopted in debates on the application of international law in cyberspace should be viewed as proposals for the development of the law in this area, as opposed to restatements of established law. Instead, this article proposes that all forms of intervention should be governed by a ‘unified threshold of coercion’ that applies to both forcible and non-forcible intervention.\n## Keywords\nprohibition on intervention – cyberspace – coercion – prohibition on the threat or use of force\n© KONINKLIJKE BRILL BV, LEIDEN, 2024 | DOI:10.1163/18757413_02701019\nHELAL\n# 1 Introduction\nIt is undisputed that the prohibition on intervention is a rule of customary international law.¹ This rule is also codified in numerous conventions, including the founding instruments of several regional organizations.² Non-intervention was also applied by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in several cases,³ the most important of which is the Nicaragua Case.⁴ This rule was also reaffirmed in many UN General Assembly resolutions,⁵ the most notable of which is the 1970 Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Co-Operation Among States in Accordance with the Charter of the United Nations ('1970 Friendly Relations Declaration').⁶ The prohibition on intervention also appears in the 1949 Declaration on the Rights and Duties of States and the 1954 Code of Offenses Against the Peace and Security of Mankind which were adopted by the International Law Commission (ILC).⁷\n1.

States from every region and from every political bloc have accused their adversaries (and sometimes even their allies) of intervening in their affairs.[8]\nIn recent years, there has been a growing interest among States and scholars in the principle of non-intervention. One reason is that cyberspace has become a domain of conflict and competition. Information and communication technologies (ICTs) are being used both as weapons of war and as instruments of non-forcible intervention.[9] States, state-sponsored non-State actors, and non-State groups and individuals acting independently have employed ICTs against foreign States, citizens, and companies to achieve various political, economic, criminal, scientific, and financial objectives. ICTs have been used to disrupt critical infrastructure, spread disinformation and propaganda to sow social discord, interfere in elections, acquire industrial and trade secrets, steal scientific research and intellectual property, and to gain profit through activities such as ransomware attacks. As a result, there is a growing corpus of state practice and expressions of opinio juris, in addition to a sizable body of scholarship, on how the prohibition on intervention applies in cyberspace. This article engages with these discussions.\nSpecifically, this article has two objectives. First, it explores how States have defined the concept of coercion,[10] which is considered a core component of\n8 See for example UNSC, 'Letter from the Chief of the Delegation of Iran to the President of the Security Council' (26 January 1946) UN Doc.

For instance, I will not delineate the exact areas of state policy that non-intervention protects, which have been variously referred to as 'internal and external affairs', 'internal affairs', 'domestic jurisdiction', and 'domain réservé'. Other issues that I will be unable to address here include the</https:></https:>\nHELAL\nthe prohibition on intervention.¹¹ It also examines how States have demarcated the boundary between, on one hand, the prohibition on intervention and, on the other, the obligation to respect the territorial sovereignty of States and the prohibition on the threat or use of force, which are two rules that are closely associated with the prohibition on intervention.\nThis article will do so by surveying national and regional position papers that States have issued in recent years on the application of international law in cyberspace in which States have outlined their views on the scope and content of the prohibition on intervention and on how it governs the conduct of States in cyberspace. These position papers were issued, at least partially, in response to calls by the UN Open-Ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (OEWG) for States to express their opinions on how international law applies in cyberspace.¹² The OEWG is one of the two principal forums in which discussions at the UN on the regulation of cyberspace are conducted, the other being the UN Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security (GGE).¹³\nIn addition to being of interest to scholars who specialize in the regulation of cyberspace, these national and regional position papers also deserve special attention from generalist scholars of international law. Most of these position papers are not framed as expressions of State views on *lex specialis* that apply only in cyberspace. Rather, they contain detailed statements on the scope and content of a wide range of *lex generalis* followed by discussions on how these rules of general international law apply in cyberspace. This makes these position papers a rich source of *opinio juris* on various primary and secondary rules\n¹¹ p. 11 A. Tzanakopoulos, ‘The Right to be Free from Economic Coercion’ (2015) 4 Cambridge Journal of International Law 616–633, at 620 (‘Coercion is a method of illegal intervention [...] coercion is intervention.

Painter, ‘The United Nations’ Cyberstability Processes: Surprising Progress but Much Left to Do’ (2021) 6 Journal of Cyber Policy 271–276.\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\nof international law, many of which are foundational to the international legal order. Some of the rules covered by these position papers include sovereignty, the prohibition on the threat or use of force, the peaceful settlement of disputes, human rights, the laws of armed conflict, the rules of attribution, and of course, the prohibition on intervention, which is the subject of this article.\nExamining these national and regional position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace reveals that, while the prohibition on intervention is accepted as a rule of general international law, there remains considerable uncertainty regarding the exact scope and content of this rule. In particular, there are notable differences among States on the definition of coercion. Some States have defined coercion as conduct that modifies the behavior of a State by causing it to act involuntarily or by compelling it to act in a manner that it would not have voluntarily engaged in but for the coercive conduct of a foreign State. Other States have defined coercion as conduct that deprives a State of its freedom of choice or control over matters within its domestic jurisdiction. A third and broader approach, which was adopted by the African Union, defines coercion as any conduct that imposes restraints on the will of a foreign State.\nIn addition to articulating theoretical definitions of coercion, some States provided examples of conduct that, in their view, amounted to coercion. These examples shed further light on how the concept of coercion applies to real-world situations in which ICTs are used as instruments of statecraft. In particular, these examples clarify the views of States on the threshold of effects or the degree of pressure that a State must be subjected to in order for conduct to be considered coercive. As I show below, there is currently no consensus among States on the effects that the conduct of the coercing State must have on the coerced State to constitute an act of unlawful intervention. Some States adopted relatively high thresholds that require the conduct in question to have significant effects on the coerced State. For example, for some States, merely seeking to sway public opinion during an election campaign does not necessarily amount to unlawful intervention. Rather, to those States, electoral interference must rise to the level of altering election results or preventing a segment of the population from voting in order to constitute an act of intervention.[14] On the other hand, other States adopted lower thresholds to determine when\n14 See for example P. Ney, ‘DOD General Counsel Remarks at US Cyber Command Legal Conference’ (2 March 2020) US Department of Defense, available at <https: 2099378=\"\" article=\"\" dod-general-counsel-remarks-at-us-cyber-command-legal-conference=\"\" news=\"\" speech=\"\" www.defense.gov=\"\"></https:> (Arguing that ‘a cyber operation by a State that interferes with another country’s ability to hold an election or that tampers with another country’s election results would be a clear violation of the rule of non-intervention’); Canadian Government, ‘International Law Applicable in Cyberspace’ (22 April 2022),\nHELAL\nelectoral interference could be deemed coercive. For example, one State noted that 'hack and leak' operations to influence public opinion could constitute a violation of the prohibition on intervention.¹⁵ The African Union also adopted a relatively low threshold of coercion that does not require the behavior of a foreign State to have significant effects on a State in order to amount to unlawful intervention.\nIn short, national and regional position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace indicate that there are divergences among States on how the prohibition on intervention governs state conduct in cyberspace. There is no agreement on a theoretical definition of coercion, there is no consensus on the threshold of effects that determines when specific state conduct that is designed to influence the behavior of other States constitutes coercion, and there is some uncertainty on how non-intervention relates to other rules such as the prohibition on the threat or use of force and the obligation to respect the territorial sovereignty of States.\nHaving catalogued the views that States have, heretofore, expressed on non-intervention and coercion in cyberspace, the second objective of this article is to critically appraise the understandings of coercion that States have adopted in their national and regional position papers. Specifically, this article makes the following two arguments.\nFirst, this article contends that – as a matter of formal law – the positions expressed by States on the meaning of coercion should be viewed as proposals de lege ferenda, and not as restatements of established lex lata. This is because, as I explain below, nothing in the history of the development of the prohibition of intervention lends support to the definitions of coercion that States have espoused. Non-intervention first emerged in the early 20th century as a rule\n¹⁵ available at <https: issues_development-enjeux_developpement=\"\" peace_security-paix_security=\"\" eyberspace_law-cyberespace_droit.aspx?lang=\"eng\" world-monde=\"\" www.international.gc.ca=\"\"> ('An example of a prohibited intervention would be a malicious cyber activity that hacks and disables a State's election commission days before an election, preventing a significant number of citizens from voting, and ultimately influencing the election outcome').\nUNGA, 'Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions on the Subject of How International Law Applies to the Use of Information and Communications Technologies by States Submitted by Participating Governmental Experts in the Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security Established Pursuant to General Assembly Resolution 73/226' (13 July 2021) UN Doc. A/76/136 ('Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions'), at 69 (Norway: 'unduly influencing public opinion through the dissemination of confidential information obtained through cyber operations (\"hack and leak\"), would be in violation of the prohibition of intervention').</https:>\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\nof Inter-American conventional international law. Then, building on decades of advocacy principally by non-aligned States, the prohibition on intervention became a rule of general international law with the adoption of the 1970 Friendly Relations Declaration. However, at no point during the evolution of the prohibition on intervention did States define coercion as conduct that causes a State to behave involuntarily or that deprives a State of its freedom of choice or control over matters within its domestic jurisdiction. Indeed, the history of the development of this rule indicates that States never even conceived of coercion as the conceptual cornerstone of non-intervention.\nSecond, this article argues that the definitions of coercion adopted by some States are conceptually flawed. Echoing the ICJ's judgment in the Nicaragua Case,¹⁶ virtually all States agree that the prohibition on intervention proscribes coercion whether undertaken through armed force or through non-forcible means, such as economic or political instruments of statecraft. Many States also underscored that the use of armed force is the gravest form of intervention. Yet – paradoxically – applying the definitions of coercion espoused by many (especially Western) States would lead to a situation where the gravest form of intervention – armed force – is governed by a lower threshold than non-forcible forms of intervention that are considered less grave.\nAs discussed below, nothing in *jus ad bellum* requires an act that amounts to armed intervention to be of such gravity that it causes a State to behave involuntarily or deprives it of control over matters within its domestic jurisdiction, which are the definitions of coercion adopted by some States. Indeed, attacking a single military unit could constitute a violation of the prohibition on the threat or use of force and could even amount to an armed attack,¹⁷ regardless of its effect on the behavior of the target State. On the other hand, applying the definitions of coercion adopted by some States would require non-forcible forms of intervention to reach a level of gravity and intensity that causes (or threatens to cause) a State to act involuntarily or that deprives it of freedom of choice. As I explain below, these definitions entail an unreasonably high\n¹⁶ Nicaragua v. USA, at para. 215 ('Intervention is wrongful when it uses methods of coercion in regard to such choices, which must remain free ones. The element of coercion, which defines, and indeed forms the very essence of, prohibited intervention, is particularly obvious in the case of an intervention which uses force, either in the direct form of military action, or in the indirect form of support for subversive or terrorist armed activities within another State').\n¹⁷ As the ICJ noted in the *Oil Platforms Case*, '[t]he Court does not exclude the possibility that the mining of a single military vessel might be sufficient to bring into play the \"inherent right of self-defence\". *Oil Platforms* (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America) (Judgment) [2003] ICJ Rep. 161, at para. 72.\nHELAL\nthreshold of effects for non-forcible intervention that is significantly higher than that which applies to forcible intervention.\nTherefore, this article argues that States and scholars should consider adopting what I call the 'unified threshold of coercion' that applies to both forcible and non-forcible intervention. Based on this approach, non-forcible conduct would be considered coercive if its impact is comparable to the scale and effects of conduct that amounts to a violation of the threat or use of force. This unified threshold of coercion is lower than the thresholds of coercion that many States have adopted in their position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace.\nThis article consists of two sections. Section 1 provides a survey of the definitions of coercion that appear in national and regional position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace. This section also outlines the views of States on the interconnection between non-intervention and the prohibition on the use of force and the obligation to respect state sovereignty, which is a debate that sheds further light on the kinds of conduct that each of these rules applies to and regulates. Then in Section 2, this article critically appraises the understandings of coercion adopted by States and argues in favor of adopting what I call the 'unified threshold of coercion' that applies equally to both forcible and non-forcible forms of intervention.\n## 2 Intervention and Coercion in Cyberspace\nNational and regional position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace unanimously affirmed that non-intervention is an established rule of international law that applies in cyberspace.[18] The GGE,[19] the African Union\n18 H.

Three approaches to defining coercion have appeared in these position papers.\n## 2.1 Coercion as Conduct that Modifies the Behavior of a State\nThe first approach defines coercion as conduct that compels a State to modify its behavior. Among the States that adopted this approach, there were slight variations in the exact definition of coercion that those States formulated. Some States defined coercion as acts that aim to compel a State to act involuntarily. Estonia's position paper expressed this view. It stated:\nWhen discussing if a cyber operation constitutes an unlawful intervention into the external or internal affairs of another state, the element of coercion is a key factor [...] Stemming from that, cyber operations that aim to force another nation to act in an involuntary manner or to refrain from acting in a certain manner, and target the other nation's domaine réservé (e.g., national democratic processes such as elections, or military, security or critical infrastructure systems) could constitute such an intervention.²³\nAustria's national statement was similar to Estonia's. It stated: '[c]oercion occurs when a state seeks to compel another state to change its behaviour with respect to its internal or external affairs, i.e. to force that state to act in an involuntary manner or involuntarily refrain from acting in a particular way'.²⁴ Some States that adopted this understanding of coercion also included a 'but for' test in their definition of coercion. According to those States, an act would be coercive if it aimed at compelling a State to behave in a manner that it would not otherwise have engaged in voluntarily. Norway's position paper expressed this view:\ncoercion, and thus of unauthorized intervention, has not yet fully crystallized in international law [...] there is no clear definition of the element of coercion').\n²³ UNGA, 'Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions', at 25.\n²⁴ Austrian Government, 'Position Paper of the Republic of Austria: Cyber Activities and International Law' (April 2024), available at <https: docs-library.unoda.org=\"\" open-ended_working_group_on_information_and_communication_technologies_-_(2021)=\"\" open-end_working_group_on_information_and_communication_technologies_-_(2021)=\"\" /austrian_position_Paper_-_cyber_activities_and_international_law_(final_23.04.2024).pdf=\"\">, at 5.</https:>\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\n[A] State must not carry out cyber operations in breach of the prohibition of intervention, according to customary international law. A cyber operation must therefore not be carried out to compel the target State to take a course of action, whether by act or omission, in a way that it would not otherwise voluntarily have pursued (coercion) in matters relating to its internal or external affairs (domaine réservé).25\nThe Netherlands adopted a similar position. It defined coercion as an act 'compelling a state to take a course of action (whether an act or an omission) that it would not otherwise voluntarily pursue. The goal of the intervention must be to effect change in the behavior of the target state'.26 Denmark also defined coercion as an act that 'has a potential for compelling the target state to engage in an action that it would otherwise not take'.27 Switzerland and Poland also used similar terms. To Switzerland, coercion is conduct that 'seeks to cause another to act (or refrain from acting) in a way it would not otherwise',28 and Poland stated that coercion 'aims at influencing the state's decisions belonging to its domaine réservé', and added that cyberoperations 'potentially leading to the state's conduct that would not occur otherwise, may be considered a prohibited intervention'.29\nOther States that understood coercion as conduct that is designed to modify the behavior of another State used relatively generic terms to define coercion. Romania, for example, defined coercion simply as an act the purpose of which is to 'effectively change the behavior of the target state'.30 Israel's Deputy Attorney General also opined that coercion 'has been taken to mean that State A cannot take actions to \"coerce\" State B in pursuing a course of action, or refraining from a course of action, in matters pertaining to State B's core internal affairs'.31 Singapore's national statement defined coercion in similar terms. It stated that a cyberoperation may violate the prohibition on intervention if it amounted to an 'attempt to coerce our government to take or forebear\n25 UNGA, 'Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions', at 68.\n26 Ibid., at 57.\n27 Danish Government, 'Denmark's Position Paper on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace', at 450.\n28 UNGA, 'Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions', at 87.\n29 Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 'The Republic of Poland's Position on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace'.\n30 Ibid., at 77.\n31 R. Schöndorf, 'Israel's Perspective on Key Legal and Practical Issues Concerning the Application of International Law to Cyber Operations' (2021) 97 International Law Studies 395-406, at 403.\nHELAL\na certain course of action on a matter ordinarily within its sovereign prerogative'.32 Italy's national statement used almost identical terms. It asserted that 'a State employs coercive means to compel another State to undertake or desist from a specific action, in matters falling under its domain réserve'.33 In other words, for these States, an act is coercive simply if it is intended to cause another State to change its behavior. These States did not, however, explicitly include a requirement that the conduct in question must compel a State to act involuntarily or force it to engage in behavior that it would not have engaged in voluntarily but-for the coercive conduct of a foreign State.\nGermany adopted a generally similar understanding of coercion. Although it did not refer to modifying the behavior of a State or causing it to act involuntarily, Germany described coercion as the exercise of a certain level of pressure that has a significant impact on the decision-making process of a State to the extent that it manipulates or undermines the will of the State. Germany's position paper stated the following:\nGenerally, Germany is of the opinion that cyber measures may constitute a prohibited intervention under international law if they are comparable in scale and effects to coercion in non-cyber contexts.\nCoercion implies that a State's internal processes regarding aspects pertaining to its domaine réservé are significantly influenced or thwarted and that its will is manifestly bent by the foreign State's conduct. However, as is widely accepted, the element of coercion must not be assumed prematurely. Even harsher forms of communication such as pointed commentary and sharp criticism as well as (persistent) attempts to obtain, through discussion, a certain reaction or the performance of a certain measure from another State do not as such qualify as coercion. Moreover, the acting State must intend to intervene in the internal affairs of the target State – otherwise the scope of the non-intervention principle would be unduly broad.34\nDespite these variations in the exact formulation of these definitions, these understandings of coercion share the common characteristic of focusing on\n32 UNGA, ‘Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions’, at 83.\n33 Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, ‘Italian Position Paper on “International Law and Cyberspace”’ (2021), available at <https: 11=\"\" doc=\"\" italian_position_paper_on_international_law_and_cyberspace.pdf=\"\" machine=\"\" research=\"\" www.esteri.it=\"\" 2021=\"\">, at 4–5.\n34 UNGA, ‘Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions’, at 34.</https:>\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\nthe desire of the coercing State to alter the behavior of another State. Marko Milanovic calls this the extortion model of coercion. 'These definitions point to undermining the victim state's will as the essence of coercion (\"involuntary,\" \"voluntary\"), so as to effect a change in its behavior'.35\nSeveral States that adopted this definition of coercion also provided examples of conduct that, in their view, amounted to intervention. As noted above in the introduction to this article, these examples provide greater clarity on how States operationalize and apply the definitions of coercion that they adopted. In its position paper, Finland position paper identified the following forms of coercion:\n[W]hile the conduct of elections belongs undisputedly to the internal affairs of each State, all methods of electoral interference do not display the element of coercion. Hacking of voter databases or manipulation of vote counts in order to alter the election results has nevertheless been recognized as a fairly clear case. To be comparable to a real world intervention, cyber interference must also be of a serious nature [...] Military or economic pressure may also qualify as coercion. Hostile cyber interference done with the purpose of promoting or supporting armed action in another State could constitute an example of prohibited intervention, provided that it seeks to force a certain policy change.[36]\nDenmark's position paper provided similar examples of coercive intervention:\nAs emphasized by the Court in the Nicaragua judgment coercive acts involving the use of force are particularly obvious examples of unlawful interventions. Denmark considers that coercion is not limited to means of direct or indirect use of force and that also measures below this threshold may constitute coercion. Cyber activities that do not amount to use of force can therefore also be coercive.\nAn example of unlawful intervention in the cyber domain could be where a State coercively interferes in the internal political process of another. In the cyber context this could potentially occur by using cyber\n35 M.

In addition to tampering with election systems to alter the results of an election, Norway stated:\n[C]arrying out cyber operations with the intent of altering election results in another State, for example by manipulating election systems or unduly influencing public opinion through the dissemination of confidential information obtained through cyber operations ('hack and leak'), would be in violation of the prohibition of intervention. Another example is a cyber operation deliberately causing a temporary shutdown of the target State's critical infrastructure, such as the power supply or TV, radio, Internet or other telecommunications infrastructure in order to compel that State to take a course of action.³⁸\nLikewise, for Poland, the following conduct amounted to a violation of the prohibition on intervention: 'a wide-scale and targeted disinformation campaign, in particular when it results in civil unrest', preventing 'a reliable and timely conduct of democratic elections', blocking 'the filing of tax returns online', or depriving a 'the parliament working remotely of the possibility of voting online to adopt a law or modifying the outcome of such voting'.³⁹ Austria also identified the following conduct as amounting to a breach of the prohibition on intervention:\n[A] cyber activity that interferes with a state's ability to hold elections or which manipulates election results could, if undertaken to compel a state to involuntarily change a government policy, constitute a violation of the prohibition of intervention. Large-scale cyber activities, including disinformation campaigns, conducted by or attributable to a state may also constitute, if undertaken to compel another state to involuntarily change its behaviour, a violation of the prohibition of intervention.⁴⁰\n37 Danish Government, 'Denmark's Position Paper on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace', at 450.\n38 UNGA, 'Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions', at 68.\n39 Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 'The Republic of Poland's Position on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace'.\n40 Austrian Government, 'Position Paper of the Republic of Austria', at 5.\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\n523\nItaly, Singapore, and Switzerland provided examples that were relatively less detailed. Italy noted that the prohibition on intervention required further study, especially ‘with regard to influence activities aimed, for instance, at undermining a State’s ability to safeguard public health during a pandemic, or at manipulating voting behavior’.41 Singapore also stated that ‘non-exhaustive examples’ of violations of the prohibition on intervention include ‘interference in Singapore’s electoral processes through cyber means, or cyber-attacks against our infrastructure’.42 Similarly, Switzerland noted that establishing whether a cyberoperation amounted to an act of intervention should be determined on a case-by-case basis, especially in situations of ‘economic coercion, which could be the case if a company that is systemically relevant was paralyzed through a cyber operation’.43\n## 2.2 Coercion as Conduct that Deprives a State of Freedom of Choice or Control\nThe second understanding of coercion that has emerged out of national position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace defines coercion as an act that deprives a State of its ability to control or to exercise freedom of choice regarding matters within its domaine réservé. Australia adopted this view. Its position paper stated: ‘[c]oercive means are those that effectively deprive or are intended to deprive the State of the ability to control, decide upon or govern matters of an inherently sovereign nature’.44 In order to establish that a breach of the prohibition on intervention has indeed occurred, Australia required evidence that the conduct of the coercing State had some measurable impact or discernable effect on the target State.45 Canada expressed a similar position. Its position paper explained that a cyberoperation would be coercive if it is ‘designed to deprive the affected State of its freedom of choice’.46 Canada also noted that, in order to amount to an act of\n41 Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, ‘Italian Position Paper on “International Law and Cyberspace”’.\n42 UNGA, ‘Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions’, at 83.\n43 Ibid., at 88.\n44 Ibid., at 5.\n45 Ibid., at 5. Australia’s national statement included a hypothetical scenario of a cyberoperation that that disables websites and denies access to government systems that operate a State’s tax system. According to Australia’s national statement, establishing whether this cyberoperation amounts to an act of intervention ‘would depend on the circumstances, including the extent of economic damage and the loss of government control over economic policy’ (emphasis added).\n46 Canadian Government, ‘International Law Applicable in Cyberspace’.\nHELAL\nintervention, a cyberoperation must 'cause coercive effects that deprive, compel or otherwise impose an outcome on the affected State'.47\nNew Zealand also defined coercion as conduct that manifests 'an intention to deprive the target state of control over matters falling within the scope of its inherently sovereign functions'.48 According to New Zealand, to constitute intervention, the conduct of the coercing State must have 'significant effects' on a matter within a State's domaine réservé. The Czech Republic defined coercion in similar terms. It stated:\nCoercion is an activity intended to deprive, either directly or indirectly, the State of its ability to exercise control or govern matters within its internal and external affairs [...] The difference between actions that violate sovereignty and actions that violate the prohibition of intervention is that the latter is coercive, i.e., intentionally aims to influence the State's free will and choice.49\nBrazil, Costa Rica, and the UK also adopted similar definitions of coercion. The UK Attorney General said the following about coercion:\nSome have characterized coercion as forcing a State to act differently from how it otherwise would – that is, compelling it into a specific act or omission. Imagine, for example, a cyber operation to delay another State's election, or to prevent it from distributing tax revenues to fund essential services. To my mind, these are certainly forms of coercion.\nBut I want to be clear today that coercion can be broader than this. In essence, an intervention in the affairs of another State will be unlawful if it is forcible, dictatorial, or otherwise coercive, depriving a State of its freedom of control over matters which it is permitted to decide freely by the principle of State sovereignty. While the precise boundaries of coercion are yet to crystallize in international law, we should be ready to consider whether disruptive cyber behaviors are coercive even where it might not\n47 Ibid.\n48 New Zealand Foreign Affairs and Trade, 'The Application of International Law to State Activity in Cyberspace' (1 December 2020), available at <https: application-international-law-state-activity-cyberspace=\"\" publications=\"\" www.dpmc.govt.nz=\"\">, at para. 9(b).\n49 Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 'Position Paper on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace' (27 February 2024), available at <https: 5376858=\"\" file=\"\" mzv.gov.cz=\"\" 20240226_cz_position_paper_on_the_application_of_il_cyberspace.pdf=\"\">, at para. 9.</https:></https:>\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\nbe possible to point to a specific course of conduct which a State has been forced into or prevented from taking.⁵⁰\nCosta Rica's position was similar, but not identical, to that of the UK. It stated that coercion can occur in a 'multitude of ways where one State, directly or indirectly through support for non-State actors, deprives another State of the capacity to make free and informed choices pertaining to its internal affairs'.⁵¹ Like the UK, Costa Rica used the word deprives, but it did not use the word control in relation to matters within its domaine réservé. Rather, it referred to the capacity of a State to make free and informed choices. Brazil used different terminology. Instead of referring to depriving a State its ability to freely decide on matters within its domaine réservé, Brazil stated that, to constitute intervention, a cyberoperation 'against another State must involve an element of coercion affecting the right of the victim State to freely choose its political, economic, social and cultural system, and to formulate its foreign policy'.⁵²\nMarko Milanovic calls this the control model of coercion:\nCoercion-as-control does not work by influencing the decision-making calculus of the coerced state. Rather, the coercing state directly interferes with the coerced state's internal or external affairs by taking action that materially deprives the coerced state of its ability to control its policy-choices within its reserved domain.⁵³\nSeveral States that adopted this definition of coercion also provided examples of conduct that amounted to intervention in their position papers. Australia, for instance, identified activities that 'manipulate the electoral system to alter the results of an election in another State, intervention in the fundamental operation of Parliament, or in the stability of States' financial systems' as examples of coercion.⁵⁴ Canada also stated that a cyberoperation that 'hacks\n⁵⁰ S.

Its position paper stated:\nCoercion is clear-cut when a State uses or threatens to use force against another one. Nonetheless, it can also occur in a multitude of ways where one State, directly or indirectly through support for non-State actors, deprives another State of the capacity to make free and informed choices pertaining to its internal or external affairs. Coercion may occur when a State provides financial or other forms of support to secessionist, subversive or violent groups in the territory of another State, when it exercises significant political or economic pressure on another State, or when it engages in or supports subversive or hostile propaganda or the dissemination of false news that interfere in the internal or external affairs of another State [...]\nA prominent example of a breach of non-intervention are ransomware attacks crippling or simply interfering with a State's ability to run public services, such as finance, education, and social security. Moreover, foreign election interference may also infringe the principle of non-intervention. This may take the form of cyber operations directly interfering with mail ballots or voter databases, or electoral disinformation campaigns seeking\n55 Canadian Government, 'International Law Applicable in Cyberspace'.\n56 New Zealand Foreign Affairs and Trade, 'The Application of International Law to State Activity in Cyberspace', at para. 10.\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\nto mislead the electorate about the vote itself, candidates, electoral polls or results. Other types of disinformation, such as those affecting a State's health policies, may also amount to a prohibited intervention. Posts inciting individuals or other States to wage wars of aggression or to disrupt or subvert the internal order of another State may likewise breach the principle of non-intervention.57\nThe UK also provided a wide range of examples of acts of coercion. It identified forms of intervention that affected four areas of state policy: 'energy security; essential medical care; economic stability; and democratic processes'.58 In relation to 'essential energy supplies' 'essential medical services' and 'economic stability' the UK listed the following cyberoperations as potentially breaching the prohibition on intervention:\n[D]isruption of systems controlling emergency medical transport (e.g., telephone dispatchers); causing hospital computer systems to cease functioning; disruption of supply chains for essential medicines and vaccines; preventing the supply of power to housing, healthcare, education, civil administration and banking facilities and infrastructure; causing the energy supply chain to stop functioning at national level through damage or prevention of access to pipelines, interchanges, and depots; or preventing the operation of power generation infrastructure.\nTurning to economic stability, covert cyber operations by a foreign State that coercively interfere with a State's freedom to manage its domestic economy, or to ensure provision of domestic financial services crucial to the State's financial system, would breach the rule on non-intervention. Such cyber operations could include disruption to the networks controlling a State's fundamental ability to conduct monetary policy or to raise and distribute revenue, for instance through taxation. Or disruption to systems which support lending, saving and insurance across the economy.59\nIn relation to democratic processes, the UK noted that 'covert cyber operations by a foreign State which coercively interfere with free and fair electoral processes would constitute a prohibited intervention'. Examples of such unlawful\n57 Costa Rican Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 'Costa Rica's Position on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace', at 7–8.\n58 Braverman, 'International Law in Future Frontiers'.\n59 Ibid.\nHELAL\nconduct include: '[O]perations that disrupt the systems which control electoral counts to change the outcome of an election; or operations to disrupt another State's ability to hold an election at all, for example by causing systems to malfunction with the effect of preventing voter registration'.60\n## 2.3 Coercion as Conduct that Imposes Restraints on the Will of a State\nThe third approach to understanding coercion appears in the Common African Position on the Application of International Law to the Use of Information and Communication Technologies in Cyberspace, which was adopted by the fifty-five members of the African Union in early 2024.61 As of this writing, the African Union is the first regional organization to have adopted a position on the application of international law in cyberspace.62 The Common African Position defined coercion 'as a policy that is designed to impose restraints on the will of a foreign State. Assessing whether the use by one or more States of ICTs in cyberspace to influence the conduct of a foreign State amounts to coercion is a determination that should be undertaken on a case-by-case basis'.63 The Common African Position also stated the following:\nWhile the definition of coercion in this context requires further study and deliberation between States, the African Union is of the view that it is not necessary, in order to constitute coercion, that the conduct of a State must rise to the level of completely depriving a foreign State of its freedom of choice or to compel that State to either act or refrain from acting involuntarily. Coercion may also occur through threats of intervention. Furthermore, there is no requirement that, in order to constitute a violation of the prohibition on intervention, an act of coercion must actually succeed in compelling the State subjected to such acts to change its conduct. An unsuccessful attempt of intervention is unlawful under international law. The African Union stresses that offers or calls to peacefully settle disputes through negotiation, enquiry, mediation, conciliation, good offices, arbitration, and judicial settlement, and diplomatic\n60 Ibid.\n61 See Helal, 'Common African Position', at para. 31.\n62 For a brief description of the process of the development and adoption of the Common African Position, see: M. Helal, 'The Common African Position on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace: Reflections on a Collaborative Lawmaking Process' (5 February 2024) EJIL:Talk!, available at <https: the-common-african-position-on-the-application-of-international-law-in-cyberspace-reflections-on-a-collaborative-lawmaking-process=\"\" www.ejiltalk.org=\"\"></https:>.\n63 Helal, 'Common African Position', at para. 31.\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\n529\ndiscussions and communications are presumed not to constitute acts of coercion.⁶⁴\nIn some respects, the understanding of coercion in the Common African Position is similar to other definitions of coercion, but it also diverges from these definitions in significant ways. The Common African Position defined coercion as conduct that ‘impose[s] restraints on the will of a foreign State’. This is broadly analogous to the notion of impinging on the freedom of choice of States, which is central to the coercion-as-control model. However, the Common African Position also indicates that the purpose of intervention is to ‘influence the conduct of a foreign State’. This echoes definitions that understand coercion as conduct that aims at modifying the behavior of a State by subverting, manipulating, or undermining its decision-making processes.\nCompared to other definitions of coercion, however, the Common African Position was purposively designed to broaden the protective scope of the prohibition on intervention. It does so by adopting a lower threshold of (actual or threatened) effects that must be crossed for conduct to amount to coercion. This is clearly expressed in the following sentence: ‘the African Union is of the view that it is not necessary, in order to constitute coercion, that the conduct of a State must rise to the level of completely depriving a foreign State of its freedom of choice or to compel that State to either act or refrain from acting involuntarily’.⁶⁵\nIn other words, the principal point of divergence between the Common African Position and the positions of other States relates to the threshold of coercion. For the member States of the African Union, intervention is any conduct undertaken by a State that imposes restraints on another State in relation to matters within its domestic jurisdiction. However, those restraints need not be of such severity that they cause a State to act involuntarily nor do they need to reach a level of intensity that completely deprives that State of its freedom of choice or control over matters within its domestic jurisdiction.\nIt is notable that, in an initial draft of the Common African Position that this author had prepared while serving as the African Union Special Rapporteur on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace, coercion was defined in the following terms: ‘coercion, in the context of the prohibition on intervention, should be defined as a policy that is designed to impose material restraints on the will of a foreign State’. The adjective ‘material’ was intended\n⁶⁴ Ibid., at para. 32.\n⁶⁵ Ibid.\nHELAL\nto signify that, in order to amount to intervention, the restraints imposed on a State must attain an elevated level of severity, which would ensure that non-intervention would not be an over-inclusive rule.\nThis initial draft of the Common African Position was welcomed by the AU Peace and Security Council,⁶⁶ and served as the basis for the interstate negotiations that led to the adoption of the Common African Position, which were held in Tunisia from 29 November to 1 December 2023.⁶⁷ During these negotiations, however, the AU member States decided to delete the adjective 'material'. The member States determined that the word 'restraints' sufficiently and accurately captured the essence of the prohibition on intervention. Many States described non-intervention as a rule that is intended to protect the policy autonomy of States and to enable States to manage their internal and external affairs free from 'restraints' that might be imposed by other States. The AU member States also agreed that, when read in the context of the entire section on non-intervention in the Common African Position, the prohibition on intervention was not over-inclusive.\n## 2.4 The Element of Intent\nMany States also included the element of the intent in their definitions of coercion. New Zealand articulated this element unambiguously. Its position paper affirmed that the 'coercive intention of the state actor is a critical element of the rule' and underscored that 'intention may in some circumstances be inferred from the effects of cyber activity'.⁶⁸ Similarly, Costa Rica's position paper noted that '[f]or such breaches [of the prohibition on intervention] to occur, it suffices that a State intends to coerce another State, employs coercive methods, or eventually causes coercive effects in another State'.⁶⁹ Czechia's position paper used similar terms. It stated that '[c]oercion is an activity intended to deprive' a State of control over matters within its domaine réservé.⁷⁰\n⁶⁶ See AU Peace and Security Council, 'Communiqué No. 1171' (24 August 2023) AU Doc. PSC/PR/COMM.1171 (2023), at para. 2: 'Welcomes the Draft Statement by the AUCIL on the Application of International Law to the Use of ICTs in Cyberspace prepared by the Special Rapporteur, which was adopted and endorsed by the 22nd Ordinary Session of the AUCIL in June 2023'.\n⁶⁷ AU Office of the Legal Counsel BC/OLC/42.23/13793.23 (on file with the author).\n⁶⁸ New Zealand Foreign Affairs and Trade, 'The Application of International Law to State Activity in Cyberspace', at para. 9(b).\n⁶⁹ Costa Rican Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 'Costa Rica's Position on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace', at 7 (emphasis added).\n⁷⁰ Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 'Position Paper on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace', at para. 9(b).\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\nOther States also included the element of intent in their definition of coercion, but only implicitly. For instance, Norway stated that holding elections is an example of an activity that falls within the *domaine réservé* of a State. Therefore, according to Norway, 'carrying out cyber operations with the intent of altering election results in another State' would violate the prohibition on intervention.[71] Furthermore, Canada,[72] Denmark,[73] and the US,[74] understood coercion as conduct that is *designed* to achieve a specific purpose or effect (such as modifying the behavior of the target State). As noted above, the Common African Position also understood coercion as conduct that is *'designed* to impose restraints on the will of a foreign State'. The use of the term *'designed'* by these position papers introduces the element of intent into the definition of coercion. It indicates that the coercing State is acting purposefully and intentionally and employing its resources in a systematic and strategic manner to achieve specific policy objectives.\nOther States used similar phrases that also make the intent of the coercing State an element of the definition of coercion. The Netherlands $^{75}$ and Romania $^{76}$ defined coercion as conduct *'the goal'* of which is changing the behavior of the target State. Likewise, Estonia and Poland described coercion as conduct that *'aimed'* at achieving a specific objective. Estonia, for example, stated that 'cyber operations that *aim* to force another nation to act in an involuntary manner or to refrain from acting in a certain manner' would amount to intervention.[77] Poland also stated that '[t]o be in breach of international law,\n71 UNGA, 'Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions', at 68 (emphasis added).\n72 Canadian Government, 'International Law Applicable in Cyberspace' ('[C]oercion may arise through the threat or use of force but could also arise where a cyber activity is designed to deprive the affected State of its freedom of choice') (emphasis added).\n73 Danish Government, 'Denmark's Position Paper on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace', at 450 ('To be coercive the effort to intervene must be designed to have a decisive impact on outcomes or conduct with respect to a matter reserved to the target State') (emphasis added).\n74 Ney, 'DOD General Counsel Remarks at US Cyber Command Legal Conference' ('[T]he principle of non-intervention prohibits \"actions designed to coerce a State [...] in contravention of its rights\").\n75 UNGA, 'Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions', at 57 (Intervention 'means compelling a state to take a course of action (whether an act or an omission) that it would not otherwise voluntarily pursue. The goal of the intervention must be to effect change in the behaviour of the target state').\n76 Ibid., at 77 ('In order for such intervention to be illegal under international law, it must be coerced, meaning that the goal of the intervention must be to effectively change the behavior of the target State').\n77 Ibid., at 25.\nHELAL\nan intervention must include the element of coercion that aims at influencing the state's decisions belonging to its domaine réservé.78 Again, using phrases like: 'the goal of' intervention, or saying that coercion is conduct 'that aims at', presupposes that the coercing State is acting intentionally. It indicates that the coercing State has identified a policy objective – an aim or a goal – which it is seeking to achieve by engaging in cyberoperations against another State.\n## 2.5 Sovereignty, Intervention, and the Use of Force: Demarcating the Doctrinal Boundaries\nIn addition to articulating definitions of coercion and offering examples of conduct that amounts to coercion, many States addressed the question of the relation between, on one hand, the prohibition on intervention and, on the other, the obligation to respect the territorial sovereignty of States and the prohibition on the threat or use of force. The content and scope of application of these three rules overlap significantly. As the ICJ observed in the Nicaragua Case, '[t]he effects of the principle of respect for territorial sovereignty inevitably overlap with those of the principles of the prohibition of the use of force and of non-intervention'.79\nTo disentangle the interconnection between these three rules, many States expressed views on the threshold of effects that must be crossed for conduct to amount to a violation of each of these rules. Surveying national and regional position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace reveals that States have approached this question from three different angles. The first relates to categories of conduct that – by their very nature – do not constitute a breach of the prohibition on intervention because they fall below the threshold of coercion. Nonetheless, some States noted that conduct that does not amount to intervention because it falls below the threshold of coercion may still be wrongful because it violates the principle of state sovereignty. The second is the higher threshold of coercion, which many States identified as the point at which non-intervention intersects with the prohibition on the threat or use of force. The third relates to the threshold at which non-forcible conduct – such as information operations, election interference, or economic sanctions – amount to coercion.\n78 Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 'The Republic of Poland's Position on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace'.\n79 Nicaragua v. USA, at para. 251.\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\n## 2.6 Conduct below the Threshold of Coercion\nMany States identified certain forms of conduct that do not amount to unlawful intervention because they are considered non-coercive. Several Western States argued that practices designed to persuade a State to change its behavior or to influence its policies are lawful, even if such practices involve criticism of that State. These Western States argued that such conduct is commonplace in international relations, which means that it should not be condemned as a form of intervention.⁸⁰ This was a point of convergence among Western States regardless of the definitions of coercion they adopted.\nFor example, in its position paper, Czechia, which defined coercion as acts that deprive a State of control over matters within its *domaine réservé*, stated that '[m]ere influencing, criticism or persuasion do not meet the requirements to be qualified as prohibited intervention'.⁸¹ Similarly, Denmark, which defined coercion as conduct that causes a State to behave in a manner it would not have engaged in voluntarily, stated that 'a distinction must be drawn between activities that merely involve influencing, as opposed to compelling, the voluntary actions of a target State. Acts of influence, such as persuasion, criticism, and public diplomacy are insufficient to qualify as an intervention'.⁸² Germany also noted that 'harsher forms of communication such as pointed commentary and sharp criticism as well as (persistent) attempts to obtain, through discussion, a certain reaction or the performance of a certain measure from another State do not as such qualify as coercion'.⁸³ Sweden also opined that 'criticism or other ways of influencing through diplomatic means' does not qualify as coercion.⁸⁴ Likewise, Canada, which was among the States that defined coercion as depriving a State of control over its *domaine réservé*, stated that '[c]oercion must be distinguished from other conduct such as public diplomacy, criticism, persuasion, and propaganda'.⁸⁵ The UK also distinguished between coercive conduct, which is unlawful, and the freedom of States 'to make their views known about processes in other countries – delivering hard, sometimes\n⁸⁰ See for example: Finnish Ministry for Foreign Affairs, 'Finland's Views on International Law and Cyberspace', at 463 ('[t]he requirement of coercion leaves out lesser forms of influence and persuasion that are commonplace in international relations').\n⁸¹ Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 'Position Paper on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace', at para. 13.\n⁸² Danish Government, 'Denmark's Position Paper on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace', at 450.\n⁸³ UNGA, 'Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions', at 34.\n⁸⁴ Swedish Government Offices, 'Position Paper on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace', at 3.\n⁸⁵ Canadian Government, 'International Law Applicable in Cyberspace'.\nHELAL\nunwelcome messages, and drawing attention to concerns. This is part and parcel of international relations.⁸⁶ Similarly, Austria stated that ‘[i]t is important to distinguish such disinformation campaigns from lawful public relations activities of state representatives, including e.g. by openly criticising the human rights situation in another state on social media accounts or websites’.⁸⁷\nThe Common African Position adopted a different approach regarding conduct that falls below the threshold of coercion. It stated: ‘offers or calls to peacefully settle disputes through negotiation, enquiry, mediation, conciliation, good offices, arbitration, and judicial settlement, and diplomatic discussions and communications are presumed not to constitute acts of coercion’.⁸⁸ The first portion of this sentence is based on Article 33 of the UN Charter. It indicates that efforts to settle disputes peacefully are not considered coercive. The second portion of this sentence – ‘diplomatic discussions and communications are presumed not to constitute acts of coercion’ – was designed to signal that diplomatic correspondences, whether written or verbal, are generally not considered coercive. The keyword here is *presumed*, which was inserted because history is replete with cases in which diplomatic communications were employed as instruments of coercion. Perhaps the most (in)famous ultimatum ever – the Austro-Hungarian ultimatum to Serbia that started World War I – was delivered via a diplomatic note.⁸⁹ Similarly, in a series of meetings that were held in 1945 and 1946 between Soviet and Turkish diplomats, the USSR attempted to coerce Turkey into redrawing the international frontier between the two States and granting the USSR access to and control over the Turkish straits.⁹⁰\nThis sentence in the Common African Position was also intended to signal that the member States of the African Union did not share the view adopted by Western States that other practices such as public diplomacy, criticism, propaganda, unwelcome messages and other conduct that, for instance, the UK described as ‘part and parcel of international relations’ could never be coercive.\nThis approach in the Common African Position is consistent with the positions expressed by African and other developing States during the negotiations on the 1970 Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning\n⁸⁶ Braverman, ‘International Law in Future Frontiers’.\n⁸⁷ Austrian Government, ‘Position Paper of the Republic of Austria’, at 5.\n⁸⁸ ‘Common African Position’, at para. 32.\n⁸⁹ See ‘Austria’s Ultimatum to Serbia: Full Text of the Document That Started the World War, and Serbia’s Reply to It’ (1918) 9 Current History 554–558.\n⁹⁰ O.

During discussions on that declaration, several Western States proposed adding a caveat that stated that non-intervention did not affect\n[t]he generally recognized freedom of states to seek to influence the policies and actions of other states, in accordance with international law and settled international practice and in a manner compatible with the principle of sovereign equality States and the duty to cooperate in accordance with the Charter.[91]\nNon-Western States opposed this proposal because innocuous phrases like 'settled international practice' or acts that 'seek to influence the policies and actions of other states' were viewed as a potential backdoor that would justify interventionist policies by powerful States.[92] For African States, determining whether 'criticism', 'public diplomacy', or so-called 'unwelcome messages' amount to intervention can only be established on the basis of an holistic, case-by-case evaluation of the facts.\nSeveral States also argued that, because of the element of coercion, the threshold that must be crossed for conduct to amount to intervention was higher than that which applied to violations of state sovereignty.[93] Switzerland's position paper expressed this understanding of the relationship between these two principles – sovereignty and non-intervention – clearly. It stated:\n91 UNGA, 'Joint Proposal by Australia, Canada, France, Italy, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America' in 'Report of the 1966 Special Committee on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Co-Operation Among States' (27 June 1966) UN Doc.

For example, Denmark underscored that 'coercion is not limited to means of direct or indirect use of force and that also measures below this threshold may constitute coercion'.¹⁰² Similarly, Germany stated: '[m]alicious cyber activities will only in some cases amount to direct or indirect use of force. However, measures below this threshold may also qualify as coercive'.¹⁰³ The UK and the US also expressed this view.¹⁰⁴\nThe Common African Position did not take an express position on whether there is a distinction between the threshold of the use of force and the threshold of intervention. Rather, the Common African Position affirmed that the prohibition on intervention is a broad rule that applies to any forcible or non-forcible instrument of statecraft that might be used as means of coercion. It stated: '[t]he prohibition on intervention applies to the use of any instrument, including armed, political, economic, or any other means, and instruments of information, that may be used by a State for the purposes of intervening in the\n100 Canadian Government, 'International Law Applicable in Cyberspace', at para. 23 ('In its most serious form, coercion may arise through the threat or use of force').\n101 Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, 'National Position of France (2019)' (9 September 2019), available at <https: cyberlaw.ccdcoe.org=\"\" national_position_of_france_(2019)=\"\" wiki=\"\"> (France: 'Depending on the extent of their intrusion or their effects, they may violate the principles of sovereignty, non-intervention or even the prohibition of the threat or use of force'); UNGA, 'Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions', at 57 (The Netherlands: '[T]he use of force will always meet the definition of coercion.

It stated: 'the customary norm prohibiting intervention in the internal affairs of another State applies irrespective of the means or medium used and extends to the use of ICTs by States'.¹⁰⁶ Similarly, Costa Rica stated:\nCoercion is clear-cut when a State uses or threatens to use force against another one. Nonetheless, it can also occur in a multitude of ways where one State, directly or indirectly through support for non-State actors, deprives another State of the capacity to make free and informed choices pertaining to its internal or external affairs.¹⁰⁷\nIn short, there is evidence of a consensus among those States that have issued national or regional position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace that the threat or use of force is, *ipso facto*, a form of coercion that is wrongful under both the prohibition on the threat or use of force and the prohibition on intervention. These position papers also show that there is a consensus on the principle that non-forcible conduct could also amount to intervention. The point of divergence, however, relates to the threshold of coercion that applies to non-forcible conduct. This is the subject of the next section.\n## 2.8 The Threshold of Non-forcible Coercion\nThis question of the exact threshold at which non-forcible conduct amounts to coercion is of critical importance. This is because most acts of unlawful intervention that could be undertaken through cyberspace are likely to fall below the threshold of forcible intervention. For example, activities such as election interference or disinformation campaigns will almost always fall below the threshold of the use of force.¹⁰⁸ In fact, this is precisely the area – conduct below the threshold of the use of force, but above the threshold of violations of territorial sovereignty – where the prohibition on intervention is most relevant.\n¹⁰⁵ Helal, ‘Common African Position’, at para. 29.\n¹⁰⁶ UNGA, ‘Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions’, at 18.\n¹⁰⁷ Costa Rican Ministry of Foreign Affairs, ‘Costa Rica’s Position on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace’, at 7.\n¹⁰⁸ M. Schmitt, “Virtual” Disenfranchisement: Cyber Election Meddling in the Grey Zones of International Law’ (2018) 19 Chicago Journal of International Law 30–67, at 40 (Arguing that ‘because of the relatively high consequential threshold for violation, it is unlikely, although not inconceivable, that cyber election meddling would qualify as an unlawful use of force’).\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\nNational and regional position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace reveal that there is no consistency among States on the question of the threshold of coercion that applies to non-forcible intervention. This lack of consistency is evident even among States that adopted the same definition of coercion. In other words, even where there is some convergence among States on the meaning of coercion at a theoretical level, there are notable divergences on how the concept of coercion applies in real-world situations.\nAmong the States that defined coercion as conduct that modifies the behavior of a State or causes it to act involuntarily, there were notable differences in the terminology used to describe the threshold that applies to non-forcible coercion. Germany contended that, to constitute an act of intervention, a cyberoperation must be 'comparable in scale and effect to coercion in non-cyber contexts'. According to Germany, to meet the threshold of coercion, a cyberoperation must have the effect of 'significantly influenc[ing] or thwart[ing]' the decision-making process of a State to the point where its 'will is manifestly bent'.[109] Although it did not specify a definite threshold that non-forcible conduct must meet to constitute an act of intervention, Switzerland noted that a cyberoperation could amount to economic coercion if it paralyzed the operation of a 'company that is systemically relevant'.[110]\nOn the other hand, Poland indicated that, to constitute coercion, the foreign State's conduct must 'adversely affect' the 'functioning and security of the political, economic, military or social system of a state'.[111] Norway also provided examples of non-forcible coercive conduct that included 'manipulating election systems', 'unduly influencing public opinion', and 'causing a temporary shutdown' of critical infrastructure.[112]\nDenmark and Romania, both of which also defined coercion as conduct that modifies the behavior of a State or causes it to act involuntarily, did not explicitly identify a specific threshold at which non-forcible conduct could be considered coercive. Instead, Romania stated that an act of intervention must be intended to 'effectively change' the behavior of a State and underscored that 'there has to be a causal nexus between the coercive act and the effect on the internal or external affairs of the target State'.[113] Denmark's position paper also stated that 'an act may be considered of a coercive nature when the act\n109 UNGA, 'Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions', at 34.\n110 Ibid., at 88.\n111 Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 'The Republic of Poland's Position on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace'.\n112 UNGA, 'Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions', at 68.\n113 Ibid., at 77.\nHELAL\nof interference has a potential for compelling the target State to engage in an action that it would otherwise not take.¹¹⁴\nTo this writer, the thresholds of coercion adopted by Germany and Switzerland are substantially higher than the thresholds adopted by Poland and Norway. The phrase ‘significantly influencing or thwarting’ that was used by Germany and the words ‘paralysis’ and ‘systemically relevant’ that Switzerland used signify a notably higher threshold of coercion than the term ‘adverse effects’ that was used by Poland and the phrases ‘manipulating election systems’ and ‘unduly influencing public opinion’ that Norway used. Denmark appears to have adopted an even lower threshold of coercion. For Denmark, a cyberoperation need not have an actual effect on the target State to be considered wrongful under the prohibition on intervention. Rather, a cyberoperation that merely has the ‘potential for compelling’ a State crosses the threshold of coercion. On the other hand, for Romania, the ‘potential’ to compel a State is insufficient. Rather, to constitute intervention, Romania requires that a State must be the target of a cyberoperation that has a measurable effect on the coerced State and that is causally connected to the behavior of the coercing State.\nThere are similar inconsistencies among the States that defined coercion as conduct that deprives a State of its freedom of choice or control over its domaine réservé. Australia, New Zealand, and Canada adopted broadly similar definitions of the threshold of coercion. According to Australia, conduct is coercive if it ‘effectively deprive[s]’ or is ‘intended to deprive’ a State of control over matters of an inherently sovereign nature.¹¹⁵ As discussed above, for Australia, examples of coercion include: ‘manipulating the electoral system to alter the results of an election’ or undermining the ‘fundamental operation of Parliament’ or the ‘stability of States’ financial systems.¹¹⁶ Similarly, for New Zealand, conduct is coercive if it has ‘significant effects’ on a State’s domaine réservé.¹¹⁷ Examples of acts that meet this threshold include ‘manipulating the voting tally’ in an election, preventing a ‘significant part of the electorate’ from voting, and causing ‘significant damage’ or ‘loss of functionality’ to critical infrastructure.¹¹⁸ According to Canada, intervention is conduct that has ‘coercive\n¹¹⁴ Danish Government, ‘Denmark’s Position Paper on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace’, at 450.\n¹¹⁵ UNGA, ‘Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions’, at 5.\n¹¹⁶ Ibid.\n¹¹⁷ New Zealand Foreign Affairs and Trade, ‘The Application of International Law to State Activity in Cyberspace’, at para. 9(b).\n¹¹⁸ Ibid.\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\neffects that deprive, compel, or impose an outcome on the affected State'. Again, as noted above, for Canada, examples of coercion include influencing the outcome of an election through a cyberoperation that 'hacks and disables a State's election commission' or by 'preventing a significant number of citizens from voting', in addition to 'disrupt[ing] the functioning of a major gas pipeline' to affect a State's negotiating position.[119] Finland provided similar examples of coercion. It noted that to constitute intervention in an election, the conduct of a foreign State must 'be of a serious nature', examples of which are altering electoral results through 'hacking of voter databases or manipulation of vote'.[120]\nBrazil, Czechia, Costa Rica, and the UK used different terms to describe the threshold of coercion. Brazil understood coercion as conduct 'affecting the right' of a State to choose its political, economic, social and cultural system and to formulate its foreign policy.[121] Czechia stated that an act is coercive if it 'intentionally aims to influence the State's free will and choice'.[122] For Costa Rica, conduct amounts to coercion if it impinges on a State's ability to make 'free and informed choices'. As noted above, Costa Rica also provided several examples of coercive conduct. These included: 'subversive or hostile propaganda', 'dissemination of false news', 'significant political or economic pressure', 'crippling or simply interfering' with public services, 'interfering with ballots or voter databases', and 'electoral disinformation campaigns'.[123] Like Costa Rica, the UK provided a wide-range of examples of coercive conduct. These included 'disruption of systems controlling emergency medical transport', 'causing hospital computer systems to cease functioning', 'disruption of supply chains for essential medicines and vaccines', 'preventing the operation of power generation infrastructure' or disrupting power supplies to 'housing, healthcare, education, civil administration and banking facilities and infrastructure', interfering with 'financial services' that are crucial to a State's financial system, and disrupting a State's 'fundamental ability to conduct monetary policy'.[124]\nTo this writer, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada adopted a higher threshold of coercion than that which Brazil, Czechia, Costa Rica, and the UK adopted. The former repeatedly used the word 'significant' to describe the\n119 Canadian Government, 'International Law Applicable in Cyberspace'.\n120 Finnish Ministry for Foreign Affairs, 'Finland's Views on International Law and Cyberspace', at 463.\n121 UNGA, 'Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions', at 18.\n122 Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 'Position Paper on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace', at para. 9.\n123 Costa Rican Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 'Costa Rica's Position on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace', at 7-8.\n124 Braverman, 'International Law in Future Frontiers'.\nHELAL\neffects that the conduct of a State must have in order to constitute coercion. Moreover, for those States, election interference must actually alter the results of an election to amount to intervention. Brazil, Czechia, Costa Rica, and the UK, however, used terms and phrases such as 'affecting', 'aims to influence', and 'free and informed choices' to describe the effects of the conduct of a foreign State. These terms signify a lower threshold of coercion. Indeed, unlike Australia, New Zealand, and Canada, the position papers of Brazil, Czechia, Costa Rica, and the UK did not require election interference to rise to the level of changing the results of an election to amount to intervention. Rather, these States used terms that would condemn as unlawful a broader range of forms of election interference. The UK, for instance, stated that covert operations that 'interfere with free and fair electoral processes' are a form of coercion,[125] while Costa Rica stated that launching disinformation campaigns and the dissemination of false news could constitute forms of unlawful electoral interference.\nAs noted above, the Common African Position did not identify a specific threshold at which non-forcible conduct amounts to coercion. Rather, the Common African Position noted that the definition of coercion requires further study among States, and explicitly rejected the thresholds that other States adopted in their position papers. The Common African Position stated: 'it is not necessary, in order to constitute coercion, that the conduct of a State must rise to the level of completely depriving a foreign State of its freedom of choice or to compel that State to either act or refrain from acting involuntarily'.[126]\nThis review of national and regional position papers reveals that there are three points of convergence among States on the question of the thresholds that delineate the boundaries of the prohibition on intervention. First, there is a consensus that the threat or use of force always crosses the threshold of coercion. Second, there is a consensus that non-intervention is a broad rule that covers both forcible and non-forcible forms of coercion. Third, there is a consensus that there are certain forms of conduct that, by their very nature, fall below the threshold of coercion. There is no consensus, however, on a specific list or catalogue of acts that are ipso facto non-coercive. However, given the positions expressed by Western States, it is reasonable to conclude that there is at least a general concurrence on the view expressed in the Common African Position that calls to settle disputes peacefully are not coercive. Beyond that, the main point of divergence among States relates to the threshold at which non-forcible conduct amounts to coercion. Indeed, as Canada noted: 'further\n125 Ibid.\n126 Helal, 'Common African Position', at para. 32.\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\nState practice and opinio juris will help clarify the thresholds for the rule of non-intervention, and the scope of customary law in this area over time'.127\nThis is a question of paramount importance to understanding how non-intervention applies in cyberspace and other domains. As noted above, the utility of the prohibition on intervention is that it protects States against conduct that is more serious than an infringement on the territorial sovereignty of a State but that does not rise to the level of a threat or use of force. This issue – the threshold at which non-forcible conduct amounts to coercion – has not been addressed by the ICJ and remains a subject of scholarly debate.128\nSome scholars have argued that coercion is unsuited to function as an element of the prohibition on intervention, at least as it applies in cyberspace. For example, Duncan Hollis has opined that coercion may not be readily applicable to influence operations that use cyberspace to manipulate public opinion or disrupt the domestic political processes of a foreign State, such as Russia's interference in the 2016 US presidential election.129 Similarly, Ido Kilovaty has written that 'the norm of non-intervention, in its current narrow understanding, is almost irrelevant in a world where States increasingly resort to cyber operations as a method of interference [...] Coercion cannot contain the diversity of threats posed by new technologies. A new standard is, therefore, required'.130\nIn my view, we do not need a new standard. The challenge facing the application of the prohibition on intervention in cyberspace, and in other domains such as economic sanctions, is that there is no agreement among States on either the definition of coercion or on the minimum threshold of effects that must be met for conduct to constitute coercion. Any understanding of non-intervention must include a conceptual tool that distinguishes between unlawful intervention and lawful conduct that influences the policies of States. Whether that conceptual tool is called 'coercion', 'dictatorial interference',131\n127 Canadian Government, 'International Law Applicable in Cyberspace'.\n128 A.

What matters is the threshold of effects that defines and captures the essence of ‘coercion’, which can be applied to determine when specific conduct amounts to intervention. This is the question that Section 3 of this article addresses.\n## 3 Towards a Unified Threshold of Coercion\nIt is impossible, given the limitations of space, to comprehensively address the question of the threshold of coercion that applies to non-forcible conduct. This is a topic that requires further research. Nonetheless, in this section, this article will offer a general sketch of a threshold that could be employed to determine when non-forcible conduct amounts to coercion, thereby violating the prohibition on intervention. Specifically, this section proposes the adoption of a single, unified threshold of coercion that applies equally to both forcible and non-forcible intervention. According to this approach, non-forcible conduct would amount to coercion if its scale and effects are comparable to conduct that amounts to a violation of the prohibition on the threat or use of force.\nTwo considerations support this approach. The first is historical. Throughout its evolution, the prohibition on intervention was understood as a cognate of the prohibition on the threat or use of force.¹³⁴ Non-intervention was designed to extend the protections afforded to States under the prohibition on the threat or use of force to non-forcible – but no less pernicious – instruments of statecraft. The second consideration is conceptual. The definitions of coercion that appear in national position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace that some States have issued impose an unreasonably high threshold of effects that must be met for non-forcible conduct to amount to an act of intervention. Defining coercion as causing a State to act ‘involuntarily’ or ‘depriving’ it of freedom of choice requires causing effects or\n¹³² R. Buchan and N. Tsagourias, ‘The Crisis in Crimea and the Principle of Non-Intervention’ (2017) 19 International Community Law Review 165–193, at 171 (‘Coercion denotes “imperative pressure” which manipulates the will of a state in order to extract some advantage or concession’).\n¹³³ T.

Such understandings of coercion would significantly reduce the scope of the prohibition on intervention, and lead to the paradoxical outcome where non-forcible methods of intervention are governed by a higher threshold of coercion than armed intervention, which is the gravest form of intervention. This is because nothing in *jus ad bellum* requires the effects of a threat or use of force to be of such gravity that it causes a State to act involuntarily or deprives it of freedom of choice.\nBefore proceeding, one point merits special emphasis. The unified threshold of coercion that I propose here should not be understood as signaling that the prohibition on the use of force and the prohibition on intervention are coterminous. At least one writer has recently suggested that ‘under the *lex lata* the prohibition on intervention only applies to acts amounting to a use of force or constituting support for the violent overthrow of a foreign regime’.¹³⁵ I disagree. As discussed below, at least since the adoption of the 1970 Friendly Relations Declaration, there has been a consensus among States that non-intervention is a broad rule that proscribes all forms of intervention, whether undertaken through forcible or non-forcible means. However, because there is no agreement among States on the meaning of coercion, there is continued uncertainty regarding when non-forcible conduct amounts to unlawful intervention. The unified threshold of coercion addresses this question by proposing a single test that applies to all forms of intervention, including armed force, or the use of political, economic, or informational instruments of statecraft, or some combination thereof.\n## 3.1 Coercion in the History of the Prohibition on Intervention\nAs argued in detail in another study by the present author, until the *Nicaragua Case* was decided by the ICJ in 1986, the concept of coercion was not defined, nor was it viewed as the cornerstone of the prohibition on intervention.¹³⁶ Moreover, throughout its evolution, States never understood intervention as conduct that causes a State to act involuntarily or that deprives it of its freedom of choice or control over its domestic jurisdiction. This is why, to this writer, the definitions of coercion that States have included in their national and regional position papers should be viewed as proposals *de lege ferenda*, and not restatements of established *lex lata*. To substantiate this claim, this\n¹³⁵ O. Pomson, ‘The Prohibition on Intervention Under International Law and Cyber Operations’ (2022) 99 International Law Studies 180–219, at 183.\n¹³⁶ M.

This overview begins with three Inter-American treaties that first included non-intervention as a distinct rule of international law, followed by the 1970 Friendly Relations Declaration, the adoption of which marked the acceptance of the prohibition on intervention as a rule of general international law.\nThe prohibition on intervention originated as a rule of conventional international law in the Inter-American system. It was first codified in Article 8 of the 1933 Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States, which reads as follows: 'No State has the right to intervene in the internal or external affairs of another'.[137] The prohibition on intervention was further reaffirmed and its scope was expanded with the adoption of the 1936 Additional Protocol Relative to Non-Intervention, Article I of which states: 'The High Contracting Parties declare inadmissible the intervention of any one of them, directly or indirectly, and for whatever reason, in the internal or external affairs of any other of the Parties'.[138]\nThe principal purpose of these provisions was to overturn the right of States to resort to acts of intervention, which was established under 19th century international law. At the time, States were permitted wage war or to engage in so-called measures short of war – i.e., acts of intervention – for an expansive range of reasons.[139] These included preserving the balance of power, repelling attacks against a State's territory, preempting an imminent armed attack, obtaining reparation for injuries inflicted on the interests or honor of the State, protecting the lives and property of citizens, securing the repayment of debts, and preventing mass atrocities.[140] Intervention was accepted as permissible\n137 Convention on the Rights and Duties of States Adopted by the Seventh International Conference of American States (signed 26 December 1933, entered into force 26 December 1934) 165 LNTS 19, at 21.\n138 Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Division of International Law, International Conferences of American States: First Supplement, 1933-1940 (Carnegie Endowment for International Peace 1940), at 191.\n139 See for example J.

However, during the negotiations on the 1933 Montevideo Convention, a subcommittee composed of Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, Ecuador, El-Salvador, Haiti, and Peru that had been entrusted with drafting the convention prepared a report that provides an insight into how the negotiating parties understood the term 'intervention'. In its report, the subcommittee defined 'the juridical concept of intervention' as follows:\nAny act of a State, through diplomatic representation, by armed force, or by any other means involving effective force, with a view to making the State's will dominate the will of another State, and, in general, any maneuver, interference or interposition of any sort, employing such means, either directly or indirectly in matter of the obligations of another State, whatever its motive, shall be considered as Intervention, and likewise a violation of International Law.\nIt would seem quite unnecessary to state that the Sub-Committee was, and is, in perfect accord that any friendly act to offer good offices and\n141 R.

This applies also to the united action of the formation of the League of Nations, the universal peace agent, of which the majority of the American States are members.^[146]^\nThe first sentence of this definition is instructive. The key phrase here is 'effective force with a view to making the State's will dominate the will of another State'. To this writer, it indicates that the drafters of the 1933 Montevideo Convention understood intervention as encompassing the use of armed force and any non-forcible conduct the effects of which are comparable to the use of force. This understanding of intervention was echoed by several States during the negotiations on the convention. Ecuador, for example stated: 'We have outlawed war. What is intervention but a kind of war, disguised and wary.'^[147]^ Argentina also stated: 'What is intervention, then, but violence? [...] Intervention is violence.'^[148]^ El Salvador also defined intervention in identical terms. It stated: 'Because the American conscience is such that territorial acquisitions originated by violence cannot be recognized; that violence has generally come to disturb the life of our countries in the form of intervention.'^[149]^ Peru shared this understanding of intervention. It argued in favor of adopting Article 8 of the 1933 Montevideo Convention because 'war is proscribed, so is violence, but not the use of arms, the diplomatic measures or any other means of effective compulsion.'^[150]^\nThe Charter of the Organization of American States, which was adopted in 1948,^[151]^ incorporated and expanded on the provisions on non-intervention in the 1933 Montevideo Convention and the 1936 Non-Intervention Protocol. Article 19 and 20 of the OAS Charter state:\n## Article 19\nNo State or group of States has the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatever, in the internal or external affairs of any other State. The foregoing principle prohibits not only armed force but also any\n146 Seventh International Conference of American States, First, Second, &amp; Eighth Committees: Minutes and Antecedents 165 (Montevideo, 1933).\n147 Ibid., at 113.\n148 Ibid., at 113.\n149 Ibid., at 126.\n150 Ibid., at 123.\n151 Articles 19–20 Charter of the Organization of American States.\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\n549\nother form of interference or attempted threat against the personality of the State or against its political, economic, and cultural elements.\n## Article 20\nNo State may use or encourage the use of coercive measures of an economic or political character in order to force the sovereign will of another State and obtain from it advantages of any kind.\nArticle 19 of the OAS Charter includes two sentences, the first of which is virtually identical to Article 1 of 1936 Non-Intervention Protocol, which itself was based on Article 8 of the 1933 Montevideo Convention. Like its antecedents, the principal purpose of the first sentence of Article 19 was to reaffirm that, at least in Inter-American international law, the right of intervention that was recognized in 19th century international law was abolished. The inclusion of the phrase 'for whatever reason', which first appeared in the 1936 Non-Intervention Protocol, also indicated that non-intervention was an absolute rule that admitted no exceptions. Accordingly, the grounds that had previously been invoked to justify intervention – such as protecting citizens abroad, collecting debts, or enforcing international law – were no longer valid.\nThe second sentence of Article 19 clarified a principle that was only implicit in the 1933 Montevideo Convention and the 1936 Non-Intervention Protocol. It confirmed that non-intervention proscribed both the use of armed force and any other instrument of statecraft to engage in acts of intervention. Although, as noted above, the subcommittee that drafted the 1933 Montevideo Convention had affirmed that intervention could be undertaken 'through diplomatic representation, by armed force, or any other means involving effective force', this was not explicitly stated in either the 1933 Montevideo Convention or the 1936 Non-Intervention Protocol. The second sentence of Article 19 was also intended to prohibit acts of subversion that seek to impinge on the political independence of a State by subjugating it or transforming it into a satellite of a foreign power or that undermine its capacity to manage its political, economic, and cultural affairs autonomously.[152]\n152 The inclusion of this sentence was probably driven by political developments that occurred during the Bogota Conference during which the OAS Charter was drafted. On April 9, 1948, while the conference was ongoing, the leader of the Colombian Liberal Party, Jorge Gaitán was assassinated. This sparked violent riots during which Colombia's Capitol building, in which the Bogota Conference was being held, was burned down. Almost immediately, communist agitators were blamed and the US claimed that Moscow\nHELAL\nArticle 20 of the OAS Charter is the first provision in which the term ‘coercion’ is used in relation to the prohibition on intervention. Coercion was not used, however, in order to signify the defining characteristic of intervention, nor was it designed to function as the conceptual tool that distinguishes between unlawful intervention and lawful conduct that seeks to influence the behavior of States. Rather, the authors of the OAS Charter drafted Article 20 with two objectives in mind. First, this provision was intended to proscribe economic sanctions that are imposed unilaterally by a State in response to an injury inflicted upon it by another State, and second, it was intended to outlaw the use of economic or political instruments of statecraft to pressure a State into giving concessions against its will. This becomes apparent from the negotiating history of Article 20.\nThis provision was formulated on the basis of two proposals that were submitted by Brazil and Cuba during the negotiations on the OAS Charter. The Cuban proposal stated: ‘No American State may unilaterally apply to another coercive measures of an economic nature that constitute retaliation or that tend to force the sovereign will of the State against which it is applied’.¹⁵³ Similarly, the Brazilian proposal stated:\nIt is prohibited for a State to exercise or support economic or political pressure on any other, in order to obtain advantages of any nature from that other State, not including, however, in the category of pressure the sanctions adopted in accordance with a determination of a competent international body. The American State that feels that it is subjected to economic or political pressure from any other State, that State has the\nwas responsible and Colombia severed diplomatic relations with the USSR. This led the conference to adopt a resolution titled: ‘The Preservation and Defence of Democracy’ that condemned ‘interference by any foreign power, or by any political organization serving the interests of a foreign power, in the political life of the nations of the American continent’ and committed the member States of the OAS to take ‘the measures necessary to eradicate and prevent activities directed, assisted or instigated by foreign governments, organizations or individuals tending to overthrow their institutions by violence, to foment disorder in their domestic political life or to disturb, by means of pressure, subversive propaganda, threats or by any other means, the free and sovereign right of their peoples to govern themselves in accordance with their democratic aspirations’.

In its report the subcommittee explained the purpose of this provision as follows:\n[T]he two essential characteristics of the proposed text are the following: First, it condemns any action or attempted action that tends to force a State, despite its sovereignty, to adopt any attitude that State deems contrary to its interests; and second, such condemnation is in no way affected by the nature of the benefits sought by the State that exercises or encourages the coercive action. The members of the Subcommittee present were in complete agreement with the fact that the proposed text does not affect in any way the application of sanctions of an economic nature authorized by certain international organizations by virtue of current pacts.^[155]^\nThe negotiating history of the three Inter-American treaties in which the prohibition on intervention was first codified does not provide support for the definitions of coercion that many States have adopted in their national position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace. In fact, the concept of coercion was not even the subject of any in-depth discussions during the drafting of these treaties. Rather, the term coercion was only introduced in Article 20 of the OAS Charter specifically to outlaw the imposition of unilateral economic sanctions. Likewise, there is little in the negotiations on the principal instruments that were adopted on non-intervention by the UN that supports the definitions of coercion that appear in national position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace.\n^[154]^ Ibid., at 83.\n^[155]^ Novena Conferencia Internacional Americana, Actas y Documentos, Vol. II: Comisiones Reglamentarias, Comisión de Credenciales – Comisión de Iniciativas – Comisión de Coordinación – Comisión de Estilo (Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de Colombia 1953), at 387–388. It should be noted that during the negotiations on this provision, the US agreed that the unilateral imposition of economic sanctions is unlawful. See Ninth International Conference of American States, Bogotá, Colombia, March 30–May 2, 1948: Report of the Delegation of the United States of America with Related Documents (Department of State Publication No. 8262, November 1948) (In its official report on the proceedings of the Bogota Conference, the US delegation stated: ‘the principle that no nation should indulge in unilateral economic sanctions is, of course, valid’).\nHELAL\nAlthough the prohibition on intervention was not codified in the UN Charter,¹⁵⁶ it was included in many instruments that were subsequently negotiated at the UN. These include the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the 1963 Vienna Convention on Consular Relations,¹⁵⁷ the 1949 Declaration on the Rights and Duties and States and the 1954 Code of Offenses Against the Peace and Security of Mankind both of which were drafted by the International Law Commission,¹⁵⁸ in addition to several General Assembly resolutions such as Resolution 31/91 on Non-Interference in the Internal Affairs of States,¹⁵⁹ and the 1981 Declaration on the Inadmissibility of Intervention and Interference in the Internal Affairs of States.¹⁶⁰ It is impossible in this article to provide a complete account of how the principle of non-intervention was articulated in these UN instruments. Therefore, I will focus here on the negotiations on non-intervention in the 1970 Friendly Relations Declaration, which contains the most authoritative expression of the prohibition on intervention.¹⁶¹\nDuring the negotiations on the 1970 Friendly Relations Declaration and the 1965 Declaration on the Inadmissibility of Intervention in the Domestic Affairs of States, on which the section on non-intervention in the 1970 Friendly Relations Declaration was based, coercion was neither defined nor was it considered the distinguishing characteristic of intervention.¹⁶² Rather, the\n¹⁵⁶ It is often mistakenly assumed that Article 2(7) of the UN Charter is a codification of the prohibition on intervention. It is not. This provision does not govern interstate relations. Rather, it applies to the conduct of the UN, as a distinct legal person, in its relations with its member States. See G.

Initially, many (mostly Western) States answered this question in the affirmative. To those States, the prohibition on intervention was limited to proscribing the direct and indirect use of armed force by States.¹⁶³ Conversely, Non-Aligned and Eastern Bloc States, insisted that non-intervention was a broader rule that prohibited all forms of the use of force and other non-forcible forms of conduct. Ultimately, the broader understanding of non-intervention was adopted. It was accepted that this rule outlawed the use of any instrument of statecraft – whether forcible or non-forcible – that may be employed to infringe on the domestic jurisdiction of States. There was, however, no attempt during these negotiations to formulate a threshold that determines when non-forcible conduct amounts to intervention. Instead, most States either identified specific forms of conduct that, in their view, amounted to intervention, or simply described intervention as the exertion of pressure against a State.¹⁶⁴\n¹⁶³ 1964) UN Doc. A/AC.119/SR.28, at 5. Similarly, France stated: ‘any attempt to define intervention must cover [...] the idea of coercion, i.e., of abnormal or improper pressure exercised by one State on another State in order to force it to change its internal structure in a direction favorable to the interests of the State applying such coercion’. Ibid., at 10. Mexico also noted that, in addition to outlawing the use of force, the prohibition on intervention was designed to outlaw ‘coercive measures of an economic or political nature’. Mexico did not, however, offer a definition of coercion. Rather, it stated that in order to distinguish between lawful pressure and unlawful intervention the ‘criterion of the illegality of such coercion was the object sought’.

See UN ILC, Yearbook of the International Law Commission 1949, vol. 1, at 90, para. 4. Similarly, during the early stages of the negotiations on the 1970 Friendly Relations Declaration, the UK argued that: ‘[t]he prohibition of the use or threat of force had absorbed much of the classic conception of intervention, which had always been regarded as connoting forcible or dictatorial interference’. See UNGA, ‘Special Committee on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation Among States, First Session, Summary Records of the Twenty-Eighth Meeting’ (23 October 1964) UN Doc.

That text did not refer to coercion at all. Instead, it defined intervention as either the use of armed force or conduct 'of such design and effect as to impair or destroy the political independence or territorial integrity of another State'.[165] Those six States explained that the latter sentence was broadly synonymous to the phrase 'to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights' that appears in the 1970 Friendly Relations Declaration.[166] According to those States, their proposed formulation provided a better juridical expression of the scope and content of the prohibition on intervention.[167]\nof economic pressure'); UNGA, 'First Committee, 1422nd Meeting, Twentieth Session' (20 December 1965) UN Doc.

Intervention was never understood as an act that causes a State to behave involuntarily or that deprives it of freedom of choice or control over matters within its domestic jurisdiction. That is why the definitions of coercion and the approaches of applying the prohibition on intervention that appear in these position papers should be viewed as proposals for the progressive development of international law in this area. In other words, these are proposals *de lege ferenda*.\n## 3.2 Coercion as Conduct Comparable to the Use of Force\nIn addition to being unfounded in *lex lata*, defining coercion as acts that cause a State to behave involuntarily or that deprive a State of its freedom of choice or control over matters its domestic jurisdiction is conceptually flawed for two reasons. First, it would be incoherent to apply to non-forcible intervention that is undertaken through instruments such as information operations or economic sanctions a threshold of coercion that is higher than that which applies to the use of armed force, which is the gravest form of intervention. Second, even if one were to ignore the inconsistency between the thresholds of forcible and non-forcible intervention, the definitions of coercion that apply to the latter that some States have adopted are unreasonably high and severely restrict the scope of application of the prohibition on intervention. This section addresses these two points.\nAs noted above, virtually all position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace affirmed that the threat or use of force is *ipso facto* coercive. Many States also underscored that the use of force is the gravest form of coercion. This reflects the principle that the prohibition on the use of force is a peremptory rule of international law. Paradoxically, however, if, as many States propose, coercion is defined as conduct that causes a State to behave involuntarily or that deprives it of freedom of choice or control, non-forcible conduct would be governed by a higher threshold than that which applies to armed intervention. This is because, under *jus ad bellum*, the threshold of scale\njuridical language', and added that this proposal 'drew attention to the fact that no action of whatever character should be taken which would in any way impair or destroy the territorial integrity or political independence of States – ideas which were clearly recognized and defined in international law'.

Schmitt, 'The Use of Cyber Force and International Law' in M. Weller (ed.), The Oxford Handbook of the Use of Force in International Law (Oxford University Press 2016) 1110–1130, at 1120 (The authors of the Tallinn Manual 'agreed that a cyber operation resulting in significant death of or injury to persons, or damage to or destruction of property, evidenced the requisite scale and effects to qualify as an armed attack').\n169 See M. Schmitt and A. Pakkam, 'Cyberspace and the Jus ad Bellum: The State of Play' (2024) 103 International Law Studies 194–229.\n170 In my view, under jus ad bellum, there is no de minimis threshold of effects that must be met for conduct to amount to a use of force. The only requirement is that the conduct in question must involve the use of armed force by a State that causes death or injury to individuals or physical damage to property. Nonetheless, this writer agrees with Christian Henderson and Erin Pobjie that an inquiry into the scale and effects of a putative use of force might be necessary in order to determine whether the conduct in question is an instance of the use of force by a State in its international relations, as the term is used in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, or an instance of the use of force for the purposes of law enforcement. See C. Henderson, The Use of Force and International Law (Cambridge University Press 2018), at 69; E. Pobjie, Prohibited Force: The Meaning of 'Use of Force' in International Law (Cambridge University Press 2024), at 142. As Erin Pobjie notes, the gravity element is 'relevant to the contextual element of whether the act occurs in \"international relations\". For example, acts of a higher gravity are more likely to be perceived by States as of a military rather than law enforcement nature and thus as engaging their international relations [...] Also, acts of higher gravity may evince a hostile or coercive intention (discussed in the following section) with respect to another State and thus engage \"international relations\" on that basis'.\n171 O.

The threshold that must be met for an act to constitute an instance of the use of force is low. Even the threshold for an armed attack, the gravest form of the use of force, is relatively low.175 As the International Law Association noted, 'it appears that the gravity threshold attached to armed attacks is not markedly high, and would include most uses of force likely to cause casualties or significant property damage'.176\nCompared to the threshold of the use of force, the definitions of coercion that many States have adopted in their national position papers impose a much higher threshold of coercion for non-forcible conduct. Nothing in *jus ad bellum* requires the use of force to be of such gravity that it *significantly influences* or *thwarts* the decision-making processes of a State to the extent that its will is *manifestly bent*, which is the definition of coercion adopted by Germany. Similarly, *jus ad bellum* does not require the State to be subjected to a level of compulsion that causes it to 'act in an involuntary manner or to refrain from acting in a certain manner', which is the definition of coercion adopted by Estonia and several other States. Nor is it necessary under *jus ad bellum* for a State to be exposed to such pressure that *deprives* it of freedom of choice or *compels* or *imposes* an outcome on the State, which is the definition of coercion adopted by Canada.\n173 T.

To meet the threshold of causing a State to act involuntarily or to deprive it of freedom of choice or control over its domestic jurisdiction, the conduct of the coercing State must be of such intensity that it overwhelms the coerced State and leaves it with no viable choice but to submit to the demands of the coercing State.¹⁷⁷ In both jurisprudence and philosophy, involuntariness is generally understood as being a situation where an actor lacks a meaningful choice or has no reasonable alternative but to comply with the demands of another actor.¹⁷⁸ Applying these definitions would significantly reduce the scope of the prohibition on intervention, thereby permitting a wide-range of non-forcible conduct both in cyberspace and beyond.\nTake the definition of coercion in Canada's national position paper on the application of international law in cyberspace. As noted above, Canada defined coercion as conduct that compels or imposes an outcome on the affected State or deprives it of its freedom of choice. Canada also provided the following example of an act of unlawful intervention in an election: '[a]n\n¹⁷⁷ The definitions of coercion adopted by most States (coercion as conduct that causes a State to act involuntarily and coercion as conduct that deprives a State of freedom of choice or control) appear to echo the definition of coercion that the ILC adopted in its Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts. The ILC stated that coercion 'has the same essential character as force majeure', which it defined as a situation where the conduct of a State is 'involuntary or at least involves no element of free choice'. As the ILC explained, the degree of pressure required for a State to be placed in a position where its conduct is 'involuntary' or lacking the 'element of free choice' is one of 'irresistible force'. To be clear, States have not cited the Articles on State Responsibility as an authority to support their definitions of coercion. Nonetheless, there is a striking resemblance between the ILC's definition of coercion and the definitions adopted by many States in their position papers. In my view, this is a threshold of pressure that is far higher than anything required by the jus ad bellum. For the ILC's discussion of the concepts of coercion and force majeure, see UN ILC, 'Report of the International Law Commission: Fifty-Third Session' (23 April–1 June and 2 July–10 August 2001) GAOR 56th Session Supp. 10 (A/56/10), at 69, 77–78.\n¹⁷⁸ The literature of coercion and voluntariness in both law and philosophy is vast and varied. Nonetheless, there is general agreement among scholars in these fields that an agent will be deemed to have behaved involuntarily if they were left with no viable or meaningful choice.

The report did, however, state the following:\nThe fact that foreign interference may not have impacted the outcomes in many ridings does not mean, however, that it did not impact the election. Foreign interference in 2019 and 2021 undermined the right of voters to have an electoral ecosystem free from coercion or covert influence. Foreign interference has an impact when there is a single instance where a ballot is cast in a certain way, or not cast at all, because of a foreign state's direct or indirect enticement.[181]\nThe report added that this foreign interference affected the electoral ecosystem and had the overall effect of '[u]ndermining faith in democracy and government' and led to a 'reduced trust in Canada's democratic process'.[182] Under Canada's definition of coercion, this conduct would not be unlawful. The foreign interference catalogued in this report did not impose any particular choice on Canada nor did it significantly affect the outcome of an election. Likewise, this conduct would not meet the threshold of causing a State to act involuntarily. Nonetheless, the political effects of foreign interference of this nature are serious, especially in the long-term. Failing to proscribe conduct of this nature would turn the prohibition on intervention into a normative empty shell that provides little protection to States and would permit a broad range of disruptive non-forcible behavior.\nHELAL\nThis is why I believe that the Common African Position was right to define coercion as conduct that is designed 'to impose restraints on the will of a foreign state', which is a markedly lower threshold than that proposed by other States. The question, however, is what exactly does 'imposing restraints' entail and at what point can one say that the exertion of pressure on a State has reached the point of 'imposing restraints' on its will?\nTo this writer – and I must emphasize that this is the author's view, not that of the member States of the African Union – the threshold of coercion for non-forcible conduct should be defined as being comparable to the minimum effects of conduct that amounts to a threat or use of force. In other words, for non-forcible conduct – such as political, economic, or informational measures – to amount to intervention, the effects of the conduct in question should be comparable to that which is entailed by the threat or use of force. I call this the unified threshold of coercion. The practical effect of adopting the unified threshold of coercion is that any non-forcible conduct that causes effects on a scale that is comparable to conduct that amounts to a violation of the prohibition on the threat or use of force would constitute a breach of the prohibition on intervention.\nTo further explain, other reports by the Canadian government provide understandings of foreign interference that, to this writer, approximates the degree of effects that would meet the unified threshold of coercion, thereby amounting to a breach of the prohibition on intervention. In one report published by the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians, foreign interference was defined in the following terms: '[f]oreign interference involves foreign states, or persons/entities operating on their behalf, attempting to covertly influence decisions, events or outcomes to better suit their strategic interests'.[183] This report also stated: 'foreign interference includes attempts to covertly influence, intimidate, manipulate, interfere, corrupt or discredit individuals, organizations and governments to further the interests of a foreign country'.[184] It also underscored that 'foreign interference should be understood as a long-term effort, akin to espionage, using inducements or threats. Both dynamics enable the manipulation of targets when required, for example, through requests for inappropriate or special favours'.[185] This report\n183 Government of Canada, 'National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians: Special Report on Foreign Interference in Canada's Democratic Processes and Institutions' (3 June 2024), available at <https: reports=\"\" rp-2024-06-03=\"\" special-report-foreign-interference.pdf=\"\" www.nsicop-cpsnr.ca=\"\"> (accessed 11 August 2024), at 5.\n184 Ibid.\n185 Ibid., at 6.</https:>\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\nprovided examples of behavior that would not amount to unlawful intervention. These include:\nForeign interference activities are distinct from acceptable diplomatic advocacy and lobbying. The latter activities are known to the host state and occur through recognized channels to achieve specific policy outcomes or objectives. It is normal for foreign diplomats in Canada, for example, to reach out to elected officials across the political spectrum, to pressure policymakers, to use local media to promote their national interests or to engage with and support domestic organizations.^[186]^\nAn earlier report, also published by the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians of Canada, states the following: '[f]oreign interference activities can include using deceptive means to cultivate relationships with elected officials and others perceived to processes influence in the political process; seek to influence the reporting of Canadian media outlets; seek, in some cases, to affect the outcome of elections; and coerce or induce diaspora communities to advance foreign interests in Canada'.^[187]^ The understandings of foreign interference in these reports are palpably broader than the definition of coercion in most national position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace, including Canada's. To this writer, these reports describe the kinds of conduct that were intended to be covered by the Common African Position, and which would be covered by the unified threshold of coercion proposed here.\nTwo considerations lend support to this understanding of coercion. First, adopting a unified threshold of coercion that applies to both forcible and non-forcible intervention is consistent with the history of the evolution of the prohibition on intervention. Throughout the negotiations on instruments in which non-intervention was codified, States consistently viewed acts of intervention as being analogous to the use of force.^[188]^ For example, as noted above, the drafters of the 1933 Montevideo Convention described intervention\n186 Ibid.\n187 Government of Canada, 'National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians: Annual Report 2019' (12 March 2020), available at <https: reports=\"\" rp-2020-03-12-ar=\"\" intro-en.html=\"\" www.nsicop-cpsnr.ca=\"\"> (accessed 11 August 2024), at 55.\n188 I. Brownlie, 'The Use of Force in Self-Defense' (1961) 37 British Yearbook of International Law 183-268, at 187 ('The term [intervention] and the use made of it by Governments and writers have been a very considerable source of confusion. It is commonly used to describe any use or threat of force which is considered to be justifiable whether or not the intervention creates a state of war in the formal sense').</https:>\nHELAL\nas any act that amounts to 'effective force'. It indicates that the authors of the Montevideo Convention understood non-forcible intervention to be the functional equivalent of armed force.\nMoreover, during the debates on the Montevideo Convention, several Latin American States underscored that non-intervention was closely associated to the prohibition on the use of force. For example, Argentina stated: 'What is intervention, then, but violence? [...] Intervention is violence.'[189] El Salvador also affirmed that '[b]ecause the American conscience is such that territorial acquisitions originated by violence cannot be recognized; that violence has generally come to disturb the life of our countries in the form of intervention'.[190] Peru also emphasized that 'war is proscribed, so is violence, but not the use of arms, the diplomatic measures or any other means of effective compulsion'.[191] Ecuador also highlighted that '[w]hat is intervention but a kind of war, disguised and wary' and argued that, having outlawed aggression pursuant to the 1933 Anti-War Treaty of Non-Aggression and Conciliation, it was only natural for the States of the western hemisphere to proscribe intervention.[192] Similarly, during the negotiations on the OAS Charter, Cuba called economic coercion 'treacherous, silent, and underhanded aggression'.[193]\nMany States expressed similar views during the negotiations on both the 1965 Declaration on Non-Intervention and the 1970 Friendly Relations Declaration. For example, Guinea described intervention as a 'more pernicious' form of aggression,[194] Trinidad and Tobago called it 'subtle and insidious' aggression,[195] and the Congo argued that non-intervention covered 'political pressure, subversive activities, and other acts of aggression'.[196] Furthermore, throughout debates on non-intervention at the UN, many States frequently described non-intervention as being derivable from or a corollary of the non-use of force.[197] In short, in addition to outlawing intervention through armed\n189 Ibid., at 113.\n190 Ibid., at 126.\n191 Ibid., at 123.\n192 Ibid., at 113.\n193 Novena Conferencia Internacional Americana, Actas y Documentos, Vol. I: Antecedentes – Secretaría General Reunión Preliminar – Sesiones Plenarias (Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de Colombia 1953), at 219.\n194 UNGA, 'First Committee 1400th Meeting, Twentieth Session' (7 December 1965) UN Doc.

A/AC.119/\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\nforce, the prohibition on intervention was designed to protect States against non-forceful conduct that was viewed as being functionally equivalent to the use of force – i.e., conduct that entailed a degree of pressure that is comparable to the use of armed force.\nIn addition to being consistent with the historical evolution of non-intervention, adopting a unified threshold of coercion that applies to all forms of intervention reflects the fact that non-intervention and the non-use of force share the same policy purpose. The ICJ has stated that ‘a rule of international law, whether customary or conventional, does not operate in a vacuum; it operates in relation to facts and in the context of a wider framework of legal rules of which it forms only a part’.¹⁹⁸ Writing in more colorful terms, James Crawford observed that ‘customary rules usually hunt in packs, connected by some familial relationship and interacting with each other’.¹⁹⁹\nNon-intervention and the non-use of force belong to the same normative ‘pack’. These rules are part of what scholars call the ‘law of coexistence’, the policy purpose of which is to protect the autonomy of States and enable them to coexist peacefully in an anarchic international system.²⁰⁰ Specifically, these two rules – non-intervention and the non-use of force – are designed to protect the physical and functional manifestations of sovereignty. These two ‘domains’ of sovereignty – the physical and the functional – are expressed by the concepts of the ‘territorial integrity’ and ‘political independence’ of States, which appear in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.²⁰¹ Non-intervention extended the\nSR.31, at 11 (Yugoslavia: non-intervention is a ‘natural corollary of Article 2(4)’ of the UN Charter); UNGA, ‘Special Committee on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation Among States, First Session, Summary Records of the Thirtieth Meeting’, at 5–6 (Mexico: Article 2(4) is among the provisions of the Charter that provided ‘a solid and irrefutable basis’ for non-intervention).\n¹⁹⁸ Interpretation of the Agreement of 25 March 1951 Between the WHO and Egypt (Advisory Opinion) [20 December 1980] ICJ Rep. 73, at para. 10.\n¹⁹⁹ J.

Far from it. Although both rules share the same policy purposes, the prohibition on intervention is broader than the prohibition on the threat or use of force. Non-intervention applies to any policy or practice, whether forcible and non-forcible, that impinges on the political independence or territorial integrity of States. In a sense, therefore, the prohibition on the threat or use of force should be viewed as a *lex specialis* that applies to a specific genus of intervention (namely, *armed* intervention). This body of *lex specialis* has been subsumed, *in toto*, within the broader *lex generalis* of the prohibition on intervention.\nIn conclusion, further research and further expressions of State views are needed on the definition and threshold of coercion. This is essential to understanding how the prohibition on intervention applies to and governs non-forcible conduct both in cyberspace and beyond. To this writer, however, the unified threshold of coercion that this article proposes provides a conceptual foundation on which to formulate a workable and conceptually coherent approach to applying the prohibition on intervention.\n²⁰² Law – Its Concept and Implications for Crimea' (2015) 75 Zeitschrift für ausländisches öffentliches Recht und Völkerrecht 7–26, at 10. As Georges Abi-Saab wrote: 'The international legal system is based at present as in the past, on two fundamental principles that determine its structure and functioning, namely, the sovereignty and equality of States [...] The principal legal consequence of this structural or rather structuring principle is to commit each State to a general obligation to respect the sovereignty of others; in other words, not to trespass on the territorial and functional ambits of this sovereignty. The most flagrant manifestation of such trespass is the threat or use of force against the State. But it is not the only one. Other, less blatant, forms exist varying in their degree of visibility and intensity.

It focuses on coercion as an element of the prohibition on intervention and identifies the different definitions of coercion that States have adopted in national and regional position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace. This article also specifically discusses the views of States on the threshold of coercion, which is the degree of harm or the effects that the conduct of a State must cause (or threaten to cause) to amount to a violation of the prohibition on intervention. This article argues that the definitions and thresholds of coercion that States have adopted in debates on the application of international law in cyberspace should be viewed as proposals for the development of the law in this area, as opposed to restatements of established law. Instead, this article proposes that all forms of intervention should be governed by a ‘unified threshold of coercion’ that applies to both forcible and non-forcible intervention.\n## Keywords\nprohibition on intervention – cyberspace – coercion – prohibition on the threat or use of force\n© KONINKLIJKE BRILL BV, LEIDEN, 2024 | DOI:10.1163/18757413_02701019\nHELAL\n# 1 Introduction\nIt is undisputed that the prohibition on intervention is a rule of customary international law. This rule is also codified in numerous conventions, including the founding instruments of several regional organizations. Non-intervention was also applied by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in several cases, the most important of which is the Nicaragua Case. This rule was also reaffirmed in many UN General Assembly resolutions, the most notable of which is the 1970 Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Co-Operation Among States in Accordance with the Charter of the United Nations ('1970 Friendly Relations Declaration'). The prohibition on intervention also appears in the 1949 Declaration on the Rights and Duties of States and the 1954 Code of Offenses Against the Peace and Security of Mankind which were adopted by the International Law Commission (ILC).\n1.

Examples of multilateral treaties in which non-intervention is codified include: Article 41(1) Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (done 18 April 1961, entered into force 24 April 1964) 500 UNTS 95; Article 55(1) Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (done 23 April 1963, entered into force 19 March 1967) 596 UNTS 261. Some of the founding instruments of regional organizations in which the prohibition on intervention also appears, albeit in varying formulations, include: Articles 19–20 Charter of the Organization of American States (signed 30 April 1948, entered into force 13 December 1951) 119 UNTS 3; Article 4(g) Constitutive Act of the African Union (signed 11 July 2000, entered into force 26 May 2001) 2158 UNTS 3; Article 1(4) Charter of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (adopted 14 March 2008), available at <https: charter=\"\" en=\"\" documents=\"\" oic_charter_2018_en.pdf=\"\" www.oic-oci.org=\"\" upload=\"\">; Article 2(2) Charter of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (done 20 November 2007, entered into force 15 December 2008) 2624 UNTS 223.\n3.

States from every region and from every political bloc have accused their adversaries (and sometimes even their allies) of intervening in their affairs.[8]\nIn recent years, there has been a growing interest among States and scholars in the principle of non-intervention. One reason is that cyberspace has become a domain of conflict and competition. Information and communication technologies (ICTs) are being used both as weapons of war and as instruments of non-forcible intervention.[9] States, state-sponsored non-State actors, and non-State groups and individuals acting independently have employed ICTs against foreign States, citizens, and companies to achieve various political, economic, criminal, scientific, and financial objectives. ICTs have been used to disrupt critical infrastructure, spread disinformation and propaganda to sow social discord, interfere in elections, acquire industrial and trade secrets, steal scientific research and intellectual property, and to gain profit through activities such as ransomware attacks. As a result, there is a growing corpus of state practice and expressions of opinio juris, in addition to a sizable body of scholarship, on how the prohibition on intervention applies in cyberspace. This article engages with these discussions.\nSpecifically, this article has two objectives. First, it explores how States have defined the concept of coercion,[10] which is considered a core component of\n\nHELAL\nthe prohibition on intervention. It also examines how States have demarcated the boundary between, on one hand, the prohibition on intervention and, on the other, the obligation to respect the territorial sovereignty of States and the prohibition on the threat or use of force, which are two rules that are closely associated with the prohibition on intervention.\nThis article will do so by surveying national and regional position papers that States have issued in recent years on the application of international law in cyberspace in which States have outlined their views on the scope and content of the prohibition on intervention and on how it governs the conduct of States in cyberspace. These position papers were issued, at least partially, in response to calls by the UN Open-Ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (OEWG) for States to express their opinions on how international law applies in cyberspace. The OEWG is one of the two principal forums in which discussions at the UN on the regulation of cyberspace are conducted, the other being the UN Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security (GGE).\nIn addition to being of interest to scholars who specialize in the regulation of cyberspace, these national and regional position papers also deserve special attention from generalist scholars of international law. Most of these position papers are not framed as expressions of State views on *lex specialis* that apply only in cyberspace. Rather, they contain detailed statements on the scope and content of a wide range of *lex generalis* followed by discussions on how these rules of general international law apply in cyberspace. This makes these position papers a rich source of *opinio juris* on various primary and secondary rules\n p. 11 A. Tzanakopoulos, ‘The Right to be Free from Economic Coercion’ (2015) 4 Cambridge Journal of International Law 616–633, at 620 (‘Coercion is a method of illegal intervention [...] coercion is intervention. Seeking to coerce a state within its sphere of freedom is wrongful; it constitutes intervention’).\n UNGA, ‘Open-Ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security – Final Substantive Report’ (10 March 2021) UN Doc. A/AC.290/2021/CRP.2, at para. 38. (The OEWG recommended that ‘States, on a voluntary basis, continue to inform the Secretary-General of their national views and assessments on how international law applies to their use of ICTs in the context of international security, and continue to voluntarily share such national views and practices through other avenues as appropriate’).\n See C. Painter, ‘The United Nations’ Cyberstability Processes: Surprising Progress but Much Left to Do’ (2021) 6 Journal of Cyber Policy 271–276.\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\nof international law, many of which are foundational to the international legal order. Some of the rules covered by these position papers include sovereignty, the prohibition on the threat or use of force, the peaceful settlement of disputes, human rights, the laws of armed conflict, the rules of attribution, and of course, the prohibition on intervention, which is the subject of this article.\nExamining these national and regional position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace reveals that, while the prohibition on intervention is accepted as a rule of general international law, there remains considerable uncertainty regarding the exact scope and content of this rule. In particular, there are notable differences among States on the definition of coercion. Some States have defined coercion as conduct that modifies the behavior of a State by causing it to act involuntarily or by compelling it to act in a manner that it would not have voluntarily engaged in but for the coercive conduct of a foreign State. Other States have defined coercion as conduct that deprives a State of its freedom of choice or control over matters within its domestic jurisdiction. A third and broader approach, which was adopted by the African Union, defines coercion as any conduct that imposes restraints on the will of a foreign State.\nIn addition to articulating theoretical definitions of coercion, some States provided examples of conduct that, in their view, amounted to coercion. These examples shed further light on how the concept of coercion applies to real-world situations in which ICTs are used as instruments of statecraft. In particular, these examples clarify the views of States on the threshold of effects or the degree of pressure that a State must be subjected to in order for conduct to be considered coercive. As I show below, there is currently no consensus among States on the effects that the conduct of the coercing State must have on the coerced State to constitute an act of unlawful intervention. Some States adopted relatively high thresholds that require the conduct in question to have significant effects on the coerced State. For example, for some States, merely seeking to sway public opinion during an election campaign does not necessarily amount to unlawful intervention. Rather, to those States, electoral interference must rise to the level of altering election results or preventing a segment of the population from voting in order to constitute an act of intervention.[14] On the other hand, other States adopted lower thresholds to determine when\n\nHELAL\nelectoral interference could be deemed coercive. For example, one State noted that 'hack and leak' operations to influence public opinion could constitute a violation of the prohibition on intervention. The African Union also adopted a relatively low threshold of coercion that does not require the behavior of a foreign State to have significant effects on a State in order to amount to unlawful intervention.\nIn short, national and regional position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace indicate that there are divergences among States on how the prohibition on intervention governs state conduct in cyberspace. There is no agreement on a theoretical definition of coercion, there is no consensus on the threshold of effects that determines when specific state conduct that is designed to influence the behavior of other States constitutes coercion, and there is some uncertainty on how non-intervention relates to other rules such as the prohibition on the threat or use of force and the obligation to respect the territorial sovereignty of States.\nHaving catalogued the views that States have, heretofore, expressed on non-intervention and coercion in cyberspace, the second objective of this article is to critically appraise the understandings of coercion that States have adopted in their national and regional position papers. Specifically, this article makes the following two arguments.\nFirst, this article contends that – as a matter of formal law – the positions expressed by States on the meaning of coercion should be viewed as proposals de lege ferenda, and not as restatements of established lex lata. This is because, as I explain below, nothing in the history of the development of the prohibition of intervention lends support to the definitions of coercion that States have espoused. Non-intervention first emerged in the early 20th century as a rule\n available at <https: issues_development-enjeux_developpement=\"\" peace_security-paix_security=\"\" eyberspace_law-cyberespace_droit.aspx?lang=\"eng\" world-monde=\"\" www.international.gc.ca=\"\"> ('An example of a prohibited intervention would be a malicious cyber activity that hacks and disables a State's election commission days before an election, preventing a significant number of citizens from voting, and ultimately influencing the election outcome').\nUNGA, 'Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions on the Subject of How International Law Applies to the Use of Information and Communications Technologies by States Submitted by Participating Governmental Experts in the Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security Established Pursuant to General Assembly Resolution 73/226' (13 July 2021) UN Doc. A/76/136 ('Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions'), at 69 (Norway: 'unduly influencing public opinion through the dissemination of confidential information obtained through cyber operations (\"hack and leak\"), would be in violation of the prohibition of intervention').</https:>\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\nof Inter-American conventional international law. Then, building on decades of advocacy principally by non-aligned States, the prohibition on intervention became a rule of general international law with the adoption of the 1970 Friendly Relations Declaration. However, at no point during the evolution of the prohibition on intervention did States define coercion as conduct that causes a State to behave involuntarily or that deprives a State of its freedom of choice or control over matters within its domestic jurisdiction. Indeed, the history of the development of this rule indicates that States never even conceived of coercion as the conceptual cornerstone of non-intervention.\nSecond, this article argues that the definitions of coercion adopted by some States are conceptually flawed. Echoing the ICJ's judgment in the Nicaragua Case, virtually all States agree that the prohibition on intervention proscribes coercion whether undertaken through armed force or through non-forcible means, such as economic or political instruments of statecraft. Many States also underscored that the use of armed force is the gravest form of intervention. Yet – paradoxically – applying the definitions of coercion espoused by many (especially Western) States would lead to a situation where the gravest form of intervention – armed force – is governed by a lower threshold than non-forcible forms of intervention that are considered less grave.\nAs discussed below, nothing in *jus ad bellum* requires an act that amounts to armed intervention to be of such gravity that it causes a State to behave involuntarily or deprives it of control over matters within its domestic jurisdiction, which are the definitions of coercion adopted by some States. Indeed, attacking a single military unit could constitute a violation of the prohibition on the threat or use of force and could even amount to an armed attack, regardless of its effect on the behavior of the target State. On the other hand, applying the definitions of coercion adopted by some States would require non-forcible forms of intervention to reach a level of gravity and intensity that causes (or threatens to cause) a State to act involuntarily or that deprives it of freedom of choice. As I explain below, these definitions entail an unreasonably high\n Nicaragua v.

Based on this approach, non-forcible conduct would be considered coercive if its impact is comparable to the scale and effects of conduct that amounts to a violation of the threat or use of force. This unified threshold of coercion is lower than the thresholds of coercion that many States have adopted in their position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace.\nThis article consists of two sections. Section 1 provides a survey of the definitions of coercion that appear in national and regional position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace. This section also outlines the views of States on the interconnection between non-intervention and the prohibition on the use of force and the obligation to respect state sovereignty, which is a debate that sheds further light on the kinds of conduct that each of these rules applies to and regulates. Then in Section 2, this article critically appraises the understandings of coercion adopted by States and argues in favor of adopting what I call the 'unified threshold of coercion' that applies equally to both forcible and non-forcible forms of intervention.\n## 2 Intervention and Coercion in Cyberspace\nNational and regional position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace unanimously affirmed that non-intervention is an established rule of international law that applies in cyberspace.[18] The GGE,[19] the African Union\n\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\nPeace and Security Council, and the Juridical Committee of the Organization of American States also adopted this position. Despite this general agreement on the status of the prohibition on intervention as an established rule of international law, States adopted diverging views regarding the exact scope and content of this rule. This is especially clear with coercion. Indeed, many States, including the member States of the African Union, noted that coercion is a concept that remains undefined in international law. Nonetheless, in\nnot intervene directly or indirectly in the internal affairs of another State, including by means of ICTs').\n AU Peace and Security Council, 'Communiqué 1120.1' (9 November 2022) AU Doc. PSC/PR/COMM.1120.1(2022), at operative paragraph 3: 'Acknowledges the application of international law to cyberspace, and stresses that the prohibition on the threat or use of force, the prohibition on intervention in the internal or external affairs of states, and the inviolability of the political independence, territorial integrity, and sovereignty of states are foundational rules of international law'.\n The Inter-American Juridical Committee of the Organization of American States recommended the adoption of the following statement by the OAS General Assembly: 'The OAS General Assembly affirms that international law, including the United Nations Charter in its entirety, the OAS Charter, international humanitarian law, international human rights law, the duty of non-intervention, the sovereign equality of states, and the law of state responsibility, is applicable to the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) by States and those for whom States are internationally responsible'. Inter-American Juridical Committee, 'International Law and State Cyber Operations' (7 August 2020) OAS Doc. CJI/Res.260 (XCVII-O/20).\n Many States noted that coercion as an element of non-intervention remains undefined. See for example M. Helal, 'Common African Position on the Application of International Law to the Use of Information and Communication Technologies in Cyberspace, and All Associated Communiqués Adopted by the Peace and Security Council of the African Union' (2 February 2024) Ohio State Legal Studies Research Paper No. 823, available at <https: papers.cfm?abstract_id=\"4714756\" papers.ssrn.com=\"\" sol3=\"\"> ('Common African Position'), at para. 32 ('the definition of coercion in this context requires further study and deliberation between States'); Danish Government, 'Denmark's Position Paper on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace' (2023) 92 Nordic Journal of International Law 446–455, at 450 ('[t]he term coercion is not defined in either treaty law or customary international law'); Swedish Government Offices, 'Position Paper on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace' (July 2022), available at <https: 3c2cb6febd0e4ab0bd542f653283b140=\"\" contentassets=\"\" swedens-position-paper-on-the-application-of-international-law-in-cyberspace.pdf=\"\" www.government.se=\"\">, at 3 ('coercion is not defined in international law'); Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 'The Republic of Poland's Position on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace' (29 December 2022) Gov.pl, available at <https: diplomacy=\"\" the-republic-of-polands-position-on-the-application-of-international-law-in-cyberspace=\"\" web=\"\" www.gov.pl=\"\"> ('There is no universally acceptable definition of \"coercion\"); UNGA, 'Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions', at 34 (Germany: 'Especially the definition of the latter element [coercion] requires further clarification in the cyber context'); Ibid. at 57 (The Netherlands: 'The precise definition of</https:></https:></https:>\nHELAL\nan effort to clarify how non-intervention applies in cyberspace, many States offered definitions of coercion in their national or regional statements. Three approaches to defining coercion have appeared in these position papers.\n## 2.1 Coercion as Conduct that Modifies the Behavior of a State\nThe first approach defines coercion as conduct that compels a State to modify its behavior. Among the States that adopted this approach, there were slight variations in the exact definition of coercion that those States formulated. Some States defined coercion as acts that aim to compel a State to act involuntarily. Estonia's position paper expressed this view. It stated:\nWhen discussing if a cyber operation constitutes an unlawful intervention into the external or internal affairs of another state, the element of coercion is a key factor [...] Stemming from that, cyber operations that aim to force another nation to act in an involuntary manner or to refrain from acting in a certain manner, and target the other nation's domaine réservé (e.g., national democratic processes such as elections, or military, security or critical infrastructure systems) could constitute such an intervention.\nAustria's national statement was similar to Estonia's. It stated: '[c]oercion occurs when a state seeks to compel another state to change its behaviour with respect to its internal or external affairs, i.e. to force that state to act in an involuntary manner or involuntarily refrain from acting in a particular way'. Some States that adopted this understanding of coercion also included a 'but for' test in their definition of coercion. According to those States, an act would be coercive if it aimed at compelling a State to behave in a manner that it would not otherwise have engaged in voluntarily. Norway's position paper expressed this view:\ncoercion, and thus of unauthorized intervention, has not yet fully crystallized in international law [...] there is no clear definition of the element of coercion').\n UNGA, 'Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions', at 25.\n Austrian Government, 'Position Paper of the Republic of Austria: Cyber Activities and International Law' (April 2024), available at <https: docs-library.unoda.org=\"\" open-ended_working_group_on_information_and_communication_technologies_-_(2021)=\"\" open-end_working_group_on_information_and_communication_technologies_-_(2021)=\"\" /austrian_position_Paper_-_cyber_activities_and_international_law_(final_23.04.2024).pdf=\"\">, at 5.</https:>\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\n[A] State must not carry out cyber operations in breach of the prohibition of intervention, according to customary international law. A cyber operation must therefore not be carried out to compel the target State to take a course of action, whether by act or omission, in a way that it would not otherwise voluntarily have pursued (coercion) in matters relating to its internal or external affairs (domaine réservé).25\nThe Netherlands adopted a similar position. It defined coercion as an act 'compelling a state to take a course of action (whether an act or an omission) that it would not otherwise voluntarily pursue. The goal of the intervention must be to effect change in the behavior of the target state'.26 Denmark also defined coercion as an act that 'has a potential for compelling the target state to engage in an action that it would otherwise not take'.27 Switzerland and Poland also used similar terms. To Switzerland, coercion is conduct that 'seeks to cause another to act (or refrain from acting) in a way it would not otherwise',28 and Poland stated that coercion 'aims at influencing the state's decisions belonging to its domaine réservé', and added that cyberoperations 'potentially leading to the state's conduct that would not occur otherwise, may be considered a prohibited intervention'.29\nOther States that understood coercion as conduct that is designed to modify the behavior of another State used relatively generic terms to define coercion. Romania, for example, defined coercion simply as an act the purpose of which is to 'effectively change the behavior of the target state'.30 Israel's Deputy Attorney General also opined that coercion 'has been taken to mean that State A cannot take actions to \"coerce\" State B in pursuing a course of action, or refraining from a course of action, in matters pertaining to State B's core internal affairs'.31 Singapore's national statement defined coercion in similar terms. It stated that a cyberoperation may violate the prohibition on intervention if it amounted to an 'attempt to coerce our government to take or forebear\n\nHELAL\na certain course of action on a matter ordinarily within its sovereign prerogative'.32 Italy's national statement used almost identical terms. It asserted that 'a State employs coercive means to compel another State to undertake or desist from a specific action, in matters falling under its domain réserve'.33 In other words, for these States, an act is coercive simply if it is intended to cause another State to change its behavior. These States did not, however, explicitly include a requirement that the conduct in question must compel a State to act involuntarily or force it to engage in behavior that it would not have engaged in voluntarily but-for the coercive conduct of a foreign State.\nGermany adopted a generally similar understanding of coercion. Although it did not refer to modifying the behavior of a State or causing it to act involuntarily, Germany described coercion as the exercise of a certain level of pressure that has a significant impact on the decision-making process of a State to the extent that it manipulates or undermines the will of the State. Germany's position paper stated the following:\nGenerally, Germany is of the opinion that cyber measures may constitute a prohibited intervention under international law if they are comparable in scale and effects to coercion in non-cyber contexts.\nCoercion implies that a State's internal processes regarding aspects pertaining to its domaine réservé are significantly influenced or thwarted and that its will is manifestly bent by the foreign State's conduct. However, as is widely accepted, the element of coercion must not be assumed prematurely. Even harsher forms of communication such as pointed commentary and sharp criticism as well as (persistent) attempts to obtain, through discussion, a certain reaction or the performance of a certain measure from another State do not as such qualify as coercion. Moreover, the acting State must intend to intervene in the internal affairs of the target State – otherwise the scope of the non-intervention principle would be unduly broad.34\nDespite these variations in the exact formulation of these definitions, these understandings of coercion share the common characteristic of focusing on\n\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\nthe desire of the coercing State to alter the behavior of another State. Marko Milanovic calls this the extortion model of coercion. 'These definitions point to undermining the victim state's will as the essence of coercion (\"involuntary,\" \"voluntary\"), so as to effect a change in its behavior'.35\nSeveral States that adopted this definition of coercion also provided examples of conduct that, in their view, amounted to intervention. As noted above in the introduction to this article, these examples provide greater clarity on how States operationalize and apply the definitions of coercion that they adopted. In its position paper, Finland position paper identified the following forms of coercion:\n[W]hile the conduct of elections belongs undisputedly to the internal affairs of each State, all methods of electoral interference do not display the element of coercion. Hacking of voter databases or manipulation of vote counts in order to alter the election results has nevertheless been recognized as a fairly clear case. To be comparable to a real world intervention, cyber interference must also be of a serious nature [...] Military or economic pressure may also qualify as coercion. Hostile cyber interference done with the purpose of promoting or supporting armed action in another State could constitute an example of prohibited intervention, provided that it seeks to force a certain policy change.[36]\nDenmark's position paper provided similar examples of coercive intervention:\nAs emphasized by the Court in the Nicaragua judgment coercive acts involving the use of force are particularly obvious examples of unlawful interventions. Denmark considers that coercion is not limited to means of direct or indirect use of force and that also measures below this threshold may constitute coercion. Cyber activities that do not amount to use of force can therefore also be coercive.\nAn example of unlawful intervention in the cyber domain could be where a State coercively interferes in the internal political process of another. In the cyber context this could potentially occur by using cyber\n\nHELAL\ntechnology to alter electronic ballots and thereby affecting the results of a political election.\nNorway also provided examples of coercion that affect a State's electoral processes, but that went beyond the examples that appear in the position papers of Finland and Denmark. In addition to tampering with election systems to alter the results of an election, Norway stated:\n[C]arrying out cyber operations with the intent of altering election results in another State, for example by manipulating election systems or unduly influencing public opinion through the dissemination of confidential information obtained through cyber operations ('hack and leak'), would be in violation of the prohibition of intervention. Another example is a cyber operation deliberately causing a temporary shutdown of the target State's critical infrastructure, such as the power supply or TV, radio, Internet or other telecommunications infrastructure in order to compel that State to take a course of action.\nLikewise, for Poland, the following conduct amounted to a violation of the prohibition on intervention: 'a wide-scale and targeted disinformation campaign, in particular when it results in civil unrest', preventing 'a reliable and timely conduct of democratic elections', blocking 'the filing of tax returns online', or depriving a 'the parliament working remotely of the possibility of voting online to adopt a law or modifying the outcome of such voting'. Austria also identified the following conduct as amounting to a breach of the prohibition on intervention:\n[A] cyber activity that interferes with a state's ability to hold elections or which manipulates election results could, if undertaken to compel a state to involuntarily change a government policy, constitute a violation of the prohibition of intervention. Large-scale cyber activities, including disinformation campaigns, conducted by or attributable to a state may also constitute, if undertaken to compel another state to involuntarily change its behaviour, a violation of the prohibition of intervention.\n\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\n\n## 2.2 Coercion as Conduct that Deprives a State of Freedom of Choice or Control\nThe second understanding of coercion that has emerged out of national position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace defines coercion as an act that deprives a State of its ability to control or to exercise freedom of choice regarding matters within its domaine réservé. Australia adopted this view. Its position paper stated: ‘[c]oercive means are those that effectively deprive or are intended to deprive the State of the ability to control, decide upon or govern matters of an inherently sovereign nature’.44 In order to establish that a breach of the prohibition on intervention has indeed occurred, Australia required evidence that the conduct of the coercing State had some measurable impact or discernable effect on the target State.45 Canada expressed a similar position. Its position paper explained that a cyberoperation would be coercive if it is ‘designed to deprive the affected State of its freedom of choice’.46 Canada also noted that, in order to amount to an act of\n\nHELAL\nintervention, a cyberoperation must 'cause coercive effects that deprive, compel or otherwise impose an outcome on the affected State'.47\nNew Zealand also defined coercion as conduct that manifests 'an intention to deprive the target state of control over matters falling within the scope of its inherently sovereign functions'.48 According to New Zealand, to constitute intervention, the conduct of the coercing State must have 'significant effects' on a matter within a State's domaine réservé. The Czech Republic defined coercion in similar terms. It stated:\nCoercion is an activity intended to deprive, either directly or indirectly, the State of its ability to exercise control or govern matters within its internal and external affairs [...] The difference between actions that violate sovereignty and actions that violate the prohibition of intervention is that the latter is coercive, i.e., intentionally aims to influence the State's free will and choice.49\nBrazil, Costa Rica, and the UK also adopted similar definitions of coercion. The UK Attorney General said the following about coercion:\nSome have characterized coercion as forcing a State to act differently from how it otherwise would – that is, compelling it into a specific act or omission. Imagine, for example, a cyber operation to delay another State's election, or to prevent it from distributing tax revenues to fund essential services. To my mind, these are certainly forms of coercion.\nBut I want to be clear today that coercion can be broader than this. In essence, an intervention in the affairs of another State will be unlawful if it is forcible, dictatorial, or otherwise coercive, depriving a State of its freedom of control over matters which it is permitted to decide freely by the principle of State sovereignty. While the precise boundaries of coercion are yet to crystallize in international law, we should be ready to consider whether disruptive cyber behaviors are coercive even where it might not\n\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\nbe possible to point to a specific course of conduct which a State has been forced into or prevented from taking.\nCosta Rica's position was similar, but not identical, to that of the UK. It stated that coercion can occur in a 'multitude of ways where one State, directly or indirectly through support for non-State actors, deprives another State of the capacity to make free and informed choices pertaining to its internal affairs'. Like the UK, Costa Rica used the word deprives, but it did not use the word control in relation to matters within its domaine réservé. Rather, it referred to the capacity of a State to make free and informed choices. Brazil used different terminology. Instead of referring to depriving a State its ability to freely decide on matters within its domaine réservé, Brazil stated that, to constitute intervention, a cyberoperation 'against another State must involve an element of coercion affecting the right of the victim State to freely choose its political, economic, social and cultural system, and to formulate its foreign policy'.\nMarko Milanovic calls this the control model of coercion:\nCoercion-as-control does not work by influencing the decision-making calculus of the coerced state. Rather, the coercing state directly interferes with the coerced state's internal or external affairs by taking action that materially deprives the coerced state of its ability to control its policy-choices within its reserved domain.\nSeveral States that adopted this definition of coercion also provided examples of conduct that amounted to intervention in their position papers. Australia, for instance, identified activities that 'manipulate the electoral system to alter the results of an election in another State, intervention in the fundamental operation of Parliament, or in the stability of States' financial systems' as examples of coercion. Canada also stated that a cyberoperation that 'hacks\n S.

Its position paper stated:\nCoercion is clear-cut when a State uses or threatens to use force against another one. Nonetheless, it can also occur in a multitude of ways where one State, directly or indirectly through support for non-State actors, deprives another State of the capacity to make free and informed choices pertaining to its internal or external affairs. Coercion may occur when a State provides financial or other forms of support to secessionist, subversive or violent groups in the territory of another State, when it exercises significant political or economic pressure on another State, or when it engages in or supports subversive or hostile propaganda or the dissemination of false news that interfere in the internal or external affairs of another State [...]\nA prominent example of a breach of non-intervention are ransomware attacks crippling or simply interfering with a State's ability to run public services, such as finance, education, and social security. Moreover, foreign election interference may also infringe the principle of non-intervention. This may take the form of cyber operations directly interfering with mail ballots or voter databases, or electoral disinformation campaigns seeking\n\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\nto mislead the electorate about the vote itself, candidates, electoral polls or results. Other types of disinformation, such as those affecting a State's health policies, may also amount to a prohibited intervention. Posts inciting individuals or other States to wage wars of aggression or to disrupt or subvert the internal order of another State may likewise breach the principle of non-intervention.57\nThe UK also provided a wide range of examples of acts of coercion. It identified forms of intervention that affected four areas of state policy: 'energy security; essential medical care; economic stability; and democratic processes'.58 In relation to 'essential energy supplies' 'essential medical services' and 'economic stability' the UK listed the following cyberoperations as potentially breaching the prohibition on intervention:\n[D]isruption of systems controlling emergency medical transport (e.g., telephone dispatchers); causing hospital computer systems to cease functioning; disruption of supply chains for essential medicines and vaccines; preventing the supply of power to housing, healthcare, education, civil administration and banking facilities and infrastructure; causing the energy supply chain to stop functioning at national level through damage or prevention of access to pipelines, interchanges, and depots; or preventing the operation of power generation infrastructure.\nTurning to economic stability, covert cyber operations by a foreign State that coercively interfere with a State's freedom to manage its domestic economy, or to ensure provision of domestic financial services crucial to the State's financial system, would breach the rule on non-intervention. Such cyber operations could include disruption to the networks controlling a State's fundamental ability to conduct monetary policy or to raise and distribute revenue, for instance through taxation. Or disruption to systems which support lending, saving and insurance across the economy.59\nIn relation to democratic processes, the UK noted that 'covert cyber operations by a foreign State which coercively interfere with free and fair electoral processes would constitute a prohibited intervention'. Examples of such unlawful\n\nHELAL\nconduct include: '[O]perations that disrupt the systems which control electoral counts to change the outcome of an election; or operations to disrupt another State's ability to hold an election at all, for example by causing systems to malfunction with the effect of preventing voter registration'.60\n## 2.3 Coercion as Conduct that Imposes Restraints on the Will of a State\nThe third approach to understanding coercion appears in the Common African Position on the Application of International Law to the Use of Information and Communication Technologies in Cyberspace, which was adopted by the fifty-five members of the African Union in early 2024.61 As of this writing, the African Union is the first regional organization to have adopted a position on the application of international law in cyberspace.62 The Common African Position defined coercion 'as a policy that is designed to impose restraints on the will of a foreign State. Assessing whether the use by one or more States of ICTs in cyberspace to influence the conduct of a foreign State amounts to coercion is a determination that should be undertaken on a case-by-case basis'.63 The Common African Position also stated the following:\nWhile the definition of coercion in this context requires further study and deliberation between States, the African Union is of the view that it is not necessary, in order to constitute coercion, that the conduct of a State must rise to the level of completely depriving a foreign State of its freedom of choice or to compel that State to either act or refrain from acting involuntarily. Coercion may also occur through threats of intervention. Furthermore, there is no requirement that, in order to constitute a violation of the prohibition on intervention, an act of coercion must actually succeed in compelling the State subjected to such acts to change its conduct. An unsuccessful attempt of intervention is unlawful under international law. The African Union stresses that offers or calls to peacefully settle disputes through negotiation, enquiry, mediation, conciliation, good offices, arbitration, and judicial settlement, and diplomatic\n\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\n\nIn some respects, the understanding of coercion in the Common African Position is similar to other definitions of coercion, but it also diverges from these definitions in significant ways. The Common African Position defined coercion as conduct that ‘impose[s] restraints on the will of a foreign State’. This is broadly analogous to the notion of impinging on the freedom of choice of States, which is central to the coercion-as-control model. However, the Common African Position also indicates that the purpose of intervention is to ‘influence the conduct of a foreign State’. This echoes definitions that understand coercion as conduct that aims at modifying the behavior of a State by subverting, manipulating, or undermining its decision-making processes.\nCompared to other definitions of coercion, however, the Common African Position was purposively designed to broaden the protective scope of the prohibition on intervention. It does so by adopting a lower threshold of (actual or threatened) effects that must be crossed for conduct to amount to coercion. This is clearly expressed in the following sentence: ‘the African Union is of the view that it is not necessary, in order to constitute coercion, that the conduct of a State must rise to the level of completely depriving a foreign State of its freedom of choice or to compel that State to either act or refrain from acting involuntarily’.\nIn other words, the principal point of divergence between the Common African Position and the positions of other States relates to the threshold of coercion. For the member States of the African Union, intervention is any conduct undertaken by a State that imposes restraints on another State in relation to matters within its domestic jurisdiction. However, those restraints need not be of such severity that they cause a State to act involuntarily nor do they need to reach a level of intensity that completely deprives that State of its freedom of choice or control over matters within its domestic jurisdiction.\nIt is notable that, in an initial draft of the Common African Position that this author had prepared while serving as the African Union Special Rapporteur on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace, coercion was defined in the following terms: ‘coercion, in the context of the prohibition on intervention, should be defined as a policy that is designed to impose material restraints on the will of a foreign State’. The adjective ‘material’ was intended\n Ibid., at para. 32.\n Ibid.\nHELAL\nto signify that, in order to amount to intervention, the restraints imposed on a State must attain an elevated level of severity, which would ensure that non-intervention would not be an over-inclusive rule.\nThis initial draft of the Common African Position was welcomed by the AU Peace and Security Council, and served as the basis for the interstate negotiations that led to the adoption of the Common African Position, which were held in Tunisia from 29 November to 1 December 2023. During these negotiations, however, the AU member States decided to delete the adjective 'material'. The member States determined that the word 'restraints' sufficiently and accurately captured the essence of the prohibition on intervention. Many States described non-intervention as a rule that is intended to protect the policy autonomy of States and to enable States to manage their internal and external affairs free from 'restraints' that might be imposed by other States. The AU member States also agreed that, when read in the context of the entire section on non-intervention in the Common African Position, the prohibition on intervention was not over-inclusive.\n## 2.4 The Element of Intent\nMany States also included the element of the intent in their definitions of coercion. New Zealand articulated this element unambiguously. Its position paper affirmed that the 'coercive intention of the state actor is a critical element of the rule' and underscored that 'intention may in some circumstances be inferred from the effects of cyber activity'. Similarly, Costa Rica's position paper noted that '[f]or such breaches [of the prohibition on intervention] to occur, it suffices that a State intends to coerce another State, employs coercive methods, or eventually causes coercive effects in another State'. Czechia's position paper used similar terms. It stated that '[c]oercion is an activity intended to deprive' a State of control over matters within its domaine réservé.\n See AU Peace and Security Council, 'Communiqué No. 1171' (24 August 2023) AU Doc. PSC/PR/COMM.1171 (2023), at para. 2: 'Welcomes the Draft Statement by the AUCIL on the Application of International Law to the Use of ICTs in Cyberspace prepared by the Special Rapporteur, which was adopted and endorsed by the 22nd Ordinary Session of the AUCIL in June 2023'.\n AU Office of the Legal Counsel BC/OLC/42.23/13793.23 (on file with the author).\n New Zealand Foreign Affairs and Trade, 'The Application of International Law to State Activity in Cyberspace', at para. 9(b).\n Costa Rican Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 'Costa Rica's Position on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace', at 7 (emphasis added).\n Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 'Position Paper on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace', at para. 9(b).\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\nOther States also included the element of intent in their definition of coercion, but only implicitly. For instance, Norway stated that holding elections is an example of an activity that falls within the *domaine réservé* of a State. Therefore, according to Norway, 'carrying out cyber operations with the intent of altering election results in another State' would violate the prohibition on intervention.[71] Furthermore, Canada,[72] Denmark,[73] and the US,[74] understood coercion as conduct that is *designed* to achieve a specific purpose or effect (such as modifying the behavior of the target State). As noted above, the Common African Position also understood coercion as conduct that is *'designed* to impose restraints on the will of a foreign State'. The use of the term *'designed'* by these position papers introduces the element of intent into the definition of coercion. It indicates that the coercing State is acting purposefully and intentionally and employing its resources in a systematic and strategic manner to achieve specific policy objectives.\nOther States used similar phrases that also make the intent of the coercing State an element of the definition of coercion. The Netherlands $^{75}$ and Romania $^{76}$ defined coercion as conduct *'the goal'* of which is changing the behavior of the target State. Likewise, Estonia and Poland described coercion as conduct that *'aimed'* at achieving a specific objective. Estonia, for example, stated that 'cyber operations that *aim* to force another nation to act in an involuntary manner or to refrain from acting in a certain manner' would amount to intervention.[77] Poland also stated that '[t]o be in breach of international law,\n\nHELAL\nan intervention must include the element of coercion that aims at influencing the state's decisions belonging to its domaine réservé.78 Again, using phrases like: 'the goal of' intervention, or saying that coercion is conduct 'that aims at', presupposes that the coercing State is acting intentionally. It indicates that the coercing State has identified a policy objective – an aim or a goal – which it is seeking to achieve by engaging in cyberoperations against another State.\n## 2.5 Sovereignty, Intervention, and the Use of Force: Demarcating the Doctrinal Boundaries\nIn addition to articulating definitions of coercion and offering examples of conduct that amounts to coercion, many States addressed the question of the relation between, on one hand, the prohibition on intervention and, on the other, the obligation to respect the territorial sovereignty of States and the prohibition on the threat or use of force. The content and scope of application of these three rules overlap significantly. As the ICJ observed in the Nicaragua Case, '[t]he effects of the principle of respect for territorial sovereignty inevitably overlap with those of the principles of the prohibition of the use of force and of non-intervention'.79\nTo disentangle the interconnection between these three rules, many States expressed views on the threshold of effects that must be crossed for conduct to amount to a violation of each of these rules. Surveying national and regional position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace reveals that States have approached this question from three different angles. The first relates to categories of conduct that – by their very nature – do not constitute a breach of the prohibition on intervention because they fall below the threshold of coercion. Nonetheless, some States noted that conduct that does not amount to intervention because it falls below the threshold of coercion may still be wrongful because it violates the principle of state sovereignty. The second is the higher threshold of coercion, which many States identified as the point at which non-intervention intersects with the prohibition on the threat or use of force. The third relates to the threshold at which non-forcible conduct – such as information operations, election interference, or economic sanctions – amount to coercion.\n\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\n## 2.6 Conduct below the Threshold of Coercion\nMany States identified certain forms of conduct that do not amount to unlawful intervention because they are considered non-coercive. Several Western States argued that practices designed to persuade a State to change its behavior or to influence its policies are lawful, even if such practices involve criticism of that State. These Western States argued that such conduct is commonplace in international relations, which means that it should not be condemned as a form of intervention. This was a point of convergence among Western States regardless of the definitions of coercion they adopted.\nFor example, in its position paper, Czechia, which defined coercion as acts that deprive a State of control over matters within its *domaine réservé*, stated that '[m]ere influencing, criticism or persuasion do not meet the requirements to be qualified as prohibited intervention'. Similarly, Denmark, which defined coercion as conduct that causes a State to behave in a manner it would not have engaged in voluntarily, stated that 'a distinction must be drawn between activities that merely involve influencing, as opposed to compelling, the voluntary actions of a target State. Acts of influence, such as persuasion, criticism, and public diplomacy are insufficient to qualify as an intervention'. Germany also noted that 'harsher forms of communication such as pointed commentary and sharp criticism as well as (persistent) attempts to obtain, through discussion, a certain reaction or the performance of a certain measure from another State do not as such qualify as coercion'. Sweden also opined that 'criticism or other ways of influencing through diplomatic means' does not qualify as coercion. Likewise, Canada, which was among the States that defined coercion as depriving a State of control over its *domaine réservé*, stated that '[c]oercion must be distinguished from other conduct such as public diplomacy, criticism, persuasion, and propaganda'. The UK also distinguished between coercive conduct, which is unlawful, and the freedom of States 'to make their views known about processes in other countries – delivering hard, sometimes\n See for example: Finnish Ministry for Foreign Affairs, 'Finland's Views on International Law and Cyberspace', at 463 ('[t]he requirement of coercion leaves out lesser forms of influence and persuasion that are commonplace in international relations').\n Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 'Position Paper on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace', at para. 13.\n Danish Government, 'Denmark's Position Paper on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace', at 450.\n UNGA, 'Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions', at 34.\n Swedish Government Offices, 'Position Paper on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace', at 3.\n Canadian Government, 'International Law Applicable in Cyberspace'.\nHELAL\nunwelcome messages, and drawing attention to concerns. This is part and parcel of international relations. Similarly, Austria stated that ‘[i]t is important to distinguish such disinformation campaigns from lawful public relations activities of state representatives, including e.g. by openly criticising the human rights situation in another state on social media accounts or websites’.\nThe Common African Position adopted a different approach regarding conduct that falls below the threshold of coercion. It stated: ‘offers or calls to peacefully settle disputes through negotiation, enquiry, mediation, conciliation, good offices, arbitration, and judicial settlement, and diplomatic discussions and communications are presumed not to constitute acts of coercion’. The first portion of this sentence is based on Article 33 of the UN Charter. It indicates that efforts to settle disputes peacefully are not considered coercive. The second portion of this sentence – ‘diplomatic discussions and communications are presumed not to constitute acts of coercion’ – was designed to signal that diplomatic correspondences, whether written or verbal, are generally not considered coercive. The keyword here is *presumed*, which was inserted because history is replete with cases in which diplomatic communications were employed as instruments of coercion. Perhaps the most (in)famous ultimatum ever – the Austro-Hungarian ultimatum to Serbia that started World War I – was delivered via a diplomatic note. Similarly, in a series of meetings that were held in 1945 and 1946 between Soviet and Turkish diplomats, the USSR attempted to coerce Turkey into redrawing the international frontier between the two States and granting the USSR access to and control over the Turkish straits.\nThis sentence in the Common African Position was also intended to signal that the member States of the African Union did not share the view adopted by Western States that other practices such as public diplomacy, criticism, propaganda, unwelcome messages and other conduct that, for instance, the UK described as ‘part and parcel of international relations’ could never be coercive.\nThis approach in the Common African Position is consistent with the positions expressed by African and other developing States during the negotiations on the 1970 Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning\n Braverman, ‘International Law in Future Frontiers’.\n Austrian Government, ‘Position Paper of the Republic of Austria’, at 5.\n ‘Common African Position’, at para. 32.\n See ‘Austria’s Ultimatum to Serbia: Full Text of the Document That Started the World War, and Serbia’s Reply to It’ (1918) 9 Current History 554–558.\n O. Isci, ‘Turkey at a Crossroads: The Soviet Threat and Postwar Realignment, 1945–1946’ (2023) 47 Diplomatic History 621–646.\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\nFriendly Relations and Co-Operation Among States. During discussions on that declaration, several Western States proposed adding a caveat that stated that non-intervention did not affect\n[t]he generally recognized freedom of states to seek to influence the policies and actions of other states, in accordance with international law and settled international practice and in a manner compatible with the principle of sovereign equality States and the duty to cooperate in accordance with the Charter.[91]\nNon-Western States opposed this proposal because innocuous phrases like 'settled international practice' or acts that 'seek to influence the policies and actions of other states' were viewed as a potential backdoor that would justify interventionist policies by powerful States.[92] For African States, determining whether 'criticism', 'public diplomacy', or so-called 'unwelcome messages' amount to intervention can only be established on the basis of an holistic, case-by-case evaluation of the facts.\nSeveral States also argued that, because of the element of coercion, the threshold that must be crossed for conduct to amount to intervention was higher than that which applied to violations of state sovereignty.[93] Switzerland's position paper expressed this understanding of the relationship between these two principles – sovereignty and non-intervention – clearly. It stated:\n\nHELAL\nAn infringement of sovereignty and a prohibited intervention are not the same. The latter must be coercive in nature, i.e. through its intervention a state seeks to cause another to act (or refrain from acting) in a way it would not otherwise. This means that the threshold for a breach of the non-intervention principle is significantly higher than that for a violation of state sovereignty.\nFinland adopted the same view. Its position paper stated: ‘[c]ompared to a violation of sovereignty, the requirement of coercive nature and that of domaine réservé make the threshold of prohibited intervention considerably higher’. Poland’s position paper similarly stated that ‘[t]he threshold for considering a specific operation in cyberspace to be in breach of the principle of non-intervention is higher than in the case of deeming it solely a violation of the principle of sovereignty’. Canada also underscored that ‘[w]hether or not a cyber activity meets the threshold for a violation of the rule on territorial sovereignty or rises to the level of a violation of the rule against intervention will be determined on a case-by-case basis’. Israel also viewed sovereignty and non-intervention as being closely related, but noted that acts of intervention are ‘understood as having a high threshold’.\n## 2.7 Forcible Intervention as the Higher Threshold of Coercion\nMany States adopted the position that the threat or use of force is a form of coercion. Several States also described the threat or use of force as the gravest\n UNGA, ‘Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions’, at 87.\n Finnish Ministry for Foreign Affairs, ‘Finland’s Views on International Law and Cyberspace’, at 464.\n Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, ‘The Republic of Poland’s Position on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace’ (‘The threshold for considering a specific operation in cyberspace to be in breach of the principle of non-intervention is higher than in the case of deeming it solely a violation of the principle of sovereignty’).\n Canadian Government, ‘International Law Applicable in Cyberspace’.\n Schöndorf, ‘Israel’s Perspective on Key Legal and Practical Issues Concerning the Application of International Law to Cyber Operations’, at 403.\n See for example Costa Rican Ministry of Foreign Affairs, ‘Costa Rica’s Position on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace’: (‘Coercion is clear-cut when a State uses or threatens to use force against another one’); Danish Government, ‘Denmark’s Position Paper on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace’ (‘coercive acts involving the use of force are particularly obvious examples of unlawful interventions’); UNGA, ‘Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions’, at 57 (Netherlands: ‘the use of force will always meet the definition of coercion. Use of force against another state is always a form of intervention’).\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\nform of coercion. Some States, such as France and the Netherlands, also emphasized that acts that constitute a threat or use of force could also concurrently violate both the prohibition on intervention and state sovereignty. Many States also argued that the threshold of non-forceful coercion is lower than the threshold of forceful coercion. For example, Denmark underscored that 'coercion is not limited to means of direct or indirect use of force and that also measures below this threshold may constitute coercion'. Similarly, Germany stated: '[m]alicious cyber activities will only in some cases amount to direct or indirect use of force. However, measures below this threshold may also qualify as coercive'. The UK and the US also expressed this view.\nThe Common African Position did not take an express position on whether there is a distinction between the threshold of the use of force and the threshold of intervention. Rather, the Common African Position affirmed that the prohibition on intervention is a broad rule that applies to any forcible or non-forcible instrument of statecraft that might be used as means of coercion. It stated: '[t]he prohibition on intervention applies to the use of any instrument, including armed, political, economic, or any other means, and instruments of information, that may be used by a State for the purposes of intervening in the\n\nHELAL\ninternal or external affairs of a foreign State'. Brazil adopted the same view. It stated: 'the customary norm prohibiting intervention in the internal affairs of another State applies irrespective of the means or medium used and extends to the use of ICTs by States'. Similarly, Costa Rica stated:\nCoercion is clear-cut when a State uses or threatens to use force against another one. Nonetheless, it can also occur in a multitude of ways where one State, directly or indirectly through support for non-State actors, deprives another State of the capacity to make free and informed choices pertaining to its internal or external affairs.\nIn short, there is evidence of a consensus among those States that have issued national or regional position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace that the threat or use of force is, *ipso facto*, a form of coercion that is wrongful under both the prohibition on the threat or use of force and the prohibition on intervention. These position papers also show that there is a consensus on the principle that non-forcible conduct could also amount to intervention. The point of divergence, however, relates to the threshold of coercion that applies to non-forcible conduct. This is the subject of the next section.\n## 2.8 The Threshold of Non-forcible Coercion\nThis question of the exact threshold at which non-forcible conduct amounts to coercion is of critical importance. This is because most acts of unlawful intervention that could be undertaken through cyberspace are likely to fall below the threshold of forcible intervention. For example, activities such as election interference or disinformation campaigns will almost always fall below the threshold of the use of force. In fact, this is precisely the area – conduct below the threshold of the use of force, but above the threshold of violations of territorial sovereignty – where the prohibition on intervention is most relevant.\n Helal, ‘Common African Position’, at para. 29.\n UNGA, ‘Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions’, at 18.\n Costa Rican Ministry of Foreign Affairs, ‘Costa Rica’s Position on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace’, at 7.\n M. Schmitt, “Virtual” Disenfranchisement: Cyber Election Meddling in the Grey Zones of International Law’ (2018) 19 Chicago Journal of International Law 30–67, at 40 (Arguing that ‘because of the relatively high consequential threshold for violation, it is unlikely, although not inconceivable, that cyber election meddling would qualify as an unlawful use of force’).\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\nNational and regional position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace reveal that there is no consistency among States on the question of the threshold of coercion that applies to non-forcible intervention. This lack of consistency is evident even among States that adopted the same definition of coercion. In other words, even where there is some convergence among States on the meaning of coercion at a theoretical level, there are notable divergences on how the concept of coercion applies in real-world situations.\nAmong the States that defined coercion as conduct that modifies the behavior of a State or causes it to act involuntarily, there were notable differences in the terminology used to describe the threshold that applies to non-forcible coercion. Germany contended that, to constitute an act of intervention, a cyberoperation must be 'comparable in scale and effect to coercion in non-cyber contexts'. According to Germany, to meet the threshold of coercion, a cyberoperation must have the effect of 'significantly influenc[ing] or thwart[ing]' the decision-making process of a State to the point where its 'will is manifestly bent'.[109] Although it did not specify a definite threshold that non-forcible conduct must meet to constitute an act of intervention, Switzerland noted that a cyberoperation could amount to economic coercion if it paralyzed the operation of a 'company that is systemically relevant'.[110]\nOn the other hand, Poland indicated that, to constitute coercion, the foreign State's conduct must 'adversely affect' the 'functioning and security of the political, economic, military or social system of a state'.[111] Norway also provided examples of non-forcible coercive conduct that included 'manipulating election systems', 'unduly influencing public opinion', and 'causing a temporary shutdown' of critical infrastructure.[112]\nDenmark and Romania, both of which also defined coercion as conduct that modifies the behavior of a State or causes it to act involuntarily, did not explicitly identify a specific threshold at which non-forcible conduct could be considered coercive. Instead, Romania stated that an act of intervention must be intended to 'effectively change' the behavior of a State and underscored that 'there has to be a causal nexus between the coercive act and the effect on the internal or external affairs of the target State'.[113] Denmark's position paper also stated that 'an act may be considered of a coercive nature when the act\n\nHELAL\nof interference has a potential for compelling the target State to engage in an action that it would otherwise not take.\nTo this writer, the thresholds of coercion adopted by Germany and Switzerland are substantially higher than the thresholds adopted by Poland and Norway. The phrase ‘significantly influencing or thwarting’ that was used by Germany and the words ‘paralysis’ and ‘systemically relevant’ that Switzerland used signify a notably higher threshold of coercion than the term ‘adverse effects’ that was used by Poland and the phrases ‘manipulating election systems’ and ‘unduly influencing public opinion’ that Norway used. Denmark appears to have adopted an even lower threshold of coercion. For Denmark, a cyberoperation need not have an actual effect on the target State to be considered wrongful under the prohibition on intervention. Rather, a cyberoperation that merely has the ‘potential for compelling’ a State crosses the threshold of coercion. On the other hand, for Romania, the ‘potential’ to compel a State is insufficient. Rather, to constitute intervention, Romania requires that a State must be the target of a cyberoperation that has a measurable effect on the coerced State and that is causally connected to the behavior of the coercing State.\nThere are similar inconsistencies among the States that defined coercion as conduct that deprives a State of its freedom of choice or control over its domaine réservé. Australia, New Zealand, and Canada adopted broadly similar definitions of the threshold of coercion. According to Australia, conduct is coercive if it ‘effectively deprive[s]’ or is ‘intended to deprive’ a State of control over matters of an inherently sovereign nature. As discussed above, for Australia, examples of coercion include: ‘manipulating the electoral system to alter the results of an election’ or undermining the ‘fundamental operation of Parliament’ or the ‘stability of States’ financial systems. Similarly, for New Zealand, conduct is coercive if it has ‘significant effects’ on a State’s domaine réservé. Examples of acts that meet this threshold include ‘manipulating the voting tally’ in an election, preventing a ‘significant part of the electorate’ from voting, and causing ‘significant damage’ or ‘loss of functionality’ to critical infrastructure. According to Canada, intervention is conduct that has ‘coercive\n Danish Government, ‘Denmark’s Position Paper on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace’, at 450.\n UNGA, ‘Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions’, at 5.\n Ibid.\n New Zealand Foreign Affairs and Trade, ‘The Application of International Law to State Activity in Cyberspace’, at para. 9(b).\n Ibid.\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\neffects that deprive, compel, or impose an outcome on the affected State'. Again, as noted above, for Canada, examples of coercion include influencing the outcome of an election through a cyberoperation that 'hacks and disables a State's election commission' or by 'preventing a significant number of citizens from voting', in addition to 'disrupt[ing] the functioning of a major gas pipeline' to affect a State's negotiating position.[119] Finland provided similar examples of coercion. It noted that to constitute intervention in an election, the conduct of a foreign State must 'be of a serious nature', examples of which are altering electoral results through 'hacking of voter databases or manipulation of vote'.[120]\nBrazil, Czechia, Costa Rica, and the UK used different terms to describe the threshold of coercion. Brazil understood coercion as conduct 'affecting the right' of a State to choose its political, economic, social and cultural system and to formulate its foreign policy.[121] Czechia stated that an act is coercive if it 'intentionally aims to influence the State's free will and choice'.[122] For Costa Rica, conduct amounts to coercion if it impinges on a State's ability to make 'free and informed choices'. As noted above, Costa Rica also provided several examples of coercive conduct. These included: 'subversive or hostile propaganda', 'dissemination of false news', 'significant political or economic pressure', 'crippling or simply interfering' with public services, 'interfering with ballots or voter databases', and 'electoral disinformation campaigns'.[123] Like Costa Rica, the UK provided a wide-range of examples of coercive conduct. These included 'disruption of systems controlling emergency medical transport', 'causing hospital computer systems to cease functioning', 'disruption of supply chains for essential medicines and vaccines', 'preventing the operation of power generation infrastructure' or disrupting power supplies to 'housing, healthcare, education, civil administration and banking facilities and infrastructure', interfering with 'financial services' that are crucial to a State's financial system, and disrupting a State's 'fundamental ability to conduct monetary policy'.[124]\nTo this writer, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada adopted a higher threshold of coercion than that which Brazil, Czechia, Costa Rica, and the UK adopted. The former repeatedly used the word 'significant' to describe the\n\nHELAL\neffects that the conduct of a State must have in order to constitute coercion. Moreover, for those States, election interference must actually alter the results of an election to amount to intervention. Brazil, Czechia, Costa Rica, and the UK, however, used terms and phrases such as 'affecting', 'aims to influence', and 'free and informed choices' to describe the effects of the conduct of a foreign State. These terms signify a lower threshold of coercion. Indeed, unlike Australia, New Zealand, and Canada, the position papers of Brazil, Czechia, Costa Rica, and the UK did not require election interference to rise to the level of changing the results of an election to amount to intervention. Rather, these States used terms that would condemn as unlawful a broader range of forms of election interference. The UK, for instance, stated that covert operations that 'interfere with free and fair electoral processes' are a form of coercion,[125] while Costa Rica stated that launching disinformation campaigns and the dissemination of false news could constitute forms of unlawful electoral interference.\nAs noted above, the Common African Position did not identify a specific threshold at which non-forcible conduct amounts to coercion. Rather, the Common African Position noted that the definition of coercion requires further study among States, and explicitly rejected the thresholds that other States adopted in their position papers. The Common African Position stated: 'it is not necessary, in order to constitute coercion, that the conduct of a State must rise to the level of completely depriving a foreign State of its freedom of choice or to compel that State to either act or refrain from acting involuntarily'.[126]\nThis review of national and regional position papers reveals that there are three points of convergence among States on the question of the thresholds that delineate the boundaries of the prohibition on intervention. First, there is a consensus that the threat or use of force always crosses the threshold of coercion. Second, there is a consensus that non-intervention is a broad rule that covers both forcible and non-forcible forms of coercion. Third, there is a consensus that there are certain forms of conduct that, by their very nature, fall below the threshold of coercion. There is no consensus, however, on a specific list or catalogue of acts that are ipso facto non-coercive. However, given the positions expressed by Western States, it is reasonable to conclude that there is at least a general concurrence on the view expressed in the Common African Position that calls to settle disputes peacefully are not coercive. Beyond that, the main point of divergence among States relates to the threshold at which non-forcible conduct amounts to coercion. Indeed, as Canada noted: 'further\n\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\nState practice and opinio juris will help clarify the thresholds for the rule of non-intervention, and the scope of customary law in this area over time'.127\nThis is a question of paramount importance to understanding how non-intervention applies in cyberspace and other domains. As noted above, the utility of the prohibition on intervention is that it protects States against conduct that is more serious than an infringement on the territorial sovereignty of a State but that does not rise to the level of a threat or use of force. This issue – the threshold at which non-forcible conduct amounts to coercion – has not been addressed by the ICJ and remains a subject of scholarly debate.128\nSome scholars have argued that coercion is unsuited to function as an element of the prohibition on intervention, at least as it applies in cyberspace. For example, Duncan Hollis has opined that coercion may not be readily applicable to influence operations that use cyberspace to manipulate public opinion or disrupt the domestic political processes of a foreign State, such as Russia's interference in the 2016 US presidential election.129 Similarly, Ido Kilovaty has written that 'the norm of non-intervention, in its current narrow understanding, is almost irrelevant in a world where States increasingly resort to cyber operations as a method of interference [...] Coercion cannot contain the diversity of threats posed by new technologies. A new standard is, therefore, required'.130\nIn my view, we do not need a new standard. The challenge facing the application of the prohibition on intervention in cyberspace, and in other domains such as economic sanctions, is that there is no agreement among States on either the definition of coercion or on the minimum threshold of effects that must be met for conduct to constitute coercion. Any understanding of non-intervention must include a conceptual tool that distinguishes between unlawful intervention and lawful conduct that influences the policies of States. Whether that conceptual tool is called 'coercion', 'dictatorial interference',131\n\nHELAL\n‘imperative pressure’, ‘forcible compulsion or restraint’, or any other term is immaterial. What matters is the threshold of effects that defines and captures the essence of ‘coercion’, which can be applied to determine when specific conduct amounts to intervention. This is the question that Section 3 of this article addresses.\n## 3 Towards a Unified Threshold of Coercion\nIt is impossible, given the limitations of space, to comprehensively address the question of the threshold of coercion that applies to non-forcible conduct. This is a topic that requires further research. Nonetheless, in this section, this article will offer a general sketch of a threshold that could be employed to determine when non-forcible conduct amounts to coercion, thereby violating the prohibition on intervention. Specifically, this section proposes the adoption of a single, unified threshold of coercion that applies equally to both forcible and non-forcible intervention. According to this approach, non-forcible conduct would amount to coercion if its scale and effects are comparable to conduct that amounts to a violation of the prohibition on the threat or use of force.\nTwo considerations support this approach. The first is historical. Throughout its evolution, the prohibition on intervention was understood as a cognate of the prohibition on the threat or use of force. Non-intervention was designed to extend the protections afforded to States under the prohibition on the threat or use of force to non-forcible – but no less pernicious – instruments of statecraft. The second consideration is conceptual. The definitions of coercion that appear in national position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace that some States have issued impose an unreasonably high threshold of effects that must be met for non-forcible conduct to amount to an act of intervention. Defining coercion as causing a State to act ‘involuntarily’ or ‘depriving’ it of freedom of choice requires causing effects or\n R. Buchan and N. Tsagourias, ‘The Crisis in Crimea and the Principle of Non-Intervention’ (2017) 19 International Community Law Review 165–193, at 171 (‘Coercion denotes “imperative pressure” which manipulates the will of a state in order to extract some advantage or concession’).\n T. Gill, ‘Non-Intervention in the Cyber Context’ in K. Ziolkowski (ed.), *Peacetime Regime for State Activities in Cyberspace: International Law, International Relations and Diplomacy* (NATO CCD COE 2013) 217–238, at 223 (“Coercion” implies forcible compulsion or restraint’).\n Milanovic, ‘Revisiting Coercion as an Element of Prohibited Intervention in International Law’, at 607.\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\n\nBefore proceeding, one point merits special emphasis. The unified threshold of coercion that I propose here should not be understood as signaling that the prohibition on the use of force and the prohibition on intervention are coterminous. At least one writer has recently suggested that ‘under the *lex lata* the prohibition on intervention only applies to acts amounting to a use of force or constituting support for the violent overthrow of a foreign regime’. I disagree. As discussed below, at least since the adoption of the 1970 Friendly Relations Declaration, there has been a consensus among States that non-intervention is a broad rule that proscribes all forms of intervention, whether undertaken through forcible or non-forcible means. However, because there is no agreement among States on the meaning of coercion, there is continued uncertainty regarding when non-forcible conduct amounts to unlawful intervention. The unified threshold of coercion addresses this question by proposing a single test that applies to all forms of intervention, including armed force, or the use of political, economic, or informational instruments of statecraft, or some combination thereof.\n## 3.1 Coercion in the History of the Prohibition on Intervention\nAs argued in detail in another study by the present author, until the *Nicaragua Case* was decided by the ICJ in 1986, the concept of coercion was not defined, nor was it viewed as the cornerstone of the prohibition on intervention. Moreover, throughout its evolution, States never understood intervention as conduct that causes a State to act involuntarily or that deprives it of its freedom of choice or control over its domestic jurisdiction. This is why, to this writer, the definitions of coercion that States have included in their national and regional position papers should be viewed as proposals *de lege ferenda*, and not restatements of established *lex lata*. To substantiate this claim, this\n O. Pomson, ‘The Prohibition on Intervention Under International Law and Cyber Operations’ (2022) 99 International Law Studies 180–219, at 183.\n M. Helal, ‘Intervention, Force &amp; Coercion – An Historical Inquiry on the Evolution of the Prohibition on Intervention’ (2024) 103 International Law Studies (forthcoming).\nHELAL\nsection provides an overview of the terms and travaux préparatoires of the principal instruments in which the prohibition on intervention was codified. This overview begins with three Inter-American treaties that first included non-intervention as a distinct rule of international law, followed by the 1970 Friendly Relations Declaration, the adoption of which marked the acceptance of the prohibition on intervention as a rule of general international law.\nThe prohibition on intervention originated as a rule of conventional international law in the Inter-American system. It was first codified in Article 8 of the 1933 Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States, which reads as follows: 'No State has the right to intervene in the internal or external affairs of another'.[137] The prohibition on intervention was further reaffirmed and its scope was expanded with the adoption of the 1936 Additional Protocol Relative to Non-Intervention, Article I of which states: 'The High Contracting Parties declare inadmissible the intervention of any one of them, directly or indirectly, and for whatever reason, in the internal or external affairs of any other of the Parties'.[138]\nThe principal purpose of these provisions was to overturn the right of States to resort to acts of intervention, which was established under 19th century international law. At the time, States were permitted wage war or to engage in so-called measures short of war – i.e., acts of intervention – for an expansive range of reasons.[139] These included preserving the balance of power, repelling attacks against a State's territory, preempting an imminent armed attack, obtaining reparation for injuries inflicted on the interests or honor of the State, protecting the lives and property of citizens, securing the repayment of debts, and preventing mass atrocities.[140] Intervention was accepted as permissible\n\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\nbecause it was predicated on the right of self-preservation, which was recognized as a fundamental right of States. Given that they were often the target of forcible and non-forcible acts of intervention by the European powers and the United States, Latin American States and scholars championed the cause of codifying an absolute prohibition on intervention as a rule of international law in the Inter-American system. This objective was achieved with the adoption of the 1933 Montevideo Convention, the 1936 Non-Intervention Protocol, and the 1948 Charter of the Organization of American States, which included the broadest formulation of the prohibition on intervention.\nDuring the negotiations on the 1933 Montevideo Convention and the 1936 Non-Intervention Protocol, coercion was not defined; it was not identified as a constituent element of the prohibition on intervention, nor were acts of intervention understood as involving conduct that causes a State to behave involuntarily or that deprives a State of freedom of choice or control over its domain réservé. Indeed, the term 'coercion' does not even appear in either of these treaties. However, during the negotiations on the 1933 Montevideo Convention, a subcommittee composed of Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, Ecuador, El-Salvador, Haiti, and Peru that had been entrusted with drafting the convention prepared a report that provides an insight into how the negotiating parties understood the term 'intervention'. In its report, the subcommittee defined 'the juridical concept of intervention' as follows:\nAny act of a State, through diplomatic representation, by armed force, or by any other means involving effective force, with a view to making the State's will dominate the will of another State, and, in general, any maneuver, interference or interposition of any sort, employing such means, either directly or indirectly in matter of the obligations of another State, whatever its motive, shall be considered as Intervention, and likewise a violation of International Law.\nIt would seem quite unnecessary to state that the Sub-Committee was, and is, in perfect accord that any friendly act to offer good offices and\n\nHELAL\nmediation in the foreign relations of States in order to maintain peace is, by its very nature, outside the definition of intervention. This applies also to the united action of the formation of the League of Nations, the universal peace agent, of which the majority of the American States are members.^[146]^\nThe first sentence of this definition is instructive. The key phrase here is 'effective force with a view to making the State's will dominate the will of another State'. To this writer, it indicates that the drafters of the 1933 Montevideo Convention understood intervention as encompassing the use of armed force and any non-forcible conduct the effects of which are comparable to the use of force. This understanding of intervention was echoed by several States during the negotiations on the convention. Ecuador, for example stated: 'We have outlawed war. What is intervention but a kind of war, disguised and wary.'^[147]^ Argentina also stated: 'What is intervention, then, but violence? [...] Intervention is violence.'^[148]^ El Salvador also defined intervention in identical terms. It stated: 'Because the American conscience is such that territorial acquisitions originated by violence cannot be recognized; that violence has generally come to disturb the life of our countries in the form of intervention.'^[149]^ Peru shared this understanding of intervention. It argued in favor of adopting Article 8 of the 1933 Montevideo Convention because 'war is proscribed, so is violence, but not the use of arms, the diplomatic measures or any other means of effective compulsion.'^[150]^\nThe Charter of the Organization of American States, which was adopted in 1948,^[151]^ incorporated and expanded on the provisions on non-intervention in the 1933 Montevideo Convention and the 1936 Non-Intervention Protocol. Article 19 and 20 of the OAS Charter state:\n## Article 19\nNo State or group of States has the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatever, in the internal or external affairs of any other State. The foregoing principle prohibits not only armed force but also any\n\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\n\n## Article 20\nNo State may use or encourage the use of coercive measures of an economic or political character in order to force the sovereign will of another State and obtain from it advantages of any kind.\nArticle 19 of the OAS Charter includes two sentences, the first of which is virtually identical to Article 1 of 1936 Non-Intervention Protocol, which itself was based on Article 8 of the 1933 Montevideo Convention. Like its antecedents, the principal purpose of the first sentence of Article 19 was to reaffirm that, at least in Inter-American international law, the right of intervention that was recognized in 19th century international law was abolished. The inclusion of the phrase 'for whatever reason', which first appeared in the 1936 Non-Intervention Protocol, also indicated that non-intervention was an absolute rule that admitted no exceptions. Accordingly, the grounds that had previously been invoked to justify intervention – such as protecting citizens abroad, collecting debts, or enforcing international law – were no longer valid.\nThe second sentence of Article 19 clarified a principle that was only implicit in the 1933 Montevideo Convention and the 1936 Non-Intervention Protocol. It confirmed that non-intervention proscribed both the use of armed force and any other instrument of statecraft to engage in acts of intervention. Although, as noted above, the subcommittee that drafted the 1933 Montevideo Convention had affirmed that intervention could be undertaken 'through diplomatic representation, by armed force, or any other means involving effective force', this was not explicitly stated in either the 1933 Montevideo Convention or the 1936 Non-Intervention Protocol. The second sentence of Article 19 was also intended to prohibit acts of subversion that seek to impinge on the political independence of a State by subjugating it or transforming it into a satellite of a foreign power or that undermine its capacity to manage its political, economic, and cultural affairs autonomously.[152]\n\nHELAL\nArticle 20 of the OAS Charter is the first provision in which the term ‘coercion’ is used in relation to the prohibition on intervention. Coercion was not used, however, in order to signify the defining characteristic of intervention, nor was it designed to function as the conceptual tool that distinguishes between unlawful intervention and lawful conduct that seeks to influence the behavior of States. Rather, the authors of the OAS Charter drafted Article 20 with two objectives in mind. First, this provision was intended to proscribe economic sanctions that are imposed unilaterally by a State in response to an injury inflicted upon it by another State, and second, it was intended to outlaw the use of economic or political instruments of statecraft to pressure a State into giving concessions against its will. This becomes apparent from the negotiating history of Article 20.\nThis provision was formulated on the basis of two proposals that were submitted by Brazil and Cuba during the negotiations on the OAS Charter. The Cuban proposal stated: ‘No American State may unilaterally apply to another coercive measures of an economic nature that constitute retaliation or that tend to force the sovereign will of the State against which it is applied’. Similarly, the Brazilian proposal stated:\nIt is prohibited for a State to exercise or support economic or political pressure on any other, in order to obtain advantages of any nature from that other State, not including, however, in the category of pressure the sanctions adopted in accordance with a determination of a competent international body. The American State that feels that it is subjected to economic or political pressure from any other State, that State has the\nwas responsible and Colombia severed diplomatic relations with the USSR. This led the conference to adopt a resolution titled: ‘The Preservation and Defence of Democracy’ that condemned ‘interference by any foreign power, or by any political organization serving the interests of a foreign power, in the political life of the nations of the American continent’ and committed the member States of the OAS to take ‘the measures necessary to eradicate and prevent activities directed, assisted or instigated by foreign governments, organizations or individuals tending to overthrow their institutions by violence, to foment disorder in their domestic political life or to disturb, by means of pressure, subversive propaganda, threats or by any other means, the free and sovereign right of their peoples to govern themselves in accordance with their democratic aspirations’.

In its report the subcommittee explained the purpose of this provision as follows:\n[T]he two essential characteristics of the proposed text are the following: First, it condemns any action or attempted action that tends to force a State, despite its sovereignty, to adopt any attitude that State deems contrary to its interests; and second, such condemnation is in no way affected by the nature of the benefits sought by the State that exercises or encourages the coercive action. The members of the Subcommittee present were in complete agreement with the fact that the proposed text does not affect in any way the application of sanctions of an economic nature authorized by certain international organizations by virtue of current pacts.^[155]^\nThe negotiating history of the three Inter-American treaties in which the prohibition on intervention was first codified does not provide support for the definitions of coercion that many States have adopted in their national position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace. In fact, the concept of coercion was not even the subject of any in-depth discussions during the drafting of these treaties. Rather, the term coercion was only introduced in Article 20 of the OAS Charter specifically to outlaw the imposition of unilateral economic sanctions. Likewise, there is little in the negotiations on the principal instruments that were adopted on non-intervention by the UN that supports the definitions of coercion that appear in national position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace.\n^[154]^ Ibid., at 83.\n^[155]^ Novena Conferencia Internacional Americana, Actas y Documentos, Vol. II: Comisiones Reglamentarias, Comisión de Credenciales – Comisión de Iniciativas – Comisión de Coordinación – Comisión de Estilo (Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de Colombia 1953), at 387–388. It should be noted that during the negotiations on this provision, the US agreed that the unilateral imposition of economic sanctions is unlawful. See Ninth International Conference of American States, Bogotá, Colombia, March 30–May 2, 1948: Report of the Delegation of the United States of America with Related Documents (Department of State Publication No. 8262, November 1948) (In its official report on the proceedings of the Bogota Conference, the US delegation stated: ‘the principle that no nation should indulge in unilateral economic sanctions is, of course, valid’).\nHELAL\nAlthough the prohibition on intervention was not codified in the UN Charter, it was included in many instruments that were subsequently negotiated at the UN. These include the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the 1963 Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, the 1949 Declaration on the Rights and Duties and States and the 1954 Code of Offenses Against the Peace and Security of Mankind both of which were drafted by the International Law Commission, in addition to several General Assembly resolutions such as Resolution 31/91 on Non-Interference in the Internal Affairs of States, and the 1981 Declaration on the Inadmissibility of Intervention and Interference in the Internal Affairs of States. It is impossible in this article to provide a complete account of how the principle of non-intervention was articulated in these UN instruments. Therefore, I will focus here on the negotiations on non-intervention in the 1970 Friendly Relations Declaration, which contains the most authoritative expression of the prohibition on intervention.\nDuring the negotiations on the 1970 Friendly Relations Declaration and the 1965 Declaration on the Inadmissibility of Intervention in the Domestic Affairs of States, on which the section on non-intervention in the 1970 Friendly Relations Declaration was based, coercion was neither defined nor was it considered the distinguishing characteristic of intervention. Rather, the\n It is often mistakenly assumed that Article 2(7) of the UN Charter is a codification of the prohibition on intervention. It is not. This provision does not govern interstate relations. Rather, it applies to the conduct of the UN, as a distinct legal person, in its relations with its member States. See G. Nolte, ‘Purposes and Principles, Article 2(7)’ in B. Simma et al.

Initially, many (mostly Western) States answered this question in the affirmative. To those States, the prohibition on intervention was limited to proscribing the direct and indirect use of armed force by States. Conversely, Non-Aligned and Eastern Bloc States, insisted that non-intervention was a broader rule that prohibited all forms of the use of force and other non-forcible forms of conduct. Ultimately, the broader understanding of non-intervention was adopted. It was accepted that this rule outlawed the use of any instrument of statecraft – whether forcible or non-forcible – that may be employed to infringe on the domestic jurisdiction of States. There was, however, no attempt during these negotiations to formulate a threshold that determines when non-forcible conduct amounts to intervention. Instead, most States either identified specific forms of conduct that, in their view, amounted to intervention, or simply described intervention as the exertion of pressure against a State.\n 1964) UN Doc. A/AC.119/SR.28, at 5. Similarly, France stated: ‘any attempt to define intervention must cover [...] the idea of coercion, i.e., of abnormal or improper pressure exercised by one State on another State in order to force it to change its internal structure in a direction favorable to the interests of the State applying such coercion’. Ibid., at 10. Mexico also noted that, in addition to outlawing the use of force, the prohibition on intervention was designed to outlaw ‘coercive measures of an economic or political nature’. Mexico did not, however, offer a definition of coercion. Rather, it stated that in order to distinguish between lawful pressure and unlawful intervention the ‘criterion of the illegality of such coercion was the object sought’.

That text did not refer to coercion at all. Instead, it defined intervention as either the use of armed force or conduct 'of such design and effect as to impair or destroy the political independence or territorial integrity of another State'.[165] Those six States explained that the latter sentence was broadly synonymous to the phrase 'to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights' that appears in the 1970 Friendly Relations Declaration.[166] According to those States, their proposed formulation provided a better juridical expression of the scope and content of the prohibition on intervention.[167]\nof economic pressure'); UNGA, 'First Committee, 1422nd Meeting, Twentieth Session' (20 December 1965) UN Doc.

First, it would be incoherent to apply to non-forcible intervention that is undertaken through instruments such as information operations or economic sanctions a threshold of coercion that is higher than that which applies to the use of armed force, which is the gravest form of intervention. Second, even if one were to ignore the inconsistency between the thresholds of forcible and non-forcible intervention, the definitions of coercion that apply to the latter that some States have adopted are unreasonably high and severely restrict the scope of application of the prohibition on intervention. This section addresses these two points.\nAs noted above, virtually all position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace affirmed that the threat or use of force is *ipso facto* coercive. Many States also underscored that the use of force is the gravest form of coercion. This reflects the principle that the prohibition on the use of force is a peremptory rule of international law. Paradoxically, however, if, as many States propose, coercion is defined as conduct that causes a State to behave involuntarily or that deprives it of freedom of choice or control, non-forcible conduct would be governed by a higher threshold than that which applies to armed intervention. This is because, under *jus ad bellum*, the threshold of scale\njuridical language', and added that this proposal 'drew attention to the fact that no action of whatever character should be taken which would in any way impair or destroy the territorial integrity or political independence of States – ideas which were clearly recognized and defined in international law'. UNGA, '1966 Special Committee on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation Among States, Summary Record of the Fifteenth Meeting', at 11.\nHELAL\nand effects that must be met for an act to constitute a violation of the prohibition on the use of force is relatively low.\nThere is a general consensus among scholars that the prohibition on the use of force applies to conduct that has physical effects; that is conduct that, either directly or indirectly, causes 'death of or injury to persons, or damage to or destruction of property'.[168] Virtually all position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace endorsed this definition of the use of force.[169] However, there is no consensus on the de minimis threshold of scale and effects that must be met for conduct to be considered a violation of the prohibition on the use of force.[170] Some scholars have argued that there are cases of the use of force that do not, due to their limited scale and effects, amount to a use of force.[171] The Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on the Conflict in Georgia endorsed this view.[172] Conversely, other writers, contend that the\n\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\napplication of the prohibition on the use of force is not subject to a gravity threshold, which means that any use of force by one State against another State – regardless of its scale and effects – is governed by this rule.173 The ICJ has not taken a definitive position on this question.174\nWhatever position one takes on this matter, one thing is clear. The threshold that must be met for an act to constitute an instance of the use of force is low. Even the threshold for an armed attack, the gravest form of the use of force, is relatively low.175 As the International Law Association noted, 'it appears that the gravity threshold attached to armed attacks is not markedly high, and would include most uses of force likely to cause casualties or significant property damage'.176\nCompared to the threshold of the use of force, the definitions of coercion that many States have adopted in their national position papers impose a much higher threshold of coercion for non-forcible conduct. Nothing in *jus ad bellum* requires the use of force to be of such gravity that it *significantly influences* or *thwarts* the decision-making processes of a State to the extent that its will is *manifestly bent*, which is the definition of coercion adopted by Germany. Similarly, *jus ad bellum* does not require the State to be subjected to a level of compulsion that causes it to 'act in an involuntary manner or to refrain from acting in a certain manner', which is the definition of coercion adopted by Estonia and several other States. Nor is it necessary under *jus ad bellum* for a State to be exposed to such pressure that *deprives* it of freedom of choice or *compels* or *imposes* an outcome on the State, which is the definition of coercion adopted by Canada.\n\nHELAL\nIn addition to the incongruence of having a threshold of coercion for non-forcible intervention that is higher than that which applies to forcible intervention, the definitions of coercion that some States have adopted impose an unreasonably high threshold for non-forcible conduct. To meet the threshold of causing a State to act involuntarily or to deprive it of freedom of choice or control over its domestic jurisdiction, the conduct of the coercing State must be of such intensity that it overwhelms the coerced State and leaves it with no viable choice but to submit to the demands of the coercing State. In both jurisprudence and philosophy, involuntariness is generally understood as being a situation where an actor lacks a meaningful choice or has no reasonable alternative but to comply with the demands of another actor. Applying these definitions would significantly reduce the scope of the prohibition on intervention, thereby permitting a wide-range of non-forcible conduct both in cyberspace and beyond.\nTake the definition of coercion in Canada's national position paper on the application of international law in cyberspace. As noted above, Canada defined coercion as conduct that compels or imposes an outcome on the affected State or deprives it of its freedom of choice. Canada also provided the following example of an act of unlawful intervention in an election: '[a]n\n The definitions of coercion adopted by most States (coercion as conduct that causes a State to act involuntarily and coercion as conduct that deprives a State of freedom of choice or control) appear to echo the definition of coercion that the ILC adopted in its Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts. The ILC stated that coercion 'has the same essential character as force majeure', which it defined as a situation where the conduct of a State is 'involuntary or at least involves no element of free choice'. As the ILC explained, the degree of pressure required for a State to be placed in a position where its conduct is 'involuntary' or lacking the 'element of free choice' is one of 'irresistible force'. To be clear, States have not cited the Articles on State Responsibility as an authority to support their definitions of coercion. Nonetheless, there is a striking resemblance between the ILC's definition of coercion and the definitions adopted by many States in their position papers. In my view, this is a threshold of pressure that is far higher than anything required by the jus ad bellum. For the ILC's discussion of the concepts of coercion and force majeure, see UN ILC, 'Report of the International Law Commission: Fifty-Third Session' (23 April–1 June and 2 July–10 August 2001) GAOR 56th Session Supp. 10 (A/56/10), at 69, 77–78.\n The literature of coercion and voluntariness in both law and philosophy is vast and varied. Nonetheless, there is general agreement among scholars in these fields that an agent will be deemed to have behaved involuntarily if they were left with no viable or meaningful choice. See generally T. Honoré, 'A Theory of Coercion' (1990) 10 Oxford Journal of Legal Studies 94–105; M. Alvarez, 'The Concept of Voluntariness' (2016) 7 Jurisprudence 665–671; S. Olsaretti, 'Voluntariness, Coercion, Self-Ownership' in D. Schmidtz and C. Pavel (eds), The Oxford Handbook of Freedom (Oxford University Press 2018) 439–455.\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\nexample of a prohibited intervention would be a malicious cyber activity that hacks and disables a State's election commission days before an election, preventing a significant number of citizens from voting, and ultimately influencing the election outcome.[179]\nUnder this definition, almost all of the conduct that appears in a recent report published by a commission established by the Canadian government to investigate foreign interference in Canadian elections would not be wrongful under the prohibition on intervention.[180] The report, which is titled Public Inquiry into Foreign Interference in Federal Electoral Processes and Democratic Institutions, noted that foreign interference did not determine the outcome of the election. The report did, however, state the following:\nThe fact that foreign interference may not have impacted the outcomes in many ridings does not mean, however, that it did not impact the election. Foreign interference in 2019 and 2021 undermined the right of voters to have an electoral ecosystem free from coercion or covert influence. Foreign interference has an impact when there is a single instance where a ballot is cast in a certain way, or not cast at all, because of a foreign state's direct or indirect enticement.[181]\nThe report added that this foreign interference affected the electoral ecosystem and had the overall effect of '[u]ndermining faith in democracy and government' and led to a 'reduced trust in Canada's democratic process'.[182] Under Canada's definition of coercion, this conduct would not be unlawful. The foreign interference catalogued in this report did not impose any particular choice on Canada nor did it significantly affect the outcome of an election. Likewise, this conduct would not meet the threshold of causing a State to act involuntarily. Nonetheless, the political effects of foreign interference of this nature are serious, especially in the long-term. Failing to proscribe conduct of this nature would turn the prohibition on intervention into a normative empty shell that provides little protection to States and would permit a broad range of disruptive non-forcible behavior.\nHELAL\nThis is why I believe that the Common African Position was right to define coercion as conduct that is designed 'to impose restraints on the will of a foreign state', which is a markedly lower threshold than that proposed by other States. The question, however, is what exactly does 'imposing restraints' entail and at what point can one say that the exertion of pressure on a State has reached the point of 'imposing restraints' on its will?\nTo this writer – and I must emphasize that this is the author's view, not that of the member States of the African Union – the threshold of coercion for non-forcible conduct should be defined as being comparable to the minimum effects of conduct that amounts to a threat or use of force. In other words, for non-forcible conduct – such as political, economic, or informational measures – to amount to intervention, the effects of the conduct in question should be comparable to that which is entailed by the threat or use of force. I call this the unified threshold of coercion. The practical effect of adopting the unified threshold of coercion is that any non-forcible conduct that causes effects on a scale that is comparable to conduct that amounts to a violation of the prohibition on the threat or use of force would constitute a breach of the prohibition on intervention.\nTo further explain, other reports by the Canadian government provide understandings of foreign interference that, to this writer, approximates the degree of effects that would meet the unified threshold of coercion, thereby amounting to a breach of the prohibition on intervention. In one report published by the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians, foreign interference was defined in the following terms: '[f]oreign interference involves foreign states, or persons/entities operating on their behalf, attempting to covertly influence decisions, events or outcomes to better suit their strategic interests'.[183] This report also stated: 'foreign interference includes attempts to covertly influence, intimidate, manipulate, interfere, corrupt or discredit individuals, organizations and governments to further the interests of a foreign country'.[184] It also underscored that 'foreign interference should be understood as a long-term effort, akin to espionage, using inducements or threats. Both dynamics enable the manipulation of targets when required, for example, through requests for inappropriate or special favours'.[185] This report\n\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\nprovided examples of behavior that would not amount to unlawful intervention. These include:\nForeign interference activities are distinct from acceptable diplomatic advocacy and lobbying. The latter activities are known to the host state and occur through recognized channels to achieve specific policy outcomes or objectives. It is normal for foreign diplomats in Canada, for example, to reach out to elected officials across the political spectrum, to pressure policymakers, to use local media to promote their national interests or to engage with and support domestic organizations.^[186]^\nAn earlier report, also published by the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians of Canada, states the following: '[f]oreign interference activities can include using deceptive means to cultivate relationships with elected officials and others perceived to processes influence in the political process; seek to influence the reporting of Canadian media outlets; seek, in some cases, to affect the outcome of elections; and coerce or induce diaspora communities to advance foreign interests in Canada'.^[187]^ The understandings of foreign interference in these reports are palpably broader than the definition of coercion in most national position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace, including Canada's. To this writer, these reports describe the kinds of conduct that were intended to be covered by the Common African Position, and which would be covered by the unified threshold of coercion proposed here.\nTwo considerations lend support to this understanding of coercion. First, adopting a unified threshold of coercion that applies to both forcible and non-forcible intervention is consistent with the history of the evolution of the prohibition on intervention. Throughout the negotiations on instruments in which non-intervention was codified, States consistently viewed acts of intervention as being analogous to the use of force.^[188]^ For example, as noted above, the drafters of the 1933 Montevideo Convention described intervention\n\nHELAL\nas any act that amounts to 'effective force'. It indicates that the authors of the Montevideo Convention understood non-forcible intervention to be the functional equivalent of armed force.\nMoreover, during the debates on the Montevideo Convention, several Latin American States underscored that non-intervention was closely associated to the prohibition on the use of force. For example, Argentina stated: 'What is intervention, then, but violence? [...] Intervention is violence.'[189] El Salvador also affirmed that '[b]ecause the American conscience is such that territorial acquisitions originated by violence cannot be recognized; that violence has generally come to disturb the life of our countries in the form of intervention'.[190] Peru also emphasized that 'war is proscribed, so is violence, but not the use of arms, the diplomatic measures or any other means of effective compulsion'.[191] Ecuador also highlighted that '[w]hat is intervention but a kind of war, disguised and wary' and argued that, having outlawed aggression pursuant to the 1933 Anti-War Treaty of Non-Aggression and Conciliation, it was only natural for the States of the western hemisphere to proscribe intervention.[192] Similarly, during the negotiations on the OAS Charter, Cuba called economic coercion 'treacherous, silent, and underhanded aggression'.[193]\nMany States expressed similar views during the negotiations on both the 1965 Declaration on Non-Intervention and the 1970 Friendly Relations Declaration. For example, Guinea described intervention as a 'more pernicious' form of aggression,[194] Trinidad and Tobago called it 'subtle and insidious' aggression,[195] and the Congo argued that non-intervention covered 'political pressure, subversive activities, and other acts of aggression'.[196] Furthermore, throughout debates on non-intervention at the UN, many States frequently described non-intervention as being derivable from or a corollary of the non-use of force.[197] In short, in addition to outlawing intervention through armed\n\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\nforce, the prohibition on intervention was designed to protect States against non-forceful conduct that was viewed as being functionally equivalent to the use of force – i.e., conduct that entailed a degree of pressure that is comparable to the use of armed force.\nIn addition to being consistent with the historical evolution of non-intervention, adopting a unified threshold of coercion that applies to all forms of intervention reflects the fact that non-intervention and the non-use of force share the same policy purpose. The ICJ has stated that ‘a rule of international law, whether customary or conventional, does not operate in a vacuum; it operates in relation to facts and in the context of a wider framework of legal rules of which it forms only a part’. Writing in more colorful terms, James Crawford observed that ‘customary rules usually hunt in packs, connected by some familial relationship and interacting with each other’.\nNon-intervention and the non-use of force belong to the same normative ‘pack’. These rules are part of what scholars call the ‘law of coexistence’, the policy purpose of which is to protect the autonomy of States and enable them to coexist peacefully in an anarchic international system. Specifically, these two rules – non-intervention and the non-use of force – are designed to protect the physical and functional manifestations of sovereignty. These two ‘domains’ of sovereignty – the physical and the functional – are expressed by the concepts of the ‘territorial integrity’ and ‘political independence’ of States, which appear in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. Non-intervention extended the\nSR.31, at 11 (Yugoslavia: non-intervention is a ‘natural corollary of Article 2(4)’ of the UN Charter); UNGA, ‘Special Committee on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation Among States, First Session, Summary Records of the Thirtieth Meeting’, at 5–6 (Mexico: Article 2(4) is among the provisions of the Charter that provided ‘a solid and irrefutable basis’ for non-intervention).\n Interpretation of the Agreement of 25 March 1951 Between the WHO and Egypt (Advisory Opinion) [20 December 1980] ICJ Rep. 73, at para. 10.\n J.

Far from it. Although both rules share the same policy purposes, the prohibition on intervention is broader than the prohibition on the threat or use of force. Non-intervention applies to any policy or practice, whether forcible and non-forcible, that impinges on the political independence or territorial integrity of States. In a sense, therefore, the prohibition on the threat or use of force should be viewed as a *lex specialis* that applies to a specific genus of intervention (namely, *armed* intervention). This body of *lex specialis* has been subsumed, *in toto*, within the broader *lex generalis* of the prohibition on intervention.\nIn conclusion, further research and further expressions of State views are needed on the definition and threshold of coercion. This is essential to understanding how the prohibition on intervention applies to and governs non-forcible conduct both in cyberspace and beyond. To this writer, however, the unified threshold of coercion that this article proposes provides a conceptual foundation on which to formulate a workable and conceptually coherent approach to applying the prohibition on intervention.\n Law – Its Concept and Implications for Crimea' (2015) 75 Zeitschrift für ausländisches öffentliches Recht und Völkerrecht 7–26, at 10. As Georges Abi-Saab wrote: 'The international legal system is based at present as in the past, on two fundamental principles that determine its structure and functioning, namely, the sovereignty and equality of States [...] The principal legal consequence of this structural or rather structuring principle is to commit each State to a general obligation to respect the sovereignty of others; in other words, not to trespass on the territorial and functional ambits of this sovereignty. The most flagrant manifestation of such trespass is the threat or use of force against the State. But it is not the only one. Other, less blatant, forms exist varying in their degree of visibility and intensity. It is precisely the rest of this continuum, beyond the use of force, which is covered by the principle of non-intervention'. G. Abi-Saab, 'Some Thoughts on the Principle of Non-Intervention' in K.

It focuses on coercion as an element of the prohibition on intervention and identifies the different definitions of coercion that States have adopted in national and regional position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace. This article also specifically discusses the views of States on the threshold of coercion, which is the degree of harm or the effects that the conduct of a State must cause (or threaten to cause) to amount to a violation of the prohibition on intervention. This article argues that the definitions and thresholds of coercion that States have adopted in debates on the application of international law in cyberspace should be viewed as proposals for the development of the law in this area, as opposed to restatements of established law. Instead, this article proposes that all forms of intervention should be governed by a ‘unified threshold of coercion’ that applies to both forcible and non-forcible intervention.\n## Keywords\nprohibition on intervention – cyberspace – coercion – prohibition on the threat or use of force\n© KONINKLIJKE BRILL BV, LEIDEN, 2024 | DOI:10.1163/18757413_02701019\nHELAL\n# 1 Introduction\nIt is undisputed that the prohibition on intervention is a rule of customary international law. This rule is also codified in numerous conventions, including the founding instruments of several regional organizations. Non-intervention was also applied by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in several cases, the most important of which is the Nicaragua Case. This rule was also reaffirmed in many UN General Assembly resolutions, the most notable of which is the 1970 Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Co-Operation Among States in Accordance with the Charter of the United Nations ('1970 Friendly Relations Declaration'). The prohibition on intervention also appears in the 1949 Declaration on the Rights and Duties of States and the 1954 Code of Offenses Against the Peace and Security of Mankind which were adopted by the International Law Commission (ILC).\n1.

Examples of multilateral treaties in which non-intervention is codified include: Article 41(1) Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (done 18 April 1961, entered into force 24 April 1964) 500 UNTS 95; Article 55(1) Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (done 23 April 1963, entered into force 19 March 1967) 596 UNTS 261. Some of the founding instruments of regional organizations in which the prohibition on intervention also appears, albeit in varying formulations, include: Articles 19–20 Charter of the Organization of American States (signed 30 April 1948, entered into force 13 December 1951) 119 UNTS 3; Article 4(g) Constitutive Act of the African Union (signed 11 July 2000, entered into force 26 May 2001) 2158 UNTS 3; Article 1(4) Charter of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (adopted 14 March 2008), available at <https: charter=\"\" en=\"\" documents=\"\" oic_charter_2018_en.pdf=\"\" www.oic-oci.org=\"\" upload=\"\">; Article 2(2) Charter of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (done 20 November 2007, entered into force 15 December 2008) 2624 UNTS 223.\n3.

States from every region and from every political bloc have accused their adversaries (and sometimes even their allies) of intervening in their affairs.[8]\nIn recent years, there has been a growing interest among States and scholars in the principle of non-intervention. One reason is that cyberspace has become a domain of conflict and competition. Information and communication technologies (ICTs) are being used both as weapons of war and as instruments of non-forcible intervention.[9] States, state-sponsored non-State actors, and non-State groups and individuals acting independently have employed ICTs against foreign States, citizens, and companies to achieve various political, economic, criminal, scientific, and financial objectives. ICTs have been used to disrupt critical infrastructure, spread disinformation and propaganda to sow social discord, interfere in elections, acquire industrial and trade secrets, steal scientific research and intellectual property, and to gain profit through activities such as ransomware attacks. As a result, there is a growing corpus of state practice and expressions of opinio juris, in addition to a sizable body of scholarship, on how the prohibition on intervention applies in cyberspace. This article engages with these discussions.\nSpecifically, this article has two objectives. First, it explores how States have defined the concept of coercion,[10] which is considered a core component of\n\nHELAL\nthe prohibition on intervention. It also examines how States have demarcated the boundary between, on one hand, the prohibition on intervention and, on the other, the obligation to respect the territorial sovereignty of States and the prohibition on the threat or use of force, which are two rules that are closely associated with the prohibition on intervention.\nThis article will do so by surveying national and regional position papers that States have issued in recent years on the application of international law in cyberspace in which States have outlined their views on the scope and content of the prohibition on intervention and on how it governs the conduct of States in cyberspace. These position papers were issued, at least partially, in response to calls by the UN Open-Ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (OEWG) for States to express their opinions on how international law applies in cyberspace. The OEWG is one of the two principal forums in which discussions at the UN on the regulation of cyberspace are conducted, the other being the UN Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security (GGE).\nIn addition to being of interest to scholars who specialize in the regulation of cyberspace, these national and regional position papers also deserve special attention from generalist scholars of international law. Most of these position papers are not framed as expressions of State views on *lex specialis* that apply only in cyberspace. Rather, they contain detailed statements on the scope and content of a wide range of *lex generalis* followed by discussions on how these rules of general international law apply in cyberspace. This makes these position papers a rich source of *opinio juris* on various primary and secondary rules\n p. 11 A. Tzanakopoulos, ‘The Right to be Free from Economic Coercion’ (2015) 4 Cambridge Journal of International Law 616–633, at 620 (‘Coercion is a method of illegal intervention [...] coercion is intervention. Seeking to coerce a state within its sphere of freedom is wrongful; it constitutes intervention’).\n UNGA, ‘Open-Ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security – Final Substantive Report’ (10 March 2021) UN Doc. A/AC.290/2021/CRP.2, at para. 38. (The OEWG recommended that ‘States, on a voluntary basis, continue to inform the Secretary-General of their national views and assessments on how international law applies to their use of ICTs in the context of international security, and continue to voluntarily share such national views and practices through other avenues as appropriate’).\n See C. Painter, ‘The United Nations’ Cyberstability Processes: Surprising Progress but Much Left to Do’ (2021) 6 Journal of Cyber Policy 271–276.\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\nof international law, many of which are foundational to the international legal order. Some of the rules covered by these position papers include sovereignty, the prohibition on the threat or use of force, the peaceful settlement of disputes, human rights, the laws of armed conflict, the rules of attribution, and of course, the prohibition on intervention, which is the subject of this article.\nExamining these national and regional position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace reveals that, while the prohibition on intervention is accepted as a rule of general international law, there remains considerable uncertainty regarding the exact scope and content of this rule. In particular, there are notable differences among States on the definition of coercion. Some States have defined coercion as conduct that modifies the behavior of a State by causing it to act involuntarily or by compelling it to act in a manner that it would not have voluntarily engaged in but for the coercive conduct of a foreign State. Other States have defined coercion as conduct that deprives a State of its freedom of choice or control over matters within its domestic jurisdiction. A third and broader approach, which was adopted by the African Union, defines coercion as any conduct that imposes restraints on the will of a foreign State.\nIn addition to articulating theoretical definitions of coercion, some States provided examples of conduct that, in their view, amounted to coercion. These examples shed further light on how the concept of coercion applies to real-world situations in which ICTs are used as instruments of statecraft. In particular, these examples clarify the views of States on the threshold of effects or the degree of pressure that a State must be subjected to in order for conduct to be considered coercive. As I show below, there is currently no consensus among States on the effects that the conduct of the coercing State must have on the coerced State to constitute an act of unlawful intervention. Some States adopted relatively high thresholds that require the conduct in question to have significant effects on the coerced State. For example, for some States, merely seeking to sway public opinion during an election campaign does not necessarily amount to unlawful intervention. Rather, to those States, electoral interference must rise to the level of altering election results or preventing a segment of the population from voting in order to constitute an act of intervention.[14] On the other hand, other States adopted lower thresholds to determine when\n\nHELAL\nelectoral interference could be deemed coercive. For example, one State noted that 'hack and leak' operations to influence public opinion could constitute a violation of the prohibition on intervention. The African Union also adopted a relatively low threshold of coercion that does not require the behavior of a foreign State to have significant effects on a State in order to amount to unlawful intervention.\nIn short, national and regional position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace indicate that there are divergences among States on how the prohibition on intervention governs state conduct in cyberspace. There is no agreement on a theoretical definition of coercion, there is no consensus on the threshold of effects that determines when specific state conduct that is designed to influence the behavior of other States constitutes coercion, and there is some uncertainty on how non-intervention relates to other rules such as the prohibition on the threat or use of force and the obligation to respect the territorial sovereignty of States.\nHaving catalogued the views that States have, heretofore, expressed on non-intervention and coercion in cyberspace, the second objective of this article is to critically appraise the understandings of coercion that States have adopted in their national and regional position papers. Specifically, this article makes the following two arguments.\nFirst, this article contends that – as a matter of formal law – the positions expressed by States on the meaning of coercion should be viewed as proposals de lege ferenda, and not as restatements of established lex lata. This is because, as I explain below, nothing in the history of the development of the prohibition of intervention lends support to the definitions of coercion that States have espoused. Non-intervention first emerged in the early 20th century as a rule\n available at <https: issues_development-enjeux_developpement=\"\" peace_security-paix_security=\"\" eyberspace_law-cyberespace_droit.aspx?lang=\"eng\" world-monde=\"\" www.international.gc.ca=\"\"> ('An example of a prohibited intervention would be a malicious cyber activity that hacks and disables a State's election commission days before an election, preventing a significant number of citizens from voting, and ultimately influencing the election outcome').\nUNGA, 'Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions on the Subject of How International Law Applies to the Use of Information and Communications Technologies by States Submitted by Participating Governmental Experts in the Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security Established Pursuant to General Assembly Resolution 73/226' (13 July 2021) UN Doc. A/76/136 ('Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions'), at 69 (Norway: 'unduly influencing public opinion through the dissemination of confidential information obtained through cyber operations (\"hack and leak\"), would be in violation of the prohibition of intervention').</https:>\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\nof Inter-American conventional international law. Then, building on decades of advocacy principally by non-aligned States, the prohibition on intervention became a rule of general international law with the adoption of the 1970 Friendly Relations Declaration. However, at no point during the evolution of the prohibition on intervention did States define coercion as conduct that causes a State to behave involuntarily or that deprives a State of its freedom of choice or control over matters within its domestic jurisdiction. Indeed, the history of the development of this rule indicates that States never even conceived of coercion as the conceptual cornerstone of non-intervention.\nSecond, this article argues that the definitions of coercion adopted by some States are conceptually flawed. Echoing the ICJ's judgment in the Nicaragua Case, virtually all States agree that the prohibition on intervention proscribes coercion whether undertaken through armed force or through non-forcible means, such as economic or political instruments of statecraft. Many States also underscored that the use of armed force is the gravest form of intervention. Yet – paradoxically – applying the definitions of coercion espoused by many (especially Western) States would lead to a situation where the gravest form of intervention – armed force – is governed by a lower threshold than non-forcible forms of intervention that are considered less grave.\nAs discussed below, nothing in *jus ad bellum* requires an act that amounts to armed intervention to be of such gravity that it causes a State to behave involuntarily or deprives it of control over matters within its domestic jurisdiction, which are the definitions of coercion adopted by some States. Indeed, attacking a single military unit could constitute a violation of the prohibition on the threat or use of force and could even amount to an armed attack, regardless of its effect on the behavior of the target State. On the other hand, applying the definitions of coercion adopted by some States would require non-forcible forms of intervention to reach a level of gravity and intensity that causes (or threatens to cause) a State to act involuntarily or that deprives it of freedom of choice. As I explain below, these definitions entail an unreasonably high\n Nicaragua v. USA, at para. 215 ('Intervention is wrongful when it uses methods of coercion in regard to such choices, which must remain free ones. The element of coercion, which defines, and indeed forms the very essence of, prohibited intervention, is particularly obvious in the case of an intervention which uses force, either in the direct form of military action, or in the indirect form of support for subversive or terrorist armed activities within another State').\n As the ICJ noted in the *Oil Platforms Case*, '[t]he Court does not exclude the possibility that the mining of a single military vessel might be sufficient to bring into play the \"inherent right of self-defence\". *Oil Platforms* (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America) (Judgment) [2003] ICJ Rep. 161, at para. 72.\nHELAL\nthreshold of effects for non-forcible intervention that is significantly higher than that which applies to forcible intervention.\nTherefore, this article argues that States and scholars should consider adopting what I call the 'unified threshold of coercion' that applies to both forcible and non-forcible intervention. Based on this approach, non-forcible conduct would be considered coercive if its impact is comparable to the scale and effects of conduct that amounts to a violation of the threat or use of force. This unified threshold of coercion is lower than the thresholds of coercion that many States have adopted in their position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace.\nThis article consists of two sections. Section 1 provides a survey of the definitions of coercion that appear in national and regional position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace. This section also outlines the views of States on the interconnection between non-intervention and the prohibition on the use of force and the obligation to respect state sovereignty, which is a debate that sheds further light on the kinds of conduct that each of these rules applies to and regulates. Then in Section 2, this article critically appraises the understandings of coercion adopted by States and argues in favor of adopting what I call the 'unified threshold of coercion' that applies equally to both forcible and non-forcible forms of intervention.\n## 2 Intervention and Coercion in Cyberspace\nNational and regional position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace unanimously affirmed that non-intervention is an established rule of international law that applies in cyberspace.[18] The GGE,[19] the African Union\n\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\nPeace and Security Council, and the Juridical Committee of the Organization of American States also adopted this position. Despite this general agreement on the status of the prohibition on intervention as an established rule of international law, States adopted diverging views regarding the exact scope and content of this rule. This is especially clear with coercion. Indeed, many States, including the member States of the African Union, noted that coercion is a concept that remains undefined in international law. Nonetheless, in\nnot intervene directly or indirectly in the internal affairs of another State, including by means of ICTs').\n AU Peace and Security Council, 'Communiqué 1120.1' (9 November 2022) AU Doc. PSC/PR/COMM.1120.1(2022), at operative paragraph 3: 'Acknowledges the application of international law to cyberspace, and stresses that the prohibition on the threat or use of force, the prohibition on intervention in the internal or external affairs of states, and the inviolability of the political independence, territorial integrity, and sovereignty of states are foundational rules of international law'.\n The Inter-American Juridical Committee of the Organization of American States recommended the adoption of the following statement by the OAS General Assembly: 'The OAS General Assembly affirms that international law, including the United Nations Charter in its entirety, the OAS Charter, international humanitarian law, international human rights law, the duty of non-intervention, the sovereign equality of states, and the law of state responsibility, is applicable to the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) by States and those for whom States are internationally responsible'. Inter-American Juridical Committee, 'International Law and State Cyber Operations' (7 August 2020) OAS Doc. CJI/Res.260 (XCVII-O/20).\n Many States noted that coercion as an element of non-intervention remains undefined. See for example M. Helal, 'Common African Position on the Application of International Law to the Use of Information and Communication Technologies in Cyberspace, and All Associated Communiqués Adopted by the Peace and Security Council of the African Union' (2 February 2024) Ohio State Legal Studies Research Paper No. 823, available at <https: papers.cfm?abstract_id=\"4714756\" papers.ssrn.com=\"\" sol3=\"\"> ('Common African Position'), at para. 32 ('the definition of coercion in this context requires further study and deliberation between States'); Danish Government, 'Denmark's Position Paper on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace' (2023) 92 Nordic Journal of International Law 446–455, at 450 ('[t]he term coercion is not defined in either treaty law or customary international law'); Swedish Government Offices, 'Position Paper on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace' (July 2022), available at <https: 3c2cb6febd0e4ab0bd542f653283b140=\"\" contentassets=\"\" swedens-position-paper-on-the-application-of-international-law-in-cyberspace.pdf=\"\" www.government.se=\"\">, at 3 ('coercion is not defined in international law'); Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 'The Republic of Poland's Position on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace' (29 December 2022) Gov.pl, available at <https: diplomacy=\"\" the-republic-of-polands-position-on-the-application-of-international-law-in-cyberspace=\"\" web=\"\" www.gov.pl=\"\"> ('There is no universally acceptable definition of \"coercion\"); UNGA, 'Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions', at 34 (Germany: 'Especially the definition of the latter element [coercion] requires further clarification in the cyber context'); Ibid. at 57 (The Netherlands: 'The precise definition of</https:></https:></https:>\nHELAL\nan effort to clarify how non-intervention applies in cyberspace, many States offered definitions of coercion in their national or regional statements. Three approaches to defining coercion have appeared in these position papers.\n## 2.1 Coercion as Conduct that Modifies the Behavior of a State\nThe first approach defines coercion as conduct that compels a State to modify its behavior. Among the States that adopted this approach, there were slight variations in the exact definition of coercion that those States formulated. Some States defined coercion as acts that aim to compel a State to act involuntarily. Estonia's position paper expressed this view. It stated:\nWhen discussing if a cyber operation constitutes an unlawful intervention into the external or internal affairs of another state, the element of coercion is a key factor [...] Stemming from that, cyber operations that aim to force another nation to act in an involuntary manner or to refrain from acting in a certain manner, and target the other nation's domaine réservé (e.g., national democratic processes such as elections, or military, security or critical infrastructure systems) could constitute such an intervention.\nAustria's national statement was similar to Estonia's. It stated: '[c]oercion occurs when a state seeks to compel another state to change its behaviour with respect to its internal or external affairs, i.e. to force that state to act in an involuntary manner or involuntarily refrain from acting in a particular way'. Some States that adopted this understanding of coercion also included a 'but for' test in their definition of coercion. According to those States, an act would be coercive if it aimed at compelling a State to behave in a manner that it would not otherwise have engaged in voluntarily. Norway's position paper expressed this view:\ncoercion, and thus of unauthorized intervention, has not yet fully crystallized in international law [...] there is no clear definition of the element of coercion').\n UNGA, 'Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions', at 25.\n Austrian Government, 'Position Paper of the Republic of Austria: Cyber Activities and International Law' (April 2024), available at <https: docs-library.unoda.org=\"\" open-ended_working_group_on_information_and_communication_technologies_-_(2021)=\"\" open-end_working_group_on_information_and_communication_technologies_-_(2021)=\"\" /austrian_position_Paper_-_cyber_activities_and_international_law_(final_23.04.2024).pdf=\"\">, at 5.</https:>\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\n[A] State must not carry out cyber operations in breach of the prohibition of intervention, according to customary international law. A cyber operation must therefore not be carried out to compel the target State to take a course of action, whether by act or omission, in a way that it would not otherwise voluntarily have pursued (coercion) in matters relating to its internal or external affairs (domaine réservé).25\nThe Netherlands adopted a similar position. It defined coercion as an act 'compelling a state to take a course of action (whether an act or an omission) that it would not otherwise voluntarily pursue. The goal of the intervention must be to effect change in the behavior of the target state'.26 Denmark also defined coercion as an act that 'has a potential for compelling the target state to engage in an action that it would otherwise not take'.27 Switzerland and Poland also used similar terms. To Switzerland, coercion is conduct that 'seeks to cause another to act (or refrain from acting) in a way it would not otherwise',28 and Poland stated that coercion 'aims at influencing the state's decisions belonging to its domaine réservé', and added that cyberoperations 'potentially leading to the state's conduct that would not occur otherwise, may be considered a prohibited intervention'.29\nOther States that understood coercion as conduct that is designed to modify the behavior of another State used relatively generic terms to define coercion. Romania, for example, defined coercion simply as an act the purpose of which is to 'effectively change the behavior of the target state'.30 Israel's Deputy Attorney General also opined that coercion 'has been taken to mean that State A cannot take actions to \"coerce\" State B in pursuing a course of action, or refraining from a course of action, in matters pertaining to State B's core internal affairs'.31 Singapore's national statement defined coercion in similar terms. It stated that a cyberoperation may violate the prohibition on intervention if it amounted to an 'attempt to coerce our government to take or forebear\n\nHELAL\na certain course of action on a matter ordinarily within its sovereign prerogative'.32 Italy's national statement used almost identical terms. It asserted that 'a State employs coercive means to compel another State to undertake or desist from a specific action, in matters falling under its domain réserve'.33 In other words, for these States, an act is coercive simply if it is intended to cause another State to change its behavior. These States did not, however, explicitly include a requirement that the conduct in question must compel a State to act involuntarily or force it to engage in behavior that it would not have engaged in voluntarily but-for the coercive conduct of a foreign State.\nGermany adopted a generally similar understanding of coercion. Although it did not refer to modifying the behavior of a State or causing it to act involuntarily, Germany described coercion as the exercise of a certain level of pressure that has a significant impact on the decision-making process of a State to the extent that it manipulates or undermines the will of the State. Germany's position paper stated the following:\nGenerally, Germany is of the opinion that cyber measures may constitute a prohibited intervention under international law if they are comparable in scale and effects to coercion in non-cyber contexts.\nCoercion implies that a State's internal processes regarding aspects pertaining to its domaine réservé are significantly influenced or thwarted and that its will is manifestly bent by the foreign State's conduct. However, as is widely accepted, the element of coercion must not be assumed prematurely. Even harsher forms of communication such as pointed commentary and sharp criticism as well as (persistent) attempts to obtain, through discussion, a certain reaction or the performance of a certain measure from another State do not as such qualify as coercion. Moreover, the acting State must intend to intervene in the internal affairs of the target State – otherwise the scope of the non-intervention principle would be unduly broad.34\nDespite these variations in the exact formulation of these definitions, these understandings of coercion share the common characteristic of focusing on\n\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\nthe desire of the coercing State to alter the behavior of another State. Marko Milanovic calls this the extortion model of coercion. 'These definitions point to undermining the victim state's will as the essence of coercion (\"involuntary,\" \"voluntary\"), so as to effect a change in its behavior'.35\nSeveral States that adopted this definition of coercion also provided examples of conduct that, in their view, amounted to intervention. As noted above in the introduction to this article, these examples provide greater clarity on how States operationalize and apply the definitions of coercion that they adopted. In its position paper, Finland position paper identified the following forms of coercion:\n[W]hile the conduct of elections belongs undisputedly to the internal affairs of each State, all methods of electoral interference do not display the element of coercion. Hacking of voter databases or manipulation of vote counts in order to alter the election results has nevertheless been recognized as a fairly clear case. To be comparable to a real world intervention, cyber interference must also be of a serious nature [...] Military or economic pressure may also qualify as coercion. Hostile cyber interference done with the purpose of promoting or supporting armed action in another State could constitute an example of prohibited intervention, provided that it seeks to force a certain policy change.[36]\nDenmark's position paper provided similar examples of coercive intervention:\nAs emphasized by the Court in the Nicaragua judgment coercive acts involving the use of force are particularly obvious examples of unlawful interventions. Denmark considers that coercion is not limited to means of direct or indirect use of force and that also measures below this threshold may constitute coercion. Cyber activities that do not amount to use of force can therefore also be coercive.\nAn example of unlawful intervention in the cyber domain could be where a State coercively interferes in the internal political process of another. In the cyber context this could potentially occur by using cyber\n\nHELAL\ntechnology to alter electronic ballots and thereby affecting the results of a political election.\nNorway also provided examples of coercion that affect a State's electoral processes, but that went beyond the examples that appear in the position papers of Finland and Denmark. In addition to tampering with election systems to alter the results of an election, Norway stated:\n[C]arrying out cyber operations with the intent of altering election results in another State, for example by manipulating election systems or unduly influencing public opinion through the dissemination of confidential information obtained through cyber operations ('hack and leak'), would be in violation of the prohibition of intervention. Another example is a cyber operation deliberately causing a temporary shutdown of the target State's critical infrastructure, such as the power supply or TV, radio, Internet or other telecommunications infrastructure in order to compel that State to take a course of action.\nLikewise, for Poland, the following conduct amounted to a violation of the prohibition on intervention: 'a wide-scale and targeted disinformation campaign, in particular when it results in civil unrest', preventing 'a reliable and timely conduct of democratic elections', blocking 'the filing of tax returns online', or depriving a 'the parliament working remotely of the possibility of voting online to adopt a law or modifying the outcome of such voting'. Austria also identified the following conduct as amounting to a breach of the prohibition on intervention:\n[A] cyber activity that interferes with a state's ability to hold elections or which manipulates election results could, if undertaken to compel a state to involuntarily change a government policy, constitute a violation of the prohibition of intervention. Large-scale cyber activities, including disinformation campaigns, conducted by or attributable to a state may also constitute, if undertaken to compel another state to involuntarily change its behaviour, a violation of the prohibition of intervention.\n\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\n\n## 2.2 Coercion as Conduct that Deprives a State of Freedom of Choice or Control\nThe second understanding of coercion that has emerged out of national position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace defines coercion as an act that deprives a State of its ability to control or to exercise freedom of choice regarding matters within its domaine réservé. Australia adopted this view. Its position paper stated: ‘[c]oercive means are those that effectively deprive or are intended to deprive the State of the ability to control, decide upon or govern matters of an inherently sovereign nature’.44 In order to establish that a breach of the prohibition on intervention has indeed occurred, Australia required evidence that the conduct of the coercing State had some measurable impact or discernable effect on the target State.45 Canada expressed a similar position. Its position paper explained that a cyberoperation would be coercive if it is ‘designed to deprive the affected State of its freedom of choice’.46 Canada also noted that, in order to amount to an act of\n\nHELAL\nintervention, a cyberoperation must 'cause coercive effects that deprive, compel or otherwise impose an outcome on the affected State'.47\nNew Zealand also defined coercion as conduct that manifests 'an intention to deprive the target state of control over matters falling within the scope of its inherently sovereign functions'.48 According to New Zealand, to constitute intervention, the conduct of the coercing State must have 'significant effects' on a matter within a State's domaine réservé. The Czech Republic defined coercion in similar terms. It stated:\nCoercion is an activity intended to deprive, either directly or indirectly, the State of its ability to exercise control or govern matters within its internal and external affairs [...] The difference between actions that violate sovereignty and actions that violate the prohibition of intervention is that the latter is coercive, i.e., intentionally aims to influence the State's free will and choice.49\nBrazil, Costa Rica, and the UK also adopted similar definitions of coercion. The UK Attorney General said the following about coercion:\nSome have characterized coercion as forcing a State to act differently from how it otherwise would – that is, compelling it into a specific act or omission. Imagine, for example, a cyber operation to delay another State's election, or to prevent it from distributing tax revenues to fund essential services. To my mind, these are certainly forms of coercion.\nBut I want to be clear today that coercion can be broader than this. In essence, an intervention in the affairs of another State will be unlawful if it is forcible, dictatorial, or otherwise coercive, depriving a State of its freedom of control over matters which it is permitted to decide freely by the principle of State sovereignty. While the precise boundaries of coercion are yet to crystallize in international law, we should be ready to consider whether disruptive cyber behaviors are coercive even where it might not\n\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\nbe possible to point to a specific course of conduct which a State has been forced into or prevented from taking.\nCosta Rica's position was similar, but not identical, to that of the UK. It stated that coercion can occur in a 'multitude of ways where one State, directly or indirectly through support for non-State actors, deprives another State of the capacity to make free and informed choices pertaining to its internal affairs'. Like the UK, Costa Rica used the word deprives, but it did not use the word control in relation to matters within its domaine réservé. Rather, it referred to the capacity of a State to make free and informed choices. Brazil used different terminology. Instead of referring to depriving a State its ability to freely decide on matters within its domaine réservé, Brazil stated that, to constitute intervention, a cyberoperation 'against another State must involve an element of coercion affecting the right of the victim State to freely choose its political, economic, social and cultural system, and to formulate its foreign policy'.\nMarko Milanovic calls this the control model of coercion:\nCoercion-as-control does not work by influencing the decision-making calculus of the coerced state. Rather, the coercing state directly interferes with the coerced state's internal or external affairs by taking action that materially deprives the coerced state of its ability to control its policy-choices within its reserved domain.\nSeveral States that adopted this definition of coercion also provided examples of conduct that amounted to intervention in their position papers. Australia, for instance, identified activities that 'manipulate the electoral system to alter the results of an election in another State, intervention in the fundamental operation of Parliament, or in the stability of States' financial systems' as examples of coercion. Canada also stated that a cyberoperation that 'hacks\n S.

Its position paper stated:\nCoercion is clear-cut when a State uses or threatens to use force against another one. Nonetheless, it can also occur in a multitude of ways where one State, directly or indirectly through support for non-State actors, deprives another State of the capacity to make free and informed choices pertaining to its internal or external affairs. Coercion may occur when a State provides financial or other forms of support to secessionist, subversive or violent groups in the territory of another State, when it exercises significant political or economic pressure on another State, or when it engages in or supports subversive or hostile propaganda or the dissemination of false news that interfere in the internal or external affairs of another State [...]\nA prominent example of a breach of non-intervention are ransomware attacks crippling or simply interfering with a State's ability to run public services, such as finance, education, and social security. Moreover, foreign election interference may also infringe the principle of non-intervention. This may take the form of cyber operations directly interfering with mail ballots or voter databases, or electoral disinformation campaigns seeking\n\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\nto mislead the electorate about the vote itself, candidates, electoral polls or results. Other types of disinformation, such as those affecting a State's health policies, may also amount to a prohibited intervention. Posts inciting individuals or other States to wage wars of aggression or to disrupt or subvert the internal order of another State may likewise breach the principle of non-intervention.57\nThe UK also provided a wide range of examples of acts of coercion. It identified forms of intervention that affected four areas of state policy: 'energy security; essential medical care; economic stability; and democratic processes'.58 In relation to 'essential energy supplies' 'essential medical services' and 'economic stability' the UK listed the following cyberoperations as potentially breaching the prohibition on intervention:\n[D]isruption of systems controlling emergency medical transport (e.g., telephone dispatchers); causing hospital computer systems to cease functioning; disruption of supply chains for essential medicines and vaccines; preventing the supply of power to housing, healthcare, education, civil administration and banking facilities and infrastructure; causing the energy supply chain to stop functioning at national level through damage or prevention of access to pipelines, interchanges, and depots; or preventing the operation of power generation infrastructure.\nTurning to economic stability, covert cyber operations by a foreign State that coercively interfere with a State's freedom to manage its domestic economy, or to ensure provision of domestic financial services crucial to the State's financial system, would breach the rule on non-intervention. Such cyber operations could include disruption to the networks controlling a State's fundamental ability to conduct monetary policy or to raise and distribute revenue, for instance through taxation. Or disruption to systems which support lending, saving and insurance across the economy.59\nIn relation to democratic processes, the UK noted that 'covert cyber operations by a foreign State which coercively interfere with free and fair electoral processes would constitute a prohibited intervention'. Examples of such unlawful\n\nHELAL\nconduct include: '[O]perations that disrupt the systems which control electoral counts to change the outcome of an election; or operations to disrupt another State's ability to hold an election at all, for example by causing systems to malfunction with the effect of preventing voter registration'.60\n## 2.3 Coercion as Conduct that Imposes Restraints on the Will of a State\nThe third approach to understanding coercion appears in the Common African Position on the Application of International Law to the Use of Information and Communication Technologies in Cyberspace, which was adopted by the fifty-five members of the African Union in early 2024.61 As of this writing, the African Union is the first regional organization to have adopted a position on the application of international law in cyberspace.62 The Common African Position defined coercion 'as a policy that is designed to impose restraints on the will of a foreign State. Assessing whether the use by one or more States of ICTs in cyberspace to influence the conduct of a foreign State amounts to coercion is a determination that should be undertaken on a case-by-case basis'.63 The Common African Position also stated the following:\nWhile the definition of coercion in this context requires further study and deliberation between States, the African Union is of the view that it is not necessary, in order to constitute coercion, that the conduct of a State must rise to the level of completely depriving a foreign State of its freedom of choice or to compel that State to either act or refrain from acting involuntarily. Coercion may also occur through threats of intervention. Furthermore, there is no requirement that, in order to constitute a violation of the prohibition on intervention, an act of coercion must actually succeed in compelling the State subjected to such acts to change its conduct. An unsuccessful attempt of intervention is unlawful under international law. The African Union stresses that offers or calls to peacefully settle disputes through negotiation, enquiry, mediation, conciliation, good offices, arbitration, and judicial settlement, and diplomatic\n\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\n\nIn some respects, the understanding of coercion in the Common African Position is similar to other definitions of coercion, but it also diverges from these definitions in significant ways. The Common African Position defined coercion as conduct that ‘impose[s] restraints on the will of a foreign State’. This is broadly analogous to the notion of impinging on the freedom of choice of States, which is central to the coercion-as-control model. However, the Common African Position also indicates that the purpose of intervention is to ‘influence the conduct of a foreign State’. This echoes definitions that understand coercion as conduct that aims at modifying the behavior of a State by subverting, manipulating, or undermining its decision-making processes.\nCompared to other definitions of coercion, however, the Common African Position was purposively designed to broaden the protective scope of the prohibition on intervention. It does so by adopting a lower threshold of (actual or threatened) effects that must be crossed for conduct to amount to coercion. This is clearly expressed in the following sentence: ‘the African Union is of the view that it is not necessary, in order to constitute coercion, that the conduct of a State must rise to the level of completely depriving a foreign State of its freedom of choice or to compel that State to either act or refrain from acting involuntarily’.\nIn other words, the principal point of divergence between the Common African Position and the positions of other States relates to the threshold of coercion. For the member States of the African Union, intervention is any conduct undertaken by a State that imposes restraints on another State in relation to matters within its domestic jurisdiction. However, those restraints need not be of such severity that they cause a State to act involuntarily nor do they need to reach a level of intensity that completely deprives that State of its freedom of choice or control over matters within its domestic jurisdiction.\nIt is notable that, in an initial draft of the Common African Position that this author had prepared while serving as the African Union Special Rapporteur on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace, coercion was defined in the following terms: ‘coercion, in the context of the prohibition on intervention, should be defined as a policy that is designed to impose material restraints on the will of a foreign State’. The adjective ‘material’ was intended\n Ibid., at para. 32.\n Ibid.\nHELAL\nto signify that, in order to amount to intervention, the restraints imposed on a State must attain an elevated level of severity, which would ensure that non-intervention would not be an over-inclusive rule.\nThis initial draft of the Common African Position was welcomed by the AU Peace and Security Council, and served as the basis for the interstate negotiations that led to the adoption of the Common African Position, which were held in Tunisia from 29 November to 1 December 2023. During these negotiations, however, the AU member States decided to delete the adjective 'material'. The member States determined that the word 'restraints' sufficiently and accurately captured the essence of the prohibition on intervention. Many States described non-intervention as a rule that is intended to protect the policy autonomy of States and to enable States to manage their internal and external affairs free from 'restraints' that might be imposed by other States. The AU member States also agreed that, when read in the context of the entire section on non-intervention in the Common African Position, the prohibition on intervention was not over-inclusive.\n## 2.4 The Element of Intent\nMany States also included the element of the intent in their definitions of coercion. New Zealand articulated this element unambiguously. Its position paper affirmed that the 'coercive intention of the state actor is a critical element of the rule' and underscored that 'intention may in some circumstances be inferred from the effects of cyber activity'. Similarly, Costa Rica's position paper noted that '[f]or such breaches [of the prohibition on intervention] to occur, it suffices that a State intends to coerce another State, employs coercive methods, or eventually causes coercive effects in another State'. Czechia's position paper used similar terms. It stated that '[c]oercion is an activity intended to deprive' a State of control over matters within its domaine réservé.\n See AU Peace and Security Council, 'Communiqué No. 1171' (24 August 2023) AU Doc. PSC/PR/COMM.1171 (2023), at para. 2: 'Welcomes the Draft Statement by the AUCIL on the Application of International Law to the Use of ICTs in Cyberspace prepared by the Special Rapporteur, which was adopted and endorsed by the 22nd Ordinary Session of the AUCIL in June 2023'.\n AU Office of the Legal Counsel BC/OLC/42.23/13793.23 (on file with the author).\n New Zealand Foreign Affairs and Trade, 'The Application of International Law to State Activity in Cyberspace', at para. 9(b).\n Costa Rican Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 'Costa Rica's Position on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace', at 7 (emphasis added).\n Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 'Position Paper on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace', at para. 9(b).\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\nOther States also included the element of intent in their definition of coercion, but only implicitly. For instance, Norway stated that holding elections is an example of an activity that falls within the *domaine réservé* of a State. Therefore, according to Norway, 'carrying out cyber operations with the intent of altering election results in another State' would violate the prohibition on intervention.[71] Furthermore, Canada,[72] Denmark,[73] and the US,[74] understood coercion as conduct that is *designed* to achieve a specific purpose or effect (such as modifying the behavior of the target State). As noted above, the Common African Position also understood coercion as conduct that is *'designed* to impose restraints on the will of a foreign State'. The use of the term *'designed'* by these position papers introduces the element of intent into the definition of coercion. It indicates that the coercing State is acting purposefully and intentionally and employing its resources in a systematic and strategic manner to achieve specific policy objectives.\nOther States used similar phrases that also make the intent of the coercing State an element of the definition of coercion. The Netherlands $^{75}$ and Romania $^{76}$ defined coercion as conduct *'the goal'* of which is changing the behavior of the target State. Likewise, Estonia and Poland described coercion as conduct that *'aimed'* at achieving a specific objective. Estonia, for example, stated that 'cyber operations that *aim* to force another nation to act in an involuntary manner or to refrain from acting in a certain manner' would amount to intervention.[77] Poland also stated that '[t]o be in breach of international law,\n\nHELAL\nan intervention must include the element of coercion that aims at influencing the state's decisions belonging to its domaine réservé.78 Again, using phrases like: 'the goal of' intervention, or saying that coercion is conduct 'that aims at', presupposes that the coercing State is acting intentionally. It indicates that the coercing State has identified a policy objective – an aim or a goal – which it is seeking to achieve by engaging in cyberoperations against another State.\n## 2.5 Sovereignty, Intervention, and the Use of Force: Demarcating the Doctrinal Boundaries\nIn addition to articulating definitions of coercion and offering examples of conduct that amounts to coercion, many States addressed the question of the relation between, on one hand, the prohibition on intervention and, on the other, the obligation to respect the territorial sovereignty of States and the prohibition on the threat or use of force. The content and scope of application of these three rules overlap significantly. As the ICJ observed in the Nicaragua Case, '[t]he effects of the principle of respect for territorial sovereignty inevitably overlap with those of the principles of the prohibition of the use of force and of non-intervention'.79\nTo disentangle the interconnection between these three rules, many States expressed views on the threshold of effects that must be crossed for conduct to amount to a violation of each of these rules. Surveying national and regional position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace reveals that States have approached this question from three different angles. The first relates to categories of conduct that – by their very nature – do not constitute a breach of the prohibition on intervention because they fall below the threshold of coercion. Nonetheless, some States noted that conduct that does not amount to intervention because it falls below the threshold of coercion may still be wrongful because it violates the principle of state sovereignty. The second is the higher threshold of coercion, which many States identified as the point at which non-intervention intersects with the prohibition on the threat or use of force. The third relates to the threshold at which non-forcible conduct – such as information operations, election interference, or economic sanctions – amount to coercion.\n\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\n## 2.6 Conduct below the Threshold of Coercion\nMany States identified certain forms of conduct that do not amount to unlawful intervention because they are considered non-coercive. Several Western States argued that practices designed to persuade a State to change its behavior or to influence its policies are lawful, even if such practices involve criticism of that State. These Western States argued that such conduct is commonplace in international relations, which means that it should not be condemned as a form of intervention. This was a point of convergence among Western States regardless of the definitions of coercion they adopted.\nFor example, in its position paper, Czechia, which defined coercion as acts that deprive a State of control over matters within its *domaine réservé*, stated that '[m]ere influencing, criticism or persuasion do not meet the requirements to be qualified as prohibited intervention'. Similarly, Denmark, which defined coercion as conduct that causes a State to behave in a manner it would not have engaged in voluntarily, stated that 'a distinction must be drawn between activities that merely involve influencing, as opposed to compelling, the voluntary actions of a target State. Acts of influence, such as persuasion, criticism, and public diplomacy are insufficient to qualify as an intervention'. Germany also noted that 'harsher forms of communication such as pointed commentary and sharp criticism as well as (persistent) attempts to obtain, through discussion, a certain reaction or the performance of a certain measure from another State do not as such qualify as coercion'. Sweden also opined that 'criticism or other ways of influencing through diplomatic means' does not qualify as coercion. Likewise, Canada, which was among the States that defined coercion as depriving a State of control over its *domaine réservé*, stated that '[c]oercion must be distinguished from other conduct such as public diplomacy, criticism, persuasion, and propaganda'. The UK also distinguished between coercive conduct, which is unlawful, and the freedom of States 'to make their views known about processes in other countries – delivering hard, sometimes\n See for example: Finnish Ministry for Foreign Affairs, 'Finland's Views on International Law and Cyberspace', at 463 ('[t]he requirement of coercion leaves out lesser forms of influence and persuasion that are commonplace in international relations').\n Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 'Position Paper on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace', at para. 13.\n Danish Government, 'Denmark's Position Paper on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace', at 450.\n UNGA, 'Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions', at 34.\n Swedish Government Offices, 'Position Paper on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace', at 3.\n Canadian Government, 'International Law Applicable in Cyberspace'.\nHELAL\nunwelcome messages, and drawing attention to concerns. This is part and parcel of international relations. Similarly, Austria stated that ‘[i]t is important to distinguish such disinformation campaigns from lawful public relations activities of state representatives, including e.g. by openly criticising the human rights situation in another state on social media accounts or websites’.\nThe Common African Position adopted a different approach regarding conduct that falls below the threshold of coercion. It stated: ‘offers or calls to peacefully settle disputes through negotiation, enquiry, mediation, conciliation, good offices, arbitration, and judicial settlement, and diplomatic discussions and communications are presumed not to constitute acts of coercion’. The first portion of this sentence is based on Article 33 of the UN Charter. It indicates that efforts to settle disputes peacefully are not considered coercive. The second portion of this sentence – ‘diplomatic discussions and communications are presumed not to constitute acts of coercion’ – was designed to signal that diplomatic correspondences, whether written or verbal, are generally not considered coercive. The keyword here is *presumed*, which was inserted because history is replete with cases in which diplomatic communications were employed as instruments of coercion. Perhaps the most (in)famous ultimatum ever – the Austro-Hungarian ultimatum to Serbia that started World War I – was delivered via a diplomatic note. Similarly, in a series of meetings that were held in 1945 and 1946 between Soviet and Turkish diplomats, the USSR attempted to coerce Turkey into redrawing the international frontier between the two States and granting the USSR access to and control over the Turkish straits.\nThis sentence in the Common African Position was also intended to signal that the member States of the African Union did not share the view adopted by Western States that other practices such as public diplomacy, criticism, propaganda, unwelcome messages and other conduct that, for instance, the UK described as ‘part and parcel of international relations’ could never be coercive.\nThis approach in the Common African Position is consistent with the positions expressed by African and other developing States during the negotiations on the 1970 Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning\n Braverman, ‘International Law in Future Frontiers’.\n Austrian Government, ‘Position Paper of the Republic of Austria’, at 5.\n ‘Common African Position’, at para. 32.\n See ‘Austria’s Ultimatum to Serbia: Full Text of the Document That Started the World War, and Serbia’s Reply to It’ (1918) 9 Current History 554–558.\n O. Isci, ‘Turkey at a Crossroads: The Soviet Threat and Postwar Realignment, 1945–1946’ (2023) 47 Diplomatic History 621–646.\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\nFriendly Relations and Co-Operation Among States. During discussions on that declaration, several Western States proposed adding a caveat that stated that non-intervention did not affect\n[t]he generally recognized freedom of states to seek to influence the policies and actions of other states, in accordance with international law and settled international practice and in a manner compatible with the principle of sovereign equality States and the duty to cooperate in accordance with the Charter.[91]\nNon-Western States opposed this proposal because innocuous phrases like 'settled international practice' or acts that 'seek to influence the policies and actions of other states' were viewed as a potential backdoor that would justify interventionist policies by powerful States.[92] For African States, determining whether 'criticism', 'public diplomacy', or so-called 'unwelcome messages' amount to intervention can only be established on the basis of an holistic, case-by-case evaluation of the facts.\nSeveral States also argued that, because of the element of coercion, the threshold that must be crossed for conduct to amount to intervention was higher than that which applied to violations of state sovereignty.[93] Switzerland's position paper expressed this understanding of the relationship between these two principles – sovereignty and non-intervention – clearly. It stated:\n\nHELAL\nAn infringement of sovereignty and a prohibited intervention are not the same. The latter must be coercive in nature, i.e. through its intervention a state seeks to cause another to act (or refrain from acting) in a way it would not otherwise. This means that the threshold for a breach of the non-intervention principle is significantly higher than that for a violation of state sovereignty.\nFinland adopted the same view. Its position paper stated: ‘[c]ompared to a violation of sovereignty, the requirement of coercive nature and that of domaine réservé make the threshold of prohibited intervention considerably higher’. Poland’s position paper similarly stated that ‘[t]he threshold for considering a specific operation in cyberspace to be in breach of the principle of non-intervention is higher than in the case of deeming it solely a violation of the principle of sovereignty’. Canada also underscored that ‘[w]hether or not a cyber activity meets the threshold for a violation of the rule on territorial sovereignty or rises to the level of a violation of the rule against intervention will be determined on a case-by-case basis’. Israel also viewed sovereignty and non-intervention as being closely related, but noted that acts of intervention are ‘understood as having a high threshold’.\n## 2.7 Forcible Intervention as the Higher Threshold of Coercion\nMany States adopted the position that the threat or use of force is a form of coercion. Several States also described the threat or use of force as the gravest\n UNGA, ‘Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions’, at 87.\n Finnish Ministry for Foreign Affairs, ‘Finland’s Views on International Law and Cyberspace’, at 464.\n Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, ‘The Republic of Poland’s Position on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace’ (‘The threshold for considering a specific operation in cyberspace to be in breach of the principle of non-intervention is higher than in the case of deeming it solely a violation of the principle of sovereignty’).\n Canadian Government, ‘International Law Applicable in Cyberspace’.\n Schöndorf, ‘Israel’s Perspective on Key Legal and Practical Issues Concerning the Application of International Law to Cyber Operations’, at 403.\n See for example Costa Rican Ministry of Foreign Affairs, ‘Costa Rica’s Position on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace’: (‘Coercion is clear-cut when a State uses or threatens to use force against another one’); Danish Government, ‘Denmark’s Position Paper on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace’ (‘coercive acts involving the use of force are particularly obvious examples of unlawful interventions’); UNGA, ‘Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions’, at 57 (Netherlands: ‘the use of force will always meet the definition of coercion. Use of force against another state is always a form of intervention’).\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\nform of coercion. Some States, such as France and the Netherlands, also emphasized that acts that constitute a threat or use of force could also concurrently violate both the prohibition on intervention and state sovereignty. Many States also argued that the threshold of non-forceful coercion is lower than the threshold of forceful coercion. For example, Denmark underscored that 'coercion is not limited to means of direct or indirect use of force and that also measures below this threshold may constitute coercion'. Similarly, Germany stated: '[m]alicious cyber activities will only in some cases amount to direct or indirect use of force. However, measures below this threshold may also qualify as coercive'. The UK and the US also expressed this view.\nThe Common African Position did not take an express position on whether there is a distinction between the threshold of the use of force and the threshold of intervention. Rather, the Common African Position affirmed that the prohibition on intervention is a broad rule that applies to any forcible or non-forcible instrument of statecraft that might be used as means of coercion. It stated: '[t]he prohibition on intervention applies to the use of any instrument, including armed, political, economic, or any other means, and instruments of information, that may be used by a State for the purposes of intervening in the\n\nHELAL\ninternal or external affairs of a foreign State'. Brazil adopted the same view. It stated: 'the customary norm prohibiting intervention in the internal affairs of another State applies irrespective of the means or medium used and extends to the use of ICTs by States'. Similarly, Costa Rica stated:\nCoercion is clear-cut when a State uses or threatens to use force against another one. Nonetheless, it can also occur in a multitude of ways where one State, directly or indirectly through support for non-State actors, deprives another State of the capacity to make free and informed choices pertaining to its internal or external affairs.\nIn short, there is evidence of a consensus among those States that have issued national or regional position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace that the threat or use of force is, *ipso facto*, a form of coercion that is wrongful under both the prohibition on the threat or use of force and the prohibition on intervention. These position papers also show that there is a consensus on the principle that non-forcible conduct could also amount to intervention. The point of divergence, however, relates to the threshold of coercion that applies to non-forcible conduct. This is the subject of the next section.\n## 2.8 The Threshold of Non-forcible Coercion\nThis question of the exact threshold at which non-forcible conduct amounts to coercion is of critical importance. This is because most acts of unlawful intervention that could be undertaken through cyberspace are likely to fall below the threshold of forcible intervention. For example, activities such as election interference or disinformation campaigns will almost always fall below the threshold of the use of force. In fact, this is precisely the area – conduct below the threshold of the use of force, but above the threshold of violations of territorial sovereignty – where the prohibition on intervention is most relevant.\n Helal, ‘Common African Position’, at para. 29.\n UNGA, ‘Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions’, at 18.\n Costa Rican Ministry of Foreign Affairs, ‘Costa Rica’s Position on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace’, at 7.\n M. Schmitt, “Virtual” Disenfranchisement: Cyber Election Meddling in the Grey Zones of International Law’ (2018) 19 Chicago Journal of International Law 30–67, at 40 (Arguing that ‘because of the relatively high consequential threshold for violation, it is unlikely, although not inconceivable, that cyber election meddling would qualify as an unlawful use of force’).\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\nNational and regional position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace reveal that there is no consistency among States on the question of the threshold of coercion that applies to non-forcible intervention. This lack of consistency is evident even among States that adopted the same definition of coercion. In other words, even where there is some convergence among States on the meaning of coercion at a theoretical level, there are notable divergences on how the concept of coercion applies in real-world situations.\nAmong the States that defined coercion as conduct that modifies the behavior of a State or causes it to act involuntarily, there were notable differences in the terminology used to describe the threshold that applies to non-forcible coercion. Germany contended that, to constitute an act of intervention, a cyberoperation must be 'comparable in scale and effect to coercion in non-cyber contexts'. According to Germany, to meet the threshold of coercion, a cyberoperation must have the effect of 'significantly influenc[ing] or thwart[ing]' the decision-making process of a State to the point where its 'will is manifestly bent'.[109] Although it did not specify a definite threshold that non-forcible conduct must meet to constitute an act of intervention, Switzerland noted that a cyberoperation could amount to economic coercion if it paralyzed the operation of a 'company that is systemically relevant'.[110]\nOn the other hand, Poland indicated that, to constitute coercion, the foreign State's conduct must 'adversely affect' the 'functioning and security of the political, economic, military or social system of a state'.[111] Norway also provided examples of non-forcible coercive conduct that included 'manipulating election systems', 'unduly influencing public opinion', and 'causing a temporary shutdown' of critical infrastructure.[112]\nDenmark and Romania, both of which also defined coercion as conduct that modifies the behavior of a State or causes it to act involuntarily, did not explicitly identify a specific threshold at which non-forcible conduct could be considered coercive. Instead, Romania stated that an act of intervention must be intended to 'effectively change' the behavior of a State and underscored that 'there has to be a causal nexus between the coercive act and the effect on the internal or external affairs of the target State'.[113] Denmark's position paper also stated that 'an act may be considered of a coercive nature when the act\n\nHELAL\nof interference has a potential for compelling the target State to engage in an action that it would otherwise not take.\nTo this writer, the thresholds of coercion adopted by Germany and Switzerland are substantially higher than the thresholds adopted by Poland and Norway. The phrase ‘significantly influencing or thwarting’ that was used by Germany and the words ‘paralysis’ and ‘systemically relevant’ that Switzerland used signify a notably higher threshold of coercion than the term ‘adverse effects’ that was used by Poland and the phrases ‘manipulating election systems’ and ‘unduly influencing public opinion’ that Norway used. Denmark appears to have adopted an even lower threshold of coercion. For Denmark, a cyberoperation need not have an actual effect on the target State to be considered wrongful under the prohibition on intervention. Rather, a cyberoperation that merely has the ‘potential for compelling’ a State crosses the threshold of coercion. On the other hand, for Romania, the ‘potential’ to compel a State is insufficient. Rather, to constitute intervention, Romania requires that a State must be the target of a cyberoperation that has a measurable effect on the coerced State and that is causally connected to the behavior of the coercing State.\nThere are similar inconsistencies among the States that defined coercion as conduct that deprives a State of its freedom of choice or control over its domaine réservé. Australia, New Zealand, and Canada adopted broadly similar definitions of the threshold of coercion. According to Australia, conduct is coercive if it ‘effectively deprive[s]’ or is ‘intended to deprive’ a State of control over matters of an inherently sovereign nature. As discussed above, for Australia, examples of coercion include: ‘manipulating the electoral system to alter the results of an election’ or undermining the ‘fundamental operation of Parliament’ or the ‘stability of States’ financial systems. Similarly, for New Zealand, conduct is coercive if it has ‘significant effects’ on a State’s domaine réservé. Examples of acts that meet this threshold include ‘manipulating the voting tally’ in an election, preventing a ‘significant part of the electorate’ from voting, and causing ‘significant damage’ or ‘loss of functionality’ to critical infrastructure. According to Canada, intervention is conduct that has ‘coercive\n Danish Government, ‘Denmark’s Position Paper on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace’, at 450.\n UNGA, ‘Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions’, at 5.\n Ibid.\n New Zealand Foreign Affairs and Trade, ‘The Application of International Law to State Activity in Cyberspace’, at para. 9(b).\n Ibid.\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\neffects that deprive, compel, or impose an outcome on the affected State'. Again, as noted above, for Canada, examples of coercion include influencing the outcome of an election through a cyberoperation that 'hacks and disables a State's election commission' or by 'preventing a significant number of citizens from voting', in addition to 'disrupt[ing] the functioning of a major gas pipeline' to affect a State's negotiating position.[119] Finland provided similar examples of coercion. It noted that to constitute intervention in an election, the conduct of a foreign State must 'be of a serious nature', examples of which are altering electoral results through 'hacking of voter databases or manipulation of vote'.[120]\nBrazil, Czechia, Costa Rica, and the UK used different terms to describe the threshold of coercion. Brazil understood coercion as conduct 'affecting the right' of a State to choose its political, economic, social and cultural system and to formulate its foreign policy.[121] Czechia stated that an act is coercive if it 'intentionally aims to influence the State's free will and choice'.[122] For Costa Rica, conduct amounts to coercion if it impinges on a State's ability to make 'free and informed choices'. As noted above, Costa Rica also provided several examples of coercive conduct. These included: 'subversive or hostile propaganda', 'dissemination of false news', 'significant political or economic pressure', 'crippling or simply interfering' with public services, 'interfering with ballots or voter databases', and 'electoral disinformation campaigns'.[123] Like Costa Rica, the UK provided a wide-range of examples of coercive conduct. These included 'disruption of systems controlling emergency medical transport', 'causing hospital computer systems to cease functioning', 'disruption of supply chains for essential medicines and vaccines', 'preventing the operation of power generation infrastructure' or disrupting power supplies to 'housing, healthcare, education, civil administration and banking facilities and infrastructure', interfering with 'financial services' that are crucial to a State's financial system, and disrupting a State's 'fundamental ability to conduct monetary policy'.[124]\nTo this writer, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada adopted a higher threshold of coercion than that which Brazil, Czechia, Costa Rica, and the UK adopted. The former repeatedly used the word 'significant' to describe the\n\nHELAL\neffects that the conduct of a State must have in order to constitute coercion. Moreover, for those States, election interference must actually alter the results of an election to amount to intervention. Brazil, Czechia, Costa Rica, and the UK, however, used terms and phrases such as 'affecting', 'aims to influence', and 'free and informed choices' to describe the effects of the conduct of a foreign State. These terms signify a lower threshold of coercion. Indeed, unlike Australia, New Zealand, and Canada, the position papers of Brazil, Czechia, Costa Rica, and the UK did not require election interference to rise to the level of changing the results of an election to amount to intervention. Rather, these States used terms that would condemn as unlawful a broader range of forms of election interference. The UK, for instance, stated that covert operations that 'interfere with free and fair electoral processes' are a form of coercion,[125] while Costa Rica stated that launching disinformation campaigns and the dissemination of false news could constitute forms of unlawful electoral interference.\nAs noted above, the Common African Position did not identify a specific threshold at which non-forcible conduct amounts to coercion. Rather, the Common African Position noted that the definition of coercion requires further study among States, and explicitly rejected the thresholds that other States adopted in their position papers. The Common African Position stated: 'it is not necessary, in order to constitute coercion, that the conduct of a State must rise to the level of completely depriving a foreign State of its freedom of choice or to compel that State to either act or refrain from acting involuntarily'.[126]\nThis review of national and regional position papers reveals that there are three points of convergence among States on the question of the thresholds that delineate the boundaries of the prohibition on intervention. First, there is a consensus that the threat or use of force always crosses the threshold of coercion. Second, there is a consensus that non-intervention is a broad rule that covers both forcible and non-forcible forms of coercion. Third, there is a consensus that there are certain forms of conduct that, by their very nature, fall below the threshold of coercion. There is no consensus, however, on a specific list or catalogue of acts that are ipso facto non-coercive. However, given the positions expressed by Western States, it is reasonable to conclude that there is at least a general concurrence on the view expressed in the Common African Position that calls to settle disputes peacefully are not coercive. Beyond that, the main point of divergence among States relates to the threshold at which non-forcible conduct amounts to coercion. Indeed, as Canada noted: 'further\n\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\nState practice and opinio juris will help clarify the thresholds for the rule of non-intervention, and the scope of customary law in this area over time'.127\nThis is a question of paramount importance to understanding how non-intervention applies in cyberspace and other domains. As noted above, the utility of the prohibition on intervention is that it protects States against conduct that is more serious than an infringement on the territorial sovereignty of a State but that does not rise to the level of a threat or use of force. This issue – the threshold at which non-forcible conduct amounts to coercion – has not been addressed by the ICJ and remains a subject of scholarly debate.128\nSome scholars have argued that coercion is unsuited to function as an element of the prohibition on intervention, at least as it applies in cyberspace. For example, Duncan Hollis has opined that coercion may not be readily applicable to influence operations that use cyberspace to manipulate public opinion or disrupt the domestic political processes of a foreign State, such as Russia's interference in the 2016 US presidential election.129 Similarly, Ido Kilovaty has written that 'the norm of non-intervention, in its current narrow understanding, is almost irrelevant in a world where States increasingly resort to cyber operations as a method of interference [...] Coercion cannot contain the diversity of threats posed by new technologies. A new standard is, therefore, required'.130\nIn my view, we do not need a new standard. The challenge facing the application of the prohibition on intervention in cyberspace, and in other domains such as economic sanctions, is that there is no agreement among States on either the definition of coercion or on the minimum threshold of effects that must be met for conduct to constitute coercion. Any understanding of non-intervention must include a conceptual tool that distinguishes between unlawful intervention and lawful conduct that influences the policies of States. Whether that conceptual tool is called 'coercion', 'dictatorial interference',131\n\nHELAL\n‘imperative pressure’, ‘forcible compulsion or restraint’, or any other term is immaterial. What matters is the threshold of effects that defines and captures the essence of ‘coercion’, which can be applied to determine when specific conduct amounts to intervention. This is the question that Section 3 of this article addresses.\n## 3 Towards a Unified Threshold of Coercion\nIt is impossible, given the limitations of space, to comprehensively address the question of the threshold of coercion that applies to non-forcible conduct. This is a topic that requires further research. Nonetheless, in this section, this article will offer a general sketch of a threshold that could be employed to determine when non-forcible conduct amounts to coercion, thereby violating the prohibition on intervention. Specifically, this section proposes the adoption of a single, unified threshold of coercion that applies equally to both forcible and non-forcible intervention. According to this approach, non-forcible conduct would amount to coercion if its scale and effects are comparable to conduct that amounts to a violation of the prohibition on the threat or use of force.\nTwo considerations support this approach. The first is historical. Throughout its evolution, the prohibition on intervention was understood as a cognate of the prohibition on the threat or use of force. Non-intervention was designed to extend the protections afforded to States under the prohibition on the threat or use of force to non-forcible – but no less pernicious – instruments of statecraft. The second consideration is conceptual. The definitions of coercion that appear in national position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace that some States have issued impose an unreasonably high threshold of effects that must be met for non-forcible conduct to amount to an act of intervention. Defining coercion as causing a State to act ‘involuntarily’ or ‘depriving’ it of freedom of choice requires causing effects or\n R. Buchan and N. Tsagourias, ‘The Crisis in Crimea and the Principle of Non-Intervention’ (2017) 19 International Community Law Review 165–193, at 171 (‘Coercion denotes “imperative pressure” which manipulates the will of a state in order to extract some advantage or concession’).\n T.

The unified threshold of coercion that I propose here should not be understood as signaling that the prohibition on the use of force and the prohibition on intervention are coterminous. At least one writer has recently suggested that ‘under the *lex lata* the prohibition on intervention only applies to acts amounting to a use of force or constituting support for the violent overthrow of a foreign regime’. I disagree. As discussed below, at least since the adoption of the 1970 Friendly Relations Declaration, there has been a consensus among States that non-intervention is a broad rule that proscribes all forms of intervention, whether undertaken through forcible or non-forcible means. However, because there is no agreement among States on the meaning of coercion, there is continued uncertainty regarding when non-forcible conduct amounts to unlawful intervention. The unified threshold of coercion addresses this question by proposing a single test that applies to all forms of intervention, including armed force, or the use of political, economic, or informational instruments of statecraft, or some combination thereof.\n## 3.1 Coercion in the History of the Prohibition on Intervention\nAs argued in detail in another study by the present author, until the *Nicaragua Case* was decided by the ICJ in 1986, the concept of coercion was not defined, nor was it viewed as the cornerstone of the prohibition on intervention. Moreover, throughout its evolution, States never understood intervention as conduct that causes a State to act involuntarily or that deprives it of its freedom of choice or control over its domestic jurisdiction. This is why, to this writer, the definitions of coercion that States have included in their national and regional position papers should be viewed as proposals *de lege ferenda*, and not restatements of established *lex lata*. To substantiate this claim, this\n O. Pomson, ‘The Prohibition on Intervention Under International Law and Cyber Operations’ (2022) 99 International Law Studies 180–219, at 183.\n M. Helal, ‘Intervention, Force &amp; Coercion – An Historical Inquiry on the Evolution of the Prohibition on Intervention’ (2024) 103 International Law Studies (forthcoming).\nHELAL\nsection provides an overview of the terms and travaux préparatoires of the principal instruments in which the prohibition on intervention was codified. This overview begins with three Inter-American treaties that first included non-intervention as a distinct rule of international law, followed by the 1970 Friendly Relations Declaration, the adoption of which marked the acceptance of the prohibition on intervention as a rule of general international law.\nThe prohibition on intervention originated as a rule of conventional international law in the Inter-American system. It was first codified in Article 8 of the 1933 Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States, which reads as follows: 'No State has the right to intervene in the internal or external affairs of another'.[137] The prohibition on intervention was further reaffirmed and its scope was expanded with the adoption of the 1936 Additional Protocol Relative to Non-Intervention, Article I of which states: 'The High Contracting Parties declare inadmissible the intervention of any one of them, directly or indirectly, and for whatever reason, in the internal or external affairs of any other of the Parties'.[138]\nThe principal purpose of these provisions was to overturn the right of States to resort to acts of intervention, which was established under 19th century international law. At the time, States were permitted wage war or to engage in so-called measures short of war – i.e., acts of intervention – for an expansive range of reasons.[139] These included preserving the balance of power, repelling attacks against a State's territory, preempting an imminent armed attack, obtaining reparation for injuries inflicted on the interests or honor of the State, protecting the lives and property of citizens, securing the repayment of debts, and preventing mass atrocities.[140] Intervention was accepted as permissible\n\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\nbecause it was predicated on the right of self-preservation, which was recognized as a fundamental right of States. Given that they were often the target of forcible and non-forcible acts of intervention by the European powers and the United States, Latin American States and scholars championed the cause of codifying an absolute prohibition on intervention as a rule of international law in the Inter-American system. This objective was achieved with the adoption of the 1933 Montevideo Convention, the 1936 Non-Intervention Protocol, and the 1948 Charter of the Organization of American States, which included the broadest formulation of the prohibition on intervention.\nDuring the negotiations on the 1933 Montevideo Convention and the 1936 Non-Intervention Protocol, coercion was not defined; it was not identified as a constituent element of the prohibition on intervention, nor were acts of intervention understood as involving conduct that causes a State to behave involuntarily or that deprives a State of freedom of choice or control over its domain réservé. Indeed, the term 'coercion' does not even appear in either of these treaties. However, during the negotiations on the 1933 Montevideo Convention, a subcommittee composed of Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, Ecuador, El-Salvador, Haiti, and Peru that had been entrusted with drafting the convention prepared a report that provides an insight into how the negotiating parties understood the term 'intervention'. In its report, the subcommittee defined 'the juridical concept of intervention' as follows:\nAny act of a State, through diplomatic representation, by armed force, or by any other means involving effective force, with a view to making the State's will dominate the will of another State, and, in general, any maneuver, interference or interposition of any sort, employing such means, either directly or indirectly in matter of the obligations of another State, whatever its motive, shall be considered as Intervention, and likewise a violation of International Law.\nIt would seem quite unnecessary to state that the Sub-Committee was, and is, in perfect accord that any friendly act to offer good offices and\n\nHELAL\nmediation in the foreign relations of States in order to maintain peace is, by its very nature, outside the definition of intervention. This applies also to the united action of the formation of the League of Nations, the universal peace agent, of which the majority of the American States are members.^[146]^\nThe first sentence of this definition is instructive. The key phrase here is 'effective force with a view to making the State's will dominate the will of another State'. To this writer, it indicates that the drafters of the 1933 Montevideo Convention understood intervention as encompassing the use of armed force and any non-forcible conduct the effects of which are comparable to the use of force. This understanding of intervention was echoed by several States during the negotiations on the convention. Ecuador, for example stated: 'We have outlawed war. What is intervention but a kind of war, disguised and wary.'^[147]^ Argentina also stated: 'What is intervention, then, but violence? [...] Intervention is violence.'^[148]^ El Salvador also defined intervention in identical terms. It stated: 'Because the American conscience is such that territorial acquisitions originated by violence cannot be recognized; that violence has generally come to disturb the life of our countries in the form of intervention.'^[149]^ Peru shared this understanding of intervention. It argued in favor of adopting Article 8 of the 1933 Montevideo Convention because 'war is proscribed, so is violence, but not the use of arms, the diplomatic measures or any other means of effective compulsion.'^[150]^\nThe Charter of the Organization of American States, which was adopted in 1948,^[151]^ incorporated and expanded on the provisions on non-intervention in the 1933 Montevideo Convention and the 1936 Non-Intervention Protocol. Article 19 and 20 of the OAS Charter state:\n## Article 19\nNo State or group of States has the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatever, in the internal or external affairs of any other State. The foregoing principle prohibits not only armed force but also any\n\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\n\n## Article 20\nNo State may use or encourage the use of coercive measures of an economic or political character in order to force the sovereign will of another State and obtain from it advantages of any kind.\nArticle 19 of the OAS Charter includes two sentences, the first of which is virtually identical to Article 1 of 1936 Non-Intervention Protocol, which itself was based on Article 8 of the 1933 Montevideo Convention. Like its antecedents, the principal purpose of the first sentence of Article 19 was to reaffirm that, at least in Inter-American international law, the right of intervention that was recognized in 19th century international law was abolished. The inclusion of the phrase 'for whatever reason', which first appeared in the 1936 Non-Intervention Protocol, also indicated that non-intervention was an absolute rule that admitted no exceptions. Accordingly, the grounds that had previously been invoked to justify intervention – such as protecting citizens abroad, collecting debts, or enforcing international law – were no longer valid.\nThe second sentence of Article 19 clarified a principle that was only implicit in the 1933 Montevideo Convention and the 1936 Non-Intervention Protocol. It confirmed that non-intervention proscribed both the use of armed force and any other instrument of statecraft to engage in acts of intervention. Although, as noted above, the subcommittee that drafted the 1933 Montevideo Convention had affirmed that intervention could be undertaken 'through diplomatic representation, by armed force, or any other means involving effective force', this was not explicitly stated in either the 1933 Montevideo Convention or the 1936 Non-Intervention Protocol. The second sentence of Article 19 was also intended to prohibit acts of subversion that seek to impinge on the political independence of a State by subjugating it or transforming it into a satellite of a foreign power or that undermine its capacity to manage its political, economic, and cultural affairs autonomously.[152]\n\nHELAL\nArticle 20 of the OAS Charter is the first provision in which the term ‘coercion’ is used in relation to the prohibition on intervention. Coercion was not used, however, in order to signify the defining characteristic of intervention, nor was it designed to function as the conceptual tool that distinguishes between unlawful intervention and lawful conduct that seeks to influence the behavior of States. Rather, the authors of the OAS Charter drafted Article 20 with two objectives in mind. First, this provision was intended to proscribe economic sanctions that are imposed unilaterally by a State in response to an injury inflicted upon it by another State, and second, it was intended to outlaw the use of economic or political instruments of statecraft to pressure a State into giving concessions against its will. This becomes apparent from the negotiating history of Article 20.\nThis provision was formulated on the basis of two proposals that were submitted by Brazil and Cuba during the negotiations on the OAS Charter. The Cuban proposal stated: ‘No American State may unilaterally apply to another coercive measures of an economic nature that constitute retaliation or that tend to force the sovereign will of the State against which it is applied’. Similarly, the Brazilian proposal stated:\nIt is prohibited for a State to exercise or support economic or political pressure on any other, in order to obtain advantages of any nature from that other State, not including, however, in the category of pressure the sanctions adopted in accordance with a determination of a competent international body. The American State that feels that it is subjected to economic or political pressure from any other State, that State has the\nwas responsible and Colombia severed diplomatic relations with the USSR. This led the conference to adopt a resolution titled: ‘The Preservation and Defence of Democracy’ that condemned ‘interference by any foreign power, or by any political organization serving the interests of a foreign power, in the political life of the nations of the American continent’ and committed the member States of the OAS to take ‘the measures necessary to eradicate and prevent activities directed, assisted or instigated by foreign governments, organizations or individuals tending to overthrow their institutions by violence, to foment disorder in their domestic political life or to disturb, by means of pressure, subversive propaganda, threats or by any other means, the free and sovereign right of their peoples to govern themselves in accordance with their democratic aspirations’.

In its report the subcommittee explained the purpose of this provision as follows:\n[T]he two essential characteristics of the proposed text are the following: First, it condemns any action or attempted action that tends to force a State, despite its sovereignty, to adopt any attitude that State deems contrary to its interests; and second, such condemnation is in no way affected by the nature of the benefits sought by the State that exercises or encourages the coercive action. The members of the Subcommittee present were in complete agreement with the fact that the proposed text does not affect in any way the application of sanctions of an economic nature authorized by certain international organizations by virtue of current pacts.^[155]^\nThe negotiating history of the three Inter-American treaties in which the prohibition on intervention was first codified does not provide support for the definitions of coercion that many States have adopted in their national position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace. In fact, the concept of coercion was not even the subject of any in-depth discussions during the drafting of these treaties. Rather, the term coercion was only introduced in Article 20 of the OAS Charter specifically to outlaw the imposition of unilateral economic sanctions. Likewise, there is little in the negotiations on the principal instruments that were adopted on non-intervention by the UN that supports the definitions of coercion that appear in national position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace.\n^[154]^ Ibid., at 83.\n^[155]^ Novena Conferencia Internacional Americana, Actas y Documentos, Vol. II: Comisiones Reglamentarias, Comisión de Credenciales – Comisión de Iniciativas – Comisión de Coordinación – Comisión de Estilo (Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de Colombia 1953), at 387–388. It should be noted that during the negotiations on this provision, the US agreed that the unilateral imposition of economic sanctions is unlawful. See Ninth International Conference of American States, Bogotá, Colombia, March 30–May 2, 1948: Report of the Delegation of the United States of America with Related Documents (Department of State Publication No. 8262, November 1948) (In its official report on the proceedings of the Bogota Conference, the US delegation stated: ‘the principle that no nation should indulge in unilateral economic sanctions is, of course, valid’).\nHELAL\nAlthough the prohibition on intervention was not codified in the UN Charter, it was included in many instruments that were subsequently negotiated at the UN. These include the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the 1963 Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, the 1949 Declaration on the Rights and Duties and States and the 1954 Code of Offenses Against the Peace and Security of Mankind both of which were drafted by the International Law Commission, in addition to several General Assembly resolutions such as Resolution 31/91 on Non-Interference in the Internal Affairs of States, and the 1981 Declaration on the Inadmissibility of Intervention and Interference in the Internal Affairs of States. It is impossible in this article to provide a complete account of how the principle of non-intervention was articulated in these UN instruments. Therefore, I will focus here on the negotiations on non-intervention in the 1970 Friendly Relations Declaration, which contains the most authoritative expression of the prohibition on intervention.\nDuring the negotiations on the 1970 Friendly Relations Declaration and the 1965 Declaration on the Inadmissibility of Intervention in the Domestic Affairs of States, on which the section on non-intervention in the 1970 Friendly Relations Declaration was based, coercion was neither defined nor was it considered the distinguishing characteristic of intervention. Rather, the\n It is often mistakenly assumed that Article 2(7) of the UN Charter is a codification of the prohibition on intervention. It is not. This provision does not govern interstate relations.

Initially, many (mostly Western) States answered this question in the affirmative. To those States, the prohibition on intervention was limited to proscribing the direct and indirect use of armed force by States. Conversely, Non-Aligned and Eastern Bloc States, insisted that non-intervention was a broader rule that prohibited all forms of the use of force and other non-forcible forms of conduct. Ultimately, the broader understanding of non-intervention was adopted. It was accepted that this rule outlawed the use of any instrument of statecraft – whether forcible or non-forcible – that may be employed to infringe on the domestic jurisdiction of States. There was, however, no attempt during these negotiations to formulate a threshold that determines when non-forcible conduct amounts to intervention. Instead, most States either identified specific forms of conduct that, in their view, amounted to intervention, or simply described intervention as the exertion of pressure against a State.\n 1964) UN Doc. A/AC.119/SR.28, at 5. Similarly, France stated: ‘any attempt to define intervention must cover [...] the idea of coercion, i.e., of abnormal or improper pressure exercised by one State on another State in order to force it to change its internal structure in a direction favorable to the interests of the State applying such coercion’. Ibid., at 10. Mexico also noted that, in addition to outlawing the use of force, the prohibition on intervention was designed to outlaw ‘coercive measures of an economic or political nature’. Mexico did not, however, offer a definition of coercion. Rather, it stated that in order to distinguish between lawful pressure and unlawful intervention the ‘criterion of the illegality of such coercion was the object sought’.

That text did not refer to coercion at all. Instead, it defined intervention as either the use of armed force or conduct 'of such design and effect as to impair or destroy the political independence or territorial integrity of another State'.[165] Those six States explained that the latter sentence was broadly synonymous to the phrase 'to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights' that appears in the 1970 Friendly Relations Declaration.[166] According to those States, their proposed formulation provided a better juridical expression of the scope and content of the prohibition on intervention.[167]\nof economic pressure'); UNGA, 'First Committee, 1422nd Meeting, Twentieth Session' (20 December 1965) UN Doc.

First, it would be incoherent to apply to non-forcible intervention that is undertaken through instruments such as information operations or economic sanctions a threshold of coercion that is higher than that which applies to the use of armed force, which is the gravest form of intervention. Second, even if one were to ignore the inconsistency between the thresholds of forcible and non-forcible intervention, the definitions of coercion that apply to the latter that some States have adopted are unreasonably high and severely restrict the scope of application of the prohibition on intervention. This section addresses these two points.\nAs noted above, virtually all position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace affirmed that the threat or use of force is *ipso facto* coercive. Many States also underscored that the use of force is the gravest form of coercion. This reflects the principle that the prohibition on the use of force is a peremptory rule of international law. Paradoxically, however, if, as many States propose, coercion is defined as conduct that causes a State to behave involuntarily or that deprives it of freedom of choice or control, non-forcible conduct would be governed by a higher threshold than that which applies to armed intervention. This is because, under *jus ad bellum*, the threshold of scale\njuridical language', and added that this proposal 'drew attention to the fact that no action of whatever character should be taken which would in any way impair or destroy the territorial integrity or political independence of States – ideas which were clearly recognized and defined in international law'. UNGA, '1966 Special Committee on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation Among States, Summary Record of the Fifteenth Meeting', at 11.\nHELAL\nand effects that must be met for an act to constitute a violation of the prohibition on the use of force is relatively low.\nThere is a general consensus among scholars that the prohibition on the use of force applies to conduct that has physical effects; that is conduct that, either directly or indirectly, causes 'death of or injury to persons, or damage to or destruction of property'.[168] Virtually all position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace endorsed this definition of the use of force.[169] However, there is no consensus on the de minimis threshold of scale and effects that must be met for conduct to be considered a violation of the prohibition on the use of force.[170] Some scholars have argued that there are cases of the use of force that do not, due to their limited scale and effects, amount to a use of force.[171] The Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on the Conflict in Georgia endorsed this view.[172] Conversely, other writers, contend that the\n\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\napplication of the prohibition on the use of force is not subject to a gravity threshold, which means that any use of force by one State against another State – regardless of its scale and effects – is governed by this rule.173 The ICJ has not taken a definitive position on this question.174\nWhatever position one takes on this matter, one thing is clear. The threshold that must be met for an act to constitute an instance of the use of force is low. Even the threshold for an armed attack, the gravest form of the use of force, is relatively low.175 As the International Law Association noted, 'it appears that the gravity threshold attached to armed attacks is not markedly high, and would include most uses of force likely to cause casualties or significant property damage'.176\nCompared to the threshold of the use of force, the definitions of coercion that many States have adopted in their national position papers impose a much higher threshold of coercion for non-forcible conduct. Nothing in *jus ad bellum* requires the use of force to be of such gravity that it *significantly influences* or *thwarts* the decision-making processes of a State to the extent that its will is *manifestly bent*, which is the definition of coercion adopted by Germany. Similarly, *jus ad bellum* does not require the State to be subjected to a level of compulsion that causes it to 'act in an involuntary manner or to refrain from acting in a certain manner', which is the definition of coercion adopted by Estonia and several other States. Nor is it necessary under *jus ad bellum* for a State to be exposed to such pressure that *deprives* it of freedom of choice or *compels* or *imposes* an outcome on the State, which is the definition of coercion adopted by Canada.\n\nHELAL\nIn addition to the incongruence of having a threshold of coercion for non-forcible intervention that is higher than that which applies to forcible intervention, the definitions of coercion that some States have adopted impose an unreasonably high threshold for non-forcible conduct. To meet the threshold of causing a State to act involuntarily or to deprive it of freedom of choice or control over its domestic jurisdiction, the conduct of the coercing State must be of such intensity that it overwhelms the coerced State and leaves it with no viable choice but to submit to the demands of the coercing State. In both jurisprudence and philosophy, involuntariness is generally understood as being a situation where an actor lacks a meaningful choice or has no reasonable alternative but to comply with the demands of another actor. Applying these definitions would significantly reduce the scope of the prohibition on intervention, thereby permitting a wide-range of non-forcible conduct both in cyberspace and beyond.\nTake the definition of coercion in Canada's national position paper on the application of international law in cyberspace. As noted above, Canada defined coercion as conduct that compels or imposes an outcome on the affected State or deprives it of its freedom of choice. Canada also provided the following example of an act of unlawful intervention in an election: '[a]n\n The definitions of coercion adopted by most States (coercion as conduct that causes a State to act involuntarily and coercion as conduct that deprives a State of freedom of choice or control) appear to echo the definition of coercion that the ILC adopted in its Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts. The ILC stated that coercion 'has the same essential character as force majeure', which it defined as a situation where the conduct of a State is 'involuntary or at least involves no element of free choice'. As the ILC explained, the degree of pressure required for a State to be placed in a position where its conduct is 'involuntary' or lacking the 'element of free choice' is one of 'irresistible force'. To be clear, States have not cited the Articles on State Responsibility as an authority to support their definitions of coercion. Nonetheless, there is a striking resemblance between the ILC's definition of coercion and the definitions adopted by many States in their position papers. In my view, this is a threshold of pressure that is far higher than anything required by the jus ad bellum. For the ILC's discussion of the concepts of coercion and force majeure, see UN ILC, 'Report of the International Law Commission: Fifty-Third Session' (23 April–1 June and 2 July–10 August 2001) GAOR 56th Session Supp. 10 (A/56/10), at 69, 77–78.\n The literature of coercion and voluntariness in both law and philosophy is vast and varied. Nonetheless, there is general agreement among scholars in these fields that an agent will be deemed to have behaved involuntarily if they were left with no viable or meaningful choice. See generally T. Honoré, 'A Theory of Coercion' (1990) 10 Oxford Journal of Legal Studies 94–105; M. Alvarez, 'The Concept of Voluntariness' (2016) 7 Jurisprudence 665–671; S. Olsaretti, 'Voluntariness, Coercion, Self-Ownership' in D. Schmidtz and C. Pavel (eds), The Oxford Handbook of Freedom (Oxford University Press 2018) 439–455.\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\nexample of a prohibited intervention would be a malicious cyber activity that hacks and disables a State's election commission days before an election, preventing a significant number of citizens from voting, and ultimately influencing the election outcome.[179]\nUnder this definition, almost all of the conduct that appears in a recent report published by a commission established by the Canadian government to investigate foreign interference in Canadian elections would not be wrongful under the prohibition on intervention.[180] The report, which is titled Public Inquiry into Foreign Interference in Federal Electoral Processes and Democratic Institutions, noted that foreign interference did not determine the outcome of the election. The report did, however, state the following:\nThe fact that foreign interference may not have impacted the outcomes in many ridings does not mean, however, that it did not impact the election. Foreign interference in 2019 and 2021 undermined the right of voters to have an electoral ecosystem free from coercion or covert influence. Foreign interference has an impact when there is a single instance where a ballot is cast in a certain way, or not cast at all, because of a foreign state's direct or indirect enticement.[181]\nThe report added that this foreign interference affected the electoral ecosystem and had the overall effect of '[u]ndermining faith in democracy and government' and led to a 'reduced trust in Canada's democratic process'.[182] Under Canada's definition of coercion, this conduct would not be unlawful. The foreign interference catalogued in this report did not impose any particular choice on Canada nor did it significantly affect the outcome of an election. Likewise, this conduct would not meet the threshold of causing a State to act involuntarily. Nonetheless, the political effects of foreign interference of this nature are serious, especially in the long-term. Failing to proscribe conduct of this nature would turn the prohibition on intervention into a normative empty shell that provides little protection to States and would permit a broad range of disruptive non-forcible behavior.\nHELAL\nThis is why I believe that the Common African Position was right to define coercion as conduct that is designed 'to impose restraints on the will of a foreign state', which is a markedly lower threshold than that proposed by other States. The question, however, is what exactly does 'imposing restraints' entail and at what point can one say that the exertion of pressure on a State has reached the point of 'imposing restraints' on its will?\nTo this writer – and I must emphasize that this is the author's view, not that of the member States of the African Union – the threshold of coercion for non-forcible conduct should be defined as being comparable to the minimum effects of conduct that amounts to a threat or use of force. In other words, for non-forcible conduct – such as political, economic, or informational measures – to amount to intervention, the effects of the conduct in question should be comparable to that which is entailed by the threat or use of force. I call this the unified threshold of coercion. The practical effect of adopting the unified threshold of coercion is that any non-forcible conduct that causes effects on a scale that is comparable to conduct that amounts to a violation of the prohibition on the threat or use of force would constitute a breach of the prohibition on intervention.\nTo further explain, other reports by the Canadian government provide understandings of foreign interference that, to this writer, approximates the degree of effects that would meet the unified threshold of coercion, thereby amounting to a breach of the prohibition on intervention. In one report published by the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians, foreign interference was defined in the following terms: '[f]oreign interference involves foreign states, or persons/entities operating on their behalf, attempting to covertly influence decisions, events or outcomes to better suit their strategic interests'.[183] This report also stated: 'foreign interference includes attempts to covertly influence, intimidate, manipulate, interfere, corrupt or discredit individuals, organizations and governments to further the interests of a foreign country'.[184] It also underscored that 'foreign interference should be understood as a long-term effort, akin to espionage, using inducements or threats. Both dynamics enable the manipulation of targets when required, for example, through requests for inappropriate or special favours'.[185] This report\n\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\nprovided examples of behavior that would not amount to unlawful intervention. These include:\nForeign interference activities are distinct from acceptable diplomatic advocacy and lobbying. The latter activities are known to the host state and occur through recognized channels to achieve specific policy outcomes or objectives. It is normal for foreign diplomats in Canada, for example, to reach out to elected officials across the political spectrum, to pressure policymakers, to use local media to promote their national interests or to engage with and support domestic organizations.^[186]^\nAn earlier report, also published by the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians of Canada, states the following: '[f]oreign interference activities can include using deceptive means to cultivate relationships with elected officials and others perceived to processes influence in the political process; seek to influence the reporting of Canadian media outlets; seek, in some cases, to affect the outcome of elections; and coerce or induce diaspora communities to advance foreign interests in Canada'.^[187]^ The understandings of foreign interference in these reports are palpably broader than the definition of coercion in most national position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace, including Canada's. To this writer, these reports describe the kinds of conduct that were intended to be covered by the Common African Position, and which would be covered by the unified threshold of coercion proposed here.\nTwo considerations lend support to this understanding of coercion. First, adopting a unified threshold of coercion that applies to both forcible and non-forcible intervention is consistent with the history of the evolution of the prohibition on intervention. Throughout the negotiations on instruments in which non-intervention was codified, States consistently viewed acts of intervention as being analogous to the use of force.^[188]^ For example, as noted above, the drafters of the 1933 Montevideo Convention described intervention\n\nHELAL\nas any act that amounts to 'effective force'. It indicates that the authors of the Montevideo Convention understood non-forcible intervention to be the functional equivalent of armed force.\nMoreover, during the debates on the Montevideo Convention, several Latin American States underscored that non-intervention was closely associated to the prohibition on the use of force. For example, Argentina stated: 'What is intervention, then, but violence? [...] Intervention is violence.'[189] El Salvador also affirmed that '[b]ecause the American conscience is such that territorial acquisitions originated by violence cannot be recognized; that violence has generally come to disturb the life of our countries in the form of intervention'.[190] Peru also emphasized that 'war is proscribed, so is violence, but not the use of arms, the diplomatic measures or any other means of effective compulsion'.[191] Ecuador also highlighted that '[w]hat is intervention but a kind of war, disguised and wary' and argued that, having outlawed aggression pursuant to the 1933 Anti-War Treaty of Non-Aggression and Conciliation, it was only natural for the States of the western hemisphere to proscribe intervention.[192] Similarly, during the negotiations on the OAS Charter, Cuba called economic coercion 'treacherous, silent, and underhanded aggression'.[193]\nMany States expressed similar views during the negotiations on both the 1965 Declaration on Non-Intervention and the 1970 Friendly Relations Declaration. For example, Guinea described intervention as a 'more pernicious' form of aggression,[194] Trinidad and Tobago called it 'subtle and insidious' aggression,[195] and the Congo argued that non-intervention covered 'political pressure, subversive activities, and other acts of aggression'.[196] Furthermore, throughout debates on non-intervention at the UN, many States frequently described non-intervention as being derivable from or a corollary of the non-use of force.[197] In short, in addition to outlawing intervention through armed\n\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\nforce, the prohibition on intervention was designed to protect States against non-forceful conduct that was viewed as being functionally equivalent to the use of force – i.e., conduct that entailed a degree of pressure that is comparable to the use of armed force.\nIn addition to being consistent with the historical evolution of non-intervention, adopting a unified threshold of coercion that applies to all forms of intervention reflects the fact that non-intervention and the non-use of force share the same policy purpose. The ICJ has stated that ‘a rule of international law, whether customary or conventional, does not operate in a vacuum; it operates in relation to facts and in the context of a wider framework of legal rules of which it forms only a part’. Writing in more colorful terms, James Crawford observed that ‘customary rules usually hunt in packs, connected by some familial relationship and interacting with each other’.\nNon-intervention and the non-use of force belong to the same normative ‘pack’. These rules are part of what scholars call the ‘law of coexistence’, the policy purpose of which is to protect the autonomy of States and enable them to coexist peacefully in an anarchic international system. Specifically, these two rules – non-intervention and the non-use of force – are designed to protect the physical and functional manifestations of sovereignty. These two ‘domains’ of sovereignty – the physical and the functional – are expressed by the concepts of the ‘territorial integrity’ and ‘political independence’ of States, which appear in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. Non-intervention extended the\nSR.31, at 11 (Yugoslavia: non-intervention is a ‘natural corollary of Article 2(4)’ of the UN Charter); UNGA, ‘Special Committee on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation Among States, First Session, Summary Records of the Thirtieth Meeting’, at 5–6 (Mexico: Article 2(4) is among the provisions of the Charter that provided ‘a solid and irrefutable basis’ for non-intervention).\n Interpretation of the Agreement of 25 March 1951 Between the WHO and Egypt (Advisory Opinion) [20 December 1980] ICJ Rep. 73, at para. 10.\n J.

Abi-Saab, ‘Whither the International Community?’ (1998) 9 European Journal of International Law 248–265, at 254.\n ‘Political independence’ refers to ‘the autonomy in the affairs of the State with respect to its institutions, freedom of political decisions, policy making, and in matters pertaining to its domestic and foreign affairs’. See S. Blay, ‘Territorial Integrity and Political Independence’ in R. Wolfrum (ed.), Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law (Oxford University Press 2010), available at <https: 10.1093=\"\" display=\"\" law=\"\" law:epil=\"\" opil.ouplaw.com=\"\" 9780199231690=\"\" 99231690-e1116=\"\"> (accessed 17 July 2024), at para. 1. ‘Territorial integrity’ is not limited to prohibiting forceful changes to the boundaries of a State. It protects the physical space within which a State exercises political independence against outside intrusion or trespass. See C. Marxsen, ‘Territorial Integrity in International</https:>\nHELAL\nprotection afforded to the territorial integrity and political independence of States against the threat or use of force to all other instruments of statecraft that could be employed to achieve the same objectives, especially that such non-forcible intervention often has the potential to achieve greater harm to States than the threat or use of force.\nTo be clear, the unified threshold of coercion proposed here should not be read as suggesting that non-intervention is coterminous with the prohibition on the threat or use of force. Far from it. Although both rules share the same policy purposes, the prohibition on intervention is broader than the prohibition on the threat or use of force. Non-intervention applies to any policy or practice, whether forcible and non-forcible, that impinges on the political independence or territorial integrity of States. In a sense, therefore, the prohibition on the threat or use of force should be viewed as a *lex specialis* that applies to a specific genus of intervention (namely, *armed* intervention). This body of *lex specialis* has been subsumed, *in toto*, within the broader *lex generalis* of the prohibition on intervention.\nIn conclusion, further research and further expressions of State views are needed on the definition and threshold of coercion. This is essential to understanding how the prohibition on intervention applies to and governs non-forcible conduct both in cyberspace and beyond. To this writer, however, the unified threshold of coercion that this article proposes provides a conceptual foundation on which to formulate a workable and conceptually coherent approach to applying the prohibition on intervention.\n Law – Its Concept and Implications for Crimea' (2015) 75 Zeitschrift für ausländisches öffentliches Recht und Völkerrecht 7–26, at 10. As Georges Abi-Saab wrote: 'The international legal system is based at present as in the past, on two fundamental principles that determine its structure and functioning, namely, the sovereignty and equality of States [...] The principal legal consequence of this structural or rather structuring principle is to commit each State to a general obligation to respect the sovereignty of others; in other words, not to trespass on the territorial and functional ambits of this sovereignty. The most flagrant manifestation of such trespass is the threat or use of force against the State. But it is not the only one. Other, less blatant, forms exist varying in their degree of visibility and intensity. It is precisely the rest of this continuum, beyond the use of force, which is covered by the principle of non-intervention'. G. Abi-Saab, 'Some Thoughts on the Principle of Non-Intervention' in K.

Helal\nAssociate Professor of Law, The Ohio State University, Columbus, The United States of America; Member, Permanent Court of Arbitration; Member, African Union Commission on International Law (AUCIL); Special Rapporteur of the African Union on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace\n## Abstract\nThis article explores debates among States on the application of the prohibition on intervention in cyberspace. It focuses on coercion as an element of the prohibition on intervention and identifies the different definitions of coercion that States have adopted in national and regional position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace. This article also specifically discusses the views of States on the threshold of coercion, which is the degree of harm or the effects that the conduct of a State must cause (or threaten to cause) to amount to a violation of the prohibition on intervention. This article argues that the definitions and thresholds of coercion that States have adopted in debates on the application of international law in cyberspace should be viewed as proposals for the development of the law in this area, as opposed to restatements of established law. Instead, this article proposes that all forms of intervention should be governed by a ‘unified threshold of coercion’ that applies to both forcible and non-forcible intervention.\n## Keywords\nprohibition on intervention – cyberspace – coercion – prohibition on the threat or use of force\n© KONINKLIJKE BRILL BV, LEIDEN, 2024 | DOI:10.1163/18757413_02701019\nHELAL\n# 1 Introduction\nIt is undisputed that the prohibition on intervention is a rule of customary international law. This rule is also codified in numerous conventions, including the founding instruments of several regional organizations. Non-intervention was also applied by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in several cases, the most important of which is the Nicaragua Case. This rule was also reaffirmed in many UN General Assembly resolutions, the most notable of which is the 1970 Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Co-Operation Among States in Accordance with the Charter of the United Nations ('1970 Friendly Relations Declaration'). The prohibition on intervention also appears in the 1949 Declaration on the Rights and Duties of States and the 1954 Code of Offenses Against the Peace and Security of Mankind which were adopted by the International Law Commission (ILC).\n1. R. Jennings and A. Watts, *Oppenheim’s International Law, Vol. I: Peace 428* (Oxford University Press 1992) ('That intervention is, as a rule, forbidden by international law there is no doubt. Its prohibition is a corollary of every state’s right to sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence').\n2. Examples of multilateral treaties in which non-intervention is codified include: Article 41(1) Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (done 18 April 1961, entered into force 24 April 1964) 500 UNTS 95; Article 55(1) Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (done 23 April 1963, entered into force 19 March 1967) 596 UNTS 261. Some of the founding instruments of regional organizations in which the prohibition on intervention also appears, albeit in varying formulations, include: Articles 19–20 Charter of the Organization of American States (signed 30 April 1948, entered into force 13 December 1951) 119 UNTS 3; Article 4(g) Constitutive Act of the African Union (signed 11 July 2000, entered into force 26 May 2001) 2158 UNTS 3; Article 1(4) Charter of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (adopted 14 March 2008), available at <https: charter=\"\" en=\"\" documents=\"\" oic_charter_2018_en.pdf=\"\" www.oic-oci.org=\"\" upload=\"\">; Article 2(2) Charter of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (done 20 November 2007, entered into force 15 December 2008) 2624 UNTS 223.\n3.

States from every region and from every political bloc have accused their adversaries (and sometimes even their allies) of intervening in their affairs.[8]\nIn recent years, there has been a growing interest among States and scholars in the principle of non-intervention. One reason is that cyberspace has become a domain of conflict and competition. Information and communication technologies (ICTs) are being used both as weapons of war and as instruments of non-forcible intervention.[9] States, state-sponsored non-State actors, and non-State groups and individuals acting independently have employed ICTs against foreign States, citizens, and companies to achieve various political, economic, criminal, scientific, and financial objectives. ICTs have been used to disrupt critical infrastructure, spread disinformation and propaganda to sow social discord, interfere in elections, acquire industrial and trade secrets, steal scientific research and intellectual property, and to gain profit through activities such as ransomware attacks. As a result, there is a growing corpus of state practice and expressions of opinio juris, in addition to a sizable body of scholarship, on how the prohibition on intervention applies in cyberspace. This article engages with these discussions.\nSpecifically, this article has two objectives. First, it explores how States have defined the concept of coercion,[10] which is considered a core component of\n\nHELAL\nthe prohibition on intervention. It also examines how States have demarcated the boundary between, on one hand, the prohibition on intervention and, on the other, the obligation to respect the territorial sovereignty of States and the prohibition on the threat or use of force, which are two rules that are closely associated with the prohibition on intervention.\nThis article will do so by surveying national and regional position papers that States have issued in recent years on the application of international law in cyberspace in which States have outlined their views on the scope and content of the prohibition on intervention and on how it governs the conduct of States in cyberspace. These position papers were issued, at least partially, in response to calls by the UN Open-Ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (OEWG) for States to express their opinions on how international law applies in cyberspace. The OEWG is one of the two principal forums in which discussions at the UN on the regulation of cyberspace are conducted, the other being the UN Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security (GGE).\nIn addition to being of interest to scholars who specialize in the regulation of cyberspace, these national and regional position papers also deserve special attention from generalist scholars of international law. Most of these position papers are not framed as expressions of State views on *lex specialis* that apply only in cyberspace. Rather, they contain detailed statements on the scope and content of a wide range of *lex generalis* followed by discussions on how these rules of general international law apply in cyberspace. This makes these position papers a rich source of *opinio juris* on various primary and secondary rules\n p. 11 A. Tzanakopoulos, ‘The Right to be Free from Economic Coercion’ (2015) 4 Cambridge Journal of International Law 616–633, at 620 (‘Coercion is a method of illegal intervention [...] coercion is intervention. Seeking to coerce a state within its sphere of freedom is wrongful; it constitutes intervention’).\n UNGA, ‘Open-Ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security – Final Substantive Report’ (10 March 2021) UN Doc. A/AC.290/2021/CRP.2, at para. 38. (The OEWG recommended that ‘States, on a voluntary basis, continue to inform the Secretary-General of their national views and assessments on how international law applies to their use of ICTs in the context of international security, and continue to voluntarily share such national views and practices through other avenues as appropriate’).\n See C. Painter, ‘The United Nations’ Cyberstability Processes: Surprising Progress but Much Left to Do’ (2021) 6 Journal of Cyber Policy 271–276.\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\nof international law, many of which are foundational to the international legal order. Some of the rules covered by these position papers include sovereignty, the prohibition on the threat or use of force, the peaceful settlement of disputes, human rights, the laws of armed conflict, the rules of attribution, and of course, the prohibition on intervention, which is the subject of this article.\nExamining these national and regional position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace reveals that, while the prohibition on intervention is accepted as a rule of general international law, there remains considerable uncertainty regarding the exact scope and content of this rule. In particular, there are notable differences among States on the definition of coercion. Some States have defined coercion as conduct that modifies the behavior of a State by causing it to act involuntarily or by compelling it to act in a manner that it would not have voluntarily engaged in but for the coercive conduct of a foreign State. Other States have defined coercion as conduct that deprives a State of its freedom of choice or control over matters within its domestic jurisdiction. A third and broader approach, which was adopted by the African Union, defines coercion as any conduct that imposes restraints on the will of a foreign State.\nIn addition to articulating theoretical definitions of coercion, some States provided examples of conduct that, in their view, amounted to coercion. These examples shed further light on how the concept of coercion applies to real-world situations in which ICTs are used as instruments of statecraft. In particular, these examples clarify the views of States on the threshold of effects or the degree of pressure that a State must be subjected to in order for conduct to be considered coercive. As I show below, there is currently no consensus among States on the effects that the conduct of the coercing State must have on the coerced State to constitute an act of unlawful intervention. Some States adopted relatively high thresholds that require the conduct in question to have significant effects on the coerced State. For example, for some States, merely seeking to sway public opinion during an election campaign does not necessarily amount to unlawful intervention. Rather, to those States, electoral interference must rise to the level of altering election results or preventing a segment of the population from voting in order to constitute an act of intervention.[14] On the other hand, other States adopted lower thresholds to determine when\n\nHELAL\nelectoral interference could be deemed coercive. For example, one State noted that 'hack and leak' operations to influence public opinion could constitute a violation of the prohibition on intervention. The African Union also adopted a relatively low threshold of coercion that does not require the behavior of a foreign State to have significant effects on a State in order to amount to unlawful intervention.\nIn short, national and regional position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace indicate that there are divergences among States on how the prohibition on intervention governs state conduct in cyberspace. There is no agreement on a theoretical definition of coercion, there is no consensus on the threshold of effects that determines when specific state conduct that is designed to influence the behavior of other States constitutes coercion, and there is some uncertainty on how non-intervention relates to other rules such as the prohibition on the threat or use of force and the obligation to respect the territorial sovereignty of States.\nHaving catalogued the views that States have, heretofore, expressed on non-intervention and coercion in cyberspace, the second objective of this article is to critically appraise the understandings of coercion that States have adopted in their national and regional position papers. Specifically, this article makes the following two arguments.\nFirst, this article contends that – as a matter of formal law – the positions expressed by States on the meaning of coercion should be viewed as proposals de lege ferenda, and not as restatements of established lex lata. This is because, as I explain below, nothing in the history of the development of the prohibition of intervention lends support to the definitions of coercion that States have espoused. Non-intervention first emerged in the early 20th century as a rule\n available at <https: issues_development-enjeux_developpement=\"\" peace_security-paix_security=\"\" eyberspace_law-cyberespace_droit.aspx?lang=\"eng\" world-monde=\"\" www.international.gc.ca=\"\"> ('An example of a prohibited intervention would be a malicious cyber activity that hacks and disables a State's election commission days before an election, preventing a significant number of citizens from voting, and ultimately influencing the election outcome').\nUNGA, 'Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions on the Subject of How International Law Applies to the Use of Information and Communications Technologies by States Submitted by Participating Governmental Experts in the Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security Established Pursuant to General Assembly Resolution 73/226' (13 July 2021) UN Doc. A/76/136 ('Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions'), at 69 (Norway: 'unduly influencing public opinion through the dissemination of confidential information obtained through cyber operations (\"hack and leak\"), would be in violation of the prohibition of intervention').</https:>\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\nof Inter-American conventional international law. Then, building on decades of advocacy principally by non-aligned States, the prohibition on intervention became a rule of general international law with the adoption of the 1970 Friendly Relations Declaration. However, at no point during the evolution of the prohibition on intervention did States define coercion as conduct that causes a State to behave involuntarily or that deprives a State of its freedom of choice or control over matters within its domestic jurisdiction. Indeed, the history of the development of this rule indicates that States never even conceived of coercion as the conceptual cornerstone of non-intervention.\nSecond, this article argues that the definitions of coercion adopted by some States are conceptually flawed. Echoing the ICJ's judgment in the Nicaragua Case, virtually all States agree that the prohibition on intervention proscribes coercion whether undertaken through armed force or through non-forcible means, such as economic or political instruments of statecraft. Many States also underscored that the use of armed force is the gravest form of intervention. Yet – paradoxically – applying the definitions of coercion espoused by many (especially Western) States would lead to a situation where the gravest form of intervention – armed force – is governed by a lower threshold than non-forcible forms of intervention that are considered less grave.\nAs discussed below, nothing in *jus ad bellum* requires an act that amounts to armed intervention to be of such gravity that it causes a State to behave involuntarily or deprives it of control over matters within its domestic jurisdiction, which are the definitions of coercion adopted by some States. Indeed, attacking a single military unit could constitute a violation of the prohibition on the threat or use of force and could even amount to an armed attack, regardless of its effect on the behavior of the target State. On the other hand, applying the definitions of coercion adopted by some States would require non-forcible forms of intervention to reach a level of gravity and intensity that causes (or threatens to cause) a State to act involuntarily or that deprives it of freedom of choice. As I explain below, these definitions entail an unreasonably high\n Nicaragua v. USA, at para. 215 ('Intervention is wrongful when it uses methods of coercion in regard to such choices, which must remain free ones. The element of coercion, which defines, and indeed forms the very essence of, prohibited intervention, is particularly obvious in the case of an intervention which uses force, either in the direct form of military action, or in the indirect form of support for subversive or terrorist armed activities within another State').\n As the ICJ noted in the *Oil Platforms Case*, '[t]he Court does not exclude the possibility that the mining of a single military vessel might be sufficient to bring into play the \"inherent right of self-defence\". *Oil Platforms* (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America) (Judgment) [2003] ICJ Rep. 161, at para. 72.\nHELAL\nthreshold of effects for non-forcible intervention that is significantly higher than that which applies to forcible intervention.\nTherefore, this article argues that States and scholars should consider adopting what I call the 'unified threshold of coercion' that applies to both forcible and non-forcible intervention. Based on this approach, non-forcible conduct would be considered coercive if its impact is comparable to the scale and effects of conduct that amounts to a violation of the threat or use of force. This unified threshold of coercion is lower than the thresholds of coercion that many States have adopted in their position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace.\nThis article consists of two sections. Section 1 provides a survey of the definitions of coercion that appear in national and regional position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace. This section also outlines the views of States on the interconnection between non-intervention and the prohibition on the use of force and the obligation to respect state sovereignty, which is a debate that sheds further light on the kinds of conduct that each of these rules applies to and regulates. Then in Section 2, this article critically appraises the understandings of coercion adopted by States and argues in favor of adopting what I call the 'unified threshold of coercion' that applies equally to both forcible and non-forcible forms of intervention.\n## 2 Intervention and Coercion in Cyberspace\nNational and regional position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace unanimously affirmed that non-intervention is an established rule of international law that applies in cyberspace.[18] The GGE,[19] the African Union\n\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\nPeace and Security Council, and the Juridical Committee of the Organization of American States also adopted this position. Despite this general agreement on the status of the prohibition on intervention as an established rule of international law, States adopted diverging views regarding the exact scope and content of this rule. This is especially clear with coercion. Indeed, many States, including the member States of the African Union, noted that coercion is a concept that remains undefined in international law. Nonetheless, in\nnot intervene directly or indirectly in the internal affairs of another State, including by means of ICTs').\n AU Peace and Security Council, 'Communiqué 1120.1' (9 November 2022) AU Doc. PSC/PR/COMM.1120.1(2022), at operative paragraph 3: 'Acknowledges the application of international law to cyberspace, and stresses that the prohibition on the threat or use of force, the prohibition on intervention in the internal or external affairs of states, and the inviolability of the political independence, territorial integrity, and sovereignty of states are foundational rules of international law'.\n The Inter-American Juridical Committee of the Organization of American States recommended the adoption of the following statement by the OAS General Assembly: 'The OAS General Assembly affirms that international law, including the United Nations Charter in its entirety, the OAS Charter, international humanitarian law, international human rights law, the duty of non-intervention, the sovereign equality of states, and the law of state responsibility, is applicable to the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) by States and those for whom States are internationally responsible'. Inter-American Juridical Committee, 'International Law and State Cyber Operations' (7 August 2020) OAS Doc. CJI/Res.260 (XCVII-O/20).\n Many States noted that coercion as an element of non-intervention remains undefined. See for example M. Helal, 'Common African Position on the Application of International Law to the Use of Information and Communication Technologies in Cyberspace, and All Associated Communiqués Adopted by the Peace and Security Council of the African Union' (2 February 2024) Ohio State Legal Studies Research Paper No. 823, available at <https: papers.cfm?abstract_id=\"4714756\" papers.ssrn.com=\"\" sol3=\"\"> ('Common African Position'), at para. 32 ('the definition of coercion in this context requires further study and deliberation between States'); Danish Government, 'Denmark's Position Paper on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace' (2023) 92 Nordic Journal of International Law 446–455, at 450 ('[t]he term coercion is not defined in either treaty law or customary international law'); Swedish Government Offices, 'Position Paper on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace' (July 2022), available at <https: 3c2cb6febd0e4ab0bd542f653283b140=\"\" contentassets=\"\" swedens-position-paper-on-the-application-of-international-law-in-cyberspace.pdf=\"\" www.government.se=\"\">, at 3 ('coercion is not defined in international law'); Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 'The Republic of Poland's Position on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace' (29 December 2022) Gov.pl, available at <https: diplomacy=\"\" the-republic-of-polands-position-on-the-application-of-international-law-in-cyberspace=\"\" web=\"\" www.gov.pl=\"\"> ('There is no universally acceptable definition of \"coercion\"); UNGA, 'Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions', at 34 (Germany: 'Especially the definition of the latter element [coercion] requires further clarification in the cyber context'); Ibid. at 57 (The Netherlands: 'The precise definition of</https:></https:></https:>\nHELAL\nan effort to clarify how non-intervention applies in cyberspace, many States offered definitions of coercion in their national or regional statements. Three approaches to defining coercion have appeared in these position papers.\n## 2.1 Coercion as Conduct that Modifies the Behavior of a State\nThe first approach defines coercion as conduct that compels a State to modify its behavior. Among the States that adopted this approach, there were slight variations in the exact definition of coercion that those States formulated. Some States defined coercion as acts that aim to compel a State to act involuntarily. Estonia's position paper expressed this view. It stated:\nWhen discussing if a cyber operation constitutes an unlawful intervention into the external or internal affairs of another state, the element of coercion is a key factor [...] Stemming from that, cyber operations that aim to force another nation to act in an involuntary manner or to refrain from acting in a certain manner, and target the other nation's domaine réservé (e.g., national democratic processes such as elections, or military, security or critical infrastructure systems) could constitute such an intervention.\nAustria's national statement was similar to Estonia's. It stated: '[c]oercion occurs when a state seeks to compel another state to change its behaviour with respect to its internal or external affairs, i.e. to force that state to act in an involuntary manner or involuntarily refrain from acting in a particular way'. Some States that adopted this understanding of coercion also included a 'but for' test in their definition of coercion. According to those States, an act would be coercive if it aimed at compelling a State to behave in a manner that it would not otherwise have engaged in voluntarily. Norway's position paper expressed this view:\ncoercion, and thus of unauthorized intervention, has not yet fully crystallized in international law [...] there is no clear definition of the element of coercion').\n UNGA, 'Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions', at 25.\n Austrian Government, 'Position Paper of the Republic of Austria: Cyber Activities and International Law' (April 2024), available at <https: docs-library.unoda.org=\"\" open-ended_working_group_on_information_and_communication_technologies_-_(2021)=\"\" open-end_working_group_on_information_and_communication_technologies_-_(2021)=\"\" /austrian_position_Paper_-_cyber_activities_and_international_law_(final_23.04.2024).pdf=\"\">, at 5.</https:>\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\n[A] State must not carry out cyber operations in breach of the prohibition of intervention, according to customary international law. A cyber operation must therefore not be carried out to compel the target State to take a course of action, whether by act or omission, in a way that it would not otherwise voluntarily have pursued (coercion) in matters relating to its internal or external affairs (domaine réservé).25\nThe Netherlands adopted a similar position. It defined coercion as an act 'compelling a state to take a course of action (whether an act or an omission) that it would not otherwise voluntarily pursue. The goal of the intervention must be to effect change in the behavior of the target state'.26 Denmark also defined coercion as an act that 'has a potential for compelling the target state to engage in an action that it would otherwise not take'.27 Switzerland and Poland also used similar terms. To Switzerland, coercion is conduct that 'seeks to cause another to act (or refrain from acting) in a way it would not otherwise',28 and Poland stated that coercion 'aims at influencing the state's decisions belonging to its domaine réservé', and added that cyberoperations 'potentially leading to the state's conduct that would not occur otherwise, may be considered a prohibited intervention'.29\nOther States that understood coercion as conduct that is designed to modify the behavior of another State used relatively generic terms to define coercion. Romania, for example, defined coercion simply as an act the purpose of which is to 'effectively change the behavior of the target state'.30 Israel's Deputy Attorney General also opined that coercion 'has been taken to mean that State A cannot take actions to \"coerce\" State B in pursuing a course of action, or refraining from a course of action, in matters pertaining to State B's core internal affairs'.31 Singapore's national statement defined coercion in similar terms. It stated that a cyberoperation may violate the prohibition on intervention if it amounted to an 'attempt to coerce our government to take or forebear\n\nHELAL\na certain course of action on a matter ordinarily within its sovereign prerogative'.32 Italy's national statement used almost identical terms. It asserted that 'a State employs coercive means to compel another State to undertake or desist from a specific action, in matters falling under its domain réserve'.33 In other words, for these States, an act is coercive simply if it is intended to cause another State to change its behavior. These States did not, however, explicitly include a requirement that the conduct in question must compel a State to act involuntarily or force it to engage in behavior that it would not have engaged in voluntarily but-for the coercive conduct of a foreign State.\nGermany adopted a generally similar understanding of coercion. Although it did not refer to modifying the behavior of a State or causing it to act involuntarily, Germany described coercion as the exercise of a certain level of pressure that has a significant impact on the decision-making process of a State to the extent that it manipulates or undermines the will of the State. Germany's position paper stated the following:\nGenerally, Germany is of the opinion that cyber measures may constitute a prohibited intervention under international law if they are comparable in scale and effects to coercion in non-cyber contexts.\nCoercion implies that a State's internal processes regarding aspects pertaining to its domaine réservé are significantly influenced or thwarted and that its will is manifestly bent by the foreign State's conduct. However, as is widely accepted, the element of coercion must not be assumed prematurely. Even harsher forms of communication such as pointed commentary and sharp criticism as well as (persistent) attempts to obtain, through discussion, a certain reaction or the performance of a certain measure from another State do not as such qualify as coercion. Moreover, the acting State must intend to intervene in the internal affairs of the target State – otherwise the scope of the non-intervention principle would be unduly broad.34\nDespite these variations in the exact formulation of these definitions, these understandings of coercion share the common characteristic of focusing on\n\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\nthe desire of the coercing State to alter the behavior of another State. Marko Milanovic calls this the extortion model of coercion. 'These definitions point to undermining the victim state's will as the essence of coercion (\"involuntary,\" \"voluntary\"), so as to effect a change in its behavior'.35\nSeveral States that adopted this definition of coercion also provided examples of conduct that, in their view, amounted to intervention. As noted above in the introduction to this article, these examples provide greater clarity on how States operationalize and apply the definitions of coercion that they adopted. In its position paper, Finland position paper identified the following forms of coercion:\n[W]hile the conduct of elections belongs undisputedly to the internal affairs of each State, all methods of electoral interference do not display the element of coercion. Hacking of voter databases or manipulation of vote counts in order to alter the election results has nevertheless been recognized as a fairly clear case. To be comparable to a real world intervention, cyber interference must also be of a serious nature [...] Military or economic pressure may also qualify as coercion. Hostile cyber interference done with the purpose of promoting or supporting armed action in another State could constitute an example of prohibited intervention, provided that it seeks to force a certain policy change.[36]\nDenmark's position paper provided similar examples of coercive intervention:\nAs emphasized by the Court in the Nicaragua judgment coercive acts involving the use of force are particularly obvious examples of unlawful interventions. Denmark considers that coercion is not limited to means of direct or indirect use of force and that also measures below this threshold may constitute coercion. Cyber activities that do not amount to use of force can therefore also be coercive.\nAn example of unlawful intervention in the cyber domain could be where a State coercively interferes in the internal political process of another. In the cyber context this could potentially occur by using cyber\n\nHELAL\ntechnology to alter electronic ballots and thereby affecting the results of a political election.\nNorway also provided examples of coercion that affect a State's electoral processes, but that went beyond the examples that appear in the position papers of Finland and Denmark. In addition to tampering with election systems to alter the results of an election, Norway stated:\n[C]arrying out cyber operations with the intent of altering election results in another State, for example by manipulating election systems or unduly influencing public opinion through the dissemination of confidential information obtained through cyber operations ('hack and leak'), would be in violation of the prohibition of intervention. Another example is a cyber operation deliberately causing a temporary shutdown of the target State's critical infrastructure, such as the power supply or TV, radio, Internet or other telecommunications infrastructure in order to compel that State to take a course of action.\nLikewise, for Poland, the following conduct amounted to a violation of the prohibition on intervention: 'a wide-scale and targeted disinformation campaign, in particular when it results in civil unrest', preventing 'a reliable and timely conduct of democratic elections', blocking 'the filing of tax returns online', or depriving a 'the parliament working remotely of the possibility of voting online to adopt a law or modifying the outcome of such voting'. Austria also identified the following conduct as amounting to a breach of the prohibition on intervention:\n[A] cyber activity that interferes with a state's ability to hold elections or which manipulates election results could, if undertaken to compel a state to involuntarily change a government policy, constitute a violation of the prohibition of intervention. Large-scale cyber activities, including disinformation campaigns, conducted by or attributable to a state may also constitute, if undertaken to compel another state to involuntarily change its behaviour, a violation of the prohibition of intervention.\n\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\n\n## 2.2 Coercion as Conduct that Deprives a State of Freedom of Choice or Control\nThe second understanding of coercion that has emerged out of national position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace defines coercion as an act that deprives a State of its ability to control or to exercise freedom of choice regarding matters within its domaine réservé. Australia adopted this view. Its position paper stated: ‘[c]oercive means are those that effectively deprive or are intended to deprive the State of the ability to control, decide upon or govern matters of an inherently sovereign nature’.44 In order to establish that a breach of the prohibition on intervention has indeed occurred, Australia required evidence that the conduct of the coercing State had some measurable impact or discernable effect on the target State.45 Canada expressed a similar position. Its position paper explained that a cyberoperation would be coercive if it is ‘designed to deprive the affected State of its freedom of choice’.46 Canada also noted that, in order to amount to an act of\n\nHELAL\nintervention, a cyberoperation must 'cause coercive effects that deprive, compel or otherwise impose an outcome on the affected State'.47\nNew Zealand also defined coercion as conduct that manifests 'an intention to deprive the target state of control over matters falling within the scope of its inherently sovereign functions'.48 According to New Zealand, to constitute intervention, the conduct of the coercing State must have 'significant effects' on a matter within a State's domaine réservé. The Czech Republic defined coercion in similar terms. It stated:\nCoercion is an activity intended to deprive, either directly or indirectly, the State of its ability to exercise control or govern matters within its internal and external affairs [...] The difference between actions that violate sovereignty and actions that violate the prohibition of intervention is that the latter is coercive, i.e., intentionally aims to influence the State's free will and choice.49\nBrazil, Costa Rica, and the UK also adopted similar definitions of coercion. The UK Attorney General said the following about coercion:\nSome have characterized coercion as forcing a State to act differently from how it otherwise would – that is, compelling it into a specific act or omission. Imagine, for example, a cyber operation to delay another State's election, or to prevent it from distributing tax revenues to fund essential services. To my mind, these are certainly forms of coercion.\nBut I want to be clear today that coercion can be broader than this. In essence, an intervention in the affairs of another State will be unlawful if it is forcible, dictatorial, or otherwise coercive, depriving a State of its freedom of control over matters which it is permitted to decide freely by the principle of State sovereignty. While the precise boundaries of coercion are yet to crystallize in international law, we should be ready to consider whether disruptive cyber behaviors are coercive even where it might not\n\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\nbe possible to point to a specific course of conduct which a State has been forced into or prevented from taking.\nCosta Rica's position was similar, but not identical, to that of the UK. It stated that coercion can occur in a 'multitude of ways where one State, directly or indirectly through support for non-State actors, deprives another State of the capacity to make free and informed choices pertaining to its internal affairs'. Like the UK, Costa Rica used the word deprives, but it did not use the word control in relation to matters within its domaine réservé. Rather, it referred to the capacity of a State to make free and informed choices. Brazil used different terminology. Instead of referring to depriving a State its ability to freely decide on matters within its domaine réservé, Brazil stated that, to constitute intervention, a cyberoperation 'against another State must involve an element of coercion affecting the right of the victim State to freely choose its political, economic, social and cultural system, and to formulate its foreign policy'.\nMarko Milanovic calls this the control model of coercion:\nCoercion-as-control does not work by influencing the decision-making calculus of the coerced state. Rather, the coercing state directly interferes with the coerced state's internal or external affairs by taking action that materially deprives the coerced state of its ability to control its policy-choices within its reserved domain.\nSeveral States that adopted this definition of coercion also provided examples of conduct that amounted to intervention in their position papers. Australia, for instance, identified activities that 'manipulate the electoral system to alter the results of an election in another State, intervention in the fundamental operation of Parliament, or in the stability of States' financial systems' as examples of coercion. Canada also stated that a cyberoperation that 'hacks\n S.

Its position paper stated:\nCoercion is clear-cut when a State uses or threatens to use force against another one. Nonetheless, it can also occur in a multitude of ways where one State, directly or indirectly through support for non-State actors, deprives another State of the capacity to make free and informed choices pertaining to its internal or external affairs. Coercion may occur when a State provides financial or other forms of support to secessionist, subversive or violent groups in the territory of another State, when it exercises significant political or economic pressure on another State, or when it engages in or supports subversive or hostile propaganda or the dissemination of false news that interfere in the internal or external affairs of another State [...]\nA prominent example of a breach of non-intervention are ransomware attacks crippling or simply interfering with a State's ability to run public services, such as finance, education, and social security. Moreover, foreign election interference may also infringe the principle of non-intervention. This may take the form of cyber operations directly interfering with mail ballots or voter databases, or electoral disinformation campaigns seeking\n\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\nto mislead the electorate about the vote itself, candidates, electoral polls or results. Other types of disinformation, such as those affecting a State's health policies, may also amount to a prohibited intervention. Posts inciting individuals or other States to wage wars of aggression or to disrupt or subvert the internal order of another State may likewise breach the principle of non-intervention.57\nThe UK also provided a wide range of examples of acts of coercion. It identified forms of intervention that affected four areas of state policy: 'energy security; essential medical care; economic stability; and democratic processes'.58 In relation to 'essential energy supplies' 'essential medical services' and 'economic stability' the UK listed the following cyberoperations as potentially breaching the prohibition on intervention:\n[D]isruption of systems controlling emergency medical transport (e.g., telephone dispatchers); causing hospital computer systems to cease functioning; disruption of supply chains for essential medicines and vaccines; preventing the supply of power to housing, healthcare, education, civil administration and banking facilities and infrastructure; causing the energy supply chain to stop functioning at national level through damage or prevention of access to pipelines, interchanges, and depots; or preventing the operation of power generation infrastructure.\nTurning to economic stability, covert cyber operations by a foreign State that coercively interfere with a State's freedom to manage its domestic economy, or to ensure provision of domestic financial services crucial to the State's financial system, would breach the rule on non-intervention. Such cyber operations could include disruption to the networks controlling a State's fundamental ability to conduct monetary policy or to raise and distribute revenue, for instance through taxation. Or disruption to systems which support lending, saving and insurance across the economy.59\nIn relation to democratic processes, the UK noted that 'covert cyber operations by a foreign State which coercively interfere with free and fair electoral processes would constitute a prohibited intervention'. Examples of such unlawful\n\nHELAL\nconduct include: '[O]perations that disrupt the systems which control electoral counts to change the outcome of an election; or operations to disrupt another State's ability to hold an election at all, for example by causing systems to malfunction with the effect of preventing voter registration'.60\n## 2.3 Coercion as Conduct that Imposes Restraints on the Will of a State\nThe third approach to understanding coercion appears in the Common African Position on the Application of International Law to the Use of Information and Communication Technologies in Cyberspace, which was adopted by the fifty-five members of the African Union in early 2024.61 As of this writing, the African Union is the first regional organization to have adopted a position on the application of international law in cyberspace.62 The Common African Position defined coercion 'as a policy that is designed to impose restraints on the will of a foreign State. Assessing whether the use by one or more States of ICTs in cyberspace to influence the conduct of a foreign State amounts to coercion is a determination that should be undertaken on a case-by-case basis'.63 The Common African Position also stated the following:\nWhile the definition of coercion in this context requires further study and deliberation between States, the African Union is of the view that it is not necessary, in order to constitute coercion, that the conduct of a State must rise to the level of completely depriving a foreign State of its freedom of choice or to compel that State to either act or refrain from acting involuntarily. Coercion may also occur through threats of intervention. Furthermore, there is no requirement that, in order to constitute a violation of the prohibition on intervention, an act of coercion must actually succeed in compelling the State subjected to such acts to change its conduct. An unsuccessful attempt of intervention is unlawful under international law. The African Union stresses that offers or calls to peacefully settle disputes through negotiation, enquiry, mediation, conciliation, good offices, arbitration, and judicial settlement, and diplomatic\n\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\n\nIn some respects, the understanding of coercion in the Common African Position is similar to other definitions of coercion, but it also diverges from these definitions in significant ways. The Common African Position defined coercion as conduct that ‘impose[s] restraints on the will of a foreign State’. This is broadly analogous to the notion of impinging on the freedom of choice of States, which is central to the coercion-as-control model. However, the Common African Position also indicates that the purpose of intervention is to ‘influence the conduct of a foreign State’. This echoes definitions that understand coercion as conduct that aims at modifying the behavior of a State by subverting, manipulating, or undermining its decision-making processes.\nCompared to other definitions of coercion, however, the Common African Position was purposively designed to broaden the protective scope of the prohibition on intervention. It does so by adopting a lower threshold of (actual or threatened) effects that must be crossed for conduct to amount to coercion. This is clearly expressed in the following sentence: ‘the African Union is of the view that it is not necessary, in order to constitute coercion, that the conduct of a State must rise to the level of completely depriving a foreign State of its freedom of choice or to compel that State to either act or refrain from acting involuntarily’.\nIn other words, the principal point of divergence between the Common African Position and the positions of other States relates to the threshold of coercion. For the member States of the African Union, intervention is any conduct undertaken by a State that imposes restraints on another State in relation to matters within its domestic jurisdiction. However, those restraints need not be of such severity that they cause a State to act involuntarily nor do they need to reach a level of intensity that completely deprives that State of its freedom of choice or control over matters within its domestic jurisdiction.\nIt is notable that, in an initial draft of the Common African Position that this author had prepared while serving as the African Union Special Rapporteur on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace, coercion was defined in the following terms: ‘coercion, in the context of the prohibition on intervention, should be defined as a policy that is designed to impose material restraints on the will of a foreign State’. The adjective ‘material’ was intended\n Ibid., at para. 32.\n Ibid.\nHELAL\nto signify that, in order to amount to intervention, the restraints imposed on a State must attain an elevated level of severity, which would ensure that non-intervention would not be an over-inclusive rule.\nThis initial draft of the Common African Position was welcomed by the AU Peace and Security Council, and served as the basis for the interstate negotiations that led to the adoption of the Common African Position, which were held in Tunisia from 29 November to 1 December 2023. During these negotiations, however, the AU member States decided to delete the adjective 'material'. The member States determined that the word 'restraints' sufficiently and accurately captured the essence of the prohibition on intervention. Many States described non-intervention as a rule that is intended to protect the policy autonomy of States and to enable States to manage their internal and external affairs free from 'restraints' that might be imposed by other States. The AU member States also agreed that, when read in the context of the entire section on non-intervention in the Common African Position, the prohibition on intervention was not over-inclusive.\n## 2.4 The Element of Intent\nMany States also included the element of the intent in their definitions of coercion. New Zealand articulated this element unambiguously. Its position paper affirmed that the 'coercive intention of the state actor is a critical element of the rule' and underscored that 'intention may in some circumstances be inferred from the effects of cyber activity'. Similarly, Costa Rica's position paper noted that '[f]or such breaches [of the prohibition on intervention] to occur, it suffices that a State intends to coerce another State, employs coercive methods, or eventually causes coercive effects in another State'. Czechia's position paper used similar terms. It stated that '[c]oercion is an activity intended to deprive' a State of control over matters within its domaine réservé.\n See AU Peace and Security Council, 'Communiqué No. 1171' (24 August 2023) AU Doc.

For instance, Norway stated that holding elections is an example of an activity that falls within the *domaine réservé* of a State. Therefore, according to Norway, 'carrying out cyber operations with the intent of altering election results in another State' would violate the prohibition on intervention.[71] Furthermore, Canada,[72] Denmark,[73] and the US,[74] understood coercion as conduct that is *designed* to achieve a specific purpose or effect (such as modifying the behavior of the target State). As noted above, the Common African Position also understood coercion as conduct that is *'designed* to impose restraints on the will of a foreign State'. The use of the term *'designed'* by these position papers introduces the element of intent into the definition of coercion. It indicates that the coercing State is acting purposefully and intentionally and employing its resources in a systematic and strategic manner to achieve specific policy objectives.\nOther States used similar phrases that also make the intent of the coercing State an element of the definition of coercion. The Netherlands $^{75}$ and Romania $^{76}$ defined coercion as conduct *'the goal'* of which is changing the behavior of the target State. Likewise, Estonia and Poland described coercion as conduct that *'aimed'* at achieving a specific objective. Estonia, for example, stated that 'cyber operations that *aim* to force another nation to act in an involuntary manner or to refrain from acting in a certain manner' would amount to intervention.[77] Poland also stated that '[t]o be in breach of international law,\n\nHELAL\nan intervention must include the element of coercion that aims at influencing the state's decisions belonging to its domaine réservé.78 Again, using phrases like: 'the goal of' intervention, or saying that coercion is conduct 'that aims at', presupposes that the coercing State is acting intentionally. It indicates that the coercing State has identified a policy objective – an aim or a goal – which it is seeking to achieve by engaging in cyberoperations against another State.\n## 2.5 Sovereignty, Intervention, and the Use of Force: Demarcating the Doctrinal Boundaries\nIn addition to articulating definitions of coercion and offering examples of conduct that amounts to coercion, many States addressed the question of the relation between, on one hand, the prohibition on intervention and, on the other, the obligation to respect the territorial sovereignty of States and the prohibition on the threat or use of force. The content and scope of application of these three rules overlap significantly. As the ICJ observed in the Nicaragua Case, '[t]he effects of the principle of respect for territorial sovereignty inevitably overlap with those of the principles of the prohibition of the use of force and of non-intervention'.79\nTo disentangle the interconnection between these three rules, many States expressed views on the threshold of effects that must be crossed for conduct to amount to a violation of each of these rules. Surveying national and regional position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace reveals that States have approached this question from three different angles. The first relates to categories of conduct that – by their very nature – do not constitute a breach of the prohibition on intervention because they fall below the threshold of coercion. Nonetheless, some States noted that conduct that does not amount to intervention because it falls below the threshold of coercion may still be wrongful because it violates the principle of state sovereignty. The second is the higher threshold of coercion, which many States identified as the point at which non-intervention intersects with the prohibition on the threat or use of force. The third relates to the threshold at which non-forcible conduct – such as information operations, election interference, or economic sanctions – amount to coercion.\n\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\n## 2.6 Conduct below the Threshold of Coercion\nMany States identified certain forms of conduct that do not amount to unlawful intervention because they are considered non-coercive. Several Western States argued that practices designed to persuade a State to change its behavior or to influence its policies are lawful, even if such practices involve criticism of that State. These Western States argued that such conduct is commonplace in international relations, which means that it should not be condemned as a form of intervention. This was a point of convergence among Western States regardless of the definitions of coercion they adopted.\nFor example, in its position paper, Czechia, which defined coercion as acts that deprive a State of control over matters within its *domaine réservé*, stated that '[m]ere influencing, criticism or persuasion do not meet the requirements to be qualified as prohibited intervention'. Similarly, Denmark, which defined coercion as conduct that causes a State to behave in a manner it would not have engaged in voluntarily, stated that 'a distinction must be drawn between activities that merely involve influencing, as opposed to compelling, the voluntary actions of a target State. Acts of influence, such as persuasion, criticism, and public diplomacy are insufficient to qualify as an intervention'. Germany also noted that 'harsher forms of communication such as pointed commentary and sharp criticism as well as (persistent) attempts to obtain, through discussion, a certain reaction or the performance of a certain measure from another State do not as such qualify as coercion'. Sweden also opined that 'criticism or other ways of influencing through diplomatic means' does not qualify as coercion. Likewise, Canada, which was among the States that defined coercion as depriving a State of control over its *domaine réservé*, stated that '[c]oercion must be distinguished from other conduct such as public diplomacy, criticism, persuasion, and propaganda'. The UK also distinguished between coercive conduct, which is unlawful, and the freedom of States 'to make their views known about processes in other countries – delivering hard, sometimes\n See for example: Finnish Ministry for Foreign Affairs, 'Finland's Views on International Law and Cyberspace', at 463 ('[t]he requirement of coercion leaves out lesser forms of influence and persuasion that are commonplace in international relations').\n Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 'Position Paper on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace', at para. 13.\n Danish Government, 'Denmark's Position Paper on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace', at 450.\n UNGA, 'Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions', at 34.\n Swedish Government Offices, 'Position Paper on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace', at 3.\n Canadian Government, 'International Law Applicable in Cyberspace'.\nHELAL\nunwelcome messages, and drawing attention to concerns. This is part and parcel of international relations. Similarly, Austria stated that ‘[i]t is important to distinguish such disinformation campaigns from lawful public relations activities of state representatives, including e.g. by openly criticising the human rights situation in another state on social media accounts or websites’.\nThe Common African Position adopted a different approach regarding conduct that falls below the threshold of coercion. It stated: ‘offers or calls to peacefully settle disputes through negotiation, enquiry, mediation, conciliation, good offices, arbitration, and judicial settlement, and diplomatic discussions and communications are presumed not to constitute acts of coercion’. The first portion of this sentence is based on Article 33 of the UN Charter. It indicates that efforts to settle disputes peacefully are not considered coercive. The second portion of this sentence – ‘diplomatic discussions and communications are presumed not to constitute acts of coercion’ – was designed to signal that diplomatic correspondences, whether written or verbal, are generally not considered coercive. The keyword here is *presumed*, which was inserted because history is replete with cases in which diplomatic communications were employed as instruments of coercion. Perhaps the most (in)famous ultimatum ever – the Austro-Hungarian ultimatum to Serbia that started World War I – was delivered via a diplomatic note. Similarly, in a series of meetings that were held in 1945 and 1946 between Soviet and Turkish diplomats, the USSR attempted to coerce Turkey into redrawing the international frontier between the two States and granting the USSR access to and control over the Turkish straits.\nThis sentence in the Common African Position was also intended to signal that the member States of the African Union did not share the view adopted by Western States that other practices such as public diplomacy, criticism, propaganda, unwelcome messages and other conduct that, for instance, the UK described as ‘part and parcel of international relations’ could never be coercive.\nThis approach in the Common African Position is consistent with the positions expressed by African and other developing States during the negotiations on the 1970 Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning\n Braverman, ‘International Law in Future Frontiers’.\n Austrian Government, ‘Position Paper of the Republic of Austria’, at 5.\n ‘Common African Position’, at para. 32.\n See ‘Austria’s Ultimatum to Serbia: Full Text of the Document That Started the World War, and Serbia’s Reply to It’ (1918) 9 Current History 554–558.\n O. Isci, ‘Turkey at a Crossroads: The Soviet Threat and Postwar Realignment, 1945–1946’ (2023) 47 Diplomatic History 621–646.\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\nFriendly Relations and Co-Operation Among States. During discussions on that declaration, several Western States proposed adding a caveat that stated that non-intervention did not affect\n[t]he generally recognized freedom of states to seek to influence the policies and actions of other states, in accordance with international law and settled international practice and in a manner compatible with the principle of sovereign equality States and the duty to cooperate in accordance with the Charter.[91]\nNon-Western States opposed this proposal because innocuous phrases like 'settled international practice' or acts that 'seek to influence the policies and actions of other states' were viewed as a potential backdoor that would justify interventionist policies by powerful States.[92] For African States, determining whether 'criticism', 'public diplomacy', or so-called 'unwelcome messages' amount to intervention can only be established on the basis of an holistic, case-by-case evaluation of the facts.\nSeveral States also argued that, because of the element of coercion, the threshold that must be crossed for conduct to amount to intervention was higher than that which applied to violations of state sovereignty.[93] Switzerland's position paper expressed this understanding of the relationship between these two principles – sovereignty and non-intervention – clearly. It stated:\n\nHELAL\nAn infringement of sovereignty and a prohibited intervention are not the same. The latter must be coercive in nature, i.e. through its intervention a state seeks to cause another to act (or refrain from acting) in a way it would not otherwise. This means that the threshold for a breach of the non-intervention principle is significantly higher than that for a violation of state sovereignty.\nFinland adopted the same view. Its position paper stated: ‘[c]ompared to a violation of sovereignty, the requirement of coercive nature and that of domaine réservé make the threshold of prohibited intervention considerably higher’. Poland’s position paper similarly stated that ‘[t]he threshold for considering a specific operation in cyberspace to be in breach of the principle of non-intervention is higher than in the case of deeming it solely a violation of the principle of sovereignty’. Canada also underscored that ‘[w]hether or not a cyber activity meets the threshold for a violation of the rule on territorial sovereignty or rises to the level of a violation of the rule against intervention will be determined on a case-by-case basis’. Israel also viewed sovereignty and non-intervention as being closely related, but noted that acts of intervention are ‘understood as having a high threshold’.\n## 2.7 Forcible Intervention as the Higher Threshold of Coercion\nMany States adopted the position that the threat or use of force is a form of coercion. Several States also described the threat or use of force as the gravest\n UNGA, ‘Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions’, at 87.\n Finnish Ministry for Foreign Affairs, ‘Finland’s Views on International Law and Cyberspace’, at 464.\n Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, ‘The Republic of Poland’s Position on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace’ (‘The threshold for considering a specific operation in cyberspace to be in breach of the principle of non-intervention is higher than in the case of deeming it solely a violation of the principle of sovereignty’).\n Canadian Government, ‘International Law Applicable in Cyberspace’.\n Schöndorf, ‘Israel’s Perspective on Key Legal and Practical Issues Concerning the Application of International Law to Cyber Operations’, at 403.\n See for example Costa Rican Ministry of Foreign Affairs, ‘Costa Rica’s Position on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace’: (‘Coercion is clear-cut when a State uses or threatens to use force against another one’); Danish Government, ‘Denmark’s Position Paper on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace’ (‘coercive acts involving the use of force are particularly obvious examples of unlawful interventions’); UNGA, ‘Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions’, at 57 (Netherlands: ‘the use of force will always meet the definition of coercion. Use of force against another state is always a form of intervention’).\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\nform of coercion. Some States, such as France and the Netherlands, also emphasized that acts that constitute a threat or use of force could also concurrently violate both the prohibition on intervention and state sovereignty. Many States also argued that the threshold of non-forceful coercion is lower than the threshold of forceful coercion. For example, Denmark underscored that 'coercion is not limited to means of direct or indirect use of force and that also measures below this threshold may constitute coercion'. Similarly, Germany stated: '[m]alicious cyber activities will only in some cases amount to direct or indirect use of force. However, measures below this threshold may also qualify as coercive'. The UK and the US also expressed this view.\nThe Common African Position did not take an express position on whether there is a distinction between the threshold of the use of force and the threshold of intervention. Rather, the Common African Position affirmed that the prohibition on intervention is a broad rule that applies to any forcible or non-forcible instrument of statecraft that might be used as means of coercion. It stated: '[t]he prohibition on intervention applies to the use of any instrument, including armed, political, economic, or any other means, and instruments of information, that may be used by a State for the purposes of intervening in the\n\nHELAL\ninternal or external affairs of a foreign State'. Brazil adopted the same view. It stated: 'the customary norm prohibiting intervention in the internal affairs of another State applies irrespective of the means or medium used and extends to the use of ICTs by States'. Similarly, Costa Rica stated:\nCoercion is clear-cut when a State uses or threatens to use force against another one. Nonetheless, it can also occur in a multitude of ways where one State, directly or indirectly through support for non-State actors, deprives another State of the capacity to make free and informed choices pertaining to its internal or external affairs.\nIn short, there is evidence of a consensus among those States that have issued national or regional position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace that the threat or use of force is, *ipso facto*, a form of coercion that is wrongful under both the prohibition on the threat or use of force and the prohibition on intervention. These position papers also show that there is a consensus on the principle that non-forcible conduct could also amount to intervention. The point of divergence, however, relates to the threshold of coercion that applies to non-forcible conduct. This is the subject of the next section.\n## 2.8 The Threshold of Non-forcible Coercion\nThis question of the exact threshold at which non-forcible conduct amounts to coercion is of critical importance. This is because most acts of unlawful intervention that could be undertaken through cyberspace are likely to fall below the threshold of forcible intervention. For example, activities such as election interference or disinformation campaigns will almost always fall below the threshold of the use of force. In fact, this is precisely the area – conduct below the threshold of the use of force, but above the threshold of violations of territorial sovereignty – where the prohibition on intervention is most relevant.\n Helal, ‘Common African Position’, at para. 29.\n UNGA, ‘Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions’, at 18.\n Costa Rican Ministry of Foreign Affairs, ‘Costa Rica’s Position on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace’, at 7.\n M. Schmitt, “Virtual” Disenfranchisement: Cyber Election Meddling in the Grey Zones of International Law’ (2018) 19 Chicago Journal of International Law 30–67, at 40 (Arguing that ‘because of the relatively high consequential threshold for violation, it is unlikely, although not inconceivable, that cyber election meddling would qualify as an unlawful use of force’).\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\nNational and regional position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace reveal that there is no consistency among States on the question of the threshold of coercion that applies to non-forcible intervention. This lack of consistency is evident even among States that adopted the same definition of coercion. In other words, even where there is some convergence among States on the meaning of coercion at a theoretical level, there are notable divergences on how the concept of coercion applies in real-world situations.\nAmong the States that defined coercion as conduct that modifies the behavior of a State or causes it to act involuntarily, there were notable differences in the terminology used to describe the threshold that applies to non-forcible coercion. Germany contended that, to constitute an act of intervention, a cyberoperation must be 'comparable in scale and effect to coercion in non-cyber contexts'. According to Germany, to meet the threshold of coercion, a cyberoperation must have the effect of 'significantly influenc[ing] or thwart[ing]' the decision-making process of a State to the point where its 'will is manifestly bent'.[109] Although it did not specify a definite threshold that non-forcible conduct must meet to constitute an act of intervention, Switzerland noted that a cyberoperation could amount to economic coercion if it paralyzed the operation of a 'company that is systemically relevant'.[110]\nOn the other hand, Poland indicated that, to constitute coercion, the foreign State's conduct must 'adversely affect' the 'functioning and security of the political, economic, military or social system of a state'.[111] Norway also provided examples of non-forcible coercive conduct that included 'manipulating election systems', 'unduly influencing public opinion', and 'causing a temporary shutdown' of critical infrastructure.[112]\nDenmark and Romania, both of which also defined coercion as conduct that modifies the behavior of a State or causes it to act involuntarily, did not explicitly identify a specific threshold at which non-forcible conduct could be considered coercive. Instead, Romania stated that an act of intervention must be intended to 'effectively change' the behavior of a State and underscored that 'there has to be a causal nexus between the coercive act and the effect on the internal or external affairs of the target State'.[113] Denmark's position paper also stated that 'an act may be considered of a coercive nature when the act\n\nHELAL\nof interference has a potential for compelling the target State to engage in an action that it would otherwise not take.\nTo this writer, the thresholds of coercion adopted by Germany and Switzerland are substantially higher than the thresholds adopted by Poland and Norway. The phrase ‘significantly influencing or thwarting’ that was used by Germany and the words ‘paralysis’ and ‘systemically relevant’ that Switzerland used signify a notably higher threshold of coercion than the term ‘adverse effects’ that was used by Poland and the phrases ‘manipulating election systems’ and ‘unduly influencing public opinion’ that Norway used. Denmark appears to have adopted an even lower threshold of coercion. For Denmark, a cyberoperation need not have an actual effect on the target State to be considered wrongful under the prohibition on intervention. Rather, a cyberoperation that merely has the ‘potential for compelling’ a State crosses the threshold of coercion. On the other hand, for Romania, the ‘potential’ to compel a State is insufficient. Rather, to constitute intervention, Romania requires that a State must be the target of a cyberoperation that has a measurable effect on the coerced State and that is causally connected to the behavior of the coercing State.\nThere are similar inconsistencies among the States that defined coercion as conduct that deprives a State of its freedom of choice or control over its domaine réservé. Australia, New Zealand, and Canada adopted broadly similar definitions of the threshold of coercion. According to Australia, conduct is coercive if it ‘effectively deprive[s]’ or is ‘intended to deprive’ a State of control over matters of an inherently sovereign nature. As discussed above, for Australia, examples of coercion include: ‘manipulating the electoral system to alter the results of an election’ or undermining the ‘fundamental operation of Parliament’ or the ‘stability of States’ financial systems. Similarly, for New Zealand, conduct is coercive if it has ‘significant effects’ on a State’s domaine réservé. Examples of acts that meet this threshold include ‘manipulating the voting tally’ in an election, preventing a ‘significant part of the electorate’ from voting, and causing ‘significant damage’ or ‘loss of functionality’ to critical infrastructure. According to Canada, intervention is conduct that has ‘coercive\n Danish Government, ‘Denmark’s Position Paper on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace’, at 450.\n UNGA, ‘Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions’, at 5.\n Ibid.\n New Zealand Foreign Affairs and Trade, ‘The Application of International Law to State Activity in Cyberspace’, at para. 9(b).\n Ibid.\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\neffects that deprive, compel, or impose an outcome on the affected State'. Again, as noted above, for Canada, examples of coercion include influencing the outcome of an election through a cyberoperation that 'hacks and disables a State's election commission' or by 'preventing a significant number of citizens from voting', in addition to 'disrupt[ing] the functioning of a major gas pipeline' to affect a State's negotiating position.[119] Finland provided similar examples of coercion. It noted that to constitute intervention in an election, the conduct of a foreign State must 'be of a serious nature', examples of which are altering electoral results through 'hacking of voter databases or manipulation of vote'.[120]\nBrazil, Czechia, Costa Rica, and the UK used different terms to describe the threshold of coercion. Brazil understood coercion as conduct 'affecting the right' of a State to choose its political, economic, social and cultural system and to formulate its foreign policy.[121] Czechia stated that an act is coercive if it 'intentionally aims to influence the State's free will and choice'.[122] For Costa Rica, conduct amounts to coercion if it impinges on a State's ability to make 'free and informed choices'. As noted above, Costa Rica also provided several examples of coercive conduct. These included: 'subversive or hostile propaganda', 'dissemination of false news', 'significant political or economic pressure', 'crippling or simply interfering' with public services, 'interfering with ballots or voter databases', and 'electoral disinformation campaigns'.[123] Like Costa Rica, the UK provided a wide-range of examples of coercive conduct. These included 'disruption of systems controlling emergency medical transport', 'causing hospital computer systems to cease functioning', 'disruption of supply chains for essential medicines and vaccines', 'preventing the operation of power generation infrastructure' or disrupting power supplies to 'housing, healthcare, education, civil administration and banking facilities and infrastructure', interfering with 'financial services' that are crucial to a State's financial system, and disrupting a State's 'fundamental ability to conduct monetary policy'.[124]\nTo this writer, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada adopted a higher threshold of coercion than that which Brazil, Czechia, Costa Rica, and the UK adopted. The former repeatedly used the word 'significant' to describe the\n\nHELAL\neffects that the conduct of a State must have in order to constitute coercion. Moreover, for those States, election interference must actually alter the results of an election to amount to intervention. Brazil, Czechia, Costa Rica, and the UK, however, used terms and phrases such as 'affecting', 'aims to influence', and 'free and informed choices' to describe the effects of the conduct of a foreign State. These terms signify a lower threshold of coercion. Indeed, unlike Australia, New Zealand, and Canada, the position papers of Brazil, Czechia, Costa Rica, and the UK did not require election interference to rise to the level of changing the results of an election to amount to intervention. Rather, these States used terms that would condemn as unlawful a broader range of forms of election interference. The UK, for instance, stated that covert operations that 'interfere with free and fair electoral processes' are a form of coercion,[125] while Costa Rica stated that launching disinformation campaigns and the dissemination of false news could constitute forms of unlawful electoral interference.\nAs noted above, the Common African Position did not identify a specific threshold at which non-forcible conduct amounts to coercion. Rather, the Common African Position noted that the definition of coercion requires further study among States, and explicitly rejected the thresholds that other States adopted in their position papers. The Common African Position stated: 'it is not necessary, in order to constitute coercion, that the conduct of a State must rise to the level of completely depriving a foreign State of its freedom of choice or to compel that State to either act or refrain from acting involuntarily'.[126]\nThis review of national and regional position papers reveals that there are three points of convergence among States on the question of the thresholds that delineate the boundaries of the prohibition on intervention. First, there is a consensus that the threat or use of force always crosses the threshold of coercion. Second, there is a consensus that non-intervention is a broad rule that covers both forcible and non-forcible forms of coercion. Third, there is a consensus that there are certain forms of conduct that, by their very nature, fall below the threshold of coercion. There is no consensus, however, on a specific list or catalogue of acts that are ipso facto non-coercive. However, given the positions expressed by Western States, it is reasonable to conclude that there is at least a general concurrence on the view expressed in the Common African Position that calls to settle disputes peacefully are not coercive. Beyond that, the main point of divergence among States relates to the threshold at which non-forcible conduct amounts to coercion. Indeed, as Canada noted: 'further\n\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\nState practice and opinio juris will help clarify the thresholds for the rule of non-intervention, and the scope of customary law in this area over time'.127\nThis is a question of paramount importance to understanding how non-intervention applies in cyberspace and other domains. As noted above, the utility of the prohibition on intervention is that it protects States against conduct that is more serious than an infringement on the territorial sovereignty of a State but that does not rise to the level of a threat or use of force. This issue – the threshold at which non-forcible conduct amounts to coercion – has not been addressed by the ICJ and remains a subject of scholarly debate.128\nSome scholars have argued that coercion is unsuited to function as an element of the prohibition on intervention, at least as it applies in cyberspace. For example, Duncan Hollis has opined that coercion may not be readily applicable to influence operations that use cyberspace to manipulate public opinion or disrupt the domestic political processes of a foreign State, such as Russia's interference in the 2016 US presidential election.129 Similarly, Ido Kilovaty has written that 'the norm of non-intervention, in its current narrow understanding, is almost irrelevant in a world where States increasingly resort to cyber operations as a method of interference [...] Coercion cannot contain the diversity of threats posed by new technologies. A new standard is, therefore, required'.130\nIn my view, we do not need a new standard. The challenge facing the application of the prohibition on intervention in cyberspace, and in other domains such as economic sanctions, is that there is no agreement among States on either the definition of coercion or on the minimum threshold of effects that must be met for conduct to constitute coercion. Any understanding of non-intervention must include a conceptual tool that distinguishes between unlawful intervention and lawful conduct that influences the policies of States. Whether that conceptual tool is called 'coercion', 'dictatorial interference',131\n\nHELAL\n‘imperative pressure’, ‘forcible compulsion or restraint’, or any other term is immaterial. What matters is the threshold of effects that defines and captures the essence of ‘coercion’, which can be applied to determine when specific conduct amounts to intervention. This is the question that Section 3 of this article addresses.\n## 3 Towards a Unified Threshold of Coercion\nIt is impossible, given the limitations of space, to comprehensively address the question of the threshold of coercion that applies to non-forcible conduct. This is a topic that requires further research. Nonetheless, in this section, this article will offer a general sketch of a threshold that could be employed to determine when non-forcible conduct amounts to coercion, thereby violating the prohibition on intervention. Specifically, this section proposes the adoption of a single, unified threshold of coercion that applies equally to both forcible and non-forcible intervention. According to this approach, non-forcible conduct would amount to coercion if its scale and effects are comparable to conduct that amounts to a violation of the prohibition on the threat or use of force.\nTwo considerations support this approach. The first is historical. Throughout its evolution, the prohibition on intervention was understood as a cognate of the prohibition on the threat or use of force. Non-intervention was designed to extend the protections afforded to States under the prohibition on the threat or use of force to non-forcible – but no less pernicious – instruments of statecraft. The second consideration is conceptual. The definitions of coercion that appear in national position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace that some States have issued impose an unreasonably high threshold of effects that must be met for non-forcible conduct to amount to an act of intervention. Defining coercion as causing a State to act ‘involuntarily’ or ‘depriving’ it of freedom of choice requires causing effects or\n R. Buchan and N. Tsagourias, ‘The Crisis in Crimea and the Principle of Non-Intervention’ (2017) 19 International Community Law Review 165–193, at 171 (‘Coercion denotes “imperative pressure” which manipulates the will of a state in order to extract some advantage or concession’).\n T. Gill, ‘Non-Intervention in the Cyber Context’ in K. Ziolkowski (ed.), *Peacetime Regime for State Activities in Cyberspace: International Law, International Relations and Diplomacy* (NATO CCD COE 2013) 217–238, at 223 (“Coercion” implies forcible compulsion or restraint’).\n Milanovic, ‘Revisiting Coercion as an Element of Prohibited Intervention in International Law’, at 607.\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\n\nBefore proceeding, one point merits special emphasis. The unified threshold of coercion that I propose here should not be understood as signaling that the prohibition on the use of force and the prohibition on intervention are coterminous. At least one writer has recently suggested that ‘under the *lex lata* the prohibition on intervention only applies to acts amounting to a use of force or constituting support for the violent overthrow of a foreign regime’. I disagree. As discussed below, at least since the adoption of the 1970 Friendly Relations Declaration, there has been a consensus among States that non-intervention is a broad rule that proscribes all forms of intervention, whether undertaken through forcible or non-forcible means. However, because there is no agreement among States on the meaning of coercion, there is continued uncertainty regarding when non-forcible conduct amounts to unlawful intervention. The unified threshold of coercion addresses this question by proposing a single test that applies to all forms of intervention, including armed force, or the use of political, economic, or informational instruments of statecraft, or some combination thereof.\n## 3.1 Coercion in the History of the Prohibition on Intervention\nAs argued in detail in another study by the present author, until the *Nicaragua Case* was decided by the ICJ in 1986, the concept of coercion was not defined, nor was it viewed as the cornerstone of the prohibition on intervention. Moreover, throughout its evolution, States never understood intervention as conduct that causes a State to act involuntarily or that deprives it of its freedom of choice or control over its domestic jurisdiction. This is why, to this writer, the definitions of coercion that States have included in their national and regional position papers should be viewed as proposals *de lege ferenda*, and not restatements of established *lex lata*. To substantiate this claim, this\n O. Pomson, ‘The Prohibition on Intervention Under International Law and Cyber Operations’ (2022) 99 International Law Studies 180–219, at 183.\n M. Helal, ‘Intervention, Force &amp; Coercion – An Historical Inquiry on the Evolution of the Prohibition on Intervention’ (2024) 103 International Law Studies (forthcoming).\nHELAL\nsection provides an overview of the terms and travaux préparatoires of the principal instruments in which the prohibition on intervention was codified. This overview begins with three Inter-American treaties that first included non-intervention as a distinct rule of international law, followed by the 1970 Friendly Relations Declaration, the adoption of which marked the acceptance of the prohibition on intervention as a rule of general international law.\nThe prohibition on intervention originated as a rule of conventional international law in the Inter-American system. It was first codified in Article 8 of the 1933 Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States, which reads as follows: 'No State has the right to intervene in the internal or external affairs of another'.[137] The prohibition on intervention was further reaffirmed and its scope was expanded with the adoption of the 1936 Additional Protocol Relative to Non-Intervention, Article I of which states: 'The High Contracting Parties declare inadmissible the intervention of any one of them, directly or indirectly, and for whatever reason, in the internal or external affairs of any other of the Parties'.[138]\nThe principal purpose of these provisions was to overturn the right of States to resort to acts of intervention, which was established under 19th century international law. At the time, States were permitted wage war or to engage in so-called measures short of war – i.e., acts of intervention – for an expansive range of reasons.[139] These included preserving the balance of power, repelling attacks against a State's territory, preempting an imminent armed attack, obtaining reparation for injuries inflicted on the interests or honor of the State, protecting the lives and property of citizens, securing the repayment of debts, and preventing mass atrocities.[140] Intervention was accepted as permissible\n\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\nbecause it was predicated on the right of self-preservation, which was recognized as a fundamental right of States. Given that they were often the target of forcible and non-forcible acts of intervention by the European powers and the United States, Latin American States and scholars championed the cause of codifying an absolute prohibition on intervention as a rule of international law in the Inter-American system. This objective was achieved with the adoption of the 1933 Montevideo Convention, the 1936 Non-Intervention Protocol, and the 1948 Charter of the Organization of American States, which included the broadest formulation of the prohibition on intervention.\nDuring the negotiations on the 1933 Montevideo Convention and the 1936 Non-Intervention Protocol, coercion was not defined; it was not identified as a constituent element of the prohibition on intervention, nor were acts of intervention understood as involving conduct that causes a State to behave involuntarily or that deprives a State of freedom of choice or control over its domain réservé. Indeed, the term 'coercion' does not even appear in either of these treaties. However, during the negotiations on the 1933 Montevideo Convention, a subcommittee composed of Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, Ecuador, El-Salvador, Haiti, and Peru that had been entrusted with drafting the convention prepared a report that provides an insight into how the negotiating parties understood the term 'intervention'. In its report, the subcommittee defined 'the juridical concept of intervention' as follows:\nAny act of a State, through diplomatic representation, by armed force, or by any other means involving effective force, with a view to making the State's will dominate the will of another State, and, in general, any maneuver, interference or interposition of any sort, employing such means, either directly or indirectly in matter of the obligations of another State, whatever its motive, shall be considered as Intervention, and likewise a violation of International Law.\nIt would seem quite unnecessary to state that the Sub-Committee was, and is, in perfect accord that any friendly act to offer good offices and\n\nHELAL\nmediation in the foreign relations of States in order to maintain peace is, by its very nature, outside the definition of intervention. This applies also to the united action of the formation of the League of Nations, the universal peace agent, of which the majority of the American States are members.^[146]^\nThe first sentence of this definition is instructive. The key phrase here is 'effective force with a view to making the State's will dominate the will of another State'. To this writer, it indicates that the drafters of the 1933 Montevideo Convention understood intervention as encompassing the use of armed force and any non-forcible conduct the effects of which are comparable to the use of force. This understanding of intervention was echoed by several States during the negotiations on the convention. Ecuador, for example stated: 'We have outlawed war. What is intervention but a kind of war, disguised and wary.'^[147]^ Argentina also stated: 'What is intervention, then, but violence? [...] Intervention is violence.'^[148]^ El Salvador also defined intervention in identical terms. It stated: 'Because the American conscience is such that territorial acquisitions originated by violence cannot be recognized; that violence has generally come to disturb the life of our countries in the form of intervention.'^[149]^ Peru shared this understanding of intervention. It argued in favor of adopting Article 8 of the 1933 Montevideo Convention because 'war is proscribed, so is violence, but not the use of arms, the diplomatic measures or any other means of effective compulsion.'^[150]^\nThe Charter of the Organization of American States, which was adopted in 1948,^[151]^ incorporated and expanded on the provisions on non-intervention in the 1933 Montevideo Convention and the 1936 Non-Intervention Protocol. Article 19 and 20 of the OAS Charter state:\n## Article 19\nNo State or group of States has the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatever, in the internal or external affairs of any other State. The foregoing principle prohibits not only armed force but also any\n\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\n\n## Article 20\nNo State may use or encourage the use of coercive measures of an economic or political character in order to force the sovereign will of another State and obtain from it advantages of any kind.\nArticle 19 of the OAS Charter includes two sentences, the first of which is virtually identical to Article 1 of 1936 Non-Intervention Protocol, which itself was based on Article 8 of the 1933 Montevideo Convention. Like its antecedents, the principal purpose of the first sentence of Article 19 was to reaffirm that, at least in Inter-American international law, the right of intervention that was recognized in 19th century international law was abolished. The inclusion of the phrase 'for whatever reason', which first appeared in the 1936 Non-Intervention Protocol, also indicated that non-intervention was an absolute rule that admitted no exceptions. Accordingly, the grounds that had previously been invoked to justify intervention – such as protecting citizens abroad, collecting debts, or enforcing international law – were no longer valid.\nThe second sentence of Article 19 clarified a principle that was only implicit in the 1933 Montevideo Convention and the 1936 Non-Intervention Protocol. It confirmed that non-intervention proscribed both the use of armed force and any other instrument of statecraft to engage in acts of intervention. Although, as noted above, the subcommittee that drafted the 1933 Montevideo Convention had affirmed that intervention could be undertaken 'through diplomatic representation, by armed force, or any other means involving effective force', this was not explicitly stated in either the 1933 Montevideo Convention or the 1936 Non-Intervention Protocol. The second sentence of Article 19 was also intended to prohibit acts of subversion that seek to impinge on the political independence of a State by subjugating it or transforming it into a satellite of a foreign power or that undermine its capacity to manage its political, economic, and cultural affairs autonomously.[152]\n\nHELAL\nArticle 20 of the OAS Charter is the first provision in which the term ‘coercion’ is used in relation to the prohibition on intervention. Coercion was not used, however, in order to signify the defining characteristic of intervention, nor was it designed to function as the conceptual tool that distinguishes between unlawful intervention and lawful conduct that seeks to influence the behavior of States. Rather, the authors of the OAS Charter drafted Article 20 with two objectives in mind. First, this provision was intended to proscribe economic sanctions that are imposed unilaterally by a State in response to an injury inflicted upon it by another State, and second, it was intended to outlaw the use of economic or political instruments of statecraft to pressure a State into giving concessions against its will. This becomes apparent from the negotiating history of Article 20.\nThis provision was formulated on the basis of two proposals that were submitted by Brazil and Cuba during the negotiations on the OAS Charter. The Cuban proposal stated: ‘No American State may unilaterally apply to another coercive measures of an economic nature that constitute retaliation or that tend to force the sovereign will of the State against which it is applied’. Similarly, the Brazilian proposal stated:\nIt is prohibited for a State to exercise or support economic or political pressure on any other, in order to obtain advantages of any nature from that other State, not including, however, in the category of pressure the sanctions adopted in accordance with a determination of a competent international body. The American State that feels that it is subjected to economic or political pressure from any other State, that State has the\nwas responsible and Colombia severed diplomatic relations with the USSR. This led the conference to adopt a resolution titled: ‘The Preservation and Defence of Democracy’ that condemned ‘interference by any foreign power, or by any political organization serving the interests of a foreign power, in the political life of the nations of the American continent’ and committed the member States of the OAS to take ‘the measures necessary to eradicate and prevent activities directed, assisted or instigated by foreign governments, organizations or individuals tending to overthrow their institutions by violence, to foment disorder in their domestic political life or to disturb, by means of pressure, subversive propaganda, threats or by any other means, the free and sovereign right of their peoples to govern themselves in accordance with their democratic aspirations’.

In its report the subcommittee explained the purpose of this provision as follows:\n[T]he two essential characteristics of the proposed text are the following: First, it condemns any action or attempted action that tends to force a State, despite its sovereignty, to adopt any attitude that State deems contrary to its interests; and second, such condemnation is in no way affected by the nature of the benefits sought by the State that exercises or encourages the coercive action. The members of the Subcommittee present were in complete agreement with the fact that the proposed text does not affect in any way the application of sanctions of an economic nature authorized by certain international organizations by virtue of current pacts.^[155]^\nThe negotiating history of the three Inter-American treaties in which the prohibition on intervention was first codified does not provide support for the definitions of coercion that many States have adopted in their national position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace. In fact, the concept of coercion was not even the subject of any in-depth discussions during the drafting of these treaties. Rather, the term coercion was only introduced in Article 20 of the OAS Charter specifically to outlaw the imposition of unilateral economic sanctions. Likewise, there is little in the negotiations on the principal instruments that were adopted on non-intervention by the UN that supports the definitions of coercion that appear in national position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace.\n^[154]^ Ibid., at 83.\n^[155]^ Novena Conferencia Internacional Americana, Actas y Documentos, Vol. II: Comisiones Reglamentarias, Comisión de Credenciales – Comisión de Iniciativas – Comisión de Coordinación – Comisión de Estilo (Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de Colombia 1953), at 387–388. It should be noted that during the negotiations on this provision, the US agreed that the unilateral imposition of economic sanctions is unlawful. See Ninth International Conference of American States, Bogotá, Colombia, March 30–May 2, 1948: Report of the Delegation of the United States of America with Related Documents (Department of State Publication No. 8262, November 1948) (In its official report on the proceedings of the Bogota Conference, the US delegation stated: ‘the principle that no nation should indulge in unilateral economic sanctions is, of course, valid’).\nHELAL\nAlthough the prohibition on intervention was not codified in the UN Charter, it was included in many instruments that were subsequently negotiated at the UN. These include the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the 1963 Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, the 1949 Declaration on the Rights and Duties and States and the 1954 Code of Offenses Against the Peace and Security of Mankind both of which were drafted by the International Law Commission, in addition to several General Assembly resolutions such as Resolution 31/91 on Non-Interference in the Internal Affairs of States, and the 1981 Declaration on the Inadmissibility of Intervention and Interference in the Internal Affairs of States. It is impossible in this article to provide a complete account of how the principle of non-intervention was articulated in these UN instruments. Therefore, I will focus here on the negotiations on non-intervention in the 1970 Friendly Relations Declaration, which contains the most authoritative expression of the prohibition on intervention.\nDuring the negotiations on the 1970 Friendly Relations Declaration and the 1965 Declaration on the Inadmissibility of Intervention in the Domestic Affairs of States, on which the section on non-intervention in the 1970 Friendly Relations Declaration was based, coercion was neither defined nor was it considered the distinguishing characteristic of intervention. Rather, the\n It is often mistakenly assumed that Article 2(7) of the UN Charter is a codification of the prohibition on intervention. It is not. This provision does not govern interstate relations. Rather, it applies to the conduct of the UN, as a distinct legal person, in its relations with its member States. See G. Nolte, ‘Purposes and Principles, Article 2(7)’ in B. Simma et al. (eds), The Charter of the United Nations: A Commentary (Oxford University Press 2012) 280–312, at 281 (Explaining that ‘[a]ccording to its text, Art. 2(7) protects only against acts of the UN and not against acts of other States’).\n Article 41(1) Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, at 95; Article 55(1) Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.\n UNGA Res. 375 (IV), ‘Draft Declaration on Rights and Duties of States’; UN ILC, Yearbook of the International Law Commission 1954, vol.

Initially, many (mostly Western) States answered this question in the affirmative. To those States, the prohibition on intervention was limited to proscribing the direct and indirect use of armed force by States. Conversely, Non-Aligned and Eastern Bloc States, insisted that non-intervention was a broader rule that prohibited all forms of the use of force and other non-forcible forms of conduct. Ultimately, the broader understanding of non-intervention was adopted. It was accepted that this rule outlawed the use of any instrument of statecraft – whether forcible or non-forcible – that may be employed to infringe on the domestic jurisdiction of States. There was, however, no attempt during these negotiations to formulate a threshold that determines when non-forcible conduct amounts to intervention. Instead, most States either identified specific forms of conduct that, in their view, amounted to intervention, or simply described intervention as the exertion of pressure against a State.\n 1964) UN Doc. A/AC.119/SR.28, at 5. Similarly, France stated: ‘any attempt to define intervention must cover [...] the idea of coercion, i.e., of abnormal or improper pressure exercised by one State on another State in order to force it to change its internal structure in a direction favorable to the interests of the State applying such coercion’. Ibid., at 10. Mexico also noted that, in addition to outlawing the use of force, the prohibition on intervention was designed to outlaw ‘coercive measures of an economic or political nature’. Mexico did not, however, offer a definition of coercion. Rather, it stated that in order to distinguish between lawful pressure and unlawful intervention the ‘criterion of the illegality of such coercion was the object sought’.

That text did not refer to coercion at all. Instead, it defined intervention as either the use of armed force or conduct 'of such design and effect as to impair or destroy the political independence or territorial integrity of another State'.[165] Those six States explained that the latter sentence was broadly synonymous to the phrase 'to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights' that appears in the 1970 Friendly Relations Declaration.[166] According to those States, their proposed formulation provided a better juridical expression of the scope and content of the prohibition on intervention.[167]\nof economic pressure'); UNGA, 'First Committee, 1422nd Meeting, Twentieth Session' (20 December 1965) UN Doc.

First, it would be incoherent to apply to non-forcible intervention that is undertaken through instruments such as information operations or economic sanctions a threshold of coercion that is higher than that which applies to the use of armed force, which is the gravest form of intervention. Second, even if one were to ignore the inconsistency between the thresholds of forcible and non-forcible intervention, the definitions of coercion that apply to the latter that some States have adopted are unreasonably high and severely restrict the scope of application of the prohibition on intervention. This section addresses these two points.\nAs noted above, virtually all position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace affirmed that the threat or use of force is *ipso facto* coercive. Many States also underscored that the use of force is the gravest form of coercion. This reflects the principle that the prohibition on the use of force is a peremptory rule of international law. Paradoxically, however, if, as many States propose, coercion is defined as conduct that causes a State to behave involuntarily or that deprives it of freedom of choice or control, non-forcible conduct would be governed by a higher threshold than that which applies to armed intervention. This is because, under *jus ad bellum*, the threshold of scale\njuridical language', and added that this proposal 'drew attention to the fact that no action of whatever character should be taken which would in any way impair or destroy the territorial integrity or political independence of States – ideas which were clearly recognized and defined in international law'. UNGA, '1966 Special Committee on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation Among States, Summary Record of the Fifteenth Meeting', at 11.\nHELAL\nand effects that must be met for an act to constitute a violation of the prohibition on the use of force is relatively low.\nThere is a general consensus among scholars that the prohibition on the use of force applies to conduct that has physical effects; that is conduct that, either directly or indirectly, causes 'death of or injury to persons, or damage to or destruction of property'.[168] Virtually all position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace endorsed this definition of the use of force.[169] However, there is no consensus on the de minimis threshold of scale and effects that must be met for conduct to be considered a violation of the prohibition on the use of force.[170] Some scholars have argued that there are cases of the use of force that do not, due to their limited scale and effects, amount to a use of force.[171] The Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on the Conflict in Georgia endorsed this view.[172] Conversely, other writers, contend that the\n\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\napplication of the prohibition on the use of force is not subject to a gravity threshold, which means that any use of force by one State against another State – regardless of its scale and effects – is governed by this rule.173 The ICJ has not taken a definitive position on this question.174\nWhatever position one takes on this matter, one thing is clear. The threshold that must be met for an act to constitute an instance of the use of force is low. Even the threshold for an armed attack, the gravest form of the use of force, is relatively low.175 As the International Law Association noted, 'it appears that the gravity threshold attached to armed attacks is not markedly high, and would include most uses of force likely to cause casualties or significant property damage'.176\nCompared to the threshold of the use of force, the definitions of coercion that many States have adopted in their national position papers impose a much higher threshold of coercion for non-forcible conduct. Nothing in *jus ad bellum* requires the use of force to be of such gravity that it *significantly influences* or *thwarts* the decision-making processes of a State to the extent that its will is *manifestly bent*, which is the definition of coercion adopted by Germany. Similarly, *jus ad bellum* does not require the State to be subjected to a level of compulsion that causes it to 'act in an involuntary manner or to refrain from acting in a certain manner', which is the definition of coercion adopted by Estonia and several other States. Nor is it necessary under *jus ad bellum* for a State to be exposed to such pressure that *deprives* it of freedom of choice or *compels* or *imposes* an outcome on the State, which is the definition of coercion adopted by Canada.\n\nHELAL\nIn addition to the incongruence of having a threshold of coercion for non-forcible intervention that is higher than that which applies to forcible intervention, the definitions of coercion that some States have adopted impose an unreasonably high threshold for non-forcible conduct. To meet the threshold of causing a State to act involuntarily or to deprive it of freedom of choice or control over its domestic jurisdiction, the conduct of the coercing State must be of such intensity that it overwhelms the coerced State and leaves it with no viable choice but to submit to the demands of the coercing State. In both jurisprudence and philosophy, involuntariness is generally understood as being a situation where an actor lacks a meaningful choice or has no reasonable alternative but to comply with the demands of another actor. Applying these definitions would significantly reduce the scope of the prohibition on intervention, thereby permitting a wide-range of non-forcible conduct both in cyberspace and beyond.\nTake the definition of coercion in Canada's national position paper on the application of international law in cyberspace. As noted above, Canada defined coercion as conduct that compels or imposes an outcome on the affected State or deprives it of its freedom of choice. Canada also provided the following example of an act of unlawful intervention in an election: '[a]n\n The definitions of coercion adopted by most States (coercion as conduct that causes a State to act involuntarily and coercion as conduct that deprives a State of freedom of choice or control) appear to echo the definition of coercion that the ILC adopted in its Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts. The ILC stated that coercion 'has the same essential character as force majeure', which it defined as a situation where the conduct of a State is 'involuntary or at least involves no element of free choice'. As the ILC explained, the degree of pressure required for a State to be placed in a position where its conduct is 'involuntary' or lacking the 'element of free choice' is one of 'irresistible force'. To be clear, States have not cited the Articles on State Responsibility as an authority to support their definitions of coercion. Nonetheless, there is a striking resemblance between the ILC's definition of coercion and the definitions adopted by many States in their position papers. In my view, this is a threshold of pressure that is far higher than anything required by the jus ad bellum. For the ILC's discussion of the concepts of coercion and force majeure, see UN ILC, 'Report of the International Law Commission: Fifty-Third Session' (23 April–1 June and 2 July–10 August 2001) GAOR 56th Session Supp. 10 (A/56/10), at 69, 77–78.\n The literature of coercion and voluntariness in both law and philosophy is vast and varied. Nonetheless, there is general agreement among scholars in these fields that an agent will be deemed to have behaved involuntarily if they were left with no viable or meaningful choice. See generally T. Honoré, 'A Theory of Coercion' (1990) 10 Oxford Journal of Legal Studies 94–105; M. Alvarez, 'The Concept of Voluntariness' (2016) 7 Jurisprudence 665–671; S. Olsaretti, 'Voluntariness, Coercion, Self-Ownership' in D. Schmidtz and C. Pavel (eds), The Oxford Handbook of Freedom (Oxford University Press 2018) 439–455.\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\nexample of a prohibited intervention would be a malicious cyber activity that hacks and disables a State's election commission days before an election, preventing a significant number of citizens from voting, and ultimately influencing the election outcome.[179]\nUnder this definition, almost all of the conduct that appears in a recent report published by a commission established by the Canadian government to investigate foreign interference in Canadian elections would not be wrongful under the prohibition on intervention.[180] The report, which is titled Public Inquiry into Foreign Interference in Federal Electoral Processes and Democratic Institutions, noted that foreign interference did not determine the outcome of the election. The report did, however, state the following:\nThe fact that foreign interference may not have impacted the outcomes in many ridings does not mean, however, that it did not impact the election. Foreign interference in 2019 and 2021 undermined the right of voters to have an electoral ecosystem free from coercion or covert influence. Foreign interference has an impact when there is a single instance where a ballot is cast in a certain way, or not cast at all, because of a foreign state's direct or indirect enticement.[181]\nThe report added that this foreign interference affected the electoral ecosystem and had the overall effect of '[u]ndermining faith in democracy and government' and led to a 'reduced trust in Canada's democratic process'.[182] Under Canada's definition of coercion, this conduct would not be unlawful. The foreign interference catalogued in this report did not impose any particular choice on Canada nor did it significantly affect the outcome of an election. Likewise, this conduct would not meet the threshold of causing a State to act involuntarily. Nonetheless, the political effects of foreign interference of this nature are serious, especially in the long-term. Failing to proscribe conduct of this nature would turn the prohibition on intervention into a normative empty shell that provides little protection to States and would permit a broad range of disruptive non-forcible behavior.\nHELAL\nThis is why I believe that the Common African Position was right to define coercion as conduct that is designed 'to impose restraints on the will of a foreign state', which is a markedly lower threshold than that proposed by other States. The question, however, is what exactly does 'imposing restraints' entail and at what point can one say that the exertion of pressure on a State has reached the point of 'imposing restraints' on its will?\nTo this writer – and I must emphasize that this is the author's view, not that of the member States of the African Union – the threshold of coercion for non-forcible conduct should be defined as being comparable to the minimum effects of conduct that amounts to a threat or use of force. In other words, for non-forcible conduct – such as political, economic, or informational measures – to amount to intervention, the effects of the conduct in question should be comparable to that which is entailed by the threat or use of force. I call this the unified threshold of coercion. The practical effect of adopting the unified threshold of coercion is that any non-forcible conduct that causes effects on a scale that is comparable to conduct that amounts to a violation of the prohibition on the threat or use of force would constitute a breach of the prohibition on intervention.\nTo further explain, other reports by the Canadian government provide understandings of foreign interference that, to this writer, approximates the degree of effects that would meet the unified threshold of coercion, thereby amounting to a breach of the prohibition on intervention. In one report published by the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians, foreign interference was defined in the following terms: '[f]oreign interference involves foreign states, or persons/entities operating on their behalf, attempting to covertly influence decisions, events or outcomes to better suit their strategic interests'.[183] This report also stated: 'foreign interference includes attempts to covertly influence, intimidate, manipulate, interfere, corrupt or discredit individuals, organizations and governments to further the interests of a foreign country'.[184] It also underscored that 'foreign interference should be understood as a long-term effort, akin to espionage, using inducements or threats. Both dynamics enable the manipulation of targets when required, for example, through requests for inappropriate or special favours'.[185] This report\n\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\nprovided examples of behavior that would not amount to unlawful intervention. These include:\nForeign interference activities are distinct from acceptable diplomatic advocacy and lobbying. The latter activities are known to the host state and occur through recognized channels to achieve specific policy outcomes or objectives. It is normal for foreign diplomats in Canada, for example, to reach out to elected officials across the political spectrum, to pressure policymakers, to use local media to promote their national interests or to engage with and support domestic organizations.^[186]^\nAn earlier report, also published by the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians of Canada, states the following: '[f]oreign interference activities can include using deceptive means to cultivate relationships with elected officials and others perceived to processes influence in the political process; seek to influence the reporting of Canadian media outlets; seek, in some cases, to affect the outcome of elections; and coerce or induce diaspora communities to advance foreign interests in Canada'.^[187]^ The understandings of foreign interference in these reports are palpably broader than the definition of coercion in most national position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace, including Canada's. To this writer, these reports describe the kinds of conduct that were intended to be covered by the Common African Position, and which would be covered by the unified threshold of coercion proposed here.\nTwo considerations lend support to this understanding of coercion. First, adopting a unified threshold of coercion that applies to both forcible and non-forcible intervention is consistent with the history of the evolution of the prohibition on intervention. Throughout the negotiations on instruments in which non-intervention was codified, States consistently viewed acts of intervention as being analogous to the use of force.^[188]^ For example, as noted above, the drafters of the 1933 Montevideo Convention described intervention\n\nHELAL\nas any act that amounts to 'effective force'. It indicates that the authors of the Montevideo Convention understood non-forcible intervention to be the functional equivalent of armed force.\nMoreover, during the debates on the Montevideo Convention, several Latin American States underscored that non-intervention was closely associated to the prohibition on the use of force. For example, Argentina stated: 'What is intervention, then, but violence? [...] Intervention is violence.'[189] El Salvador also affirmed that '[b]ecause the American conscience is such that territorial acquisitions originated by violence cannot be recognized; that violence has generally come to disturb the life of our countries in the form of intervention'.[190] Peru also emphasized that 'war is proscribed, so is violence, but not the use of arms, the diplomatic measures or any other means of effective compulsion'.[191] Ecuador also highlighted that '[w]hat is intervention but a kind of war, disguised and wary' and argued that, having outlawed aggression pursuant to the 1933 Anti-War Treaty of Non-Aggression and Conciliation, it was only natural for the States of the western hemisphere to proscribe intervention.[192] Similarly, during the negotiations on the OAS Charter, Cuba called economic coercion 'treacherous, silent, and underhanded aggression'.[193]\nMany States expressed similar views during the negotiations on both the 1965 Declaration on Non-Intervention and the 1970 Friendly Relations Declaration. For example, Guinea described intervention as a 'more pernicious' form of aggression,[194] Trinidad and Tobago called it 'subtle and insidious' aggression,[195] and the Congo argued that non-intervention covered 'political pressure, subversive activities, and other acts of aggression'.[196] Furthermore, throughout debates on non-intervention at the UN, many States frequently described non-intervention as being derivable from or a corollary of the non-use of force.[197] In short, in addition to outlawing intervention through armed\n\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\nforce, the prohibition on intervention was designed to protect States against non-forceful conduct that was viewed as being functionally equivalent to the use of force – i.e., conduct that entailed a degree of pressure that is comparable to the use of armed force.\nIn addition to being consistent with the historical evolution of non-intervention, adopting a unified threshold of coercion that applies to all forms of intervention reflects the fact that non-intervention and the non-use of force share the same policy purpose. The ICJ has stated that ‘a rule of international law, whether customary or conventional, does not operate in a vacuum; it operates in relation to facts and in the context of a wider framework of legal rules of which it forms only a part’. Writing in more colorful terms, James Crawford observed that ‘customary rules usually hunt in packs, connected by some familial relationship and interacting with each other’.\nNon-intervention and the non-use of force belong to the same normative ‘pack’. These rules are part of what scholars call the ‘law of coexistence’, the policy purpose of which is to protect the autonomy of States and enable them to coexist peacefully in an anarchic international system. Specifically, these two rules – non-intervention and the non-use of force – are designed to protect the physical and functional manifestations of sovereignty. These two ‘domains’ of sovereignty – the physical and the functional – are expressed by the concepts of the ‘territorial integrity’ and ‘political independence’ of States, which appear in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. Non-intervention extended the\nSR.31, at 11 (Yugoslavia: non-intervention is a ‘natural corollary of Article 2(4)’ of the UN Charter); UNGA, ‘Special Committee on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation Among States, First Session, Summary Records of the Thirtieth Meeting’, at 5–6 (Mexico: Article 2(4) is among the provisions of the Charter that provided ‘a solid and irrefutable basis’ for non-intervention).\n Interpretation of the Agreement of 25 March 1951 Between the WHO and Egypt (Advisory Opinion) [20 December 1980] ICJ Rep. 73, at para. 10.\n J. Crawford, Chance, Order, Change: The Course of International Law, General Course on Public International Law (Brill Nijhoff 2014), at 56.\n G. Abi-Saab, ‘Whither the International Community?’ (1998) 9 European Journal of International Law 248–265, at 254.\n ‘Political independence’ refers to ‘the autonomy in the affairs of the State with respect to its institutions, freedom of political decisions, policy making, and in matters pertaining to its domestic and foreign affairs’. See S. Blay, ‘Territorial Integrity and Political Independence’ in R. Wolfrum (ed.), Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law (Oxford University Press 2010), available at <https: 10.1093=\"\" display=\"\" law=\"\" law:epil=\"\" opil.ouplaw.com=\"\" 9780199231690=\"\" 99231690-e1116=\"\"> (accessed 17 July 2024), at para. 1. ‘Territorial integrity’ is not limited to prohibiting forceful changes to the boundaries of a State. It protects the physical space within which a State exercises political independence against outside intrusion or trespass. See C. Marxsen, ‘Territorial Integrity in International</https:>\nHELAL\nprotection afforded to the territorial integrity and political independence of States against the threat or use of force to all other instruments of statecraft that could be employed to achieve the same objectives, especially that such non-forcible intervention often has the potential to achieve greater harm to States than the threat or use of force.\nTo be clear, the unified threshold of coercion proposed here should not be read as suggesting that non-intervention is coterminous with the prohibition on the threat or use of force. Far from it. Although both rules share the same policy purposes, the prohibition on intervention is broader than the prohibition on the threat or use of force. Non-intervention applies to any policy or practice, whether forcible and non-forcible, that impinges on the political independence or territorial integrity of States. In a sense, therefore, the prohibition on the threat or use of force should be viewed as a *lex specialis* that applies to a specific genus of intervention (namely, *armed* intervention). This body of *lex specialis* has been subsumed, *in toto*, within the broader *lex generalis* of the prohibition on intervention.\nIn conclusion, further research and further expressions of State views are needed on the definition and threshold of coercion. This is essential to understanding how the prohibition on intervention applies to and governs non-forcible conduct both in cyberspace and beyond. To this writer, however, the unified threshold of coercion that this article proposes provides a conceptual foundation on which to formulate a workable and conceptually coherent approach to applying the prohibition on intervention.\n Law – Its Concept and Implications for Crimea' (2015) 75 Zeitschrift für ausländisches öffentliches Recht und Völkerrecht 7–26, at 10. As Georges Abi-Saab wrote: 'The international legal system is based at present as in the past, on two fundamental principles that determine its structure and functioning, namely, the sovereignty and equality of States [...] The principal legal consequence of this structural or rather structuring principle is to commit each State to a general obligation to respect the sovereignty of others; in other words, not to trespass on the territorial and functional ambits of this sovereignty. The most flagrant manifestation of such trespass is the threat or use of force against the State. But it is not the only one. Other, less blatant, forms exist varying in their degree of visibility and intensity. It is precisely the rest of this continuum, beyond the use of force, which is covered by the principle of non-intervention'. G. Abi-Saab, 'Some Thoughts on the Principle of Non-Intervention' in K. Wellens (ed.), *International Law: Theory and Practice: Essays in Honour of Eric Suy* (Brill Nijhoff 1998) 225–236.\n T. Kliem, 'You Can't Cyber in Here, This is the War Room!

This article also specifically discusses the views of States on the threshold of coercion, which is the degree of harm or the effects that the conduct of a State must cause (or threaten to cause) to amount to a violation of the prohibition on intervention. This article argues that the definitions and thresholds of coercion that States have adopted in debates on the application of international law in cyberspace should be viewed as proposals for the development of the law in this area, as opposed to restatements of established law. Instead, this article proposes that all forms of intervention should be governed by a ‘unified threshold of coercion’ that applies to both forcible and non-forcible intervention.\n## Keywords\nprohibition on intervention – cyberspace – coercion – prohibition on the threat or use of force\n© KONINKLIJKE BRILL BV, LEIDEN, 2024 | DOI:10.1163/18757413_02701019\nHELAL\n# 1 Introduction\nIt is undisputed that the prohibition on intervention is a rule of customary international law.¹ This rule is also codified in numerous conventions, including the founding instruments of several regional organizations.² Non-intervention was also applied by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in several cases,³ the most important of which is the Nicaragua Case.⁴ This rule was also reaffirmed in many UN General Assembly resolutions,⁵ the most notable of which is the 1970 Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Co-Operation Among States in Accordance with the Charter of the United Nations ('1970 Friendly Relations Declaration').⁶ The prohibition on intervention also appears in the 1949 Declaration on the Rights and Duties of States and the 1954 Code of Offenses Against the Peace and Security of Mankind which were adopted by the International Law Commission (ILC).⁷\n1.

States from every region and from every political bloc have accused their adversaries (and sometimes even their allies) of intervening in their affairs.\nIn recent years, there has been a growing interest among States and scholars in the principle of non-intervention. One reason is that cyberspace has become a domain of conflict and competition. Information and communication technologies (ICTs) are being used both as weapons of war and as instruments of non-forcible intervention. States, state-sponsored non-State actors, and non-State groups and individuals acting independently have employed ICTs against foreign States, citizens, and companies to achieve various political, economic, criminal, scientific, and financial objectives. ICTs have been used to disrupt critical infrastructure, spread disinformation and propaganda to sow social discord, interfere in elections, acquire industrial and trade secrets, steal scientific research and intellectual property, and to gain profit through activities such as ransomware attacks. As a result, there is a growing corpus of state practice and expressions of opinio juris, in addition to a sizable body of scholarship, on how the prohibition on intervention applies in cyberspace. This article engages with these discussions.\nSpecifically, this article has two objectives. First, it explores how States have defined the concept of coercion, which is considered a core component of\n8 See for example UNSC, 'Letter from the Chief of the Delegation of Iran to the President of the Security Council' (26 January 1946) UN Doc.

For instance, I will not delineate the exact areas of state policy that non-intervention protects, which have been variously referred to as 'internal and external affairs', 'internal affairs', 'domestic jurisdiction', and 'domain réservé'. Other issues that I will be unable to address here include the</https:></https:>\nHELAL\nthe prohibition on intervention.¹¹ It also examines how States have demarcated the boundary between, on one hand, the prohibition on intervention and, on the other, the obligation to respect the territorial sovereignty of States and the prohibition on the threat or use of force, which are two rules that are closely associated with the prohibition on intervention.\nThis article will do so by surveying national and regional position papers that States have issued in recent years on the application of international law in cyberspace in which States have outlined their views on the scope and content of the prohibition on intervention and on how it governs the conduct of States in cyberspace. These position papers were issued, at least partially, in response to calls by the UN Open-Ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (OEWG) for States to express their opinions on how international law applies in cyberspace.¹² The OEWG is one of the two principal forums in which discussions at the UN on the regulation of cyberspace are conducted, the other being the UN Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security (GGE).¹³\nIn addition to being of interest to scholars who specialize in the regulation of cyberspace, these national and regional position papers also deserve special attention from generalist scholars of international law. Most of these position papers are not framed as expressions of State views on *lex specialis* that apply only in cyberspace. Rather, they contain detailed statements on the scope and content of a wide range of *lex generalis* followed by discussions on how these rules of general international law apply in cyberspace. This makes these position papers a rich source of *opinio juris* on various primary and secondary rules\n¹¹ p. 11 A. Tzanakopoulos, ‘The Right to be Free from Economic Coercion’ (2015) 4 Cambridge Journal of International Law 616–633, at 620 (‘Coercion is a method of illegal intervention [...] coercion is intervention. Seeking to coerce a state within its sphere of freedom is wrongful; it constitutes intervention’).\n¹² UNGA, ‘Open-Ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security – Final Substantive Report’ (10 March 2021) UN Doc.

(The OEWG recommended that ‘States, on a voluntary basis, continue to inform the Secretary-General of their national views and assessments on how international law applies to their use of ICTs in the context of international security, and continue to voluntarily share such national views and practices through other avenues as appropriate’).\n¹³ See C. Painter, ‘The United Nations’ Cyberstability Processes: Surprising Progress but Much Left to Do’ (2021) 6 Journal of Cyber Policy 271–276.\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\nof international law, many of which are foundational to the international legal order. Some of the rules covered by these position papers include sovereignty, the prohibition on the threat or use of force, the peaceful settlement of disputes, human rights, the laws of armed conflict, the rules of attribution, and of course, the prohibition on intervention, which is the subject of this article.\nExamining these national and regional position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace reveals that, while the prohibition on intervention is accepted as a rule of general international law, there remains considerable uncertainty regarding the exact scope and content of this rule. In particular, there are notable differences among States on the definition of coercion. Some States have defined coercion as conduct that modifies the behavior of a State by causing it to act involuntarily or by compelling it to act in a manner that it would not have voluntarily engaged in but for the coercive conduct of a foreign State. Other States have defined coercion as conduct that deprives a State of its freedom of choice or control over matters within its domestic jurisdiction. A third and broader approach, which was adopted by the African Union, defines coercion as any conduct that imposes restraints on the will of a foreign State.\nIn addition to articulating theoretical definitions of coercion, some States provided examples of conduct that, in their view, amounted to coercion. These examples shed further light on how the concept of coercion applies to real-world situations in which ICTs are used as instruments of statecraft. In particular, these examples clarify the views of States on the threshold of effects or the degree of pressure that a State must be subjected to in order for conduct to be considered coercive. As I show below, there is currently no consensus among States on the effects that the conduct of the coercing State must have on the coerced State to constitute an act of unlawful intervention. Some States adopted relatively high thresholds that require the conduct in question to have significant effects on the coerced State. For example, for some States, merely seeking to sway public opinion during an election campaign does not necessarily amount to unlawful intervention. Rather, to those States, electoral interference must rise to the level of altering election results or preventing a segment of the population from voting in order to constitute an act of intervention. On the other hand, other States adopted lower thresholds to determine when\n14 See for example P. Ney, ‘DOD General Counsel Remarks at US Cyber Command Legal Conference’ (2 March 2020) US Department of Defense, available at <https: 2099378=\"\" article=\"\" dod-general-counsel-remarks-at-us-cyber-command-legal-conference=\"\" news=\"\" speech=\"\" www.defense.gov=\"\"></https:> (Arguing that ‘a cyber operation by a State that interferes with another country’s ability to hold an election or that tampers with another country’s election results would be a clear violation of the rule of non-intervention’); Canadian Government, ‘International Law Applicable in Cyberspace’ (22 April 2022),\nHELAL\nelectoral interference could be deemed coercive. For example, one State noted that 'hack and leak' operations to influence public opinion could constitute a violation of the prohibition on intervention.¹⁵ The African Union also adopted a relatively low threshold of coercion that does not require the behavior of a foreign State to have significant effects on a State in order to amount to unlawful intervention.\nIn short, national and regional position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace indicate that there are divergences among States on how the prohibition on intervention governs state conduct in cyberspace. There is no agreement on a theoretical definition of coercion, there is no consensus on the threshold of effects that determines when specific state conduct that is designed to influence the behavior of other States constitutes coercion, and there is some uncertainty on how non-intervention relates to other rules such as the prohibition on the threat or use of force and the obligation to respect the territorial sovereignty of States.\nHaving catalogued the views that States have, heretofore, expressed on non-intervention and coercion in cyberspace, the second objective of this article is to critically appraise the understandings of coercion that States have adopted in their national and regional position papers. Specifically, this article makes the following two arguments.\nFirst, this article contends that – as a matter of formal law – the positions expressed by States on the meaning of coercion should be viewed as proposals de lege ferenda, and not as restatements of established lex lata. This is because, as I explain below, nothing in the history of the development of the prohibition of intervention lends support to the definitions of coercion that States have espoused. Non-intervention first emerged in the early 20th century as a rule\n¹⁵ available at <https: issues_development-enjeux_developpement=\"\" peace_security-paix_security=\"\" eyberspace_law-cyberespace_droit.aspx?lang=\"eng\" world-monde=\"\" www.international.gc.ca=\"\"> ('An example of a prohibited intervention would be a malicious cyber activity that hacks and disables a State's election commission days before an election, preventing a significant number of citizens from voting, and ultimately influencing the election outcome').\nUNGA, 'Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions on the Subject of How International Law Applies to the Use of Information and Communications Technologies by States Submitted by Participating Governmental Experts in the Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security Established Pursuant to General Assembly Resolution 73/226' (13 July 2021) UN Doc. A/76/136 ('Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions'), at 69 (Norway: 'unduly influencing public opinion through the dissemination of confidential information obtained through cyber operations (\"hack and leak\"), would be in violation of the prohibition of intervention').</https:>\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\nof Inter-American conventional international law. Then, building on decades of advocacy principally by non-aligned States, the prohibition on intervention became a rule of general international law with the adoption of the 1970 Friendly Relations Declaration. However, at no point during the evolution of the prohibition on intervention did States define coercion as conduct that causes a State to behave involuntarily or that deprives a State of its freedom of choice or control over matters within its domestic jurisdiction. Indeed, the history of the development of this rule indicates that States never even conceived of coercion as the conceptual cornerstone of non-intervention.\nSecond, this article argues that the definitions of coercion adopted by some States are conceptually flawed. Echoing the ICJ's judgment in the Nicaragua Case,¹⁶ virtually all States agree that the prohibition on intervention proscribes coercion whether undertaken through armed force or through non-forcible means, such as economic or political instruments of statecraft. Many States also underscored that the use of armed force is the gravest form of intervention. Yet – paradoxically – applying the definitions of coercion espoused by many (especially Western) States would lead to a situation where the gravest form of intervention – armed force – is governed by a lower threshold than non-forcible forms of intervention that are considered less grave.\nAs discussed below, nothing in *jus ad bellum* requires an act that amounts to armed intervention to be of such gravity that it causes a State to behave involuntarily or deprives it of control over matters within its domestic jurisdiction, which are the definitions of coercion adopted by some States. Indeed, attacking a single military unit could constitute a violation of the prohibition on the threat or use of force and could even amount to an armed attack,¹⁷ regardless of its effect on the behavior of the target State. On the other hand, applying the definitions of coercion adopted by some States would require non-forcible forms of intervention to reach a level of gravity and intensity that causes (or threatens to cause) a State to act involuntarily or that deprives it of freedom of choice. As I explain below, these definitions entail an unreasonably high\n¹⁶ Nicaragua v. USA, at para. 215 ('Intervention is wrongful when it uses methods of coercion in regard to such choices, which must remain free ones. The element of coercion, which defines, and indeed forms the very essence of, prohibited intervention, is particularly obvious in the case of an intervention which uses force, either in the direct form of military action, or in the indirect form of support for subversive or terrorist armed activities within another State').\n¹⁷ As the ICJ noted in the *Oil Platforms Case*, '[t]he Court does not exclude the possibility that the mining of a single military vessel might be sufficient to bring into play the \"inherent right of self-defence\". *Oil Platforms* (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America) (Judgment)  ICJ Rep. 161, at para. 72.\nHELAL\nthreshold of effects for non-forcible intervention that is significantly higher than that which applies to forcible intervention.\nTherefore, this article argues that States and scholars should consider adopting what I call the 'unified threshold of coercion' that applies to both forcible and non-forcible intervention. Based on this approach, non-forcible conduct would be considered coercive if its impact is comparable to the scale and effects of conduct that amounts to a violation of the threat or use of force. This unified threshold of coercion is lower than the thresholds of coercion that many States have adopted in their position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace.\nThis article consists of two sections. Section 1 provides a survey of the definitions of coercion that appear in national and regional position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace. This section also outlines the views of States on the interconnection between non-intervention and the prohibition on the use of force and the obligation to respect state sovereignty, which is a debate that sheds further light on the kinds of conduct that each of these rules applies to and regulates. Then in Section 2, this article critically appraises the understandings of coercion adopted by States and argues in favor of adopting what I call the 'unified threshold of coercion' that applies equally to both forcible and non-forcible forms of intervention.\n## 2 Intervention and Coercion in Cyberspace\nNational and regional position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace unanimously affirmed that non-intervention is an established rule of international law that applies in cyberspace.

Three approaches to defining coercion have appeared in these position papers.\n## 2.1 Coercion as Conduct that Modifies the Behavior of a State\nThe first approach defines coercion as conduct that compels a State to modify its behavior. Among the States that adopted this approach, there were slight variations in the exact definition of coercion that those States formulated. Some States defined coercion as acts that aim to compel a State to act involuntarily. Estonia's position paper expressed this view. It stated:\nWhen discussing if a cyber operation constitutes an unlawful intervention into the external or internal affairs of another state, the element of coercion is a key factor [...] Stemming from that, cyber operations that aim to force another nation to act in an involuntary manner or to refrain from acting in a certain manner, and target the other nation's domaine réservé (e.g., national democratic processes such as elections, or military, security or critical infrastructure systems) could constitute such an intervention.²³\nAustria's national statement was similar to Estonia's. It stated: '[c]oercion occurs when a state seeks to compel another state to change its behaviour with respect to its internal or external affairs, i.e. to force that state to act in an involuntary manner or involuntarily refrain from acting in a particular way'.²⁴ Some States that adopted this understanding of coercion also included a 'but for' test in their definition of coercion. According to those States, an act would be coercive if it aimed at compelling a State to behave in a manner that it would not otherwise have engaged in voluntarily. Norway's position paper expressed this view:\ncoercion, and thus of unauthorized intervention, has not yet fully crystallized in international law [...] there is no clear definition of the element of coercion').\n²³ UNGA, 'Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions', at 25.\n²⁴ Austrian Government, 'Position Paper of the Republic of Austria: Cyber Activities and International Law' (April 2024), available at <https: docs-library.unoda.org=\"\" open-ended_working_group_on_information_and_communication_technologies_-_(2021)=\"\" open-end_working_group_on_information_and_communication_technologies_-_(2021)=\"\" /austrian_position_Paper_-_cyber_activities_and_international_law_(final_23.04.2024).pdf=\"\">, at 5.</https:>\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\n[A] State must not carry out cyber operations in breach of the prohibition of intervention, according to customary international law. A cyber operation must therefore not be carried out to compel the target State to take a course of action, whether by act or omission, in a way that it would not otherwise voluntarily have pursued (coercion) in matters relating to its internal or external affairs (domaine réservé).25\nThe Netherlands adopted a similar position. It defined coercion as an act 'compelling a state to take a course of action (whether an act or an omission) that it would not otherwise voluntarily pursue. The goal of the intervention must be to effect change in the behavior of the target state'.26 Denmark also defined coercion as an act that 'has a potential for compelling the target state to engage in an action that it would otherwise not take'.27 Switzerland and Poland also used similar terms. To Switzerland, coercion is conduct that 'seeks to cause another to act (or refrain from acting) in a way it would not otherwise',28 and Poland stated that coercion 'aims at influencing the state's decisions belonging to its domaine réservé', and added that cyberoperations 'potentially leading to the state's conduct that would not occur otherwise, may be considered a prohibited intervention'.29\nOther States that understood coercion as conduct that is designed to modify the behavior of another State used relatively generic terms to define coercion. Romania, for example, defined coercion simply as an act the purpose of which is to 'effectively change the behavior of the target state'.30 Israel's Deputy Attorney General also opined that coercion 'has been taken to mean that State A cannot take actions to \"coerce\" State B in pursuing a course of action, or refraining from a course of action, in matters pertaining to State B's core internal affairs'.31 Singapore's national statement defined coercion in similar terms. It stated that a cyberoperation may violate the prohibition on intervention if it amounted to an 'attempt to coerce our government to take or forebear\n25 UNGA, 'Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions', at 68.\n26 Ibid., at 57.\n27 Danish Government, 'Denmark's Position Paper on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace', at 450.\n28 UNGA, 'Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions', at 87.\n29 Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 'The Republic of Poland's Position on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace'.\n30 Ibid., at 77.\n31 R. Schöndorf, 'Israel's Perspective on Key Legal and Practical Issues Concerning the Application of International Law to Cyber Operations' (2021) 97 International Law Studies 395-406, at 403.\nHELAL\na certain course of action on a matter ordinarily within its sovereign prerogative'.32 Italy's national statement used almost identical terms. It asserted that 'a State employs coercive means to compel another State to undertake or desist from a specific action, in matters falling under its domain réserve'.33 In other words, for these States, an act is coercive simply if it is intended to cause another State to change its behavior. These States did not, however, explicitly include a requirement that the conduct in question must compel a State to act involuntarily or force it to engage in behavior that it would not have engaged in voluntarily but-for the coercive conduct of a foreign State.\nGermany adopted a generally similar understanding of coercion. Although it did not refer to modifying the behavior of a State or causing it to act involuntarily, Germany described coercion as the exercise of a certain level of pressure that has a significant impact on the decision-making process of a State to the extent that it manipulates or undermines the will of the State. Germany's position paper stated the following:\nGenerally, Germany is of the opinion that cyber measures may constitute a prohibited intervention under international law if they are comparable in scale and effects to coercion in non-cyber contexts.\nCoercion implies that a State's internal processes regarding aspects pertaining to its domaine réservé are significantly influenced or thwarted and that its will is manifestly bent by the foreign State's conduct. However, as is widely accepted, the element of coercion must not be assumed prematurely. Even harsher forms of communication such as pointed commentary and sharp criticism as well as (persistent) attempts to obtain, through discussion, a certain reaction or the performance of a certain measure from another State do not as such qualify as coercion. Moreover, the acting State must intend to intervene in the internal affairs of the target State – otherwise the scope of the non-intervention principle would be unduly broad.34\nDespite these variations in the exact formulation of these definitions, these understandings of coercion share the common characteristic of focusing on\n32 UNGA, ‘Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions’, at 83.\n33 Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, ‘Italian Position Paper on “International Law and Cyberspace”’ (2021), available at <https: 11=\"\" doc=\"\" italian_position_paper_on_international_law_and_cyberspace.pdf=\"\" machine=\"\" research=\"\" www.esteri.it=\"\" 2021=\"\">, at 4–5.\n34 UNGA, ‘Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions’, at 34.</https:>\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\nthe desire of the coercing State to alter the behavior of another State.

'These definitions point to undermining the victim state's will as the essence of coercion (\"involuntary,\" \"voluntary\"), so as to effect a change in its behavior'.35\nSeveral States that adopted this definition of coercion also provided examples of conduct that, in their view, amounted to intervention. As noted above in the introduction to this article, these examples provide greater clarity on how States operationalize and apply the definitions of coercion that they adopted. In its position paper, Finland position paper identified the following forms of coercion:\n[W]hile the conduct of elections belongs undisputedly to the internal affairs of each State, all methods of electoral interference do not display the element of coercion. Hacking of voter databases or manipulation of vote counts in order to alter the election results has nevertheless been recognized as a fairly clear case. To be comparable to a real world intervention, cyber interference must also be of a serious nature [...] Military or economic pressure may also qualify as coercion. Hostile cyber interference done with the purpose of promoting or supporting armed action in another State could constitute an example of prohibited intervention, provided that it seeks to force a certain policy change.\nDenmark's position paper provided similar examples of coercive intervention:\nAs emphasized by the Court in the Nicaragua judgment coercive acts involving the use of force are particularly obvious examples of unlawful interventions. Denmark considers that coercion is not limited to means of direct or indirect use of force and that also measures below this threshold may constitute coercion. Cyber activities that do not amount to use of force can therefore also be coercive.\nAn example of unlawful intervention in the cyber domain could be where a State coercively interferes in the internal political process of another. In the cyber context this could potentially occur by using cyber\n35 M. Milanovic, 'Revisiting Coercion as an Element of Prohibited Intervention in International Law' 117 (2023) American Journal of International Law 601–650, at 615.\n36 Finnish Ministry for Foreign Affairs, 'Finland's Views on International Law and Cyberspace' (2023) 92 Nordic Journal of International Law 456–469, at 463–464.\nHELAL\ntechnology to alter electronic ballots and thereby affecting the results of a political election.³⁷\nNorway also provided examples of coercion that affect a State's electoral processes, but that went beyond the examples that appear in the position papers of Finland and Denmark. In addition to tampering with election systems to alter the results of an election, Norway stated:\n[C]arrying out cyber operations with the intent of altering election results in another State, for example by manipulating election systems or unduly influencing public opinion through the dissemination of confidential information obtained through cyber operations ('hack and leak'), would be in violation of the prohibition of intervention. Another example is a cyber operation deliberately causing a temporary shutdown of the target State's critical infrastructure, such as the power supply or TV, radio, Internet or other telecommunications infrastructure in order to compel that State to take a course of action.³⁸\nLikewise, for Poland, the following conduct amounted to a violation of the prohibition on intervention: 'a wide-scale and targeted disinformation campaign, in particular when it results in civil unrest', preventing 'a reliable and timely conduct of democratic elections', blocking 'the filing of tax returns online', or depriving a 'the parliament working remotely of the possibility of voting online to adopt a law or modifying the outcome of such voting'.³⁹ Austria also identified the following conduct as amounting to a breach of the prohibition on intervention:\n[A] cyber activity that interferes with a state's ability to hold elections or which manipulates election results could, if undertaken to compel a state to involuntarily change a government policy, constitute a violation of the prohibition of intervention. Large-scale cyber activities, including disinformation campaigns, conducted by or attributable to a state may also constitute, if undertaken to compel another state to involuntarily change its behaviour, a violation of the prohibition of intervention.⁴⁰\n37 Danish Government, 'Denmark's Position Paper on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace', at 450.\n38 UNGA, 'Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions', at 68.\n39 Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 'The Republic of Poland's Position on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace'.\n40 Austrian Government, 'Position Paper of the Republic of Austria', at 5.\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\n523\nItaly, Singapore, and Switzerland provided examples that were relatively less detailed. Italy noted that the prohibition on intervention required further study, especially ‘with regard to influence activities aimed, for instance, at undermining a State’s ability to safeguard public health during a pandemic, or at manipulating voting behavior’.41 Singapore also stated that ‘non-exhaustive examples’ of violations of the prohibition on intervention include ‘interference in Singapore’s electoral processes through cyber means, or cyber-attacks against our infrastructure’.42 Similarly, Switzerland noted that establishing whether a cyberoperation amounted to an act of intervention should be determined on a case-by-case basis, especially in situations of ‘economic coercion, which could be the case if a company that is systemically relevant was paralyzed through a cyber operation’.43\n## 2.2 Coercion as Conduct that Deprives a State of Freedom of Choice or Control\nThe second understanding of coercion that has emerged out of national position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace defines coercion as an act that deprives a State of its ability to control or to exercise freedom of choice regarding matters within its domaine réservé. Australia adopted this view. Its position paper stated: ‘[c]oercive means are those that effectively deprive or are intended to deprive the State of the ability to control, decide upon or govern matters of an inherently sovereign nature’.44 In order to establish that a breach of the prohibition on intervention has indeed occurred, Australia required evidence that the conduct of the coercing State had some measurable impact or discernable effect on the target State.45 Canada expressed a similar position. Its position paper explained that a cyberoperation would be coercive if it is ‘designed to deprive the affected State of its freedom of choice’.46 Canada also noted that, in order to amount to an act of\n41 Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, ‘Italian Position Paper on “International Law and Cyberspace”’.\n42 UNGA, ‘Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions’, at 83.\n43 Ibid., at 88.\n44 Ibid., at 5.\n45 Ibid., at 5. Australia’s national statement included a hypothetical scenario of a cyberoperation that that disables websites and denies access to government systems that operate a State’s tax system. According to Australia’s national statement, establishing whether this cyberoperation amounts to an act of intervention ‘would depend on the circumstances, including the extent of economic damage and the loss of government control over economic policy’ (emphasis added).\n46 Canadian Government, ‘International Law Applicable in Cyberspace’.\nHELAL\nintervention, a cyberoperation must 'cause coercive effects that deprive, compel or otherwise impose an outcome on the affected State'.47\nNew Zealand also defined coercion as conduct that manifests 'an intention to deprive the target state of control over matters falling within the scope of its inherently sovereign functions'.48 According to New Zealand, to constitute intervention, the conduct of the coercing State must have 'significant effects' on a matter within a State's domaine réservé. The Czech Republic defined coercion in similar terms. It stated:\nCoercion is an activity intended to deprive, either directly or indirectly, the State of its ability to exercise control or govern matters within its internal and external affairs [...] The difference between actions that violate sovereignty and actions that violate the prohibition of intervention is that the latter is coercive, i.e., intentionally aims to influence the State's free will and choice.49\nBrazil, Costa Rica, and the UK also adopted similar definitions of coercion. The UK Attorney General said the following about coercion:\nSome have characterized coercion as forcing a State to act differently from how it otherwise would – that is, compelling it into a specific act or omission. Imagine, for example, a cyber operation to delay another State's election, or to prevent it from distributing tax revenues to fund essential services. To my mind, these are certainly forms of coercion.\nBut I want to be clear today that coercion can be broader than this. In essence, an intervention in the affairs of another State will be unlawful if it is forcible, dictatorial, or otherwise coercive, depriving a State of its freedom of control over matters which it is permitted to decide freely by the principle of State sovereignty. While the precise boundaries of coercion are yet to crystallize in international law, we should be ready to consider whether disruptive cyber behaviors are coercive even where it might not\n47 Ibid.\n48 New Zealand Foreign Affairs and Trade, 'The Application of International Law to State Activity in Cyberspace' (1 December 2020), available at <https: application-international-law-state-activity-cyberspace=\"\" publications=\"\" www.dpmc.govt.nz=\"\">, at para. 9(b).\n49 Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 'Position Paper on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace' (27 February 2024), available at <https: 5376858=\"\" file=\"\" mzv.gov.cz=\"\" 20240226_cz_position_paper_on_the_application_of_il_cyberspace.pdf=\"\">, at para. 9.</https:></https:>\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\nbe possible to point to a specific course of conduct which a State has been forced into or prevented from taking.⁵⁰\nCosta Rica's position was similar, but not identical, to that of the UK. It stated that coercion can occur in a 'multitude of ways where one State, directly or indirectly through support for non-State actors, deprives another State of the capacity to make free and informed choices pertaining to its internal affairs'.⁵¹ Like the UK, Costa Rica used the word deprives, but it did not use the word control in relation to matters within its domaine réservé. Rather, it referred to the capacity of a State to make free and informed choices. Brazil used different terminology. Instead of referring to depriving a State its ability to freely decide on matters within its domaine réservé, Brazil stated that, to constitute intervention, a cyberoperation 'against another State must involve an element of coercion affecting the right of the victim State to freely choose its political, economic, social and cultural system, and to formulate its foreign policy'.⁵²\nMarko Milanovic calls this the control model of coercion:\nCoercion-as-control does not work by influencing the decision-making calculus of the coerced state. Rather, the coercing state directly interferes with the coerced state's internal or external affairs by taking action that materially deprives the coerced state of its ability to control its policy-choices within its reserved domain.⁵³\nSeveral States that adopted this definition of coercion also provided examples of conduct that amounted to intervention in their position papers. Australia, for instance, identified activities that 'manipulate the electoral system to alter the results of an election in another State, intervention in the fundamental operation of Parliament, or in the stability of States' financial systems' as examples of coercion.⁵⁴ Canada also stated that a cyberoperation that 'hacks\n⁵⁰ S.

Its position paper stated:\nCoercion is clear-cut when a State uses or threatens to use force against another one. Nonetheless, it can also occur in a multitude of ways where one State, directly or indirectly through support for non-State actors, deprives another State of the capacity to make free and informed choices pertaining to its internal or external affairs. Coercion may occur when a State provides financial or other forms of support to secessionist, subversive or violent groups in the territory of another State, when it exercises significant political or economic pressure on another State, or when it engages in or supports subversive or hostile propaganda or the dissemination of false news that interfere in the internal or external affairs of another State [...]\nA prominent example of a breach of non-intervention are ransomware attacks crippling or simply interfering with a State's ability to run public services, such as finance, education, and social security. Moreover, foreign election interference may also infringe the principle of non-intervention. This may take the form of cyber operations directly interfering with mail ballots or voter databases, or electoral disinformation campaigns seeking\n55 Canadian Government, 'International Law Applicable in Cyberspace'.\n56 New Zealand Foreign Affairs and Trade, 'The Application of International Law to State Activity in Cyberspace', at para. 10.\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\nto mislead the electorate about the vote itself, candidates, electoral polls or results. Other types of disinformation, such as those affecting a State's health policies, may also amount to a prohibited intervention. Posts inciting individuals or other States to wage wars of aggression or to disrupt or subvert the internal order of another State may likewise breach the principle of non-intervention.57\nThe UK also provided a wide range of examples of acts of coercion. It identified forms of intervention that affected four areas of state policy: 'energy security; essential medical care; economic stability; and democratic processes'.58 In relation to 'essential energy supplies' 'essential medical services' and 'economic stability' the UK listed the following cyberoperations as potentially breaching the prohibition on intervention:\n[D]isruption of systems controlling emergency medical transport (e.g., telephone dispatchers); causing hospital computer systems to cease functioning; disruption of supply chains for essential medicines and vaccines; preventing the supply of power to housing, healthcare, education, civil administration and banking facilities and infrastructure; causing the energy supply chain to stop functioning at national level through damage or prevention of access to pipelines, interchanges, and depots; or preventing the operation of power generation infrastructure.\nTurning to economic stability, covert cyber operations by a foreign State that coercively interfere with a State's freedom to manage its domestic economy, or to ensure provision of domestic financial services crucial to the State's financial system, would breach the rule on non-intervention. Such cyber operations could include disruption to the networks controlling a State's fundamental ability to conduct monetary policy or to raise and distribute revenue, for instance through taxation. Or disruption to systems which support lending, saving and insurance across the economy.59\nIn relation to democratic processes, the UK noted that 'covert cyber operations by a foreign State which coercively interfere with free and fair electoral processes would constitute a prohibited intervention'. Examples of such unlawful\n57 Costa Rican Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 'Costa Rica's Position on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace', at 7–8.\n58 Braverman, 'International Law in Future Frontiers'.\n59 Ibid.\nHELAL\nconduct include: '[O]perations that disrupt the systems which control electoral counts to change the outcome of an election; or operations to disrupt another State's ability to hold an election at all, for example by causing systems to malfunction with the effect of preventing voter registration'.60\n## 2.3 Coercion as Conduct that Imposes Restraints on the Will of a State\nThe third approach to understanding coercion appears in the Common African Position on the Application of International Law to the Use of Information and Communication Technologies in Cyberspace, which was adopted by the fifty-five members of the African Union in early 2024.61 As of this writing, the African Union is the first regional organization to have adopted a position on the application of international law in cyberspace.62 The Common African Position defined coercion 'as a policy that is designed to impose restraints on the will of a foreign State. Assessing whether the use by one or more States of ICTs in cyberspace to influence the conduct of a foreign State amounts to coercion is a determination that should be undertaken on a case-by-case basis'.63 The Common African Position also stated the following:\nWhile the definition of coercion in this context requires further study and deliberation between States, the African Union is of the view that it is not necessary, in order to constitute coercion, that the conduct of a State must rise to the level of completely depriving a foreign State of its freedom of choice or to compel that State to either act or refrain from acting involuntarily. Coercion may also occur through threats of intervention. Furthermore, there is no requirement that, in order to constitute a violation of the prohibition on intervention, an act of coercion must actually succeed in compelling the State subjected to such acts to change its conduct. An unsuccessful attempt of intervention is unlawful under international law. The African Union stresses that offers or calls to peacefully settle disputes through negotiation, enquiry, mediation, conciliation, good offices, arbitration, and judicial settlement, and diplomatic\n60 Ibid.\n61 See Helal, 'Common African Position', at para. 31.\n62 For a brief description of the process of the development and adoption of the Common African Position, see: M. Helal, 'The Common African Position on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace: Reflections on a Collaborative Lawmaking Process' (5 February 2024) EJIL:Talk!, available at <https: the-common-african-position-on-the-application-of-international-law-in-cyberspace-reflections-on-a-collaborative-lawmaking-process=\"\" www.ejiltalk.org=\"\"></https:>.\n63 Helal, 'Common African Position', at para. 31.\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\n529\ndiscussions and communications are presumed not to constitute acts of coercion.⁶⁴\nIn some respects, the understanding of coercion in the Common African Position is similar to other definitions of coercion, but it also diverges from these definitions in significant ways. The Common African Position defined coercion as conduct that ‘impose[s] restraints on the will of a foreign State’. This is broadly analogous to the notion of impinging on the freedom of choice of States, which is central to the coercion-as-control model. However, the Common African Position also indicates that the purpose of intervention is to ‘influence the conduct of a foreign State’. This echoes definitions that understand coercion as conduct that aims at modifying the behavior of a State by subverting, manipulating, or undermining its decision-making processes.\nCompared to other definitions of coercion, however, the Common African Position was purposively designed to broaden the protective scope of the prohibition on intervention. It does so by adopting a lower threshold of (actual or threatened) effects that must be crossed for conduct to amount to coercion. This is clearly expressed in the following sentence: ‘the African Union is of the view that it is not necessary, in order to constitute coercion, that the conduct of a State must rise to the level of completely depriving a foreign State of its freedom of choice or to compel that State to either act or refrain from acting involuntarily’.⁶⁵\nIn other words, the principal point of divergence between the Common African Position and the positions of other States relates to the threshold of coercion. For the member States of the African Union, intervention is any conduct undertaken by a State that imposes restraints on another State in relation to matters within its domestic jurisdiction. However, those restraints need not be of such severity that they cause a State to act involuntarily nor do they need to reach a level of intensity that completely deprives that State of its freedom of choice or control over matters within its domestic jurisdiction.\nIt is notable that, in an initial draft of the Common African Position that this author had prepared while serving as the African Union Special Rapporteur on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace, coercion was defined in the following terms: ‘coercion, in the context of the prohibition on intervention, should be defined as a policy that is designed to impose material restraints on the will of a foreign State’. The adjective ‘material’ was intended\n⁶⁴ Ibid., at para. 32.\n⁶⁵ Ibid.\nHELAL\nto signify that, in order to amount to intervention, the restraints imposed on a State must attain an elevated level of severity, which would ensure that non-intervention would not be an over-inclusive rule.\nThis initial draft of the Common African Position was welcomed by the AU Peace and Security Council,⁶⁶ and served as the basis for the interstate negotiations that led to the adoption of the Common African Position, which were held in Tunisia from 29 November to 1 December 2023.⁶⁷ During these negotiations, however, the AU member States decided to delete the adjective 'material'. The member States determined that the word 'restraints' sufficiently and accurately captured the essence of the prohibition on intervention. Many States described non-intervention as a rule that is intended to protect the policy autonomy of States and to enable States to manage their internal and external affairs free from 'restraints' that might be imposed by other States. The AU member States also agreed that, when read in the context of the entire section on non-intervention in the Common African Position, the prohibition on intervention was not over-inclusive.\n## 2.4 The Element of Intent\nMany States also included the element of the intent in their definitions of coercion. New Zealand articulated this element unambiguously. Its position paper affirmed that the 'coercive intention of the state actor is a critical element of the rule' and underscored that 'intention may in some circumstances be inferred from the effects of cyber activity'.⁶⁸ Similarly, Costa Rica's position paper noted that '[f]or such breaches [of the prohibition on intervention] to occur, it suffices that a State intends to coerce another State, employs coercive methods, or eventually causes coercive effects in another State'.⁶⁹ Czechia's position paper used similar terms. It stated that '[c]oercion is an activity intended to deprive' a State of control over matters within its domaine réservé.⁷⁰\n⁶⁶ See AU Peace and Security Council, 'Communiqué No. 1171' (24 August 2023) AU Doc. PSC/PR/COMM.1171 (2023), at para. 2: 'Welcomes the Draft Statement by the AUCIL on the Application of International Law to the Use of ICTs in Cyberspace prepared by the Special Rapporteur, which was adopted and endorsed by the 22nd Ordinary Session of the AUCIL in June 2023'.\n⁶⁷ AU Office of the Legal Counsel BC/OLC/42.23/13793.23 (on file with the author).\n⁶⁸ New Zealand Foreign Affairs and Trade, 'The Application of International Law to State Activity in Cyberspace', at para. 9(b).\n⁶⁹ Costa Rican Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 'Costa Rica's Position on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace', at 7 (emphasis added).\n⁷⁰ Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 'Position Paper on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace', at para. 9(b).\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\nOther States also included the element of intent in their definition of coercion, but only implicitly. For instance, Norway stated that holding elections is an example of an activity that falls within the *domaine réservé* of a State. Therefore, according to Norway, 'carrying out cyber operations with the intent of altering election results in another State' would violate the prohibition on intervention. Furthermore, Canada, Denmark, and the US, understood coercion as conduct that is *designed* to achieve a specific purpose or effect (such as modifying the behavior of the target State). As noted above, the Common African Position also understood coercion as conduct that is *'designed* to impose restraints on the will of a foreign State'. The use of the term *'designed'* by these position papers introduces the element of intent into the definition of coercion. It indicates that the coercing State is acting purposefully and intentionally and employing its resources in a systematic and strategic manner to achieve specific policy objectives.\nOther States used similar phrases that also make the intent of the coercing State an element of the definition of coercion. The Netherlands $^{75}$ and Romania $^{76}$ defined coercion as conduct *'the goal'* of which is changing the behavior of the target State. Likewise, Estonia and Poland described coercion as conduct that *'aimed'* at achieving a specific objective. Estonia, for example, stated that 'cyber operations that *aim* to force another nation to act in an involuntary manner or to refrain from acting in a certain manner' would amount to intervention. Poland also stated that '[t]o be in breach of international law,\n71 UNGA, 'Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions', at 68 (emphasis added).\n72 Canadian Government, 'International Law Applicable in Cyberspace' ('[C]oercion may arise through the threat or use of force but could also arise where a cyber activity is designed to deprive the affected State of its freedom of choice') (emphasis added).\n73 Danish Government, 'Denmark's Position Paper on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace', at 450 ('To be coercive the effort to intervene must be designed to have a decisive impact on outcomes or conduct with respect to a matter reserved to the target State') (emphasis added).\n74 Ney, 'DOD General Counsel Remarks at US Cyber Command Legal Conference' ('[T]he principle of non-intervention prohibits \"actions designed to coerce a State [...] in contravention of its rights\").\n75 UNGA, 'Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions', at 57 (Intervention 'means compelling a state to take a course of action (whether an act or an omission) that it would not otherwise voluntarily pursue. The goal of the intervention must be to effect change in the behaviour of the target state').\n76 Ibid., at 77 ('In order for such intervention to be illegal under international law, it must be coerced, meaning that the goal of the intervention must be to effectively change the behavior of the target State').\n77 Ibid., at 25.\nHELAL\nan intervention must include the element of coercion that aims at influencing the state's decisions belonging to its domaine réservé.78 Again, using phrases like: 'the goal of' intervention, or saying that coercion is conduct 'that aims at', presupposes that the coercing State is acting intentionally. It indicates that the coercing State has identified a policy objective – an aim or a goal – which it is seeking to achieve by engaging in cyberoperations against another State.\n## 2.5 Sovereignty, Intervention, and the Use of Force: Demarcating the Doctrinal Boundaries\nIn addition to articulating definitions of coercion and offering examples of conduct that amounts to coercion, many States addressed the question of the relation between, on one hand, the prohibition on intervention and, on the other, the obligation to respect the territorial sovereignty of States and the prohibition on the threat or use of force. The content and scope of application of these three rules overlap significantly. As the ICJ observed in the Nicaragua Case, '[t]he effects of the principle of respect for territorial sovereignty inevitably overlap with those of the principles of the prohibition of the use of force and of non-intervention'.79\nTo disentangle the interconnection between these three rules, many States expressed views on the threshold of effects that must be crossed for conduct to amount to a violation of each of these rules. Surveying national and regional position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace reveals that States have approached this question from three different angles. The first relates to categories of conduct that – by their very nature – do not constitute a breach of the prohibition on intervention because they fall below the threshold of coercion. Nonetheless, some States noted that conduct that does not amount to intervention because it falls below the threshold of coercion may still be wrongful because it violates the principle of state sovereignty. The second is the higher threshold of coercion, which many States identified as the point at which non-intervention intersects with the prohibition on the threat or use of force. The third relates to the threshold at which non-forcible conduct – such as information operations, election interference, or economic sanctions – amount to coercion.\n78 Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 'The Republic of Poland's Position on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace'.\n79 Nicaragua v. USA, at para. 251.\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\n## 2.6 Conduct below the Threshold of Coercion\nMany States identified certain forms of conduct that do not amount to unlawful intervention because they are considered non-coercive. Several Western States argued that practices designed to persuade a State to change its behavior or to influence its policies are lawful, even if such practices involve criticism of that State. These Western States argued that such conduct is commonplace in international relations, which means that it should not be condemned as a form of intervention.⁸⁰ This was a point of convergence among Western States regardless of the definitions of coercion they adopted.\nFor example, in its position paper, Czechia, which defined coercion as acts that deprive a State of control over matters within its *domaine réservé*, stated that '[m]ere influencing, criticism or persuasion do not meet the requirements to be qualified as prohibited intervention'.⁸¹ Similarly, Denmark, which defined coercion as conduct that causes a State to behave in a manner it would not have engaged in voluntarily, stated that 'a distinction must be drawn between activities that merely involve influencing, as opposed to compelling, the voluntary actions of a target State. Acts of influence, such as persuasion, criticism, and public diplomacy are insufficient to qualify as an intervention'.⁸² Germany also noted that 'harsher forms of communication such as pointed commentary and sharp criticism as well as (persistent) attempts to obtain, through discussion, a certain reaction or the performance of a certain measure from another State do not as such qualify as coercion'.⁸³ Sweden also opined that 'criticism or other ways of influencing through diplomatic means' does not qualify as coercion.⁸⁴ Likewise, Canada, which was among the States that defined coercion as depriving a State of control over its *domaine réservé*, stated that '[c]oercion must be distinguished from other conduct such as public diplomacy, criticism, persuasion, and propaganda'.⁸⁵ The UK also distinguished between coercive conduct, which is unlawful, and the freedom of States 'to make their views known about processes in other countries – delivering hard, sometimes\n⁸⁰ See for example: Finnish Ministry for Foreign Affairs, 'Finland's Views on International Law and Cyberspace', at 463 ('[t]he requirement of coercion leaves out lesser forms of influence and persuasion that are commonplace in international relations').\n⁸¹ Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 'Position Paper on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace', at para. 13.\n⁸² Danish Government, 'Denmark's Position Paper on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace', at 450.\n⁸³ UNGA, 'Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions', at 34.\n⁸⁴ Swedish Government Offices, 'Position Paper on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace', at 3.\n⁸⁵ Canadian Government, 'International Law Applicable in Cyberspace'.\nHELAL\nunwelcome messages, and drawing attention to concerns. This is part and parcel of international relations.⁸⁶ Similarly, Austria stated that ‘[i]t is important to distinguish such disinformation campaigns from lawful public relations activities of state representatives, including e.g. by openly criticising the human rights situation in another state on social media accounts or websites’.⁸⁷\nThe Common African Position adopted a different approach regarding conduct that falls below the threshold of coercion. It stated: ‘offers or calls to peacefully settle disputes through negotiation, enquiry, mediation, conciliation, good offices, arbitration, and judicial settlement, and diplomatic discussions and communications are presumed not to constitute acts of coercion’.⁸⁸ The first portion of this sentence is based on Article 33 of the UN Charter. It indicates that efforts to settle disputes peacefully are not considered coercive. The second portion of this sentence – ‘diplomatic discussions and communications are presumed not to constitute acts of coercion’ – was designed to signal that diplomatic correspondences, whether written or verbal, are generally not considered coercive. The keyword here is *presumed*, which was inserted because history is replete with cases in which diplomatic communications were employed as instruments of coercion. Perhaps the most (in)famous ultimatum ever – the Austro-Hungarian ultimatum to Serbia that started World War I – was delivered via a diplomatic note.⁸⁹ Similarly, in a series of meetings that were held in 1945 and 1946 between Soviet and Turkish diplomats, the USSR attempted to coerce Turkey into redrawing the international frontier between the two States and granting the USSR access to and control over the Turkish straits.⁹⁰\nThis sentence in the Common African Position was also intended to signal that the member States of the African Union did not share the view adopted by Western States that other practices such as public diplomacy, criticism, propaganda, unwelcome messages and other conduct that, for instance, the UK described as ‘part and parcel of international relations’ could never be coercive.\nThis approach in the Common African Position is consistent with the positions expressed by African and other developing States during the negotiations on the 1970 Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning\n⁸⁶ Braverman, ‘International Law in Future Frontiers’.\n⁸⁷ Austrian Government, ‘Position Paper of the Republic of Austria’, at 5.\n⁸⁸ ‘Common African Position’, at para. 32.\n⁸⁹ See ‘Austria’s Ultimatum to Serbia: Full Text of the Document That Started the World War, and Serbia’s Reply to It’ (1918) 9 Current History 554–558.\n⁹⁰ O.

During discussions on that declaration, several Western States proposed adding a caveat that stated that non-intervention did not affect\n[t]he generally recognized freedom of states to seek to influence the policies and actions of other states, in accordance with international law and settled international practice and in a manner compatible with the principle of sovereign equality States and the duty to cooperate in accordance with the Charter.\nNon-Western States opposed this proposal because innocuous phrases like 'settled international practice' or acts that 'seek to influence the policies and actions of other states' were viewed as a potential backdoor that would justify interventionist policies by powerful States. For African States, determining whether 'criticism', 'public diplomacy', or so-called 'unwelcome messages' amount to intervention can only be established on the basis of an holistic, case-by-case evaluation of the facts.\nSeveral States also argued that, because of the element of coercion, the threshold that must be crossed for conduct to amount to intervention was higher than that which applied to violations of state sovereignty. Switzerland's position paper expressed this understanding of the relationship between these two principles – sovereignty and non-intervention – clearly. It stated:\n91 UNGA, 'Joint Proposal by Australia, Canada, France, Italy, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America' in 'Report of the 1966 Special Committee on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Co-Operation Among States' (27 June 1966) UN Doc.

The latter must be coercive in nature, i.e. through its intervention a state seeks to cause another to act (or refrain from acting) in a way it would not otherwise. This means that the threshold for a breach of the non-intervention principle is significantly higher than that for a violation of state sovereignty.⁹⁴\nFinland adopted the same view. Its position paper stated: ‘[c]ompared to a violation of sovereignty, the requirement of coercive nature and that of domaine réservé make the threshold of prohibited intervention considerably higher’.⁹⁵ Poland’s position paper similarly stated that ‘[t]he threshold for considering a specific operation in cyberspace to be in breach of the principle of non-intervention is higher than in the case of deeming it solely a violation of the principle of sovereignty’.⁹⁶ Canada also underscored that ‘[w]hether or not a cyber activity meets the threshold for a violation of the rule on territorial sovereignty or rises to the level of a violation of the rule against intervention will be determined on a case-by-case basis’.⁹⁷ Israel also viewed sovereignty and non-intervention as being closely related, but noted that acts of intervention are ‘understood as having a high threshold’.⁹⁸\n## 2.7 Forcible Intervention as the Higher Threshold of Coercion\nMany States adopted the position that the threat or use of force is a form of coercion.⁹⁹ Several States also described the threat or use of force as the gravest\n⁹⁴ UNGA, ‘Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions’, at 87.\n⁹⁵ Finnish Ministry for Foreign Affairs, ‘Finland’s Views on International Law and Cyberspace’, at 464.\n⁹⁶ Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, ‘The Republic of Poland’s Position on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace’ (‘The threshold for considering a specific operation in cyberspace to be in breach of the principle of non-intervention is higher than in the case of deeming it solely a violation of the principle of sovereignty’).\n⁹⁷ Canadian Government, ‘International Law Applicable in Cyberspace’.\n⁹⁸ Schöndorf, ‘Israel’s Perspective on Key Legal and Practical Issues Concerning the Application of International Law to Cyber Operations’, at 403.\n⁹⁹ See for example Costa Rican Ministry of Foreign Affairs, ‘Costa Rica’s Position on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace’: (‘Coercion is clear-cut when a State uses or threatens to use force against another one’); Danish Government, ‘Denmark’s Position Paper on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace’ (‘coercive acts involving the use of force are particularly obvious examples of unlawful interventions’); UNGA, ‘Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions’, at 57 (Netherlands: ‘the use of force will always meet the definition of coercion. Use of force against another state is always a form of intervention’).\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\nform of coercion.¹⁰⁰ Some States, such as France and the Netherlands, also emphasized that acts that constitute a threat or use of force could also concurrently violate both the prohibition on intervention and state sovereignty.¹⁰¹ Many States also argued that the threshold of non-forceful coercion is lower than the threshold of forceful coercion. For example, Denmark underscored that 'coercion is not limited to means of direct or indirect use of force and that also measures below this threshold may constitute coercion'.¹⁰² Similarly, Germany stated: '[m]alicious cyber activities will only in some cases amount to direct or indirect use of force. However, measures below this threshold may also qualify as coercive'.¹⁰³ The UK and the US also expressed this view.¹⁰⁴\nThe Common African Position did not take an express position on whether there is a distinction between the threshold of the use of force and the threshold of intervention. Rather, the Common African Position affirmed that the prohibition on intervention is a broad rule that applies to any forcible or non-forcible instrument of statecraft that might be used as means of coercion. It stated: '[t]he prohibition on intervention applies to the use of any instrument, including armed, political, economic, or any other means, and instruments of information, that may be used by a State for the purposes of intervening in the\n100 Canadian Government, 'International Law Applicable in Cyberspace', at para. 23 ('In its most serious form, coercion may arise through the threat or use of force').\n101 Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, 'National Position of France (2019)' (9 September 2019), available at <https: cyberlaw.ccdcoe.org=\"\" national_position_of_france_(2019)=\"\" wiki=\"\"> (France: 'Depending on the extent of their intrusion or their effects, they may violate the principles of sovereignty, non-intervention or even the prohibition of the threat or use of force'); UNGA, 'Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions', at 57 (The Netherlands: '[T]he use of force will always meet the definition of coercion.

It stated: 'the customary norm prohibiting intervention in the internal affairs of another State applies irrespective of the means or medium used and extends to the use of ICTs by States'.¹⁰⁶ Similarly, Costa Rica stated:\nCoercion is clear-cut when a State uses or threatens to use force against another one. Nonetheless, it can also occur in a multitude of ways where one State, directly or indirectly through support for non-State actors, deprives another State of the capacity to make free and informed choices pertaining to its internal or external affairs.¹⁰⁷\nIn short, there is evidence of a consensus among those States that have issued national or regional position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace that the threat or use of force is, *ipso facto*, a form of coercion that is wrongful under both the prohibition on the threat or use of force and the prohibition on intervention. These position papers also show that there is a consensus on the principle that non-forcible conduct could also amount to intervention. The point of divergence, however, relates to the threshold of coercion that applies to non-forcible conduct. This is the subject of the next section.\n## 2.8 The Threshold of Non-forcible Coercion\nThis question of the exact threshold at which non-forcible conduct amounts to coercion is of critical importance. This is because most acts of unlawful intervention that could be undertaken through cyberspace are likely to fall below the threshold of forcible intervention. For example, activities such as election interference or disinformation campaigns will almost always fall below the threshold of the use of force.¹⁰⁸ In fact, this is precisely the area – conduct below the threshold of the use of force, but above the threshold of violations of territorial sovereignty – where the prohibition on intervention is most relevant.\n¹⁰⁵ Helal, ‘Common African Position’, at para. 29.\n¹⁰⁶ UNGA, ‘Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions’, at 18.\n¹⁰⁷ Costa Rican Ministry of Foreign Affairs, ‘Costa Rica’s Position on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace’, at 7.\n¹⁰⁸ M. Schmitt, “Virtual” Disenfranchisement: Cyber Election Meddling in the Grey Zones of International Law’ (2018) 19 Chicago Journal of International Law 30–67, at 40 (Arguing that ‘because of the relatively high consequential threshold for violation, it is unlikely, although not inconceivable, that cyber election meddling would qualify as an unlawful use of force’).\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\nNational and regional position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace reveal that there is no consistency among States on the question of the threshold of coercion that applies to non-forcible intervention. This lack of consistency is evident even among States that adopted the same definition of coercion. In other words, even where there is some convergence among States on the meaning of coercion at a theoretical level, there are notable divergences on how the concept of coercion applies in real-world situations.\nAmong the States that defined coercion as conduct that modifies the behavior of a State or causes it to act involuntarily, there were notable differences in the terminology used to describe the threshold that applies to non-forcible coercion. Germany contended that, to constitute an act of intervention, a cyberoperation must be 'comparable in scale and effect to coercion in non-cyber contexts'. According to Germany, to meet the threshold of coercion, a cyberoperation must have the effect of 'significantly influenc[ing] or thwart[ing]' the decision-making process of a State to the point where its 'will is manifestly bent'. Although it did not specify a definite threshold that non-forcible conduct must meet to constitute an act of intervention, Switzerland noted that a cyberoperation could amount to economic coercion if it paralyzed the operation of a 'company that is systemically relevant'.\nOn the other hand, Poland indicated that, to constitute coercion, the foreign State's conduct must 'adversely affect' the 'functioning and security of the political, economic, military or social system of a state'. Norway also provided examples of non-forcible coercive conduct that included 'manipulating election systems', 'unduly influencing public opinion', and 'causing a temporary shutdown' of critical infrastructure.\nDenmark and Romania, both of which also defined coercion as conduct that modifies the behavior of a State or causes it to act involuntarily, did not explicitly identify a specific threshold at which non-forcible conduct could be considered coercive. Instead, Romania stated that an act of intervention must be intended to 'effectively change' the behavior of a State and underscored that 'there has to be a causal nexus between the coercive act and the effect on the internal or external affairs of the target State'. Denmark's position paper also stated that 'an act may be considered of a coercive nature when the act\n109 UNGA, 'Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions', at 34.\n110 Ibid., at 88.\n111 Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 'The Republic of Poland's Position on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace'.\n112 UNGA, 'Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions', at 68.\n113 Ibid., at 77.\nHELAL\nof interference has a potential for compelling the target State to engage in an action that it would otherwise not take.¹¹⁴\nTo this writer, the thresholds of coercion adopted by Germany and Switzerland are substantially higher than the thresholds adopted by Poland and Norway. The phrase ‘significantly influencing or thwarting’ that was used by Germany and the words ‘paralysis’ and ‘systemically relevant’ that Switzerland used signify a notably higher threshold of coercion than the term ‘adverse effects’ that was used by Poland and the phrases ‘manipulating election systems’ and ‘unduly influencing public opinion’ that Norway used. Denmark appears to have adopted an even lower threshold of coercion. For Denmark, a cyberoperation need not have an actual effect on the target State to be considered wrongful under the prohibition on intervention. Rather, a cyberoperation that merely has the ‘potential for compelling’ a State crosses the threshold of coercion. On the other hand, for Romania, the ‘potential’ to compel a State is insufficient. Rather, to constitute intervention, Romania requires that a State must be the target of a cyberoperation that has a measurable effect on the coerced State and that is causally connected to the behavior of the coercing State.\nThere are similar inconsistencies among the States that defined coercion as conduct that deprives a State of its freedom of choice or control over its domaine réservé. Australia, New Zealand, and Canada adopted broadly similar definitions of the threshold of coercion. According to Australia, conduct is coercive if it ‘effectively deprive[s]’ or is ‘intended to deprive’ a State of control over matters of an inherently sovereign nature.¹¹⁵ As discussed above, for Australia, examples of coercion include: ‘manipulating the electoral system to alter the results of an election’ or undermining the ‘fundamental operation of Parliament’ or the ‘stability of States’ financial systems.¹¹⁶ Similarly, for New Zealand, conduct is coercive if it has ‘significant effects’ on a State’s domaine réservé.¹¹⁷ Examples of acts that meet this threshold include ‘manipulating the voting tally’ in an election, preventing a ‘significant part of the electorate’ from voting, and causing ‘significant damage’ or ‘loss of functionality’ to critical infrastructure.¹¹⁸ According to Canada, intervention is conduct that has ‘coercive\n¹¹⁴ Danish Government, ‘Denmark’s Position Paper on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace’, at 450.\n¹¹⁵ UNGA, ‘Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions’, at 5.\n¹¹⁶ Ibid.\n¹¹⁷ New Zealand Foreign Affairs and Trade, ‘The Application of International Law to State Activity in Cyberspace’, at para. 9(b).\n¹¹⁸ Ibid.\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\neffects that deprive, compel, or impose an outcome on the affected State'. Again, as noted above, for Canada, examples of coercion include influencing the outcome of an election through a cyberoperation that 'hacks and disables a State's election commission' or by 'preventing a significant number of citizens from voting', in addition to 'disrupt[ing] the functioning of a major gas pipeline' to affect a State's negotiating position. Finland provided similar examples of coercion. It noted that to constitute intervention in an election, the conduct of a foreign State must 'be of a serious nature', examples of which are altering electoral results through 'hacking of voter databases or manipulation of vote'.\nBrazil, Czechia, Costa Rica, and the UK used different terms to describe the threshold of coercion. Brazil understood coercion as conduct 'affecting the right' of a State to choose its political, economic, social and cultural system and to formulate its foreign policy. Czechia stated that an act is coercive if it 'intentionally aims to influence the State's free will and choice'. For Costa Rica, conduct amounts to coercion if it impinges on a State's ability to make 'free and informed choices'. As noted above, Costa Rica also provided several examples of coercive conduct. These included: 'subversive or hostile propaganda', 'dissemination of false news', 'significant political or economic pressure', 'crippling or simply interfering' with public services, 'interfering with ballots or voter databases', and 'electoral disinformation campaigns'. Like Costa Rica, the UK provided a wide-range of examples of coercive conduct. These included 'disruption of systems controlling emergency medical transport', 'causing hospital computer systems to cease functioning', 'disruption of supply chains for essential medicines and vaccines', 'preventing the operation of power generation infrastructure' or disrupting power supplies to 'housing, healthcare, education, civil administration and banking facilities and infrastructure', interfering with 'financial services' that are crucial to a State's financial system, and disrupting a State's 'fundamental ability to conduct monetary policy'.\nTo this writer, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada adopted a higher threshold of coercion than that which Brazil, Czechia, Costa Rica, and the UK adopted. The former repeatedly used the word 'significant' to describe the\n119 Canadian Government, 'International Law Applicable in Cyberspace'.\n120 Finnish Ministry for Foreign Affairs, 'Finland's Views on International Law and Cyberspace', at 463.\n121 UNGA, 'Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions', at 18.\n122 Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 'Position Paper on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace', at para. 9.\n123 Costa Rican Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 'Costa Rica's Position on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace', at 7-8.\n124 Braverman, 'International Law in Future Frontiers'.\nHELAL\neffects that the conduct of a State must have in order to constitute coercion. Moreover, for those States, election interference must actually alter the results of an election to amount to intervention. Brazil, Czechia, Costa Rica, and the UK, however, used terms and phrases such as 'affecting', 'aims to influence', and 'free and informed choices' to describe the effects of the conduct of a foreign State. These terms signify a lower threshold of coercion. Indeed, unlike Australia, New Zealand, and Canada, the position papers of Brazil, Czechia, Costa Rica, and the UK did not require election interference to rise to the level of changing the results of an election to amount to intervention. Rather, these States used terms that would condemn as unlawful a broader range of forms of election interference. The UK, for instance, stated that covert operations that 'interfere with free and fair electoral processes' are a form of coercion, while Costa Rica stated that launching disinformation campaigns and the dissemination of false news could constitute forms of unlawful electoral interference.\nAs noted above, the Common African Position did not identify a specific threshold at which non-forcible conduct amounts to coercion. Rather, the Common African Position noted that the definition of coercion requires further study among States, and explicitly rejected the thresholds that other States adopted in their position papers. The Common African Position stated: 'it is not necessary, in order to constitute coercion, that the conduct of a State must rise to the level of completely depriving a foreign State of its freedom of choice or to compel that State to either act or refrain from acting involuntarily'.\nThis review of national and regional position papers reveals that there are three points of convergence among States on the question of the thresholds that delineate the boundaries of the prohibition on intervention. First, there is a consensus that the threat or use of force always crosses the threshold of coercion. Second, there is a consensus that non-intervention is a broad rule that covers both forcible and non-forcible forms of coercion. Third, there is a consensus that there are certain forms of conduct that, by their very nature, fall below the threshold of coercion. There is no consensus, however, on a specific list or catalogue of acts that are ipso facto non-coercive. However, given the positions expressed by Western States, it is reasonable to conclude that there is at least a general concurrence on the view expressed in the Common African Position that calls to settle disputes peacefully are not coercive. Beyond that, the main point of divergence among States relates to the threshold at which non-forcible conduct amounts to coercion. Indeed, as Canada noted: 'further\n125 Ibid.\n126 Helal, 'Common African Position', at para. 32.\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\nState practice and opinio juris will help clarify the thresholds for the rule of non-intervention, and the scope of customary law in this area over time'.127\nThis is a question of paramount importance to understanding how non-intervention applies in cyberspace and other domains. As noted above, the utility of the prohibition on intervention is that it protects States against conduct that is more serious than an infringement on the territorial sovereignty of a State but that does not rise to the level of a threat or use of force. This issue – the threshold at which non-forcible conduct amounts to coercion – has not been addressed by the ICJ and remains a subject of scholarly debate.128\nSome scholars have argued that coercion is unsuited to function as an element of the prohibition on intervention, at least as it applies in cyberspace. For example, Duncan Hollis has opined that coercion may not be readily applicable to influence operations that use cyberspace to manipulate public opinion or disrupt the domestic political processes of a foreign State, such as Russia's interference in the 2016 US presidential election.129 Similarly, Ido Kilovaty has written that 'the norm of non-intervention, in its current narrow understanding, is almost irrelevant in a world where States increasingly resort to cyber operations as a method of interference [...] Coercion cannot contain the diversity of threats posed by new technologies. A new standard is, therefore, required'.130\nIn my view, we do not need a new standard. The challenge facing the application of the prohibition on intervention in cyberspace, and in other domains such as economic sanctions, is that there is no agreement among States on either the definition of coercion or on the minimum threshold of effects that must be met for conduct to constitute coercion. Any understanding of non-intervention must include a conceptual tool that distinguishes between unlawful intervention and lawful conduct that influences the policies of States. Whether that conceptual tool is called 'coercion', 'dictatorial interference',131\n127 Canadian Government, 'International Law Applicable in Cyberspace'.\n128 A.

What matters is the threshold of effects that defines and captures the essence of ‘coercion’, which can be applied to determine when specific conduct amounts to intervention. This is the question that Section 3 of this article addresses.\n## 3 Towards a Unified Threshold of Coercion\nIt is impossible, given the limitations of space, to comprehensively address the question of the threshold of coercion that applies to non-forcible conduct. This is a topic that requires further research. Nonetheless, in this section, this article will offer a general sketch of a threshold that could be employed to determine when non-forcible conduct amounts to coercion, thereby violating the prohibition on intervention. Specifically, this section proposes the adoption of a single, unified threshold of coercion that applies equally to both forcible and non-forcible intervention. According to this approach, non-forcible conduct would amount to coercion if its scale and effects are comparable to conduct that amounts to a violation of the prohibition on the threat or use of force.\nTwo considerations support this approach. The first is historical. Throughout its evolution, the prohibition on intervention was understood as a cognate of the prohibition on the threat or use of force.¹³⁴ Non-intervention was designed to extend the protections afforded to States under the prohibition on the threat or use of force to non-forcible – but no less pernicious – instruments of statecraft. The second consideration is conceptual. The definitions of coercion that appear in national position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace that some States have issued impose an unreasonably high threshold of effects that must be met for non-forcible conduct to amount to an act of intervention. Defining coercion as causing a State to act ‘involuntarily’ or ‘depriving’ it of freedom of choice requires causing effects or\n¹³² R. Buchan and N. Tsagourias, ‘The Crisis in Crimea and the Principle of Non-Intervention’ (2017) 19 International Community Law Review 165–193, at 171 (‘Coercion denotes “imperative pressure” which manipulates the will of a state in order to extract some advantage or concession’).\n¹³³ T.

Ziolkowski (ed.), *Peacetime Regime for State Activities in Cyberspace: International Law, International Relations and Diplomacy* (NATO CCD COE 2013) 217–238, at 223 (“Coercion” implies forcible compulsion or restraint’).\n¹³⁴ Milanovic, ‘Revisiting Coercion as an Element of Prohibited Intervention in International Law’, at 607.\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\n545\ninflicting harm that is of such gravity and intensity that it negates or severely restricts the autonomy of the State. Such understandings of coercion would significantly reduce the scope of the prohibition on intervention, and lead to the paradoxical outcome where non-forcible methods of intervention are governed by a higher threshold of coercion than armed intervention, which is the gravest form of intervention. This is because nothing in *jus ad bellum* requires the effects of a threat or use of force to be of such gravity that it causes a State to act involuntarily or deprives it of freedom of choice.\nBefore proceeding, one point merits special emphasis. The unified threshold of coercion that I propose here should not be understood as signaling that the prohibition on the use of force and the prohibition on intervention are coterminous. At least one writer has recently suggested that ‘under the *lex lata* the prohibition on intervention only applies to acts amounting to a use of force or constituting support for the violent overthrow of a foreign regime’.¹³⁵ I disagree. As discussed below, at least since the adoption of the 1970 Friendly Relations Declaration, there has been a consensus among States that non-intervention is a broad rule that proscribes all forms of intervention, whether undertaken through forcible or non-forcible means. However, because there is no agreement among States on the meaning of coercion, there is continued uncertainty regarding when non-forcible conduct amounts to unlawful intervention. The unified threshold of coercion addresses this question by proposing a single test that applies to all forms of intervention, including armed force, or the use of political, economic, or informational instruments of statecraft, or some combination thereof.\n## 3.1 Coercion in the History of the Prohibition on Intervention\nAs argued in detail in another study by the present author, until the *Nicaragua Case* was decided by the ICJ in 1986, the concept of coercion was not defined, nor was it viewed as the cornerstone of the prohibition on intervention.¹³⁶ Moreover, throughout its evolution, States never understood intervention as conduct that causes a State to act involuntarily or that deprives it of its freedom of choice or control over its domestic jurisdiction. This is why, to this writer, the definitions of coercion that States have included in their national and regional position papers should be viewed as proposals *de lege ferenda*, and not restatements of established *lex lata*. To substantiate this claim, this\n¹³⁵ O. Pomson, ‘The Prohibition on Intervention Under International Law and Cyber Operations’ (2022) 99 International Law Studies 180–219, at 183.\n¹³⁶ M.

This overview begins with three Inter-American treaties that first included non-intervention as a distinct rule of international law, followed by the 1970 Friendly Relations Declaration, the adoption of which marked the acceptance of the prohibition on intervention as a rule of general international law.\nThe prohibition on intervention originated as a rule of conventional international law in the Inter-American system. It was first codified in Article 8 of the 1933 Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States, which reads as follows: 'No State has the right to intervene in the internal or external affairs of another'. The prohibition on intervention was further reaffirmed and its scope was expanded with the adoption of the 1936 Additional Protocol Relative to Non-Intervention, Article I of which states: 'The High Contracting Parties declare inadmissible the intervention of any one of them, directly or indirectly, and for whatever reason, in the internal or external affairs of any other of the Parties'.\nThe principal purpose of these provisions was to overturn the right of States to resort to acts of intervention, which was established under 19th century international law. At the time, States were permitted wage war or to engage in so-called measures short of war – i.e., acts of intervention – for an expansive range of reasons. These included preserving the balance of power, repelling attacks against a State's territory, preempting an imminent armed attack, obtaining reparation for injuries inflicted on the interests or honor of the State, protecting the lives and property of citizens, securing the repayment of debts, and preventing mass atrocities.

However, during the negotiations on the 1933 Montevideo Convention, a subcommittee composed of Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, Ecuador, El-Salvador, Haiti, and Peru that had been entrusted with drafting the convention prepared a report that provides an insight into how the negotiating parties understood the term 'intervention'. In its report, the subcommittee defined 'the juridical concept of intervention' as follows:\nAny act of a State, through diplomatic representation, by armed force, or by any other means involving effective force, with a view to making the State's will dominate the will of another State, and, in general, any maneuver, interference or interposition of any sort, employing such means, either directly or indirectly in matter of the obligations of another State, whatever its motive, shall be considered as Intervention, and likewise a violation of International Law.\nIt would seem quite unnecessary to state that the Sub-Committee was, and is, in perfect accord that any friendly act to offer good offices and\n141 R.

This applies also to the united action of the formation of the League of Nations, the universal peace agent, of which the majority of the American States are members.^^\nThe first sentence of this definition is instructive. The key phrase here is 'effective force with a view to making the State's will dominate the will of another State'. To this writer, it indicates that the drafters of the 1933 Montevideo Convention understood intervention as encompassing the use of armed force and any non-forcible conduct the effects of which are comparable to the use of force. This understanding of intervention was echoed by several States during the negotiations on the convention. Ecuador, for example stated: 'We have outlawed war. What is intervention but a kind of war, disguised and wary.'^^ Argentina also stated: 'What is intervention, then, but violence? [...] Intervention is violence.'^^ El Salvador also defined intervention in identical terms. It stated: 'Because the American conscience is such that territorial acquisitions originated by violence cannot be recognized; that violence has generally come to disturb the life of our countries in the form of intervention.'^^ Peru shared this understanding of intervention. It argued in favor of adopting Article 8 of the 1933 Montevideo Convention because 'war is proscribed, so is violence, but not the use of arms, the diplomatic measures or any other means of effective compulsion.'^^\nThe Charter of the Organization of American States, which was adopted in 1948,^^ incorporated and expanded on the provisions on non-intervention in the 1933 Montevideo Convention and the 1936 Non-Intervention Protocol. Article 19 and 20 of the OAS Charter state:\n## Article 19\nNo State or group of States has the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatever, in the internal or external affairs of any other State. The foregoing principle prohibits not only armed force but also any\n146 Seventh International Conference of American States, First, Second, &amp; Eighth Committees: Minutes and Antecedents 165 (Montevideo, 1933).\n147 Ibid., at 113.\n148 Ibid., at 113.\n149 Ibid., at 126.\n150 Ibid., at 123.\n151 Articles 19–20 Charter of the Organization of American States.\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\n549\nother form of interference or attempted threat against the personality of the State or against its political, economic, and cultural elements.\n## Article 20\nNo State may use or encourage the use of coercive measures of an economic or political character in order to force the sovereign will of another State and obtain from it advantages of any kind.\nArticle 19 of the OAS Charter includes two sentences, the first of which is virtually identical to Article 1 of 1936 Non-Intervention Protocol, which itself was based on Article 8 of the 1933 Montevideo Convention. Like its antecedents, the principal purpose of the first sentence of Article 19 was to reaffirm that, at least in Inter-American international law, the right of intervention that was recognized in 19th century international law was abolished. The inclusion of the phrase 'for whatever reason', which first appeared in the 1936 Non-Intervention Protocol, also indicated that non-intervention was an absolute rule that admitted no exceptions. Accordingly, the grounds that had previously been invoked to justify intervention – such as protecting citizens abroad, collecting debts, or enforcing international law – were no longer valid.\nThe second sentence of Article 19 clarified a principle that was only implicit in the 1933 Montevideo Convention and the 1936 Non-Intervention Protocol. It confirmed that non-intervention proscribed both the use of armed force and any other instrument of statecraft to engage in acts of intervention. Although, as noted above, the subcommittee that drafted the 1933 Montevideo Convention had affirmed that intervention could be undertaken 'through diplomatic representation, by armed force, or any other means involving effective force', this was not explicitly stated in either the 1933 Montevideo Convention or the 1936 Non-Intervention Protocol. The second sentence of Article 19 was also intended to prohibit acts of subversion that seek to impinge on the political independence of a State by subjugating it or transforming it into a satellite of a foreign power or that undermine its capacity to manage its political, economic, and cultural affairs autonomously.\n152 The inclusion of this sentence was probably driven by political developments that occurred during the Bogota Conference during which the OAS Charter was drafted. On April 9, 1948, while the conference was ongoing, the leader of the Colombian Liberal Party, Jorge Gaitán was assassinated. This sparked violent riots during which Colombia's Capitol building, in which the Bogota Conference was being held, was burned down. Almost immediately, communist agitators were blamed and the US claimed that Moscow\nHELAL\nArticle 20 of the OAS Charter is the first provision in which the term ‘coercion’ is used in relation to the prohibition on intervention. Coercion was not used, however, in order to signify the defining characteristic of intervention, nor was it designed to function as the conceptual tool that distinguishes between unlawful intervention and lawful conduct that seeks to influence the behavior of States. Rather, the authors of the OAS Charter drafted Article 20 with two objectives in mind. First, this provision was intended to proscribe economic sanctions that are imposed unilaterally by a State in response to an injury inflicted upon it by another State, and second, it was intended to outlaw the use of economic or political instruments of statecraft to pressure a State into giving concessions against its will. This becomes apparent from the negotiating history of Article 20.\nThis provision was formulated on the basis of two proposals that were submitted by Brazil and Cuba during the negotiations on the OAS Charter. The Cuban proposal stated: ‘No American State may unilaterally apply to another coercive measures of an economic nature that constitute retaliation or that tend to force the sovereign will of the State against which it is applied’.¹⁵³ Similarly, the Brazilian proposal stated:\nIt is prohibited for a State to exercise or support economic or political pressure on any other, in order to obtain advantages of any nature from that other State, not including, however, in the category of pressure the sanctions adopted in accordance with a determination of a competent international body. The American State that feels that it is subjected to economic or political pressure from any other State, that State has the\nwas responsible and Colombia severed diplomatic relations with the USSR. This led the conference to adopt a resolution titled: ‘The Preservation and Defence of Democracy’ that condemned ‘interference by any foreign power, or by any political organization serving the interests of a foreign power, in the political life of the nations of the American continent’ and committed the member States of the OAS to take ‘the measures necessary to eradicate and prevent activities directed, assisted or instigated by foreign governments, organizations or individuals tending to overthrow their institutions by violence, to foment disorder in their domestic political life or to disturb, by means of pressure, subversive propaganda, threats or by any other means, the free and sovereign right of their peoples to govern themselves in accordance with their democratic aspirations’. See *Novena Conferencia Internacional Americana, Actas y Documentos, Vol. VI: Conclusiones Acta Final – Instrumentos Diplomaticos* (Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de Colombia 1953), at 303.\n¹⁵³ *Novena Conferencia Internacional Americana, Actas y Documentos, Vol. III: Comision Primera – Comision Segunda* (Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de Colombia 1953), at 94.\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\nright to appeal to the Governing Board of the Pan American Union, so that it may take the measures it deems appropriate.^^\nThe final version of Article 20 was drafted by a subcommittee composed of Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Cuba, El Salvador, Panama, Uruguay, and the US. In its report the subcommittee explained the purpose of this provision as follows:\n[T]he two essential characteristics of the proposed text are the following: First, it condemns any action or attempted action that tends to force a State, despite its sovereignty, to adopt any attitude that State deems contrary to its interests; and second, such condemnation is in no way affected by the nature of the benefits sought by the State that exercises or encourages the coercive action. The members of the Subcommittee present were in complete agreement with the fact that the proposed text does not affect in any way the application of sanctions of an economic nature authorized by certain international organizations by virtue of current pacts.^^\nThe negotiating history of the three Inter-American treaties in which the prohibition on intervention was first codified does not provide support for the definitions of coercion that many States have adopted in their national position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace. In fact, the concept of coercion was not even the subject of any in-depth discussions during the drafting of these treaties. Rather, the term coercion was only introduced in Article 20 of the OAS Charter specifically to outlaw the imposition of unilateral economic sanctions. Likewise, there is little in the negotiations on the principal instruments that were adopted on non-intervention by the UN that supports the definitions of coercion that appear in national position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace.\n^^ Ibid., at 83.\n^^ Novena Conferencia Internacional Americana, Actas y Documentos, Vol. II: Comisiones Reglamentarias, Comisión de Credenciales – Comisión de Iniciativas – Comisión de Coordinación – Comisión de Estilo (Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de Colombia 1953), at 387–388. It should be noted that during the negotiations on this provision, the US agreed that the unilateral imposition of economic sanctions is unlawful. See Ninth International Conference of American States, Bogotá, Colombia, March 30–May 2, 1948: Report of the Delegation of the United States of America with Related Documents (Department of State Publication No. 8262, November 1948) (In its official report on the proceedings of the Bogota Conference, the US delegation stated: ‘the principle that no nation should indulge in unilateral economic sanctions is, of course, valid’).\nHELAL\nAlthough the prohibition on intervention was not codified in the UN Charter,¹⁵⁶ it was included in many instruments that were subsequently negotiated at the UN. These include the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the 1963 Vienna Convention on Consular Relations,¹⁵⁷ the 1949 Declaration on the Rights and Duties and States and the 1954 Code of Offenses Against the Peace and Security of Mankind both of which were drafted by the International Law Commission,¹⁵⁸ in addition to several General Assembly resolutions such as Resolution 31/91 on Non-Interference in the Internal Affairs of States,¹⁵⁹ and the 1981 Declaration on the Inadmissibility of Intervention and Interference in the Internal Affairs of States.¹⁶⁰ It is impossible in this article to provide a complete account of how the principle of non-intervention was articulated in these UN instruments. Therefore, I will focus here on the negotiations on non-intervention in the 1970 Friendly Relations Declaration, which contains the most authoritative expression of the prohibition on intervention.¹⁶¹\nDuring the negotiations on the 1970 Friendly Relations Declaration and the 1965 Declaration on the Inadmissibility of Intervention in the Domestic Affairs of States, on which the section on non-intervention in the 1970 Friendly Relations Declaration was based, coercion was neither defined nor was it considered the distinguishing characteristic of intervention.¹⁶² Rather, the\n¹⁵⁶ It is often mistakenly assumed that Article 2(7) of the UN Charter is a codification of the prohibition on intervention. It is not. This provision does not govern interstate relations. Rather, it applies to the conduct of the UN, as a distinct legal person, in its relations with its member States. See G.

Initially, many (mostly Western) States answered this question in the affirmative. To those States, the prohibition on intervention was limited to proscribing the direct and indirect use of armed force by States.¹⁶³ Conversely, Non-Aligned and Eastern Bloc States, insisted that non-intervention was a broader rule that prohibited all forms of the use of force and other non-forcible forms of conduct. Ultimately, the broader understanding of non-intervention was adopted. It was accepted that this rule outlawed the use of any instrument of statecraft – whether forcible or non-forcible – that may be employed to infringe on the domestic jurisdiction of States. There was, however, no attempt during these negotiations to formulate a threshold that determines when non-forcible conduct amounts to intervention. Instead, most States either identified specific forms of conduct that, in their view, amounted to intervention, or simply described intervention as the exertion of pressure against a State.¹⁶⁴\n¹⁶³ 1964) UN Doc. A/AC.119/SR.28, at 5. Similarly, France stated: ‘any attempt to define intervention must cover [...] the idea of coercion, i.e., of abnormal or improper pressure exercised by one State on another State in order to force it to change its internal structure in a direction favorable to the interests of the State applying such coercion’. Ibid., at 10. Mexico also noted that, in addition to outlawing the use of force, the prohibition on intervention was designed to outlaw ‘coercive measures of an economic or political nature’. Mexico did not, however, offer a definition of coercion. Rather, it stated that in order to distinguish between lawful pressure and unlawful intervention the ‘criterion of the illegality of such coercion was the object sought’.

See UN ILC, Yearbook of the International Law Commission 1949, vol. 1, at 90, para. 4. Similarly, during the early stages of the negotiations on the 1970 Friendly Relations Declaration, the UK argued that: ‘[t]he prohibition of the use or threat of force had absorbed much of the classic conception of intervention, which had always been regarded as connoting forcible or dictatorial interference’. See UNGA, ‘Special Committee on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation Among States, First Session, Summary Records of the Twenty-Eighth Meeting’ (23 October 1964) UN Doc.

That text did not refer to coercion at all. Instead, it defined intervention as either the use of armed force or conduct 'of such design and effect as to impair or destroy the political independence or territorial integrity of another State'. Those six States explained that the latter sentence was broadly synonymous to the phrase 'to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights' that appears in the 1970 Friendly Relations Declaration.

Intervention was never understood as an act that causes a State to behave involuntarily or that deprives it of freedom of choice or control over matters within its domestic jurisdiction. That is why the definitions of coercion and the approaches of applying the prohibition on intervention that appear in these position papers should be viewed as proposals for the progressive development of international law in this area. In other words, these are proposals *de lege ferenda*.\n## 3.2 Coercion as Conduct Comparable to the Use of Force\nIn addition to being unfounded in *lex lata*, defining coercion as acts that cause a State to behave involuntarily or that deprive a State of its freedom of choice or control over matters its domestic jurisdiction is conceptually flawed for two reasons. First, it would be incoherent to apply to non-forcible intervention that is undertaken through instruments such as information operations or economic sanctions a threshold of coercion that is higher than that which applies to the use of armed force, which is the gravest form of intervention. Second, even if one were to ignore the inconsistency between the thresholds of forcible and non-forcible intervention, the definitions of coercion that apply to the latter that some States have adopted are unreasonably high and severely restrict the scope of application of the prohibition on intervention. This section addresses these two points.\nAs noted above, virtually all position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace affirmed that the threat or use of force is *ipso facto* coercive. Many States also underscored that the use of force is the gravest form of coercion. This reflects the principle that the prohibition on the use of force is a peremptory rule of international law. Paradoxically, however, if, as many States propose, coercion is defined as conduct that causes a State to behave involuntarily or that deprives it of freedom of choice or control, non-forcible conduct would be governed by a higher threshold than that which applies to armed intervention. This is because, under *jus ad bellum*, the threshold of scale\njuridical language', and added that this proposal 'drew attention to the fact that no action of whatever character should be taken which would in any way impair or destroy the territorial integrity or political independence of States – ideas which were clearly recognized and defined in international law'.

Virtually all position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace endorsed this definition of the use of force. However, there is no consensus on the de minimis threshold of scale and effects that must be met for conduct to be considered a violation of the prohibition on the use of force. Some scholars have argued that there are cases of the use of force that do not, due to their limited scale and effects, amount to a use of force. The Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on the Conflict in Georgia endorsed this view. Conversely, other writers, contend that the\n168 M. Schmitt, 'The Use of Cyber Force and International Law' in M. Weller (ed.), The Oxford Handbook of the Use of Force in International Law (Oxford University Press 2016) 1110–1130, at 1120 (The authors of the Tallinn Manual 'agreed that a cyber operation resulting in significant death of or injury to persons, or damage to or destruction of property, evidenced the requisite scale and effects to qualify as an armed attack').\n169 See M. Schmitt and A. Pakkam, 'Cyberspace and the Jus ad Bellum: The State of Play' (2024) 103 International Law Studies 194–229.\n170 In my view, under jus ad bellum, there is no de minimis threshold of effects that must be met for conduct to amount to a use of force. The only requirement is that the conduct in question must involve the use of armed force by a State that causes death or injury to individuals or physical damage to property. Nonetheless, this writer agrees with Christian Henderson and Erin Pobjie that an inquiry into the scale and effects of a putative use of force might be necessary in order to determine whether the conduct in question is an instance of the use of force by a State in its international relations, as the term is used in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, or an instance of the use of force for the purposes of law enforcement. See C. Henderson, The Use of Force and International Law (Cambridge University Press 2018), at 69; E. Pobjie, Prohibited Force: The Meaning of 'Use of Force' in International Law (Cambridge University Press 2024), at 142. As Erin Pobjie notes, the gravity element is 'relevant to the contextual element of whether the act occurs in \"international relations\". For example, acts of a higher gravity are more likely to be perceived by States as of a military rather than law enforcement nature and thus as engaging their international relations [...] Also, acts of higher gravity may evince a hostile or coercive intention (discussed in the following section) with respect to another State and thus engage \"international relations\" on that basis'.\n171 O.

The threshold that must be met for an act to constitute an instance of the use of force is low. Even the threshold for an armed attack, the gravest form of the use of force, is relatively low.175 As the International Law Association noted, 'it appears that the gravity threshold attached to armed attacks is not markedly high, and would include most uses of force likely to cause casualties or significant property damage'.176\nCompared to the threshold of the use of force, the definitions of coercion that many States have adopted in their national position papers impose a much higher threshold of coercion for non-forcible conduct. Nothing in *jus ad bellum* requires the use of force to be of such gravity that it *significantly influences* or *thwarts* the decision-making processes of a State to the extent that its will is *manifestly bent*, which is the definition of coercion adopted by Germany. Similarly, *jus ad bellum* does not require the State to be subjected to a level of compulsion that causes it to 'act in an involuntary manner or to refrain from acting in a certain manner', which is the definition of coercion adopted by Estonia and several other States. Nor is it necessary under *jus ad bellum* for a State to be exposed to such pressure that *deprives* it of freedom of choice or *compels* or *imposes* an outcome on the State, which is the definition of coercion adopted by Canada.\n173 T.

To meet the threshold of causing a State to act involuntarily or to deprive it of freedom of choice or control over its domestic jurisdiction, the conduct of the coercing State must be of such intensity that it overwhelms the coerced State and leaves it with no viable choice but to submit to the demands of the coercing State.¹⁷⁷ In both jurisprudence and philosophy, involuntariness is generally understood as being a situation where an actor lacks a meaningful choice or has no reasonable alternative but to comply with the demands of another actor.¹⁷⁸ Applying these definitions would significantly reduce the scope of the prohibition on intervention, thereby permitting a wide-range of non-forcible conduct both in cyberspace and beyond.\nTake the definition of coercion in Canada's national position paper on the application of international law in cyberspace. As noted above, Canada defined coercion as conduct that compels or imposes an outcome on the affected State or deprives it of its freedom of choice. Canada also provided the following example of an act of unlawful intervention in an election: '[a]n\n¹⁷⁷ The definitions of coercion adopted by most States (coercion as conduct that causes a State to act involuntarily and coercion as conduct that deprives a State of freedom of choice or control) appear to echo the definition of coercion that the ILC adopted in its Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts. The ILC stated that coercion 'has the same essential character as force majeure', which it defined as a situation where the conduct of a State is 'involuntary or at least involves no element of free choice'. As the ILC explained, the degree of pressure required for a State to be placed in a position where its conduct is 'involuntary' or lacking the 'element of free choice' is one of 'irresistible force'. To be clear, States have not cited the Articles on State Responsibility as an authority to support their definitions of coercion. Nonetheless, there is a striking resemblance between the ILC's definition of coercion and the definitions adopted by many States in their position papers. In my view, this is a threshold of pressure that is far higher than anything required by the jus ad bellum. For the ILC's discussion of the concepts of coercion and force majeure, see UN ILC, 'Report of the International Law Commission: Fifty-Third Session' (23 April–1 June and 2 July–10 August 2001) GAOR 56th Session Supp. 10 (A/56/10), at 69, 77–78.\n¹⁷⁸ The literature of coercion and voluntariness in both law and philosophy is vast and varied. Nonetheless, there is general agreement among scholars in these fields that an agent will be deemed to have behaved involuntarily if they were left with no viable or meaningful choice. See generally T. Honoré, 'A Theory of Coercion' (1990) 10 Oxford Journal of Legal Studies 94–105; M. Alvarez, 'The Concept of Voluntariness' (2016) 7 Jurisprudence 665–671; S.

The report, which is titled Public Inquiry into Foreign Interference in Federal Electoral Processes and Democratic Institutions, noted that foreign interference did not determine the outcome of the election. The report did, however, state the following:\nThe fact that foreign interference may not have impacted the outcomes in many ridings does not mean, however, that it did not impact the election. Foreign interference in 2019 and 2021 undermined the right of voters to have an electoral ecosystem free from coercion or covert influence. Foreign interference has an impact when there is a single instance where a ballot is cast in a certain way, or not cast at all, because of a foreign state's direct or indirect enticement.\nThe report added that this foreign interference affected the electoral ecosystem and had the overall effect of '[u]ndermining faith in democracy and government' and led to a 'reduced trust in Canada's democratic process'. Under Canada's definition of coercion, this conduct would not be unlawful. The foreign interference catalogued in this report did not impose any particular choice on Canada nor did it significantly affect the outcome of an election. Likewise, this conduct would not meet the threshold of causing a State to act involuntarily. Nonetheless, the political effects of foreign interference of this nature are serious, especially in the long-term. Failing to proscribe conduct of this nature would turn the prohibition on intervention into a normative empty shell that provides little protection to States and would permit a broad range of disruptive non-forcible behavior.\nHELAL\nThis is why I believe that the Common African Position was right to define coercion as conduct that is designed 'to impose restraints on the will of a foreign state', which is a markedly lower threshold than that proposed by other States. The question, however, is what exactly does 'imposing restraints' entail and at what point can one say that the exertion of pressure on a State has reached the point of 'imposing restraints' on its will?\nTo this writer – and I must emphasize that this is the author's view, not that of the member States of the African Union – the threshold of coercion for non-forcible conduct should be defined as being comparable to the minimum effects of conduct that amounts to a threat or use of force. In other words, for non-forcible conduct – such as political, economic, or informational measures – to amount to intervention, the effects of the conduct in question should be comparable to that which is entailed by the threat or use of force. I call this the unified threshold of coercion. The practical effect of adopting the unified threshold of coercion is that any non-forcible conduct that causes effects on a scale that is comparable to conduct that amounts to a violation of the prohibition on the threat or use of force would constitute a breach of the prohibition on intervention.\nTo further explain, other reports by the Canadian government provide understandings of foreign interference that, to this writer, approximates the degree of effects that would meet the unified threshold of coercion, thereby amounting to a breach of the prohibition on intervention. In one report published by the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians, foreign interference was defined in the following terms: '[f]oreign interference involves foreign states, or persons/entities operating on their behalf, attempting to covertly influence decisions, events or outcomes to better suit their strategic interests'. This report also stated: 'foreign interference includes attempts to covertly influence, intimidate, manipulate, interfere, corrupt or discredit individuals, organizations and governments to further the interests of a foreign country'. It also underscored that 'foreign interference should be understood as a long-term effort, akin to espionage, using inducements or threats. Both dynamics enable the manipulation of targets when required, for example, through requests for inappropriate or special favours'.

These include:\nForeign interference activities are distinct from acceptable diplomatic advocacy and lobbying. The latter activities are known to the host state and occur through recognized channels to achieve specific policy outcomes or objectives. It is normal for foreign diplomats in Canada, for example, to reach out to elected officials across the political spectrum, to pressure policymakers, to use local media to promote their national interests or to engage with and support domestic organizations.^^\nAn earlier report, also published by the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians of Canada, states the following: '[f]oreign interference activities can include using deceptive means to cultivate relationships with elected officials and others perceived to processes influence in the political process; seek to influence the reporting of Canadian media outlets; seek, in some cases, to affect the outcome of elections; and coerce or induce diaspora communities to advance foreign interests in Canada'.^^ The understandings of foreign interference in these reports are palpably broader than the definition of coercion in most national position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace, including Canada's. To this writer, these reports describe the kinds of conduct that were intended to be covered by the Common African Position, and which would be covered by the unified threshold of coercion proposed here.\nTwo considerations lend support to this understanding of coercion. First, adopting a unified threshold of coercion that applies to both forcible and non-forcible intervention is consistent with the history of the evolution of the prohibition on intervention. Throughout the negotiations on instruments in which non-intervention was codified, States consistently viewed acts of intervention as being analogous to the use of force.^^ For example, as noted above, the drafters of the 1933 Montevideo Convention described intervention\n186 Ibid.\n187 Government of Canada, 'National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians: Annual Report 2019' (12 March 2020), available at <https: reports=\"\" rp-2020-03-12-ar=\"\" intro-en.html=\"\" www.nsicop-cpsnr.ca=\"\"> (accessed 11 August 2024), at 55.\n188 I. Brownlie, 'The Use of Force in Self-Defense' (1961) 37 British Yearbook of International Law 183-268, at 187 ('The term [intervention] and the use made of it by Governments and writers have been a very considerable source of confusion. It is commonly used to describe any use or threat of force which is considered to be justifiable whether or not the intervention creates a state of war in the formal sense').</https:>\nHELAL\nas any act that amounts to 'effective force'. It indicates that the authors of the Montevideo Convention understood non-forcible intervention to be the functional equivalent of armed force.\nMoreover, during the debates on the Montevideo Convention, several Latin American States underscored that non-intervention was closely associated to the prohibition on the use of force. For example, Argentina stated: 'What is intervention, then, but violence? [...] Intervention is violence.' El Salvador also affirmed that '[b]ecause the American conscience is such that territorial acquisitions originated by violence cannot be recognized; that violence has generally come to disturb the life of our countries in the form of intervention'. Peru also emphasized that 'war is proscribed, so is violence, but not the use of arms, the diplomatic measures or any other means of effective compulsion'. Ecuador also highlighted that '[w]hat is intervention but a kind of war, disguised and wary' and argued that, having outlawed aggression pursuant to the 1933 Anti-War Treaty of Non-Aggression and Conciliation, it was only natural for the States of the western hemisphere to proscribe intervention. Similarly, during the negotiations on the OAS Charter, Cuba called economic coercion 'treacherous, silent, and underhanded aggression'.\nMany States expressed similar views during the negotiations on both the 1965 Declaration on Non-Intervention and the 1970 Friendly Relations Declaration. For example, Guinea described intervention as a 'more pernicious' form of aggression, Trinidad and Tobago called it 'subtle and insidious' aggression, and the Congo argued that non-intervention covered 'political pressure, subversive activities, and other acts of aggression'. Furthermore, throughout debates on non-intervention at the UN, many States frequently described non-intervention as being derivable from or a corollary of the non-use of force. In short, in addition to outlawing intervention through armed\n189 Ibid., at 113.\n190 Ibid., at 126.\n191 Ibid., at 123.\n192 Ibid., at 113.\n193 Novena Conferencia Internacional Americana, Actas y Documentos, Vol. I: Antecedentes – Secretaría General Reunión Preliminar – Sesiones Plenarias (Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de Colombia 1953), at 219.\n194 UNGA, 'First Committee 1400th Meeting, Twentieth Session' (7 December 1965) UN Doc.

A/AC.119/\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\nforce, the prohibition on intervention was designed to protect States against non-forceful conduct that was viewed as being functionally equivalent to the use of force – i.e., conduct that entailed a degree of pressure that is comparable to the use of armed force.\nIn addition to being consistent with the historical evolution of non-intervention, adopting a unified threshold of coercion that applies to all forms of intervention reflects the fact that non-intervention and the non-use of force share the same policy purpose. The ICJ has stated that ‘a rule of international law, whether customary or conventional, does not operate in a vacuum; it operates in relation to facts and in the context of a wider framework of legal rules of which it forms only a part’.¹⁹⁸ Writing in more colorful terms, James Crawford observed that ‘customary rules usually hunt in packs, connected by some familial relationship and interacting with each other’.¹⁹⁹\nNon-intervention and the non-use of force belong to the same normative ‘pack’. These rules are part of what scholars call the ‘law of coexistence’, the policy purpose of which is to protect the autonomy of States and enable them to coexist peacefully in an anarchic international system.²⁰⁰ Specifically, these two rules – non-intervention and the non-use of force – are designed to protect the physical and functional manifestations of sovereignty. These two ‘domains’ of sovereignty – the physical and the functional – are expressed by the concepts of the ‘territorial integrity’ and ‘political independence’ of States, which appear in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.²⁰¹ Non-intervention extended the\nSR.31, at 11 (Yugoslavia: non-intervention is a ‘natural corollary of Article 2(4)’ of the UN Charter); UNGA, ‘Special Committee on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation Among States, First Session, Summary Records of the Thirtieth Meeting’, at 5–6 (Mexico: Article 2(4) is among the provisions of the Charter that provided ‘a solid and irrefutable basis’ for non-intervention).\n¹⁹⁸ Interpretation of the Agreement of 25 March 1951 Between the WHO and Egypt (Advisory Opinion) [20 December 1980] ICJ Rep. 73, at para. 10.\n¹⁹⁹ J.

It protects the physical space within which a State exercises political independence against outside intrusion or trespass. See C.

Far from it. Although both rules share the same policy purposes, the prohibition on intervention is broader than the prohibition on the threat or use of force. Non-intervention applies to any policy or practice, whether forcible and non-forcible, that impinges on the political independence or territorial integrity of States. In a sense, therefore, the prohibition on the threat or use of force should be viewed as a *lex specialis* that applies to a specific genus of intervention (namely, *armed* intervention). This body of *lex specialis* has been subsumed, *in toto*, within the broader *lex generalis* of the prohibition on intervention.\nIn conclusion, further research and further expressions of State views are needed on the definition and threshold of coercion. This is essential to understanding how the prohibition on intervention applies to and governs non-forcible conduct both in cyberspace and beyond. To this writer, however, the unified threshold of coercion that this article proposes provides a conceptual foundation on which to formulate a workable and conceptually coherent approach to applying the prohibition on intervention.\n²⁰² Law – Its Concept and Implications for Crimea' (2015) 75 Zeitschrift für ausländisches öffentliches Recht und Völkerrecht 7–26, at 10. As Georges Abi-Saab wrote: 'The international legal system is based at present as in the past, on two fundamental principles that determine its structure and functioning, namely, the sovereignty and equality of States [...] The principal legal consequence of this structural or rather structuring principle is to commit each State to a general obligation to respect the sovereignty of others; in other words, not to trespass on the territorial and functional ambits of this sovereignty. The most flagrant manifestation of such trespass is the threat or use of force against the State. But it is not the only one. Other, less blatant, forms exist varying in their degree of visibility and intensity.

Helal\nAssociate Professor of Law, The Ohio State University, Columbus, The United States of America; Member, Permanent Court of Arbitration; Member, African Union Commission on International Law (AUCIL); Special Rapporteur of the African Union on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace\n## Abstract\nThis article explores debates among States on the application of the prohibition on intervention in cyberspace. It focuses on coercion as an element of the prohibition on intervention and identifies the different definitions of coercion that States have adopted in national and regional position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace. This article also specifically discusses the views of States on the threshold of coercion, which is the degree of harm or the effects that the conduct of a State must cause (or threaten to cause) to amount to a violation of the prohibition on intervention. This article argues that the definitions and thresholds of coercion that States have adopted in debates on the application of international law in cyberspace should be viewed as proposals for the development of the law in this area, as opposed to restatements of established law. Instead, this article proposes that all forms of intervention should be governed by a ‘unified threshold of coercion’ that applies to both forcible and non-forcible intervention.\n## Keywords\nprohibition on intervention – cyberspace – coercion – prohibition on the threat or use of force\n© KONINKLIJKE BRILL BV, LEIDEN, 2024 | DOI:10.1163/18757413_02701019\nHELAL\n# 1 Introduction\nIt is undisputed that the prohibition on intervention is a rule of customary international law.¹ This rule is also codified in numerous conventions, including the founding instruments of several regional organizations.² Non-intervention was also applied by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in several cases,³ the most important of which is the Nicaragua Case.⁴ This rule was also reaffirmed in many UN General Assembly resolutions,⁵ the most notable of which is the 1970 Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Co-Operation Among States in Accordance with the Charter of the United Nations ('1970 Friendly Relations Declaration').⁶ The prohibition on intervention also appears in the 1949 Declaration on the Rights and Duties of States and the 1954 Code of Offenses Against the Peace and Security of Mankind which were adopted by the International Law Commission (ILC).⁷\n\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE Invocations of the principle of non-intervention are also ubiquitous in diplomatic practice. States from every region and from every political bloc have accused their adversaries (and sometimes even their allies) of intervening in their affairs.[8] In recent years, there has been a growing interest among States and scholars in the principle of non-intervention. One reason is that cyberspace has become a domain of conflict and competition. Information and communication technologies (ICTs) are being used both as weapons of war and as instruments of non-forcible intervention.[9] States, state-sponsored non-State actors, and non-State groups and individuals acting independently have employed ICTs against foreign States, citizens, and companies to achieve various political, economic, criminal, scientific, and financial objectives. ICTs have been used to disrupt critical infrastructure, spread disinformation and propaganda to sow social discord, interfere in elections, acquire industrial and trade secrets, steal scientific research and intellectual property, and to gain profit through activities such as ransomware attacks. As a result, there is a growing corpus of state practice and expressions of opinio juris, in addition to a sizable body of scholarship, on how the prohibition on intervention applies in cyberspace. This article engages with these discussions.\nSpecifically, this article has two objectives. First, it explores how States have defined the concept of coercion,[10] which is considered a core component of HELAL the prohibition on intervention.¹¹ It also examines how States have demarcated the boundary between, on one hand, the prohibition on intervention and, on the other, the obligation to respect the territorial sovereignty of States and the prohibition on the threat or use of force, which are two rules that are closely associated with the prohibition on intervention.\nThis article will do so by surveying national and regional position papers that States have issued in recent years on the application of international law in cyberspace in which States have outlined their views on the scope and content of the prohibition on intervention and on how it governs the conduct of States in cyberspace. These position papers were issued, at least partially, in response to calls by the UN Open-Ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (OEWG) for States to express their opinions on how international law applies in cyberspace.¹² The OEWG is one of the two principal forums in which discussions at the UN on the regulation of cyberspace are conducted, the other being the UN Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security (GGE).¹³ In addition to being of interest to scholars who specialize in the regulation of cyberspace, these national and regional position papers also deserve special attention from generalist scholars of international law. Most of these position papers are not framed as expressions of State views on *lex specialis* that apply only in cyberspace. Rather, they contain detailed statements on the scope and content of a wide range of *lex generalis* followed by discussions on how these rules of general international law apply in cyberspace. This makes these position papers a rich source of *opinio juris* on various primary and secondary rules ¹¹ p. 11 A. Tzanakopoulos, ‘The Right to be Free from Economic Coercion’ (2015) 4 Cambridge Journal of International Law 616–633, at 620 (‘Coercion is a method of illegal intervention [...] coercion is intervention. Seeking to coerce a state within its sphere of freedom is wrongful; it constitutes intervention’).\n¹² UNGA, ‘Open-Ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security – Final Substantive Report’ (10 March 2021) UN Doc. A/AC.290/2021/CRP.2, at para. 38. (The OEWG recommended that ‘States, on a voluntary basis, continue to inform the Secretary-General of their national views and assessments on how international law applies to their use of ICTs in the context of international security, and continue to voluntarily share such national views and practices through other avenues as appropriate’).\n¹³ See C. Painter, ‘The United Nations’ Cyberstability Processes: Surprising Progress but Much Left to Do’ (2021) 6 Journal of Cyber Policy 271–276.\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE of international law, many of which are foundational to the international legal order. Some of the rules covered by these position papers include sovereignty, the prohibition on the threat or use of force, the peaceful settlement of disputes, human rights, the laws of armed conflict, the rules of attribution, and of course, the prohibition on intervention, which is the subject of this article.\nExamining these national and regional position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace reveals that, while the prohibition on intervention is accepted as a rule of general international law, there remains considerable uncertainty regarding the exact scope and content of this rule. In particular, there are notable differences among States on the definition of coercion. Some States have defined coercion as conduct that modifies the behavior of a State by causing it to act involuntarily or by compelling it to act in a manner that it would not have voluntarily engaged in but for the coercive conduct of a foreign State. Other States have defined coercion as conduct that deprives a State of its freedom of choice or control over matters within its domestic jurisdiction. A third and broader approach, which was adopted by the African Union, defines coercion as any conduct that imposes restraints on the will of a foreign State.\nIn addition to articulating theoretical definitions of coercion, some States provided examples of conduct that, in their view, amounted to coercion. These examples shed further light on how the concept of coercion applies to real-world situations in which ICTs are used as instruments of statecraft. In particular, these examples clarify the views of States on the threshold of effects or the degree of pressure that a State must be subjected to in order for conduct to be considered coercive. As I show below, there is currently no consensus among States on the effects that the conduct of the coercing State must have on the coerced State to constitute an act of unlawful intervention. Some States adopted relatively high thresholds that require the conduct in question to have significant effects on the coerced State. For example, for some States, merely seeking to sway public opinion during an election campaign does not necessarily amount to unlawful intervention. Rather, to those States, electoral interference must rise to the level of altering election results or preventing a segment of the population from voting in order to constitute an act of intervention.[14] On the other hand, other States adopted lower thresholds to determine when HELAL electoral interference could be deemed coercive. For example, one State noted that 'hack and leak' operations to influence public opinion could constitute a violation of the prohibition on intervention.¹⁵ The African Union also adopted a relatively low threshold of coercion that does not require the behavior of a foreign State to have significant effects on a State in order to amount to unlawful intervention.\nIn short, national and regional position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace indicate that there are divergences among States on how the prohibition on intervention governs state conduct in cyberspace. There is no agreement on a theoretical definition of coercion, there is no consensus on the threshold of effects that determines when specific state conduct that is designed to influence the behavior of other States constitutes coercion, and there is some uncertainty on how non-intervention relates to other rules such as the prohibition on the threat or use of force and the obligation to respect the territorial sovereignty of States.\nHaving catalogued the views that States have, heretofore, expressed on non-intervention and coercion in cyberspace, the second objective of this article is to critically appraise the understandings of coercion that States have adopted in their national and regional position papers. Specifically, this article makes the following two arguments.\nFirst, this article contends that – as a matter of formal law – the positions expressed by States on the meaning of coercion should be viewed as proposals de lege ferenda, and not as restatements of established lex lata. This is because, as I explain below, nothing in the history of the development of the prohibition of intervention lends support to the definitions of coercion that States have espoused. Non-intervention first emerged in the early 20th century as a rule ¹⁵ available at <https: issues_development-enjeux_developpement=\"\"peace_security-paix_security=\"\"eyberspace_law-cyberespace_droit.aspx?lang=\"eng\"world-monde=\"\"www.international.gc.ca=\"\"> ('An example of a prohibited intervention would be a malicious cyber activity that hacks and disables a State's election commission days before an election, preventing a significant number of citizens from voting, and ultimately influencing the election outcome').\nUNGA, 'Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions on the Subject of How International Law Applies to the Use of Information and Communications Technologies by States Submitted by Participating Governmental Experts in the Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security Established Pursuant to General Assembly Resolution 73/226' (13 July 2021) UN Doc.

Then, building on decades of advocacy principally by non-aligned States, the prohibition on intervention became a rule of general international law with the adoption of the 1970 Friendly Relations Declaration. However, at no point during the evolution of the prohibition on intervention did States define coercion as conduct that causes a State to behave involuntarily or that deprives a State of its freedom of choice or control over matters within its domestic jurisdiction. Indeed, the history of the development of this rule indicates that States never even conceived of coercion as the conceptual cornerstone of non-intervention.\nSecond, this article argues that the definitions of coercion adopted by some States are conceptually flawed. Echoing the ICJ's judgment in the Nicaragua Case,¹⁶ virtually all States agree that the prohibition on intervention proscribes coercion whether undertaken through armed force or through non-forcible means, such as economic or political instruments of statecraft. Many States also underscored that the use of armed force is the gravest form of intervention. Yet – paradoxically – applying the definitions of coercion espoused by many (especially Western) States would lead to a situation where the gravest form of intervention – armed force – is governed by a lower threshold than non-forcible forms of intervention that are considered less grave.\nAs discussed below, nothing in *jus ad bellum* requires an act that amounts to armed intervention to be of such gravity that it causes a State to behave involuntarily or deprives it of control over matters within its domestic jurisdiction, which are the definitions of coercion adopted by some States. Indeed, attacking a single military unit could constitute a violation of the prohibition on the threat or use of force and could even amount to an armed attack,¹⁷ regardless of its effect on the behavior of the target State. On the other hand, applying the definitions of coercion adopted by some States would require non-forcible forms of intervention to reach a level of gravity and intensity that causes (or threatens to cause) a State to act involuntarily or that deprives it of freedom of choice. As I explain below, these definitions entail an unreasonably high ¹⁶ Nicaragua v. USA, at para. 215 ('Intervention is wrongful when it uses methods of coercion in regard to such choices, which must remain free ones. The element of coercion, which defines, and indeed forms the very essence of, prohibited intervention, is particularly obvious in the case of an intervention which uses force, either in the direct form of military action, or in the indirect form of support for subversive or terrorist armed activities within another State').\n¹⁷ As the ICJ noted in the *Oil Platforms Case*, '[t]he Court does not exclude the possibility that the mining of a single military vessel might be sufficient to bring into play the\"inherent right of self-defence\". *Oil Platforms* (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America) (Judgment) [2003] ICJ Rep. 161, at para. 72.\nHELAL threshold of effects for non-forcible intervention that is significantly higher than that which applies to forcible intervention.\nTherefore, this article argues that States and scholars should consider adopting what I call the 'unified threshold of coercion' that applies to both forcible and non-forcible intervention. Based on this approach, non-forcible conduct would be considered coercive if its impact is comparable to the scale and effects of conduct that amounts to a violation of the threat or use of force. This unified threshold of coercion is lower than the thresholds of coercion that many States have adopted in their position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace.\nThis article consists of two sections. Section 1 provides a survey of the definitions of coercion that appear in national and regional position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace. This section also outlines the views of States on the interconnection between non-intervention and the prohibition on the use of force and the obligation to respect state sovereignty, which is a debate that sheds further light on the kinds of conduct that each of these rules applies to and regulates. Then in Section 2, this article critically appraises the understandings of coercion adopted by States and argues in favor of adopting what I call the 'unified threshold of coercion' that applies equally to both forcible and non-forcible forms of intervention.\n## 2 Intervention and Coercion in Cyberspace National and regional position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace unanimously affirmed that non-intervention is an established rule of international law that applies in cyberspace.[18] The GGE,[19] the African Union COERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE Peace and Security Council,²⁰ and the Juridical Committee of the Organization of American States also adopted this position.²¹ Despite this general agreement on the status of the prohibition on intervention as an established rule of international law, States adopted diverging views regarding the exact scope and content of this rule. This is especially clear with coercion. Indeed, many States, including the member States of the African Union, noted that coercion is a concept that remains undefined in international law.²² Nonetheless, in not intervene directly or indirectly in the internal affairs of another State, including by means of ICTs').\n²⁰ AU Peace and Security Council, 'Communiqué 1120.1' (9 November 2022) AU Doc.

Three approaches to defining coercion have appeared in these position papers.\n## 2.1 Coercion as Conduct that Modifies the Behavior of a State The first approach defines coercion as conduct that compels a State to modify its behavior. Among the States that adopted this approach, there were slight variations in the exact definition of coercion that those States formulated. Some States defined coercion as acts that aim to compel a State to act involuntarily. Estonia's position paper expressed this view. It stated: When discussing if a cyber operation constitutes an unlawful intervention into the external or internal affairs of another state, the element of coercion is a key factor [...] Stemming from that, cyber operations that aim to force another nation to act in an involuntary manner or to refrain from acting in a certain manner, and target the other nation's domaine réservé (e.g., national democratic processes such as elections, or military, security or critical infrastructure systems) could constitute such an intervention.²³ Austria's national statement was similar to Estonia's. It stated: '[c]oercion occurs when a state seeks to compel another state to change its behaviour with respect to its internal or external affairs, i.e. to force that state to act in an involuntary manner or involuntarily refrain from acting in a particular way'.²⁴ Some States that adopted this understanding of coercion also included a 'but for' test in their definition of coercion. According to those States, an act would be coercive if it aimed at compelling a State to behave in a manner that it would not otherwise have engaged in voluntarily. Norway's position paper expressed this view: coercion, and thus of unauthorized intervention, has not yet fully crystallized in international law [...] there is no clear definition of the element of coercion').\n²³ UNGA, 'Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions', at 25.\n²⁴ Austrian Government, 'Position Paper of the Republic of Austria: Cyber Activities and International Law', available at <https: docs-library.unoda.org=\"\"open-ended_working_group_on_information_and_communication_technologies_-_(2021)=\"\"open-end_working_group_on_information_and_communication_technologies_-_(2021)=\"\"/austrian_position_Paper_-_cyber_activities_and_international_law_(final_23.04.2024).pdf=\"\">, at 5.</https:> COERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE [A] State must not carry out cyber operations in breach of the prohibition of intervention, according to customary international law. A cyber operation must therefore not be carried out to compel the target State to take a course of action, whether by act or omission, in a way that it would not otherwise voluntarily have pursued (coercion) in matters relating to its internal or external affairs (domaine réservé).25 The Netherlands adopted a similar position. It defined coercion as an act 'compelling a state to take a course of action (whether an act or an omission) that it would not otherwise voluntarily pursue. The goal of the intervention must be to effect change in the behavior of the target state'.26 Denmark also defined coercion as an act that 'has a potential for compelling the target state to engage in an action that it would otherwise not take'.27 Switzerland and Poland also used similar terms. To Switzerland, coercion is conduct that 'seeks to cause another to act (or refrain from acting) in a way it would not otherwise',28 and Poland stated that coercion 'aims at influencing the state's decisions belonging to its domaine réservé', and added that cyberoperations 'potentially leading to the state's conduct that would not occur otherwise, may be considered a prohibited intervention'.29 Other States that understood coercion as conduct that is designed to modify the behavior of another State used relatively generic terms to define coercion. Romania, for example, defined coercion simply as an act the purpose of which is to 'effectively change the behavior of the target state'.30 Israel's Deputy Attorney General also opined that coercion 'has been taken to mean that State A cannot take actions to\"coerce\"State B in pursuing a course of action, or refraining from a course of action, in matters pertaining to State B's core internal affairs'.31 Singapore's national statement defined coercion in similar terms. It stated that a cyberoperation may violate the prohibition on intervention if it amounted to an 'attempt to coerce our government to take or forebear HELAL a certain course of action on a matter ordinarily within its sovereign prerogative'.32 Italy's national statement used almost identical terms. It asserted that 'a State employs coercive means to compel another State to undertake or desist from a specific action, in matters falling under its domain réserve'.33 In other words, for these States, an act is coercive simply if it is intended to cause another State to change its behavior. These States did not, however, explicitly include a requirement that the conduct in question must compel a State to act involuntarily or force it to engage in behavior that it would not have engaged in voluntarily but-for the coercive conduct of a foreign State.\nGermany adopted a generally similar understanding of coercion. Although it did not refer to modifying the behavior of a State or causing it to act involuntarily, Germany described coercion as the exercise of a certain level of pressure that has a significant impact on the decision-making process of a State to the extent that it manipulates or undermines the will of the State. Germany's position paper stated the following: Generally, Germany is of the opinion that cyber measures may constitute a prohibited intervention under international law if they are comparable in scale and effects to coercion in non-cyber contexts.\nCoercion implies that a State's internal processes regarding aspects pertaining to its domaine réservé are significantly influenced or thwarted and that its will is manifestly bent by the foreign State's conduct. However, as is widely accepted, the element of coercion must not be assumed prematurely. Even harsher forms of communication such as pointed commentary and sharp criticism as well as (persistent) attempts to obtain, through discussion, a certain reaction or the performance of a certain measure from another State do not as such qualify as coercion. Moreover, the acting State must intend to intervene in the internal affairs of the target State – otherwise the scope of the non-intervention principle would be unduly broad.34 Despite these variations in the exact formulation of these definitions, these understandings of coercion share the common characteristic of focusing on COERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE the desire of the coercing State to alter the behavior of another State. Marko Milanovic calls this the extortion model of coercion. 'These definitions point to undermining the victim state's will as the essence of coercion (\"involuntary,\"\"voluntary\"), so as to effect a change in its behavior'.35 Several States that adopted this definition of coercion also provided examples of conduct that, in their view, amounted to intervention. As noted above in the introduction to this article, these examples provide greater clarity on how States operationalize and apply the definitions of coercion that they adopted. In its position paper, Finland position paper identified the following forms of coercion: [W]hile the conduct of elections belongs undisputedly to the internal affairs of each State, all methods of electoral interference do not display the element of coercion. Hacking of voter databases or manipulation of vote counts in order to alter the election results has nevertheless been recognized as a fairly clear case. To be comparable to a real world intervention, cyber interference must also be of a serious nature [...] Military or economic pressure may also qualify as coercion. Hostile cyber interference done with the purpose of promoting or supporting armed action in another State could constitute an example of prohibited intervention, provided that it seeks to force a certain policy change.[36] Denmark's position paper provided similar examples of coercive intervention: As emphasized by the Court in the Nicaragua judgment coercive acts involving the use of force are particularly obvious examples of unlawful interventions. Denmark considers that coercion is not limited to means of direct or indirect use of force and that also measures below this threshold may constitute coercion. Cyber activities that do not amount to use of force can therefore also be coercive.\nAn example of unlawful intervention in the cyber domain could be where a State coercively interferes in the internal political process of another. In the cyber context this could potentially occur by using cyber HELAL technology to alter electronic ballots and thereby affecting the results of a political election.³⁷ Norway also provided examples of coercion that affect a State's electoral processes, but that went beyond the examples that appear in the position papers of Finland and Denmark. In addition to tampering with election systems to alter the results of an election, Norway stated: [C]arrying out cyber operations with the intent of altering election results in another State, for example by manipulating election systems or unduly influencing public opinion through the dissemination of confidential information obtained through cyber operations ('hack and leak'), would be in violation of the prohibition of intervention. Another example is a cyber operation deliberately causing a temporary shutdown of the target State's critical infrastructure, such as the power supply or TV, radio, Internet or other telecommunications infrastructure in order to compel that State to take a course of action.³⁸ Likewise, for Poland, the following conduct amounted to a violation of the prohibition on intervention: 'a wide-scale and targeted disinformation campaign, in particular when it results in civil unrest', preventing 'a reliable and timely conduct of democratic elections', blocking 'the filing of tax returns online', or depriving a 'the parliament working remotely of the possibility of voting online to adopt a law or modifying the outcome of such voting'.³⁹ Austria also identified the following conduct as amounting to a breach of the prohibition on intervention: [A] cyber activity that interferes with a state's ability to hold elections or which manipulates election results could, if undertaken to compel a state to involuntarily change a government policy, constitute a violation of the prohibition of intervention. Large-scale cyber activities, including disinformation campaigns, conducted by or attributable to a state may also constitute, if undertaken to compel another state to involuntarily change its behaviour, a violation of the prohibition of intervention.⁴⁰\n\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\n\n## 2.2 Coercion as Conduct that Deprives a State of Freedom of Choice or Control\nThe second understanding of coercion that has emerged out of national position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace defines coercion as an act that deprives a State of its ability to control or to exercise freedom of choice regarding matters within its domaine réservé. Australia adopted this view. Its position paper stated: ‘[c]oercive means are those that effectively deprive or are intended to deprive the State of the ability to control, decide upon or govern matters of an inherently sovereign nature’.44 In order to establish that a breach of the prohibition on intervention has indeed occurred, Australia required evidence that the conduct of the coercing State had some measurable impact or discernable effect on the target State.45 Canada expressed a similar position. Its position paper explained that a cyberoperation would be coercive if it is ‘designed to deprive the affected State of its freedom of choice’.46 Canada also noted that, in order to amount to an act of\n\nHELAL intervention, a cyberoperation must 'cause coercive effects that deprive, compel or otherwise impose an outcome on the affected State'.47 New Zealand also defined coercion as conduct that manifests 'an intention to deprive the target state of control over matters falling within the scope of its inherently sovereign functions'.48 According to New Zealand, to constitute intervention, the conduct of the coercing State must have 'significant effects' on a matter within a State's domaine réservé. The Czech Republic defined coercion in similar terms. It stated: Coercion is an activity intended to deprive, either directly or indirectly, the State of its ability to exercise control or govern matters within its internal and external affairs [...] The difference between actions that violate sovereignty and actions that violate the prohibition of intervention is that the latter is coercive, i.e., intentionally aims to influence the State's free will and choice.49 Brazil, Costa Rica, and the UK also adopted similar definitions of coercion. The UK Attorney General said the following about coercion: Some have characterized coercion as forcing a State to act differently from how it otherwise would – that is, compelling it into a specific act or omission. Imagine, for example, a cyber operation to delay another State's election, or to prevent it from distributing tax revenues to fund essential services. To my mind, these are certainly forms of coercion.\nBut I want to be clear today that coercion can be broader than this. In essence, an intervention in the affairs of another State will be unlawful if it is forcible, dictatorial, or otherwise coercive, depriving a State of its freedom of control over matters which it is permitted to decide freely by the principle of State sovereignty. While the precise boundaries of coercion are yet to crystallize in international law, we should be ready to consider whether disruptive cyber behaviors are coercive even where it might not COERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE be possible to point to a specific course of conduct which a State has been forced into or prevented from taking.⁵⁰ Costa Rica's position was similar, but not identical, to that of the UK. It stated that coercion can occur in a 'multitude of ways where one State, directly or indirectly through support for non-State actors, deprives another State of the capacity to make free and informed choices pertaining to its internal affairs'.⁵¹ Like the UK, Costa Rica used the word deprives, but it did not use the word control in relation to matters within its domaine réservé. Rather, it referred to the capacity of a State to make free and informed choices. Brazil used different terminology. Instead of referring to depriving a State its ability to freely decide on matters within its domaine réservé, Brazil stated that, to constitute intervention, a cyberoperation 'against another State must involve an element of coercion affecting the right of the victim State to freely choose its political, economic, social and cultural system, and to formulate its foreign policy'.⁵² Marko Milanovic calls this the control model of coercion: Coercion-as-control does not work by influencing the decision-making calculus of the coerced state. Rather, the coercing state directly interferes with the coerced state's internal or external affairs by taking action that materially deprives the coerced state of its ability to control its policy-choices within its reserved domain.⁵³ Several States that adopted this definition of coercion also provided examples of conduct that amounted to intervention in their position papers. Australia, for instance, identified activities that 'manipulate the electoral system to alter the results of an election in another State, intervention in the fundamental operation of Parliament, or in the stability of States' financial systems' as examples of coercion.⁵⁴ Canada also stated that a cyberoperation that 'hacks ⁵⁰ S.

Its position paper stated: Coercion is clear-cut when a State uses or threatens to use force against another one. Nonetheless, it can also occur in a multitude of ways where one State, directly or indirectly through support for non-State actors, deprives another State of the capacity to make free and informed choices pertaining to its internal or external affairs. Coercion may occur when a State provides financial or other forms of support to secessionist, subversive or violent groups in the territory of another State, when it exercises significant political or economic pressure on another State, or when it engages in or supports subversive or hostile propaganda or the dissemination of false news that interfere in the internal or external affairs of another State [...]\nA prominent example of a breach of non-intervention are ransomware attacks crippling or simply interfering with a State's ability to run public services, such as finance, education, and social security. Moreover, foreign election interference may also infringe the principle of non-intervention. This may take the form of cyber operations directly interfering with mail ballots or voter databases, or electoral disinformation campaigns seeking COERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE to mislead the electorate about the vote itself, candidates, electoral polls or results. Other types of disinformation, such as those affecting a State's health policies, may also amount to a prohibited intervention. Posts inciting individuals or other States to wage wars of aggression or to disrupt or subvert the internal order of another State may likewise breach the principle of non-intervention.57 The UK also provided a wide range of examples of acts of coercion. It identified forms of intervention that affected four areas of state policy: 'energy security; essential medical care; economic stability; and democratic processes'.58 In relation to 'essential energy supplies' 'essential medical services' and 'economic stability' the UK listed the following cyberoperations as potentially breaching the prohibition on intervention: [D]isruption of systems controlling emergency medical transport (e.g., telephone dispatchers); causing hospital computer systems to cease functioning; disruption of supply chains for essential medicines and vaccines; preventing the supply of power to housing, healthcare, education, civil administration and banking facilities and infrastructure; causing the energy supply chain to stop functioning at national level through damage or prevention of access to pipelines, interchanges, and depots; or preventing the operation of power generation infrastructure.\nTurning to economic stability, covert cyber operations by a foreign State that coercively interfere with a State's freedom to manage its domestic economy, or to ensure provision of domestic financial services crucial to the State's financial system, would breach the rule on non-intervention. Such cyber operations could include disruption to the networks controlling a State's fundamental ability to conduct monetary policy or to raise and distribute revenue, for instance through taxation. Or disruption to systems which support lending, saving and insurance across the economy.59 In relation to democratic processes, the UK noted that 'covert cyber operations by a foreign State which coercively interfere with free and fair electoral processes would constitute a prohibited intervention'. Examples of such unlawful HELAL conduct include: '[O]perations that disrupt the systems which control electoral counts to change the outcome of an election; or operations to disrupt another State's ability to hold an election at all, for example by causing systems to malfunction with the effect of preventing voter registration'.60 ## 2.3 Coercion as Conduct that Imposes Restraints on the Will of a State The third approach to understanding coercion appears in the Common African Position on the Application of International Law to the Use of Information and Communication Technologies in Cyberspace, which was adopted by the fifty-five members of the African Union in early 2024.61 As of this writing, the African Union is the first regional organization to have adopted a position on the application of international law in cyberspace.62 The Common African Position defined coercion 'as a policy that is designed to impose restraints on the will of a foreign State. Assessing whether the use by one or more States of ICTs in cyberspace to influence the conduct of a foreign State amounts to coercion is a determination that should be undertaken on a case-by-case basis'.63 The Common African Position also stated the following: While the definition of coercion in this context requires further study and deliberation between States, the African Union is of the view that it is not necessary, in order to constitute coercion, that the conduct of a State must rise to the level of completely depriving a foreign State of its freedom of choice or to compel that State to either act or refrain from acting involuntarily. Coercion may also occur through threats of intervention. Furthermore, there is no requirement that, in order to constitute a violation of the prohibition on intervention, an act of coercion must actually succeed in compelling the State subjected to such acts to change its conduct. An unsuccessful attempt of intervention is unlawful under international law. The African Union stresses that offers or calls to peacefully settle disputes through negotiation, enquiry, mediation, conciliation, good offices, arbitration, and judicial settlement, and diplomatic\n\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\n\nIn some respects, the understanding of coercion in the Common African Position is similar to other definitions of coercion, but it also diverges from these definitions in significant ways. The Common African Position defined coercion as conduct that ‘impose[s] restraints on the will of a foreign State’. This is broadly analogous to the notion of impinging on the freedom of choice of States, which is central to the coercion-as-control model. However, the Common African Position also indicates that the purpose of intervention is to ‘influence the conduct of a foreign State’. This echoes definitions that understand coercion as conduct that aims at modifying the behavior of a State by subverting, manipulating, or undermining its decision-making processes.\nCompared to other definitions of coercion, however, the Common African Position was purposively designed to broaden the protective scope of the prohibition on intervention. It does so by adopting a lower threshold of (actual or threatened) effects that must be crossed for conduct to amount to coercion. This is clearly expressed in the following sentence: ‘the African Union is of the view that it is not necessary, in order to constitute coercion, that the conduct of a State must rise to the level of completely depriving a foreign State of its freedom of choice or to compel that State to either act or refrain from acting involuntarily’.⁶⁵ In other words, the principal point of divergence between the Common African Position and the positions of other States relates to the threshold of coercion. For the member States of the African Union, intervention is any conduct undertaken by a State that imposes restraints on another State in relation to matters within its domestic jurisdiction. However, those restraints need not be of such severity that they cause a State to act involuntarily nor do they need to reach a level of intensity that completely deprives that State of its freedom of choice or control over matters within its domestic jurisdiction.\nIt is notable that, in an initial draft of the Common African Position that this author had prepared while serving as the African Union Special Rapporteur on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace, coercion was defined in the following terms: ‘coercion, in the context of the prohibition on intervention, should be defined as a policy that is designed to impose material restraints on the will of a foreign State’. The adjective ‘material’ was intended ⁶⁴ Ibid., at para. 32.\n⁶⁵ Ibid.\nHELAL to signify that, in order to amount to intervention, the restraints imposed on a State must attain an elevated level of severity, which would ensure that non-intervention would not be an over-inclusive rule.\nThis initial draft of the Common African Position was welcomed by the AU Peace and Security Council,⁶⁶ and served as the basis for the interstate negotiations that led to the adoption of the Common African Position, which were held in Tunisia from 29 November to 1 December 2023.⁶⁷ During these negotiations, however, the AU member States decided to delete the adjective 'material'. The member States determined that the word 'restraints' sufficiently and accurately captured the essence of the prohibition on intervention. Many States described non-intervention as a rule that is intended to protect the policy autonomy of States and to enable States to manage their internal and external affairs free from 'restraints' that might be imposed by other States. The AU member States also agreed that, when read in the context of the entire section on non-intervention in the Common African Position, the prohibition on intervention was not over-inclusive.\n## 2.4 The Element of Intent Many States also included the element of the intent in their definitions of coercion. New Zealand articulated this element unambiguously. Its position paper affirmed that the 'coercive intention of the state actor is a critical element of the rule' and underscored that 'intention may in some circumstances be inferred from the effects of cyber activity'.⁶⁸ Similarly, Costa Rica's position paper noted that '[f]or such breaches [of the prohibition on intervention] to occur, it suffices that a State intends to coerce another State, employs coercive methods, or eventually causes coercive effects in another State'.⁶⁹ Czechia's position paper used similar terms. It stated that '[c]oercion is an activity intended to deprive' a State of control over matters within its domaine réservé.⁷⁰ ⁶⁶ See AU Peace and Security Council, 'Communiqué No. 1171' (24 August 2023) AU Doc. PSC/PR/COMM.1171 (2023), at para. 2: 'Welcomes the Draft Statement by the AUCIL on the Application of International Law to the Use of ICTs in Cyberspace prepared by the Special Rapporteur, which was adopted and endorsed by the 22nd Ordinary Session of the AUCIL in June 2023'.\n⁶⁷ AU Office of the Legal Counsel BC/OLC/42.23/13793.23 (on file with the author).\n⁶⁸ New Zealand Foreign Affairs and Trade, 'The Application of International Law to State Activity in Cyberspace', at para. 9(b).\n⁶⁹ Costa Rican Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 'Costa Rica's Position on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace', at 7 (emphasis added).\n⁷⁰ Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 'Position Paper on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace', at para. 9(b).\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE Other States also included the element of intent in their definition of coercion, but only implicitly. For instance, Norway stated that holding elections is an example of an activity that falls within the *domaine réservé* of a State. Therefore, according to Norway, 'carrying out cyber operations with the intent of altering election results in another State' would violate the prohibition on intervention.[71] Furthermore, Canada,[72] Denmark,[73] and the US,[74] understood coercion as conduct that is *designed* to achieve a specific purpose or effect (such as modifying the behavior of the target State). As noted above, the Common African Position also understood coercion as conduct that is *'designed* to impose restraints on the will of a foreign State'. The use of the term *'designed'* by these position papers introduces the element of intent into the definition of coercion. It indicates that the coercing State is acting purposefully and intentionally and employing its resources in a systematic and strategic manner to achieve specific policy objectives.\nOther States used similar phrases that also make the intent of the coercing State an element of the definition of coercion. The Netherlands and Romania defined coercion as conduct *'the goal'* of which is changing the behavior of the target State. Likewise, Estonia and Poland described coercion as conduct that *'aimed'* at achieving a specific objective. Estonia, for example, stated that 'cyber operations that *aim* to force another nation to act in an involuntary manner or to refrain from acting in a certain manner' would amount to intervention.[77] Poland also stated that '[t]o be in breach of international law, HELAL an intervention must include the element of coercion that aims at influencing the state's decisions belonging to its domaine réservé.78 Again, using phrases like: 'the goal of' intervention, or saying that coercion is conduct 'that aims at', presupposes that the coercing State is acting intentionally. It indicates that the coercing State has identified a policy objective – an aim or a goal – which it is seeking to achieve by engaging in cyberoperations against another State.\n## 2.5 Sovereignty, Intervention, and the Use of Force: Demarcating the Doctrinal Boundaries In addition to articulating definitions of coercion and offering examples of conduct that amounts to coercion, many States addressed the question of the relation between, on one hand, the prohibition on intervention and, on the other, the obligation to respect the territorial sovereignty of States and the prohibition on the threat or use of force. The content and scope of application of these three rules overlap significantly. As the ICJ observed in the Nicaragua Case, '[t]he effects of the principle of respect for territorial sovereignty inevitably overlap with those of the principles of the prohibition of the use of force and of non-intervention'.79 To disentangle the interconnection between these three rules, many States expressed views on the threshold of effects that must be crossed for conduct to amount to a violation of each of these rules. Surveying national and regional position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace reveals that States have approached this question from three different angles. The first relates to categories of conduct that – by their very nature – do not constitute a breach of the prohibition on intervention because they fall below the threshold of coercion. Nonetheless, some States noted that conduct that does not amount to intervention because it falls below the threshold of coercion may still be wrongful because it violates the principle of state sovereignty. The second is the higher threshold of coercion, which many States identified as the point at which non-intervention intersects with the prohibition on the threat or use of force. The third relates to the threshold at which non-forcible conduct – such as information operations, election interference, or economic sanctions – amount to coercion.\n\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE ## 2.6 Conduct below the Threshold of Coercion Many States identified certain forms of conduct that do not amount to unlawful intervention because they are considered non-coercive. Several Western States argued that practices designed to persuade a State to change its behavior or to influence its policies are lawful, even if such practices involve criticism of that State. These Western States argued that such conduct is commonplace in international relations, which means that it should not be condemned as a form of intervention.⁸⁰ This was a point of convergence among Western States regardless of the definitions of coercion they adopted.\nFor example, in its position paper, Czechia, which defined coercion as acts that deprive a State of control over matters within its *domaine réservé*, stated that '[m]ere influencing, criticism or persuasion do not meet the requirements to be qualified as prohibited intervention'.⁸¹ Similarly, Denmark, which defined coercion as conduct that causes a State to behave in a manner it would not have engaged in voluntarily, stated that 'a distinction must be drawn between activities that merely involve influencing, as opposed to compelling, the voluntary actions of a target State. Acts of influence, such as persuasion, criticism, and public diplomacy are insufficient to qualify as an intervention'.⁸² Germany also noted that 'harsher forms of communication such as pointed commentary and sharp criticism as well as (persistent) attempts to obtain, through discussion, a certain reaction or the performance of a certain measure from another State do not as such qualify as coercion'.⁸³ Sweden also opined that 'criticism or other ways of influencing through diplomatic means' does not qualify as coercion.⁸⁴ Likewise, Canada, which was among the States that defined coercion as depriving a State of control over its *domaine réservé*, stated that '[c]oercion must be distinguished from other conduct such as public diplomacy, criticism, persuasion, and propaganda'.⁸⁵ The UK also distinguished between coercive conduct, which is unlawful, and the freedom of States 'to make their views known about processes in other countries – delivering hard, sometimes ⁸⁰ See for example: Finnish Ministry for Foreign Affairs, 'Finland's Views on International Law and Cyberspace', at 463 ('[t]he requirement of coercion leaves out lesser forms of influence and persuasion that are commonplace in international relations').\n⁸¹ Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 'Position Paper on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace', at para. 13.\n⁸² Danish Government, 'Denmark's Position Paper on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace', at 450.\n⁸³ UNGA, 'Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions', at 34.\n⁸⁴ Swedish Government Offices, 'Position Paper on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace', at 3.\n⁸⁵ Canadian Government, 'International Law Applicable in Cyberspace'.\nHELAL unwelcome messages, and drawing attention to concerns. This is part and parcel of international relations.⁸⁶ Similarly, Austria stated that ‘[i]t is important to distinguish such disinformation campaigns from lawful public relations activities of state representatives, including e.g. by openly criticising the human rights situation in another state on social media accounts or websites’.⁸⁷ The Common African Position adopted a different approach regarding conduct that falls below the threshold of coercion. It stated: ‘offers or calls to peacefully settle disputes through negotiation, enquiry, mediation, conciliation, good offices, arbitration, and judicial settlement, and diplomatic discussions and communications are presumed not to constitute acts of coercion’.⁸⁸ The first portion of this sentence is based on Article 33 of the UN Charter. It indicates that efforts to settle disputes peacefully are not considered coercive. The second portion of this sentence – ‘diplomatic discussions and communications are presumed not to constitute acts of coercion’ – was designed to signal that diplomatic correspondences, whether written or verbal, are generally not considered coercive. The keyword here is *presumed*, which was inserted because history is replete with cases in which diplomatic communications were employed as instruments of coercion. Perhaps the most (in)famous ultimatum ever – the Austro-Hungarian ultimatum to Serbia that started World War I – was delivered via a diplomatic note.⁸⁹ Similarly, in a series of meetings that were held in 1945 and 1946 between Soviet and Turkish diplomats, the USSR attempted to coerce Turkey into redrawing the international frontier between the two States and granting the USSR access to and control over the Turkish straits.⁹⁰ This sentence in the Common African Position was also intended to signal that the member States of the African Union did not share the view adopted by Western States that other practices such as public diplomacy, criticism, propaganda, unwelcome messages and other conduct that, for instance, the UK described as ‘part and parcel of international relations’ could never be coercive.\nThis approach in the Common African Position is consistent with the positions expressed by African and other developing States during the negotiations on the 1970 Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning ⁸⁶ Braverman, ‘International Law in Future Frontiers’.\n⁸⁷ Austrian Government, ‘Position Paper of the Republic of Austria’, at 5.\n⁸⁸ ‘Common African Position’, at para. 32.\n⁸⁹ See ‘Austria’s Ultimatum to Serbia: Full Text of the Document That Started the World War, and Serbia’s Reply to It’ (1918) 9 Current History 554–558.\n⁹⁰ O. Isci, ‘Turkey at a Crossroads: The Soviet Threat and Postwar Realignment, 1945–1946’ (2023) 47 Diplomatic History 621–646.\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE Friendly Relations and Co-Operation Among States. During discussions on that declaration, several Western States proposed adding a caveat that stated that non-intervention did not affect [t]he generally recognized freedom of states to seek to influence the policies and actions of other states, in accordance with international law and settled international practice and in a manner compatible with the principle of sovereign equality States and the duty to cooperate in accordance with the Charter.[91] Non-Western States opposed this proposal because innocuous phrases like 'settled international practice' or acts that 'seek to influence the policies and actions of other states' were viewed as a potential backdoor that would justify interventionist policies by powerful States.[92] For African States, determining whether 'criticism', 'public diplomacy', or so-called 'unwelcome messages' amount to intervention can only be established on the basis of an holistic, case-by-case evaluation of the facts.\nSeveral States also argued that, because of the element of coercion, the threshold that must be crossed for conduct to amount to intervention was higher than that which applied to violations of state sovereignty.[93] Switzerland's position paper expressed this understanding of the relationship between these two principles – sovereignty and non-intervention – clearly. It stated: HELAL An infringement of sovereignty and a prohibited intervention are not the same. The latter must be coercive in nature, i.e. through its intervention a state seeks to cause another to act (or refrain from acting) in a way it would not otherwise. This means that the threshold for a breach of the non-intervention principle is significantly higher than that for a violation of state sovereignty.⁹⁴ Finland adopted the same view. Its position paper stated: ‘[c]ompared to a violation of sovereignty, the requirement of coercive nature and that of domaine réservé make the threshold of prohibited intervention considerably higher’.⁹⁵ Poland’s position paper similarly stated that ‘[t]he threshold for considering a specific operation in cyberspace to be in breach of the principle of non-intervention is higher than in the case of deeming it solely a violation of the principle of sovereignty’.⁹⁶ Canada also underscored that ‘[w]hether or not a cyber activity meets the threshold for a violation of the rule on territorial sovereignty or rises to the level of a violation of the rule against intervention will be determined on a case-by-case basis’.⁹⁷ Israel also viewed sovereignty and non-intervention as being closely related, but noted that acts of intervention are ‘understood as having a high threshold’.⁹⁸ ## 2.7 Forcible Intervention as the Higher Threshold of Coercion Many States adopted the position that the threat or use of force is a form of coercion.⁹⁹ Several States also described the threat or use of force as the gravest ⁹⁴ UNGA, ‘Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions’, at 87.\n⁹⁵ Finnish Ministry for Foreign Affairs, ‘Finland’s Views on International Law and Cyberspace’, at 464.\n⁹⁶ Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, ‘The Republic of Poland’s Position on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace’ (‘The threshold for considering a specific operation in cyberspace to be in breach of the principle of non-intervention is higher than in the case of deeming it solely a violation of the principle of sovereignty’).\n⁹⁷ Canadian Government, ‘International Law Applicable in Cyberspace’.\n⁹⁸ Schöndorf, ‘Israel’s Perspective on Key Legal and Practical Issues Concerning the Application of International Law to Cyber Operations’, at 403.\n⁹⁹ See for example Costa Rican Ministry of Foreign Affairs, ‘Costa Rica’s Position on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace’: (‘Coercion is clear-cut when a State uses or threatens to use force against another one’); Danish Government, ‘Denmark’s Position Paper on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace’ (‘coercive acts involving the use of force are particularly obvious examples of unlawful interventions’); UNGA, ‘Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions’, at 57 (Netherlands: ‘the use of force will always meet the definition of coercion. Use of force against another state is always a form of intervention’).\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE form of coercion.¹⁰⁰ Some States, such as France and the Netherlands, also emphasized that acts that constitute a threat or use of force could also concurrently violate both the prohibition on intervention and state sovereignty.¹⁰¹ Many States also argued that the threshold of non-forceful coercion is lower than the threshold of forceful coercion. For example, Denmark underscored that 'coercion is not limited to means of direct or indirect use of force and that also measures below this threshold may constitute coercion'.¹⁰² Similarly, Germany stated: '[m]alicious cyber activities will only in some cases amount to direct or indirect use of force. However, measures below this threshold may also qualify as coercive'.¹⁰³ The UK and the US also expressed this view.¹⁰⁴ The Common African Position did not take an express position on whether there is a distinction between the threshold of the use of force and the threshold of intervention. Rather, the Common African Position affirmed that the prohibition on intervention is a broad rule that applies to any forcible or non-forcible instrument of statecraft that might be used as means of coercion. It stated: '[t]he prohibition on intervention applies to the use of any instrument, including armed, political, economic, or any other means, and instruments of information, that may be used by a State for the purposes of intervening in the HELAL internal or external affairs of a foreign State'.¹⁰⁵ Brazil adopted the same view. It stated: 'the customary norm prohibiting intervention in the internal affairs of another State applies irrespective of the means or medium used and extends to the use of ICTs by States'.¹⁰⁶ Similarly, Costa Rica stated: Coercion is clear-cut when a State uses or threatens to use force against another one. Nonetheless, it can also occur in a multitude of ways where one State, directly or indirectly through support for non-State actors, deprives another State of the capacity to make free and informed choices pertaining to its internal or external affairs.¹⁰⁷ In short, there is evidence of a consensus among those States that have issued national or regional position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace that the threat or use of force is, *ipso facto*, a form of coercion that is wrongful under both the prohibition on the threat or use of force and the prohibition on intervention. These position papers also show that there is a consensus on the principle that non-forcible conduct could also amount to intervention. The point of divergence, however, relates to the threshold of coercion that applies to non-forcible conduct. This is the subject of the next section.\n## 2.8 The Threshold of Non-forcible Coercion This question of the exact threshold at which non-forcible conduct amounts to coercion is of critical importance. This is because most acts of unlawful intervention that could be undertaken through cyberspace are likely to fall below the threshold of forcible intervention. For example, activities such as election interference or disinformation campaigns will almost always fall below the threshold of the use of force.¹⁰⁸ In fact, this is precisely the area – conduct below the threshold of the use of force, but above the threshold of violations of territorial sovereignty – where the prohibition on intervention is most relevant.\n¹⁰⁵ Helal, ‘Common African Position’, at para. 29.\n¹⁰⁶ UNGA, ‘Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions’, at 18.\n¹⁰⁷ Costa Rican Ministry of Foreign Affairs, ‘Costa Rica’s Position on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace’, at 7.\n¹⁰⁸ M. Schmitt, “Virtual” Disenfranchisement: Cyber Election Meddling in the Grey Zones of International Law’ (2018) 19 Chicago Journal of International Law 30–67, at 40 (Arguing that ‘because of the relatively high consequential threshold for violation, it is unlikely, although not inconceivable, that cyber election meddling would qualify as an unlawful use of force’).\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE National and regional position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace reveal that there is no consistency among States on the question of the threshold of coercion that applies to non-forcible intervention. This lack of consistency is evident even among States that adopted the same definition of coercion. In other words, even where there is some convergence among States on the meaning of coercion at a theoretical level, there are notable divergences on how the concept of coercion applies in real-world situations.\nAmong the States that defined coercion as conduct that modifies the behavior of a State or causes it to act involuntarily, there were notable differences in the terminology used to describe the threshold that applies to non-forcible coercion. Germany contended that, to constitute an act of intervention, a cyberoperation must be 'comparable in scale and effect to coercion in non-cyber contexts'. According to Germany, to meet the threshold of coercion, a cyberoperation must have the effect of 'significantly influenc[ing] or thwart[ing]' the decision-making process of a State to the point where its 'will is manifestly bent'.[109] Although it did not specify a definite threshold that non-forcible conduct must meet to constitute an act of intervention, Switzerland noted that a cyberoperation could amount to economic coercion if it paralyzed the operation of a 'company that is systemically relevant'.[110] On the other hand, Poland indicated that, to constitute coercion, the foreign State's conduct must 'adversely affect' the 'functioning and security of the political, economic, military or social system of a state'.[111] Norway also provided examples of non-forcible coercive conduct that included 'manipulating election systems', 'unduly influencing public opinion', and 'causing a temporary shutdown' of critical infrastructure.[112] Denmark and Romania, both of which also defined coercion as conduct that modifies the behavior of a State or causes it to act involuntarily, did not explicitly identify a specific threshold at which non-forcible conduct could be considered coercive. Instead, Romania stated that an act of intervention must be intended to 'effectively change' the behavior of a State and underscored that 'there has to be a causal nexus between the coercive act and the effect on the internal or external affairs of the target State'.[113] Denmark's position paper also stated that 'an act may be considered of a coercive nature when the act HELAL of interference has a potential for compelling the target State to engage in an action that it would otherwise not take.¹¹⁴ To this writer, the thresholds of coercion adopted by Germany and Switzerland are substantially higher than the thresholds adopted by Poland and Norway. The phrase ‘significantly influencing or thwarting’ that was used by Germany and the words ‘paralysis’ and ‘systemically relevant’ that Switzerland used signify a notably higher threshold of coercion than the term ‘adverse effects’ that was used by Poland and the phrases ‘manipulating election systems’ and ‘unduly influencing public opinion’ that Norway used. Denmark appears to have adopted an even lower threshold of coercion. For Denmark, a cyberoperation need not have an actual effect on the target State to be considered wrongful under the prohibition on intervention. Rather, a cyberoperation that merely has the ‘potential for compelling’ a State crosses the threshold of coercion. On the other hand, for Romania, the ‘potential’ to compel a State is insufficient. Rather, to constitute intervention, Romania requires that a State must be the target of a cyberoperation that has a measurable effect on the coerced State and that is causally connected to the behavior of the coercing State.\nThere are similar inconsistencies among the States that defined coercion as conduct that deprives a State of its freedom of choice or control over its domaine réservé. Australia, New Zealand, and Canada adopted broadly similar definitions of the threshold of coercion. According to Australia, conduct is coercive if it ‘effectively deprive[s]’ or is ‘intended to deprive’ a State of control over matters of an inherently sovereign nature.¹¹⁵ As discussed above, for Australia, examples of coercion include: ‘manipulating the electoral system to alter the results of an election’ or undermining the ‘fundamental operation of Parliament’ or the ‘stability of States’ financial systems.¹¹⁶ Similarly, for New Zealand, conduct is coercive if it has ‘significant effects’ on a State’s domaine réservé.¹¹⁷ Examples of acts that meet this threshold include ‘manipulating the voting tally’ in an election, preventing a ‘significant part of the electorate’ from voting, and causing ‘significant damage’ or ‘loss of functionality’ to critical infrastructure.¹¹⁸ According to Canada, intervention is conduct that has ‘coercive ¹¹⁴ Danish Government, ‘Denmark’s Position Paper on the Application of International Law in Cyberspace’, at 450.\n¹¹⁵ UNGA, ‘Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions’, at 5.\n¹¹⁶ Ibid.\n¹¹⁷ New Zealand Foreign Affairs and Trade, ‘The Application of International Law to State Activity in Cyberspace’, at para. 9(b).\n¹¹⁸ Ibid.\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE effects that deprive, compel, or impose an outcome on the affected State'. Again, as noted above, for Canada, examples of coercion include influencing the outcome of an election through a cyberoperation that 'hacks and disables a State's election commission' or by 'preventing a significant number of citizens from voting', in addition to 'disrupt[ing] the functioning of a major gas pipeline' to affect a State's negotiating position.[119] Finland provided similar examples of coercion. It noted that to constitute intervention in an election, the conduct of a foreign State must 'be of a serious nature', examples of which are altering electoral results through 'hacking of voter databases or manipulation of vote'.[120] Brazil, Czechia, Costa Rica, and the UK used different terms to describe the threshold of coercion. Brazil understood coercion as conduct 'affecting the right' of a State to choose its political, economic, social and cultural system and to formulate its foreign policy.[121] Czechia stated that an act is coercive if it 'intentionally aims to influence the State's free will and choice'.[122] For Costa Rica, conduct amounts to coercion if it impinges on a State's ability to make 'free and informed choices'. As noted above, Costa Rica also provided several examples of coercive conduct. These included: 'subversive or hostile propaganda', 'dissemination of false news', 'significant political or economic pressure', 'crippling or simply interfering' with public services, 'interfering with ballots or voter databases', and 'electoral disinformation campaigns'.[123] Like Costa Rica, the UK provided a wide-range of examples of coercive conduct. These included 'disruption of systems controlling emergency medical transport', 'causing hospital computer systems to cease functioning', 'disruption of supply chains for essential medicines and vaccines', 'preventing the operation of power generation infrastructure' or disrupting power supplies to 'housing, healthcare, education, civil administration and banking facilities and infrastructure', interfering with 'financial services' that are crucial to a State's financial system, and disrupting a State's 'fundamental ability to conduct monetary policy'.[124] To this writer, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada adopted a higher threshold of coercion than that which Brazil, Czechia, Costa Rica, and the UK adopted. The former repeatedly used the word 'significant' to describe the HELAL effects that the conduct of a State must have in order to constitute coercion. Moreover, for those States, election interference must actually alter the results of an election to amount to intervention. Brazil, Czechia, Costa Rica, and the UK, however, used terms and phrases such as 'affecting', 'aims to influence', and 'free and informed choices' to describe the effects of the conduct of a foreign State. These terms signify a lower threshold of coercion. Indeed, unlike Australia, New Zealand, and Canada, the position papers of Brazil, Czechia, Costa Rica, and the UK did not require election interference to rise to the level of changing the results of an election to amount to intervention. Rather, these States used terms that would condemn as unlawful a broader range of forms of election interference. The UK, for instance, stated that covert operations that 'interfere with free and fair electoral processes' are a form of coercion,[125] while Costa Rica stated that launching disinformation campaigns and the dissemination of false news could constitute forms of unlawful electoral interference.\nAs noted above, the Common African Position did not identify a specific threshold at which non-forcible conduct amounts to coercion. Rather, the Common African Position noted that the definition of coercion requires further study among States, and explicitly rejected the thresholds that other States adopted in their position papers. The Common African Position stated: 'it is not necessary, in order to constitute coercion, that the conduct of a State must rise to the level of completely depriving a foreign State of its freedom of choice or to compel that State to either act or refrain from acting involuntarily'.[126] This review of national and regional position papers reveals that there are three points of convergence among States on the question of the thresholds that delineate the boundaries of the prohibition on intervention. First, there is a consensus that the threat or use of force always crosses the threshold of coercion. Second, there is a consensus that non-intervention is a broad rule that covers both forcible and non-forcible forms of coercion. Third, there is a consensus that there are certain forms of conduct that, by their very nature, fall below the threshold of coercion. There is no consensus, however, on a specific list or catalogue of acts that are ipso facto non-coercive. However, given the positions expressed by Western States, it is reasonable to conclude that there is at least a general concurrence on the view expressed in the Common African Position that calls to settle disputes peacefully are not coercive. Beyond that, the main point of divergence among States relates to the threshold at which non-forcible conduct amounts to coercion. Indeed, as Canada noted: 'further COERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE State practice and opinio juris will help clarify the thresholds for the rule of non-intervention, and the scope of customary law in this area over time'.127 This is a question of paramount importance to understanding how non-intervention applies in cyberspace and other domains. As noted above, the utility of the prohibition on intervention is that it protects States against conduct that is more serious than an infringement on the territorial sovereignty of a State but that does not rise to the level of a threat or use of force. This issue – the threshold at which non-forcible conduct amounts to coercion – has not been addressed by the ICJ and remains a subject of scholarly debate.128 Some scholars have argued that coercion is unsuited to function as an element of the prohibition on intervention, at least as it applies in cyberspace. For example, Duncan Hollis has opined that coercion may not be readily applicable to influence operations that use cyberspace to manipulate public opinion or disrupt the domestic political processes of a foreign State, such as Russia's interference in the 2016 US presidential election.129 Similarly, Ido Kilovaty has written that 'the norm of non-intervention, in its current narrow understanding, is almost irrelevant in a world where States increasingly resort to cyber operations as a method of interference [...] Coercion cannot contain the diversity of threats posed by new technologies. A new standard is, therefore, required'.130 In my view, we do not need a new standard. The challenge facing the application of the prohibition on intervention in cyberspace, and in other domains such as economic sanctions, is that there is no agreement among States on either the definition of coercion or on the minimum threshold of effects that must be met for conduct to constitute coercion. Any understanding of non-intervention must include a conceptual tool that distinguishes between unlawful intervention and lawful conduct that influences the policies of States. Whether that conceptual tool is called 'coercion', 'dictatorial interference',131 HELAL ‘imperative pressure’,¹³² ‘forcible compulsion or restraint’,¹³³ or any other term is immaterial. What matters is the threshold of effects that defines and captures the essence of ‘coercion’, which can be applied to determine when specific conduct amounts to intervention. This is the question that Section 3 of this article addresses.\n## 3 Towards a Unified Threshold of Coercion It is impossible, given the limitations of space, to comprehensively address the question of the threshold of coercion that applies to non-forcible conduct. This is a topic that requires further research. Nonetheless, in this section, this article will offer a general sketch of a threshold that could be employed to determine when non-forcible conduct amounts to coercion, thereby violating the prohibition on intervention. Specifically, this section proposes the adoption of a single, unified threshold of coercion that applies equally to both forcible and non-forcible intervention. According to this approach, non-forcible conduct would amount to coercion if its scale and effects are comparable to conduct that amounts to a violation of the prohibition on the threat or use of force.\nTwo considerations support this approach. The first is historical. Throughout its evolution, the prohibition on intervention was understood as a cognate of the prohibition on the threat or use of force.¹³⁴ Non-intervention was designed to extend the protections afforded to States under the prohibition on the threat or use of force to non-forcible – but no less pernicious – instruments of statecraft. The second consideration is conceptual. The definitions of coercion that appear in national position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace that some States have issued impose an unreasonably high threshold of effects that must be met for non-forcible conduct to amount to an act of intervention. Defining coercion as causing a State to act ‘involuntarily’ or ‘depriving’ it of freedom of choice requires causing effects or ¹³² R. Buchan and N. Tsagourias, ‘The Crisis in Crimea and the Principle of Non-Intervention’ (2017) 19 International Community Law Review 165–193, at 171 (‘Coercion denotes “imperative pressure” which manipulates the will of a state in order to extract some advantage or concession’).\n¹³³ T. Gill, ‘Non-Intervention in the Cyber Context’ in K. Ziolkowski (ed.), *Peacetime Regime for State Activities in Cyberspace: International Law, International Relations and Diplomacy* 217–238, at 223 (“Coercion” implies forcible compulsion or restraint’).\n¹³⁴ Milanovic, ‘Revisiting Coercion as an Element of Prohibited Intervention in International Law’, at 607.\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE Before proceeding, one point merits special emphasis. The unified threshold of coercion that I propose here should not be understood as signaling that the prohibition on the use of force and the prohibition on intervention are coterminous. At least one writer has recently suggested that ‘under the *lex lata* the prohibition on intervention only applies to acts amounting to a use of force or constituting support for the violent overthrow of a foreign regime’.¹³⁵ I disagree. As discussed below, at least since the adoption of the 1970 Friendly Relations Declaration, there has been a consensus among States that non-intervention is a broad rule that proscribes all forms of intervention, whether undertaken through forcible or non-forcible means. However, because there is no agreement among States on the meaning of coercion, there is continued uncertainty regarding when non-forcible conduct amounts to unlawful intervention. The unified threshold of coercion addresses this question by proposing a single test that applies to all forms of intervention, including armed force, or the use of political, economic, or informational instruments of statecraft, or some combination thereof.\n## 3.1 Coercion in the History of the Prohibition on Intervention As argued in detail in another study by the present author, until the *Nicaragua Case* was decided by the ICJ in 1986, the concept of coercion was not defined, nor was it viewed as the cornerstone of the prohibition on intervention.¹³⁶ Moreover, throughout its evolution, States never understood intervention as conduct that causes a State to act involuntarily or that deprives it of its freedom of choice or control over its domestic jurisdiction. This is why, to this writer, the definitions of coercion that States have included in their national and regional position papers should be viewed as proposals *de lege ferenda*, and not restatements of established *lex lata*. To substantiate this claim, this ¹³⁵ O. Pomson, ‘The Prohibition on Intervention Under International Law and Cyber Operations’ (2022) 99 International Law Studies 180–219, at 183.\n¹³⁶ M. Helal, ‘Intervention, Force &amp; Coercion – An Historical Inquiry on the Evolution of the Prohibition on Intervention’ (2024) 103 International Law Studies (forthcoming).\nHELAL section provides an overview of the terms and travaux préparatoires of the principal instruments in which the prohibition on intervention was codified. This overview begins with three Inter-American treaties that first included non-intervention as a distinct rule of international law, followed by the 1970 Friendly Relations Declaration, the adoption of which marked the acceptance of the prohibition on intervention as a rule of general international law.\nThe prohibition on intervention originated as a rule of conventional international law in the Inter-American system. It was first codified in Article 8 of the 1933 Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States, which reads as follows: 'No State has the right to intervene in the internal or external affairs of another'.[137] The prohibition on intervention was further reaffirmed and its scope was expanded with the adoption of the 1936 Additional Protocol Relative to Non-Intervention, Article I of which states: 'The High Contracting Parties declare inadmissible the intervention of any one of them, directly or indirectly, and for whatever reason, in the internal or external affairs of any other of the Parties'.[138] The principal purpose of these provisions was to overturn the right of States to resort to acts of intervention, which was established under 19th century international law. At the time, States were permitted wage war or to engage in so-called measures short of war – i.e., acts of intervention – for an expansive range of reasons.[139] These included preserving the balance of power, repelling attacks against a State's territory, preempting an imminent armed attack, obtaining reparation for injuries inflicted on the interests or honor of the State, protecting the lives and property of citizens, securing the repayment of debts, and preventing mass atrocities.[140] Intervention was accepted as permissible COERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE because it was predicated on the right of self-preservation,¹⁴¹ which was recognized as a fundamental right of States.¹⁴² Given that they were often the target of forcible and non-forcible acts of intervention by the European powers and the United States,¹⁴³ Latin American States and scholars championed the cause of codifying an absolute prohibition on intervention as a rule of international law in the Inter-American system.¹⁴⁴ This objective was achieved with the adoption of the 1933 Montevideo Convention, the 1936 Non-Intervention Protocol, and the 1948 Charter of the Organization of American States, which included the broadest formulation of the prohibition on intervention.\nDuring the negotiations on the 1933 Montevideo Convention and the 1936 Non-Intervention Protocol, coercion was not defined; it was not identified as a constituent element of the prohibition on intervention, nor were acts of intervention understood as involving conduct that causes a State to behave involuntarily or that deprives a State of freedom of choice or control over its domain réservé.¹⁴⁵ Indeed, the term 'coercion' does not even appear in either of these treaties. However, during the negotiations on the 1933 Montevideo Convention, a subcommittee composed of Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, Ecuador, El-Salvador, Haiti, and Peru that had been entrusted with drafting the convention prepared a report that provides an insight into how the negotiating parties understood the term 'intervention'. In its report, the subcommittee defined 'the juridical concept of intervention' as follows: Any act of a State, through diplomatic representation, by armed force, or by any other means involving effective force, with a view to making the State's will dominate the will of another State, and, in general, any maneuver, interference or interposition of any sort, employing such means, either directly or indirectly in matter of the obligations of another State, whatever its motive, shall be considered as Intervention, and likewise a violation of International Law.\nIt would seem quite unnecessary to state that the Sub-Committee was, and is, in perfect accord that any friendly act to offer good offices and HELAL mediation in the foreign relations of States in order to maintain peace is, by its very nature, outside the definition of intervention. This applies also to the united action of the formation of the League of Nations, the universal peace agent, of which the majority of the American States are members.^[146]^ The first sentence of this definition is instructive. The key phrase here is 'effective force with a view to making the State's will dominate the will of another State'. To this writer, it indicates that the drafters of the 1933 Montevideo Convention understood intervention as encompassing the use of armed force and any non-forcible conduct the effects of which are comparable to the use of force. This understanding of intervention was echoed by several States during the negotiations on the convention. Ecuador, for example stated: 'We have outlawed war. What is intervention but a kind of war, disguised and wary.'^[147]^ Argentina also stated: 'What is intervention, then, but violence? [...] Intervention is violence.'^[148]^ El Salvador also defined intervention in identical terms. It stated: 'Because the American conscience is such that territorial acquisitions originated by violence cannot be recognized; that violence has generally come to disturb the life of our countries in the form of intervention.'^[149]^ Peru shared this understanding of intervention. It argued in favor of adopting Article 8 of the 1933 Montevideo Convention because 'war is proscribed, so is violence, but not the use of arms, the diplomatic measures or any other means of effective compulsion.'^[150]^ The Charter of the Organization of American States, which was adopted in 1948,^[151]^ incorporated and expanded on the provisions on non-intervention in the 1933 Montevideo Convention and the 1936 Non-Intervention Protocol. Article 19 and 20 of the OAS Charter state: ## Article 19 No State or group of States has the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatever, in the internal or external affairs of any other State. The foregoing principle prohibits not only armed force but also any\n\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE\n\n## Article 20\nNo State may use or encourage the use of coercive measures of an economic or political character in order to force the sovereign will of another State and obtain from it advantages of any kind.\nArticle 19 of the OAS Charter includes two sentences, the first of which is virtually identical to Article 1 of 1936 Non-Intervention Protocol, which itself was based on Article 8 of the 1933 Montevideo Convention. Like its antecedents, the principal purpose of the first sentence of Article 19 was to reaffirm that, at least in Inter-American international law, the right of intervention that was recognized in 19th century international law was abolished. The inclusion of the phrase 'for whatever reason', which first appeared in the 1936 Non-Intervention Protocol, also indicated that non-intervention was an absolute rule that admitted no exceptions. Accordingly, the grounds that had previously been invoked to justify intervention – such as protecting citizens abroad, collecting debts, or enforcing international law – were no longer valid.\nThe second sentence of Article 19 clarified a principle that was only implicit in the 1933 Montevideo Convention and the 1936 Non-Intervention Protocol. It confirmed that non-intervention proscribed both the use of armed force and any other instrument of statecraft to engage in acts of intervention. Although, as noted above, the subcommittee that drafted the 1933 Montevideo Convention had affirmed that intervention could be undertaken 'through diplomatic representation, by armed force, or any other means involving effective force', this was not explicitly stated in either the 1933 Montevideo Convention or the 1936 Non-Intervention Protocol. The second sentence of Article 19 was also intended to prohibit acts of subversion that seek to impinge on the political independence of a State by subjugating it or transforming it into a satellite of a foreign power or that undermine its capacity to manage its political, economic, and cultural affairs autonomously.[152]\n\nHELAL Article 20 of the OAS Charter is the first provision in which the term ‘coercion’ is used in relation to the prohibition on intervention. Coercion was not used, however, in order to signify the defining characteristic of intervention, nor was it designed to function as the conceptual tool that distinguishes between unlawful intervention and lawful conduct that seeks to influence the behavior of States. Rather, the authors of the OAS Charter drafted Article 20 with two objectives in mind. First, this provision was intended to proscribe economic sanctions that are imposed unilaterally by a State in response to an injury inflicted upon it by another State, and second, it was intended to outlaw the use of economic or political instruments of statecraft to pressure a State into giving concessions against its will. This becomes apparent from the negotiating history of Article 20.\nThis provision was formulated on the basis of two proposals that were submitted by Brazil and Cuba during the negotiations on the OAS Charter. The Cuban proposal stated: ‘No American State may unilaterally apply to another coercive measures of an economic nature that constitute retaliation or that tend to force the sovereign will of the State against which it is applied’.¹⁵³ Similarly, the Brazilian proposal stated: It is prohibited for a State to exercise or support economic or political pressure on any other, in order to obtain advantages of any nature from that other State, not including, however, in the category of pressure the sanctions adopted in accordance with a determination of a competent international body. The American State that feels that it is subjected to economic or political pressure from any other State, that State has the was responsible and Colombia severed diplomatic relations with the USSR. This led the conference to adopt a resolution titled: ‘The Preservation and Defence of Democracy’ that condemned ‘interference by any foreign power, or by any political organization serving the interests of a foreign power, in the political life of the nations of the American continent’ and committed the member States of the OAS to take ‘the measures necessary to eradicate and prevent activities directed, assisted or instigated by foreign governments, organizations or individuals tending to overthrow their institutions by violence, to foment disorder in their domestic political life or to disturb, by means of pressure, subversive propaganda, threats or by any other means, the free and sovereign right of their peoples to govern themselves in accordance with their democratic aspirations’. See *Novena Conferencia Internacional Americana, Actas y Documentos, Vol. VI: Conclusiones Acta Final – Instrumentos Diplomaticos* (Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de Colombia 1953), at 303.\n¹⁵³ *Novena Conferencia Internacional Americana, Actas y Documentos, Vol. III: Comision Primera – Comision Segunda* (Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de Colombia 1953), at 94.\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE right to appeal to the Governing Board of the Pan American Union, so that it may take the measures it deems appropriate.^[154]^ The final version of Article 20 was drafted by a subcommittee composed of Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Cuba, El Salvador, Panama, Uruguay, and the US. In its report the subcommittee explained the purpose of this provision as follows: [T]he two essential characteristics of the proposed text are the following: First, it condemns any action or attempted action that tends to force a State, despite its sovereignty, to adopt any attitude that State deems contrary to its interests; and second, such condemnation is in no way affected by the nature of the benefits sought by the State that exercises or encourages the coercive action. The members of the Subcommittee present were in complete agreement with the fact that the proposed text does not affect in any way the application of sanctions of an economic nature authorized by certain international organizations by virtue of current pacts.^[155]^ The negotiating history of the three Inter-American treaties in which the prohibition on intervention was first codified does not provide support for the definitions of coercion that many States have adopted in their national position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace. In fact, the concept of coercion was not even the subject of any in-depth discussions during the drafting of these treaties. Rather, the term coercion was only introduced in Article 20 of the OAS Charter specifically to outlaw the imposition of unilateral economic sanctions. Likewise, there is little in the negotiations on the principal instruments that were adopted on non-intervention by the UN that supports the definitions of coercion that appear in national position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace.\n^[154]^ Ibid., at 83.\n^[155]^ Novena Conferencia Internacional Americana, Actas y Documentos, Vol. II: Comisiones Reglamentarias, Comisión de Credenciales – Comisión de Iniciativas – Comisión de Coordinación – Comisión de Estilo (Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de Colombia 1953), at 387–388. It should be noted that during the negotiations on this provision, the US agreed that the unilateral imposition of economic sanctions is unlawful. See Ninth International Conference of American States, Bogotá, Colombia, March 30–May 2, 1948: Report of the Delegation of the United States of America with Related Documents (Department of State Publication No. 8262, November 1948) (In its official report on the proceedings of the Bogota Conference, the US delegation stated: ‘the principle that no nation should indulge in unilateral economic sanctions is, of course, valid’).\nHELAL Although the prohibition on intervention was not codified in the UN Charter,¹⁵⁶ it was included in many instruments that were subsequently negotiated at the UN. These include the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the 1963 Vienna Convention on Consular Relations,¹⁵⁷ the 1949 Declaration on the Rights and Duties and States and the 1954 Code of Offenses Against the Peace and Security of Mankind both of which were drafted by the International Law Commission,¹⁵⁸ in addition to several General Assembly resolutions such as Resolution 31/91 on Non-Interference in the Internal Affairs of States,¹⁵⁹ and the 1981 Declaration on the Inadmissibility of Intervention and Interference in the Internal Affairs of States.¹⁶⁰ It is impossible in this article to provide a complete account of how the principle of non-intervention was articulated in these UN instruments. Therefore, I will focus here on the negotiations on non-intervention in the 1970 Friendly Relations Declaration, which contains the most authoritative expression of the prohibition on intervention.¹⁶¹ During the negotiations on the 1970 Friendly Relations Declaration and the 1965 Declaration on the Inadmissibility of Intervention in the Domestic Affairs of States, on which the section on non-intervention in the 1970 Friendly Relations Declaration was based, coercion was neither defined nor was it considered the distinguishing characteristic of intervention.¹⁶² Rather, the ¹⁵⁶ It is often mistakenly assumed that Article 2(7) of the UN Charter is a codification of the prohibition on intervention. It is not. This provision does not govern interstate relations. Rather, it applies to the conduct of the UN, as a distinct legal person, in its relations with its member States. See G.

UNGA, ‘Special Committee on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation Among States, First Session, Summary Records of the Twenty-Eighth Meeting’ (23 October COERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE principal question that dominated debates among States on the scope and content of the prohibition on intervention was whether it was synonymous with the prohibition on the use of force. Initially, many (mostly Western) States answered this question in the affirmative. To those States, the prohibition on intervention was limited to proscribing the direct and indirect use of armed force by States.¹⁶³ Conversely, Non-Aligned and Eastern Bloc States, insisted that non-intervention was a broader rule that prohibited all forms of the use of force and other non-forcible forms of conduct. Ultimately, the broader understanding of non-intervention was adopted. It was accepted that this rule outlawed the use of any instrument of statecraft – whether forcible or non-forcible – that may be employed to infringe on the domestic jurisdiction of States. There was, however, no attempt during these negotiations to formulate a threshold that determines when non-forcible conduct amounts to intervention. Instead, most States either identified specific forms of conduct that, in their view, amounted to intervention, or simply described intervention as the exertion of pressure against a State.¹⁶⁴ ¹⁶³ 1964) UN Doc. A/AC.119/SR.28, at 5. Similarly, France stated: ‘any attempt to define intervention must cover [...] the idea of coercion, i.e., of abnormal or improper pressure exercised by one State on another State in order to force it to change its internal structure in a direction favorable to the interests of the State applying such coercion’. Ibid., at 10. Mexico also noted that, in addition to outlawing the use of force, the prohibition on intervention was designed to outlaw ‘coercive measures of an economic or political nature’. Mexico did not, however, offer a definition of coercion. Rather, it stated that in order to distinguish between lawful pressure and unlawful intervention the ‘criterion of the illegality of such coercion was the object sought’.

See UN ILC, Yearbook of the International Law Commission 1949, vol. 1, at 90, para. 4. Similarly, during the early stages of the negotiations on the 1970 Friendly Relations Declaration, the UK argued that: ‘[t]he prohibition of the use or threat of force had absorbed much of the classic conception of intervention, which had always been regarded as connoting forcible or dictatorial interference’.

That text did not refer to coercion at all. Instead, it defined intervention as either the use of armed force or conduct 'of such design and effect as to impair or destroy the political independence or territorial integrity of another State'.[165] Those six States explained that the latter sentence was broadly synonymous to the phrase 'to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights' that appears in the 1970 Friendly Relations Declaration.[166] According to those States, their proposed formulation provided a better juridical expression of the scope and content of the prohibition on intervention.[167] of economic pressure'); UNGA, 'First Committee, 1422nd Meeting, Twentieth Session' (20 December 1965) UN Doc.

First, it would be incoherent to apply to non-forcible intervention that is undertaken through instruments such as information operations or economic sanctions a threshold of coercion that is higher than that which applies to the use of armed force, which is the gravest form of intervention. Second, even if one were to ignore the inconsistency between the thresholds of forcible and non-forcible intervention, the definitions of coercion that apply to the latter that some States have adopted are unreasonably high and severely restrict the scope of application of the prohibition on intervention. This section addresses these two points.\nAs noted above, virtually all position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace affirmed that the threat or use of force is *ipso facto* coercive. Many States also underscored that the use of force is the gravest form of coercion. This reflects the principle that the prohibition on the use of force is a peremptory rule of international law. Paradoxically, however, if, as many States propose, coercion is defined as conduct that causes a State to behave involuntarily or that deprives it of freedom of choice or control, non-forcible conduct would be governed by a higher threshold than that which applies to armed intervention. This is because, under *jus ad bellum*, the threshold of scale\njuridical language', and added that this proposal 'drew attention to the fact that no action of whatever character should be taken which would in any way impair or destroy the territorial integrity or political independence of States – ideas which were clearly recognized and defined in international law'. UNGA, '1966 Special Committee on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation Among States, Summary Record of the Fifteenth Meeting', at 11.\nHELAL\nand effects that must be met for an act to constitute a violation of the prohibition on the use of force is relatively low.\nThere is a general consensus among scholars that the prohibition on the use of force applies to conduct that has physical effects; that is conduct that, either directly or indirectly, causes 'death of or injury to persons, or damage to or destruction of property'.[168] Virtually all position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace endorsed this definition of the use of force.[169] However, there is no consensus on the de minimis threshold of scale and effects that must be met for conduct to be considered a violation of the prohibition on the use of force.[170] Some scholars have argued that there are cases of the use of force that do not, due to their limited scale and effects, amount to a use of force.[171] The Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on the Conflict in Georgia endorsed this view.[172] Conversely, other writers, contend that the\n\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE application of the prohibition on the use of force is not subject to a gravity threshold, which means that any use of force by one State against another State – regardless of its scale and effects – is governed by this rule.173 The ICJ has not taken a definitive position on this question.174 Whatever position one takes on this matter, one thing is clear. The threshold that must be met for an act to constitute an instance of the use of force is low. Even the threshold for an armed attack, the gravest form of the use of force, is relatively low.175 As the International Law Association noted, 'it appears that the gravity threshold attached to armed attacks is not markedly high, and would include most uses of force likely to cause casualties or significant property damage'.176 Compared to the threshold of the use of force, the definitions of coercion that many States have adopted in their national position papers impose a much higher threshold of coercion for non-forcible conduct. Nothing in *jus ad bellum* requires the use of force to be of such gravity that it *significantly influences* or *thwarts* the decision-making processes of a State to the extent that its will is *manifestly bent*, which is the definition of coercion adopted by Germany. Similarly, *jus ad bellum* does not require the State to be subjected to a level of compulsion that causes it to 'act in an involuntary manner or to refrain from acting in a certain manner', which is the definition of coercion adopted by Estonia and several other States. Nor is it necessary under *jus ad bellum* for a State to be exposed to such pressure that *deprives* it of freedom of choice or *compels* or *imposes* an outcome on the State, which is the definition of coercion adopted by Canada.\n\nHELAL In addition to the incongruence of having a threshold of coercion for non-forcible intervention that is higher than that which applies to forcible intervention, the definitions of coercion that some States have adopted impose an unreasonably high threshold for non-forcible conduct. To meet the threshold of causing a State to act involuntarily or to deprive it of freedom of choice or control over its domestic jurisdiction, the conduct of the coercing State must be of such intensity that it overwhelms the coerced State and leaves it with no viable choice but to submit to the demands of the coercing State.¹⁷⁷ In both jurisprudence and philosophy, involuntariness is generally understood as being a situation where an actor lacks a meaningful choice or has no reasonable alternative but to comply with the demands of another actor.¹⁷⁸ Applying these definitions would significantly reduce the scope of the prohibition on intervention, thereby permitting a wide-range of non-forcible conduct both in cyberspace and beyond.\nTake the definition of coercion in Canada's national position paper on the application of international law in cyberspace. As noted above, Canada defined coercion as conduct that compels or imposes an outcome on the affected State or deprives it of its freedom of choice. Canada also provided the following example of an act of unlawful intervention in an election: '[a]n ¹⁷⁷ The definitions of coercion adopted by most States (coercion as conduct that causes a State to act involuntarily and coercion as conduct that deprives a State of freedom of choice or control) appear to echo the definition of coercion that the ILC adopted in its Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts. The ILC stated that coercion 'has the same essential character as force majeure', which it defined as a situation where the conduct of a State is 'involuntary or at least involves no element of free choice'. As the ILC explained, the degree of pressure required for a State to be placed in a position where its conduct is 'involuntary' or lacking the 'element of free choice' is one of 'irresistible force'. To be clear, States have not cited the Articles on State Responsibility as an authority to support their definitions of coercion. Nonetheless, there is a striking resemblance between the ILC's definition of coercion and the definitions adopted by many States in their position papers. In my view, this is a threshold of pressure that is far higher than anything required by the jus ad bellum. For the ILC's discussion of the concepts of coercion and force majeure, see UN ILC, 'Report of the International Law Commission: Fifty-Third Session' (23 April–1 June and 2 July–10 August 2001) GAOR 56th Session Supp. 10 (A/56/10), at 69, 77–78.\n¹⁷⁸ The literature of coercion and voluntariness in both law and philosophy is vast and varied. Nonetheless, there is general agreement among scholars in these fields that an agent will be deemed to have behaved involuntarily if they were left with no viable or meaningful choice. See generally T. Honoré, 'A Theory of Coercion' (1990) 10 Oxford Journal of Legal Studies 94–105; M. Alvarez, 'The Concept of Voluntariness' (2016) 7 Jurisprudence 665–671; S. Olsaretti, 'Voluntariness, Coercion, Self-Ownership' in D. Schmidtz and C. Pavel (eds), The Oxford Handbook of Freedom (Oxford University Press 2018) 439–455.\nCOERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE example of a prohibited intervention would be a malicious cyber activity that hacks and disables a State's election commission days before an election, preventing a significant number of citizens from voting, and ultimately influencing the election outcome.[179] Under this definition, almost all of the conduct that appears in a recent report published by a commission established by the Canadian government to investigate foreign interference in Canadian elections would not be wrongful under the prohibition on intervention.[180] The report, which is titled Public Inquiry into Foreign Interference in Federal Electoral Processes and Democratic Institutions, noted that foreign interference did not determine the outcome of the election. The report did, however, state the following: The fact that foreign interference may not have impacted the outcomes in many ridings does not mean, however, that it did not impact the election. Foreign interference in 2019 and 2021 undermined the right of voters to have an electoral ecosystem free from coercion or covert influence. Foreign interference has an impact when there is a single instance where a ballot is cast in a certain way, or not cast at all, because of a foreign state's direct or indirect enticement.[181] The report added that this foreign interference affected the electoral ecosystem and had the overall effect of '[u]ndermining faith in democracy and government' and led to a 'reduced trust in Canada's democratic process'.[182] Under Canada's definition of coercion, this conduct would not be unlawful. The foreign interference catalogued in this report did not impose any particular choice on Canada nor did it significantly affect the outcome of an election. Likewise, this conduct would not meet the threshold of causing a State to act involuntarily. Nonetheless, the political effects of foreign interference of this nature are serious, especially in the long-term. Failing to proscribe conduct of this nature would turn the prohibition on intervention into a normative empty shell that provides little protection to States and would permit a broad range of disruptive non-forcible behavior.\nHELAL This is why I believe that the Common African Position was right to define coercion as conduct that is designed 'to impose restraints on the will of a foreign state', which is a markedly lower threshold than that proposed by other States. The question, however, is what exactly does 'imposing restraints' entail and at what point can one say that the exertion of pressure on a State has reached the point of 'imposing restraints' on its will?\nTo this writer – and I must emphasize that this is the author's view, not that of the member States of the African Union – the threshold of coercion for non-forcible conduct should be defined as being comparable to the minimum effects of conduct that amounts to a threat or use of force. In other words, for non-forcible conduct – such as political, economic, or informational measures – to amount to intervention, the effects of the conduct in question should be comparable to that which is entailed by the threat or use of force. I call this the unified threshold of coercion. The practical effect of adopting the unified threshold of coercion is that any non-forcible conduct that causes effects on a scale that is comparable to conduct that amounts to a violation of the prohibition on the threat or use of force would constitute a breach of the prohibition on intervention.\nTo further explain, other reports by the Canadian government provide understandings of foreign interference that, to this writer, approximates the degree of effects that would meet the unified threshold of coercion, thereby amounting to a breach of the prohibition on intervention. In one report published by the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians, foreign interference was defined in the following terms: '[f]oreign interference involves foreign states, or persons/entities operating on their behalf, attempting to covertly influence decisions, events or outcomes to better suit their strategic interests'.[183] This report also stated: 'foreign interference includes attempts to covertly influence, intimidate, manipulate, interfere, corrupt or discredit individuals, organizations and governments to further the interests of a foreign country'.[184] It also underscored that 'foreign interference should be understood as a long-term effort, akin to espionage, using inducements or threats. Both dynamics enable the manipulation of targets when required, for example, through requests for inappropriate or special favours'.[185] This report COERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE provided examples of behavior that would not amount to unlawful intervention. These include: Foreign interference activities are distinct from acceptable diplomatic advocacy and lobbying. The latter activities are known to the host state and occur through recognized channels to achieve specific policy outcomes or objectives. It is normal for foreign diplomats in Canada, for example, to reach out to elected officials across the political spectrum, to pressure policymakers, to use local media to promote their national interests or to engage with and support domestic organizations.^[186]^ An earlier report, also published by the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians of Canada, states the following: '[f]oreign interference activities can include using deceptive means to cultivate relationships with elected officials and others perceived to processes influence in the political process; seek to influence the reporting of Canadian media outlets; seek, in some cases, to affect the outcome of elections; and coerce or induce diaspora communities to advance foreign interests in Canada'.^[187]^ The understandings of foreign interference in these reports are palpably broader than the definition of coercion in most national position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace, including Canada's. To this writer, these reports describe the kinds of conduct that were intended to be covered by the Common African Position, and which would be covered by the unified threshold of coercion proposed here.\nTwo considerations lend support to this understanding of coercion. First, adopting a unified threshold of coercion that applies to both forcible and non-forcible intervention is consistent with the history of the evolution of the prohibition on intervention. Throughout the negotiations on instruments in which non-intervention was codified, States consistently viewed acts of intervention as being analogous to the use of force.^[188]^ For example, as noted above, the drafters of the 1933 Montevideo Convention described intervention HELAL as any act that amounts to 'effective force'. It indicates that the authors of the Montevideo Convention understood non-forcible intervention to be the functional equivalent of armed force.\nMoreover, during the debates on the Montevideo Convention, several Latin American States underscored that non-intervention was closely associated to the prohibition on the use of force. For example, Argentina stated: 'What is intervention, then, but violence? [...] Intervention is violence.'[189] El Salvador also affirmed that '[b]ecause the American conscience is such that territorial acquisitions originated by violence cannot be recognized; that violence has generally come to disturb the life of our countries in the form of intervention'.[190] Peru also emphasized that 'war is proscribed, so is violence, but not the use of arms, the diplomatic measures or any other means of effective compulsion'.[191] Ecuador also highlighted that '[w]hat is intervention but a kind of war, disguised and wary' and argued that, having outlawed aggression pursuant to the 1933 Anti-War Treaty of Non-Aggression and Conciliation, it was only natural for the States of the western hemisphere to proscribe intervention.[192] Similarly, during the negotiations on the OAS Charter, Cuba called economic coercion 'treacherous, silent, and underhanded aggression'.[193] Many States expressed similar views during the negotiations on both the 1965 Declaration on Non-Intervention and the 1970 Friendly Relations Declaration. For example, Guinea described intervention as a 'more pernicious' form of aggression,[194] Trinidad and Tobago called it 'subtle and insidious' aggression,[195] and the Congo argued that non-intervention covered 'political pressure, subversive activities, and other acts of aggression'.[196] Furthermore, throughout debates on non-intervention at the UN, many States frequently described non-intervention as being derivable from or a corollary of the non-use of force.[197] In short, in addition to outlawing intervention through armed COERCION IN CYBERSPACE - TAKING STOCK OF THE DEBATE force, the prohibition on intervention was designed to protect States against non-forceful conduct that was viewed as being functionally equivalent to the use of force – i.e., conduct that entailed a degree of pressure that is comparable to the use of armed force.\nIn addition to being consistent with the historical evolution of non-intervention, adopting a unified threshold of coercion that applies to all forms of intervention reflects the fact that non-intervention and the non-use of force share the same policy purpose. The ICJ has stated that ‘a rule of international law, whether customary or conventional, does not operate in a vacuum; it operates in relation to facts and in the context of a wider framework of legal rules of which it forms only a part’.¹⁹⁸ Writing in more colorful terms, James Crawford observed that ‘customary rules usually hunt in packs, connected by some familial relationship and interacting with each other’.¹⁹⁹ Non-intervention and the non-use of force belong to the same normative ‘pack’. These rules are part of what scholars call the ‘law of coexistence’, the policy purpose of which is to protect the autonomy of States and enable them to coexist peacefully in an anarchic international system.²⁰⁰ Specifically, these two rules – non-intervention and the non-use of force – are designed to protect the physical and functional manifestations of sovereignty. These two ‘domains’ of sovereignty – the physical and the functional – are expressed by the concepts of the ‘territorial integrity’ and ‘political independence’ of States, which appear in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.²⁰¹ Non-intervention extended the SR.31, at 11 (Yugoslavia: non-intervention is a ‘natural corollary of Article 2(4)’ of the UN Charter); UNGA, ‘Special Committee on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation Among States, First Session, Summary Records of the Thirtieth Meeting’, at 5–6 (Mexico: Article 2(4) is among the provisions of the Charter that provided ‘a solid and irrefutable basis’ for non-intervention).\n¹⁹⁸ Interpretation of the Agreement of 25 March 1951 Between the WHO and Egypt (Advisory Opinion) [20 December 1980] ICJ Rep. 73, at para. 10.\n¹⁹⁹ J. Crawford, Chance, Order, Change: The Course of International Law, General Course on Public International Law (Brill Nijhoff 2014), at 56.\n²⁰⁰ G. Abi-Saab, ‘Whither the International Community?’ (1998) 9 European Journal of International Law 248–265, at 254.\n²⁰¹ ‘Political independence’ refers to ‘the autonomy in the affairs of the State with respect to its institutions, freedom of political decisions, policy making, and in matters pertaining to its domestic and foreign affairs’. See S. Blay, ‘Territorial Integrity and Political Independence’ in R. Wolfrum (ed.), Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law (Oxford University Press 2010), available at <https: 10.1093=\"\"display=\"\"law=\"\"law:epil=\"\"opil.ouplaw.com=\"\"9780199231690=\"\"99231690-e1116=\"\"> (accessed 17 July 2024), at para. 1. ‘Territorial integrity’ is not limited to prohibiting forceful changes to the boundaries of a State. It protects the physical space within which a State exercises political independence against outside intrusion or trespass. See C. Marxsen, ‘Territorial Integrity in International</https:> HELAL protection afforded to the territorial integrity and political independence of States against the threat or use of force to all other instruments of statecraft that could be employed to achieve the same objectives,²⁰² especially that such non-forcible intervention often has the potential to achieve greater harm to States than the threat or use of force.²⁰³ To be clear, the unified threshold of coercion proposed here should not be read as suggesting that non-intervention is coterminous with the prohibition on the threat or use of force. Far from it. Although both rules share the same policy purposes, the prohibition on intervention is broader than the prohibition on the threat or use of force. Non-intervention applies to any policy or practice, whether forcible and non-forcible, that impinges on the political independence or territorial integrity of States. In a sense, therefore, the prohibition on the threat or use of force should be viewed as a *lex specialis* that applies to a specific genus of intervention (namely, *armed* intervention). This body of *lex specialis* has been subsumed, *in toto*, within the broader *lex generalis* of the prohibition on intervention.\nIn conclusion, further research and further expressions of State views are needed on the definition and threshold of coercion. This is essential to understanding how the prohibition on intervention applies to and governs non-forcible conduct both in cyberspace and beyond. To this writer, however, the unified threshold of coercion that this article proposes provides a conceptual foundation on which to formulate a workable and conceptually coherent approach to applying the prohibition on intervention.\n²⁰² Law – Its Concept and Implications for Crimea' (2015) 75 Zeitschrift für ausländisches öffentliches Recht und Völkerrecht 7–26, at 10. As Georges Abi-Saab wrote: 'The international legal system is based at present as in the past, on two fundamental principles that determine its structure and functioning, namely, the sovereignty and equality of States [...] The principal legal consequence of this structural or rather structuring principle is to commit each State to a general obligation to respect the sovereignty of others; in other words, not to trespass on the territorial and functional ambits of this sovereignty. The most flagrant manifestation of such trespass is the threat or use of force against the State. But it is not the only one. Other, less blatant, forms exist varying in their degree of visibility and intensity. It is precisely the rest of this continuum, beyond the use of force, which is covered by the principle of non-intervention'. G. Abi-Saab, 'Some Thoughts on the Principle of Non-Intervention' in K. Wellens (ed.), *International Law: Theory and Practice: Essays in Honour of Eric Suy* (Brill Nijhoff 1998) 225–236.\n²⁰³ T. Kliem, 'You Can't Cyber in Here, This is the War Room!

    "abstract": "This article explores debates among States on the application of the prohibition on intervention in cyberspace. It focuses on coercion as an element of the prohibition on intervention and identifies the different definitions of coercion that States have adopted in national and regional position papers on the application of international law in cyberspace. This article also specifically discusses the views of States on the threshold of coercion, which is the degree of harm or the effects that the conduct of a State must cause (or threaten to cause) to amount to a violation of the prohibition on intervention. This article argues that the definitions and thresholds of coercion that States have adopted in debates on the application of international law in cyberspace should be viewed as proposals for the development of the law in this area, as opposed to restatements of established law. Instead, this article proposes that all forms of intervention should be governed by a ‘unified threshold of coercion’ that applies to both forcible and non-forcible intervention.",
