A recent United Nations report suggested that international human rights law represents an important external reference point for criminalisation and procedural provisions related to cyberattacks.¹ However, this is not necessarily the case for public cyberattacks, which involve state–state relations.\nThis chapter argues that the determination of whether a particular cyberattack is of public or private nature (a cybercrime) should define how states respond to cybersecurity risks. Section 5.3 of this chapter demonstrates that non-state actors motivated by financial gain or ideology perpetrate private cyberattacks, which typically target non-state entities, rather than states (see Section 5.3.1). Such cyberattacks require primarily domestic law responses based on the principle of territoriality and alternative principles.\nStates act as the main perpetrators of public cyberattacks, usually motivated not by financial gain but by political and strategic objectives such as causing harm, interfering with internal political processes or gaining access to sensitive information (see Section 5.3.2). They can\n¹ United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, ‘Comprehensive Study on Cybercrime’ UN Publications, February 2013, available at: www.unodc.org/documents/organized-crime/UNODC_CCPCJ_EG.4_2013/CYBERCRIME_STUDY_210213.pdf (accessed 18 July 2022).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009374576.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nYARIK KRYVOI\nundermine critical infrastructure, national security, the democratic legitimacy of institutions, or political freedoms.\nSection 5.4 of this chapter shows that public cyberattacks require not only domestic law but also international law responses. If the state-sponsored nature of a cyberattack can be established with a degree of certainty, this should trigger the state's rights to self-defence and to respond with countermeasures to procure cessation and achieve reparation for the injury. The difficulty with collecting evidence related to cyberattacks, including on attribution of the conduct of private actors to state actors, has led to proposals to adopt due diligence or strict liability approaches to state responsibility (see Section 5.4.2).\nThe chapter concludes that the effective application of existing international law to public cyberattacks may require the reassessment of application of the concepts of self-defence and countermeasures in cyberspace. It highlights the limits of global treaty-making in the area of cybersecurity and calls for establishment of a dispute resolution body in charge of public cyberattacks, which could develop jurisprudence to assist in the application of existing norms to cyberspace and the development of new, cyberspace-specific, norms.\n## 5.2 Conceptual Framework\nTable 5.1 highlights the differences between private, hybrid, and public cyberattacks, discussed in more detail in subsequent sections. It shows that despite commonalities, public and private cyberattacks are governed by separate legal regimes, have different motivations, and vary in severity. Hybrid cyberattacks blur the distinction between the two – and while they appear as private attacks, they are in fact public. The rest of the chapter examines different aspects of the distinction between private and public cyberattacks and responses to them.\n## 5.3 The Nature and Legal Regimes of Private and Public Cyberattacks\n### 5.3.1 Private Cyberattacks\n#### 5.3.1.1 Nature of Private Cyberattacks\nCyberspace creates a fertile environment for criminal activities, as it allows perpetrators to pose security threats or engage in money laundering or data theft, or facilitate corruption across borders without leaving\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009374576.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTable 5.1 Key features of private and public cyberattacks\n|   | Private cyberattacks (cybercrimes) | Public cyberattacks  |   |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|   |   |  Hybrid cyberattacks | Direct cyberattacks  |\n|  Perpetrator | Non-state actors | Non-state and state actors | States  |\n|  Motivation | Usually, financially or ideologically motivated. Private cyberattacks often have an ulterior motive (obtain profit, strike fear or send a message), rather than merely cause damage for other reasons | A mix of financial, ideological, political motivation, and possibility of for-profit motivations | Mainly politically motivated, to cause damage or gain access to sensitive information  |\n|  Targets and severity of impact | Varies from small to large targets but usually targets other non-state entities, rather than states with varying severity of impact | Varies from small targets to large targets with severe impact | Highly severe. Public cyberattacks most often target other states but may also be aimed at non-state actors. They can undermine critical infrastructure, national security, democratic legitimacy and institutions, or political freedoms  |\n|  Dominant applicable law | Domestic law | Domestic and international law | International law  |\n|  Typical forms | • Ransomware attacks • Personal data leaks • Cyberterrorism • Malware hacking • Online child sexual exploitation • Cyber-enabled crimes | Can take the forms of private and public cyberattacks | • Election hacking • Cyberattacks on state digital infrastructure • Cyberattacks on foreign military targets • Cyberespionage  |\n|  Responses | In accordance with domestic laws: • Domestic administrative and criminal law countermeasures | In accordance with domestic and public international law, including: • Self-defence • Proportionate and necessary countermeasures • Domestic proceedings  |   |\nYARIK KRYVOI\ntheir homes.² Criminals, extremists, and terrorists can exploit such new technologies, which allow them to pursue illicit activities or spread radical ideologies internationally from safe havens, thus circumventing traditional domestic legal systems and law enforcement measures.³\nSome even labelled the cybercrime economy as the ‘Web of Profit’, with a variety of criminal activities, generating revenues from illicit online markets, IP and trade secret theft, and data crimeware and ransomware.⁴ According to some estimates, cybercrime revenues annually reach around US$1.5 trillion.⁵ Cyberattacks can also cause significant disruption and lead to very high costs – for example, some estimates suggest that potential cost of the 2017 WannaCry attack was US$4 billion.⁶\nPrivate cyberattacks emanate from private individuals or groups usually motivated by gaining profit (e.g. ransom attacks) or ideological reasons (e.g. propaganda of terrorism). Private actors may engage in personal data leaks, economic crimes, terrorism, and sexual offences. With a few exceptions, normally such crimes do not rise to the level of posing a threat to national security since profit is the primary motivation of private cyberattacks.\nIt must be noted that the same cyberattacks can be perpetrated by either private or public actors. This includes hacking and illegal access, data or ID theft, cyber sabotage, spreading viruses, and distributing worms, spyware, and logic bombs. The United Nations Manual on Computer-related Crime includes fraud as well as forgery in its list of cybercrimes.⁷ What matters for the determination of public or private nature of cyberattacks is whether the ultimate perpetrator is a public or a private actor.\n² Ibid.\n³ See, for example, European Commission, ‘Reflection Paper on Harnessing Globalisation’ (2017) EU Publications 12–13, available at: https://commission.europa.eu/publications/reflection-paper-harnessing-globalisation_en (accessed 6 September 2022).\n⁴ Michael McGuire, ‘Nation States, Cyberconflict and the Web of Profit’ (2021) HP Development Company, available at: https://threatresearch.ext.hp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/hp-bps-web-of-profit-report_APR_2021.pdf (accessed 6 September 2022).\n⁵ Ibid., 20.\n⁶ Jonathan Berr, “WannaCry” Ransomware Attack Losses Could Reach $4 billion’ CBS News, 16 May 2017, available at: www.cbsnews.com/news/wannacry-ransomware-attacks-wannacry-virus-losses/ (accessed 6 September 2022).\n⁷ United Nations, United Nations Manual on the Prevention and Control of Computer-Related Crime (New York: United Nations, 1994), available at: www.unodc.org/pdf/Manual_ComputerRelatedCrime.PDF (accessed 6 September 2022).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009374576.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nRESPONDING TO PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CYBERATTACKS 107\nAn example of a private cyberattack is the 2013 attack on the US web services provider Yahoo, which led to the loss of one billion users' data.⁸ In another incident, hackers gained access to the personal data of 100 million users of a major Australian tech company.⁹ One can think of situations in which private cyberattacks may go beyond causing damage to particular organisations and individuals and pose a threat to critical infrastructure (e.g. hospitals, electricity, or military facilities). For example, the 2021 Colonial Pipeline Hack in the United States was carried out by a private group seeking ransom, who disabled thousands of miles of US energy infrastructure for nearly a week.¹⁰ A cyberattack against a US water treatment facility in Florida, which temporarily increased the levels of chemicals in drinking water, was also likely caused by a private hacker.¹¹\nTo sum up, non-state actors commit private cyberattacks, most of which aim at financial gain but can also be motivated by ideological reasons. Such cyberattacks usually do not raise to the level of causing national security threats, although the largest ones may do so.\n## 5.3.1.2 Legal Norms to Tackle Private Cyberattacks\nDomestic rather than international law plays a key role in preventing and responding to private cyberattacks. However, many states, particularly those less economically developed, have neither laws penalising cyberattacks nor the capacity to enforce them.¹² According to a recent survey, less than a third of states have substantially or fully updated their\n⁸ One billion users' data was lost.

Its signatories also include states from outside of the Council of Europe such as the United States, Australia, Japan, and Nigeria but nonetheless, most of its signatories are Western states.¹⁴ This convention influenced similar approaches to regulating cybercrimes in state parties of the Convention.\nFor example, in the United Kingdom, legal guidance broadens the scope of existing crimes such as fraud or sexual offences to cyberspace.¹⁵ The UK Computer Misuse Act 1990 relates to offences or attacks directly against computer systems and has been amended multiple times since its passing.¹⁶ English courts take jurisdiction where such crimes substantially relate to English laws or interests.¹⁷ Similarly, Germany, which adopted the IT Security Act of 2015, broadened the scope of existing offences to cyberspace and added many cybercrimes such as hacking and identity theft into its Criminal Code.¹⁸ The United States has no dedicated cybercrime legislation and instead amends existing statutes to apply to cyberspace.¹⁹\nAs explained in more detail in Chapter 4 of this book, Russia has been critical of the Budapest Convention, arguing that it endangers national sovereignty, particularly on the provisions dealing with transborder\n¹³ McConnell International, ‘Cyber Crime . . . and Punishment?

The SCO Agreement does not attempt to harmonise domestic legislation but instead focuses on co-operation between states, information exchange, and joint cybersecurity threat evaluation.\n²⁰ T.

The contrasts between the above-discussed Vietnamese and US cybersecurity regimes underscore the need for cross-jurisdictional co-operation and harmonisation, as cybercrimes are often international in nature.\nInternational agreements, such as the 2001 Budapest Convention, clearly target private cyberthreats and aim primarily at co-ordinating the efforts of states and ironing out differences in domestic law. The convention's preamble refers to the need to secure a balance between the interests of law enforcement and respect for fundamental rights, protection of personal data, and co-operation in the penal field. However, most international law instruments remain silent on harmonisation and the need to protect fundamental rights in response to private cyberthreats.\n## 5.3.2 Public Cyberattacks\n### 5.3.2.1 Nature of Public Cyberattacks\nA recent study identified over 200 cybersecurity incidents connected to nation-states over the last eleven years.[27] States are increasing their spending on cybersecurity. For example, the United States in 2021 increased it by 14 per cent.[28] China adopted a programme to grow its cybersecurity\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009374576.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nRESPONDING TO PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CYBERATTACKS 111\nindustry by 15 per cent annually in 2021–2023.²⁹ Russia plans to increase spending on cybersecurity in 2022 and 2023 by 800 per cent in a dedicated federal project on information cybersecurity.³⁰ This demonstrates an increased strategic interest in cybersecurity and significant funds invested in the capacity to launch new kinds of cyberattacks.\nState actors perpetrate public cyberattacks either directly or through affiliated private entities. Such cyberattacks may involve undermining political institutions and media, interfering with critical financial or military infrastructure, or merely stealing personal data. Although less frequent than private cyberattacks, the sophistication of public cyber-threats and the political sensitivity of such cases make responding to them difficult. Moreover, cyberattacks emanating from state actors usually pose a greater threat to national security.\nStates seldom openly engage in cyberattacks through official government entities and avoid admitting to such conduct. Consequently, the distinction between private and public cyberattacks is not always clear-cut, as hybrid cyberattacks involving co-operation between state and private actors become increasingly frequent. Many states increasingly deploy the tools and techniques used by private actors, and some recruit them to act as proxies in their interest.\nFor example, several recent attacks of which Russia is accused could be regarded as hybrid cyberattacks. For example, in May 2021 Russian-based hackers, with suspected links to the state, attacked over 150 different government agencies and human rights groups in the United States and other countries.³¹ In June 2021, Russian hackers (meaning Russian nationals) conducted ransomware attacks against one of the largest American meat processors. The US government has accused the Russian state of instigating these attacks.³² Germany recently accused Russia of illegally targeting its politicians with ‘phishing’ emails to gain\n²⁹ Xiong Xinyi and Zhang Hongpei, ‘China Launches 3-year Draft Plan for Cybersecurity Sector after Regulatory Actions’ Global Times, 12 July 2021, available at: www.globaltimes.cn/page/202107/1228461.shtml (accessed 6 September 2022).\n³⁰ Anna Ustinova, ‘It’s about the Cipher: Spending on Information Security in Russia Will Increase Eightfold’ IZ, 2 October 2020, available at: https://iz.ru/1068209/anna-ustinova/delo-v-shifre-traty-na-informbezopasnost-v-rossii-uvelichat-v-vosem-raz (accessed 6 September 2022).\n³¹ BBC News, ‘Russian Hackers Target Aid Groups in New Cyber-Attack, Says Microsoft’ BBC, 28 May 2021, available at: www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-57280510 (accessed 18 July 2022).\n³² Tom Polansek, ‘JBS Meat Plants Reopen as White House Blames Russia-linked Group over Hack’ Reuters, 3 June 2021, available at: www.reuters.com/world/us/russia-linked-\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009374576.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nYARIK KRYVOI\naccess to personal details to influence elections.³³ The Russian state was also accused of conducting global campaigns to compromise enterprise and cloud environments in various countries, switching off electric power stations abroad, hacking electoral authorities, and creating some of the world's most destructive computer viruses and refusing to co-operate in investigating such attacks.³⁴\nMost public cyberattacks are clearly politically motivated. For example, in 2014, North Korea was blamed for an attack on Sony following the release of the film The Interview.³⁵ In 2007, Estonia, one of Europe's smaller states, faced an attack by bots originating from almost 180 different countries, which was widely believed to be orchestrated by Russia. Russia also launched a cyberattack on Georgia in 2008,³⁶ which supplemented the conventional phase of Russia–Georgia war. Geopolitically motivated cybersecurity threats can also target elections, such as Russian interference in the 2016 US election.³⁷\nState actors may also be involved in cyberattacks for financial gain. For example, North Korea was accused not only of punishing Sony for producing a film about the North Korean leader but subsequently of\nhacking-group-is-behind-cyberattack-against-jbs-bloomberg-news-2021-06-02/ (accessed 18 July 2022).\n³³ Guy Chazan, ‘Germany Protests to Russia over Wave of Cyber-Attacks’ Financial Times, 7 September 2021, available at: www.ft.com/content/16ac7609-32cd-467c-9a8d-8a796073df14 (accessed 6 September 2022).\n³⁴ See, for example, National Security Agency, Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and UK National Cyber Security Centre, ‘Cybersecurity Advisory: Russian GRU Conducting Global Brute Force Campaign to Compromise Enterprise and Cloud Environments’, July 2021, available at: https://tinyurl.com/yuftcuby (accessed 6 September 2022); The Insider, “Sandworm”.

Essentially, they are public cyberattacks and the difficulty lies in attribution. Attribution of cyberattacks to a state presents complex factual and legal questions, which eventually determine whether such an attack can be regarded as private or public. This chapter deals primarily with issues of legal attribution, which is different from technical attribution (a factual and technical investigation) and political attribution (a policy decision attributing an attack to an actor without necessarily attaching legal consequences such as countermeasures).\nIn accordance with the International Law Commission (ILC) Articles on State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts,⁴¹ cyberattacks can be attributed to a state if they were conducted by organs of a state⁴² or if the conduct was directed or controlled by a state.⁴³ If the state-sponsored nature of the attack can be established with certainty, this may\n³⁸ Katrina Manson, Helen Warrell, and Hannah Murphy, ‘North Koreans Charged in $1.3bn Cyber-Hack Spree’ Financial Times, 18 February 2021, available at: www.ft.com/content/3556c699-8bff-4837-abb1-1ef70d2094d4 (accessed 6 September 2022).\n³⁹ See, for example, Center for Strategic and International Studies, ‘Significant Cyber Incidents’ Center for Strategic and International Studies, available at: www.csis.org/programs/strategic-technologies-program/significant-cyber-incidents (accessed 6 September 2022).\n⁴⁰ Hanna Murphy, ‘Russia-Linked Hackers Target IT Supply Chain with Ransomware’ Financial Times, 4 July 2021, available at: www.ft.com/content/a8e7c9a2-5819-424f-b087-c6f2e8f0c7a1 (accessed 6 September 2022).\n⁴¹ International Law Commission, ‘Commentaries to Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts’, UN GAOR 56th Session, Supp. No. 10, at 43, UN Doc.

Subsequently, the ICJ has rejected the use of the ‘overall control’ test.⁵² Regardless of whether the ‘overall control’ of the ‘effective control’ test applies, the attribution threshold is high and mere state funding or equipping groups will not result in attribution.⁵³\nBecause of difficulties with finding evidence, currently attribution of cyberattacks remains largely political rather than legal. A good example is the already-mentioned US attribution of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. The Obama administration quickly attributed it to Russia,⁵⁴ but a thorough report prepared by the Select Committee on Intelligence on the Russian cyber intrusions came out only in 2020.⁵⁵\nTo sum up, state actors perpetrate public cyberattacks either directly or through affiliated private entities. Most of such attacks are clearly politically motivated. The real difficulty with distinguishing private and public cyberattacks, and their attribution is the scarcity of evidence. Attribution becomes even more complicated if a state entity stands behind attacks seemingly conducted by private entities acting alone and of their own volition.\n## 5.3.2.2 Legal Norms to Tackle Public Cyberattacks\nAs discussed above, international regulations on cyberattacks remain scarce. Moreover, they struggle to adequately respond to the challenge of transboundary cyberattacks, which often involve computers in multiple jurisdictions.\n⁵¹ Prosecutor v.

Russia has been accused of such tactics by granting refuge to convicted foreign ransomware hackers.⁵⁶ The UK National Cyber Security Centre, FBI, and the US Department of Homeland Security called on Russia to cease such activities.⁵⁷ International law does not give a simple answer to whether harbouring individual criminals guilty of cyberattacks attributes that conduct to the state and the scope of the obligation of states under international law to prevent activities of non-state actors breaching the rights of third states.⁵⁸\nThe ILC has suggested that the Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities could apply to cyberattacks, even though this instrument does not explicitly mention cyberattacks.⁵⁹ It applies to activities not prohibited by international law but ones causing transboundary harm⁶⁰ and provides that the state of origin of the harm ‘shall take all appropriate measures to prevent significant transboundary harm or at any event to minimize the risk thereof’.⁶¹ This is known as the obligation of due diligence, regarded as a general principle of international law.⁶² The ICJ in the Corfu Channel case stated: ‘it is every State’s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States’.⁶³\n⁵⁶ See, for example, Department of Justice, ‘Canadian Hacker Who Conspired With and Aided Russian FSB Officers Pleads Guilty’ Department of Justice, 28 November 2017, available at: www.justice.gov/opa/pr/canadian-hacker-who-conspired-and-aided-russian-fsb-officers-pleads-guilty (accessed 18 July 2022); Tim Maurer, ‘Why the Russian Government Turns a Blind Eye to Cybercriminals’ Slate, 2 February 2018, available at: https://slate.com/technology/2018/02/why-the-russian-government-turns-a-blind-eye-to-cybercriminals.html (accessed 18 July 2022).\n⁵⁷ NCSC, ‘Russian State-Sponsored Cyber Actors Targeting Network Infrastructure Devices’ NCSC, 15 April 2018, available at: www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/russian-state-sponsored-cyber-actors-targeting-network-infrastructure-devices (accessed 18 July 2022).\n⁵⁸ Ibid.\n⁵⁹ International Law Commission, ‘Commentaries on Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities’ (2001) 2(2) Yearbook of the International Law Commission 148.\n⁶⁰ Ibid., Article 1.\n⁶¹ Ibid., Article 3.\n⁶² Luke Chircop, ‘A Due Diligence Standard of Attribution in Cyberspace’ (2018) 67 International &amp; Comparative Law Quarterly 643–668 at 649–650; see also Scott J.

The greater the risk, the stronger the obligation for the state to act.⁶⁶\nThe above requirements for due diligence should flexibly consider the technical capacity of the state to engage in due diligence.⁶⁷ Cyberattacks seldom fit with the territorial logic – the criminals might be in one state but remotely conduct their activities through third countries.\nIt also raises the issue of attribution within the meaning of Article 4 (conducted by organs of a state) and Article 8 (conduct was directed or controlled by a state) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts. Following the logic of due diligence, if a state fails to exercise due diligence to prevent transboundary harms’ situation, that would also amount to ‘public cyberattacks’ that trigger state countermeasures as discussed in more detail in Section 5.3.1.\nRegardless of whether the cyberattacks are private or public, states need to be prepared to deal with them proactively, including before admitting investments through foreign direct investment review mechanisms,⁶⁸ by regulating already admitted investments, or by responding to national security breaches as they occur.\n## 5.4 Responding to Cyberattacks\n### 5.4.1 Private Cyberattacks\nBecause not all attacks can be pre-empted, states must also consider how to respond to them. Whether a cyberattack is public or private in nature\n⁶⁴ Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0, 30–50.\n⁶⁵ Ibid.; see also Luke Chircop, ‘A Due Diligence Standard of Attribution in Cyberspace’ (2018) 67 International &amp; Comparative Law Quarterly 643–668 at 650–651.\n⁶⁶ Seabed Mining (Advisory Opinion) [2011] International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, 50 ILM 458, para. 117.\n⁶⁷ Karine Bannelier-Christakis, ‘Cyber Diligence: A Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations?’ (2014) 14 Baltic Yearbook of International Law 23–39 at 30.\n⁶⁸ See Chapter 8 on this point.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009374576.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nYARIK KRYVOI\ndetermines the type of response available in accordance with domestic or international law.\nAs discussed above, private cyberattack regulation in domestic law does not differ greatly from the regulation of any other crime. In fact, cyberattacks are often understood as versions of existing crimes such as fraud or damage to property, committed through or facilitated using cyberspace. For this reason, the primary response to private cyberattacks is traditional criminal proceedings in domestic courts.\n## 5.4.1.1 Countermeasures against Private Cyberattacks\nStates can take countermeasures against private threats in accordance with domestic law. One example is the response to the 2021 ransomware hacking of a US pipeline (Colonial Pipeline Attack).⁶⁹ That private cyberattack on critical domestic infrastructure was launched not for politically motivated offensive or strategic reasons but for pure financial gain. Attackers hacked the pipeline network and demanded ransom to unlock the pipeline. The response was a typical law enforcement activity. The US Department of Justice, using traditional law enforcement agencies (albeit with new, unprecedented integration of cyberspace strategies), seized the bitcoins used to pay the hackers' ransom. Host states may confiscate assets that they see as tools of cyberattacks or expropriate businesses, which pose cyberthreats to the host state. This is in effect no different from police seizing stolen money or assets from thieves or ransom-demanders.\nSimilarly, the group responsible for the Colonial Pipeline Attack had their accounts frozen and stolen bitcoins (used by Colonial to pay their ransom) forcibly recovered by the US Department of Justice.⁷⁰ These examples demonstrate the extension of traditional law enforcement jurisdiction and strategies to cyberspace, even when that 'space' is beyond the traditional physical jurisdiction of the state.\n## 5.4.1.2 Jurisdiction over Private Cyberattacks\n5.4.1.2.1 The Territoriality Approach Since private cyberattacks are governed by domestic law like any other crime, territoriality is the cornerstone jurisdictional principle. It is based on the principle that a\n⁶⁹ Alexander Mallin and Luke Barr, ‘DOJ Seizes Millions in Ransom Paid by Colonial Pipeline’ ABC, 7 June 2021, available at: https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/doj-seizes-millions-ransom-paid-colonial-pipeline/story?id=78135821 (accessed 18 July 2022).\n⁷⁰ Ibid.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009374576.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nRESPONDING TO PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CYBERATTACKS 119\nstate and its organs will have jurisdiction over a crime if it occurred, wholly or in part, in the physical territory of that state. This principle has been enshrined in virtually all domestic criminal laws for centuries.71 It should follow from the territorial jurisdiction principle that if the act occurred, wholly or in part, in the physical territory of the state, it has authority to prosecute and adjudicate such acts. For example, the US government has claimed jurisdiction to prosecute state-sponsored cyberattacks in domestic courts, leading to several indictments.72\nThe application of the territoriality principle may be challenging in the context of cyberattacks, which are usually not physically grounded in one jurisdiction, can affect multiple states, be committed entirely remotely, and routed through several jurisdictions.73 Three challenges complicate asserting jurisdiction over cyberattacks: (a) the international dispersal of illegal activities; (b) jurisdiction may be impossible to assert because conduct may be legal in one jurisdiction but illegal in another, hindering prosecution; and (c) jurisdiction to prosecute may be claimed by several states simultaneously, causing problems with establishing priority between them.74\nFurther, different jurisdictional considerations apply to local cyberattacks and transnational cyberattacks. The former conforms to the traditional model of a crime.75 The latter might pose jurisdictional issues because of its detachment from state territory. However, states can still apply the principle of territoriality and assert jurisdiction over crimes where all or part of the cyberattack occurred in their territory (a ‘substantial effect’ doctrine).76\n71 Cedric Ryngaert, ‘Territorial Jurisdiction over Cross-Frontier Offences: Revisiting a Classic Problem of International Criminal Law’ (2009) 9(1) International Criminal Law Review 187–209 at 187; Manley O.

Instead of searching for the location of the criminal act, states could instead consider the location of the computers themselves. Singapore claims jurisdiction over cyberattacks ‘if, for the offence in question . . . the computer, program or data was in Singapore at the material time’.⁸² Some US states, such as Connecticut, have statutes that confer jurisdiction in cybercrime cases on the fact that some part of the conduct constituting a cybercrime offence impacts a computer located in that state.⁸³ Finally, states always retain jurisdiction over satellites launched from their territory. Since internet access is becoming increasingly dependent on satellites, this jurisdictional link might prove more useful.⁸⁴\nHowever, as this review suggests, the traditional territoriality approach has significant limitations if applied in the context of cyberattacks.\n5.4.1.2.2 Alternatives to the Territoriality Approach Asserting jurisdiction on the basis of the territory principle is particularly ineffective in\n⁷⁷ Article 22 of the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, 23 November 2001, in force 1 July 2004, ETS No. 185 (Budapest Convention).\n⁷⁸ Ibid., Article 22(5).\n⁷⁹ Article 15 of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, 15 November 2000, in force 29 September 2003, UN Doc.

The Budapest Convention requires parties to establish jurisdiction ‘when the offence is committed (...) by one of its nationals, if the offence is punishable under criminal law where it was committed or if the offence is committed outside the territorial jurisdiction of any State’.⁸⁷ Several domestic criminal legal systems contain equivalent provisions.⁸⁸\nFor cyberattacks with the most serious consequences, such as cyberterrorism, some suggest universal jurisdiction could be attached.⁸⁹ Others suggest that violations of human rights or crimes against humanity should also be covered by universal jurisdiction.⁹⁰\nJurisdiction based on the nationality of the target of the cyberattack is another approach adopted in domestic systems. For example, Germany has a very general jurisdiction provision based on the nationality of the victim: if an attack is committed against a German national regardless of whether the crime is punishable in the country where it was committed.⁹¹ Similarly, in Belgium, a crime against a Belgian national falls under the jurisdiction if the act is punishable in the country where it was committed.⁹² In the United States, the basic federal cybercrime provision confers jurisdiction to prosecute when the conduct at issue impacts the federal government, that is, where the United States is itself the victim.⁹³\nFinally, the protective principle allows states to assert jurisdiction where national security is threatened.⁹⁴ The US basic federal computer\n⁸⁵ Jean-Baptiste Maillart, ‘The Limits of Subjective Territorial Jurisdiction in the Context of Cybercrime’ (2018) 19(3) ERA Forum 375–390 at 375.\n⁸⁶ Brenner, ‘Cybercrime Jurisdiction’, 200–206.\n⁸⁷ Article 22(1)(d) of the Budapest Convention.\n⁸⁸ See, for example, Australian Criminal Code Act of 1995 §476.3; StGB.Strafgesetzbuch (German Criminal Code) §7 Nr.

Different domestic legal systems follow other approaches, such as focusing on the nationality of the victim or the location of computers used in cyberattacks. More judicial practice could help adopt more cohesive and predictable approaches to jurisdiction over geographically dispersed cyberattacks. Approaches to conflict of laws issues vary widely between states, which requires not only judicial practice but also efforts to harmonise and codify jurisdictional rules on private cyberattacks.\n## 5.4.2 Public Cyberattacks\n### 5.4.2.1 Countermeasures against Public Cyberattacks\nResponses to public cyberattacks are very different from private cyberattacks. States may bring cases before domestic courts, explained in the previous section, but this has limited effectiveness vis-à-vis states, the ultimate perpetrators, due to sovereign immunity. In practice, because of the limited jurisdictional reach against state perpetrators, the target state has to respond to private individuals involved in cyberattacks as if these were private cyberattacks. For example, in 2018, a federal grand jury in the District of Columbia charged thirteen Russian nationals and three Russian entities with violating US criminal laws in order to interfere with US elections and political processes.⁹⁷\nStates can also respond to public cyberattacks in accordance with public international law. The UN Charter guarantees the right of states to self-defence against an armed attack.⁹⁸ The Nicaragua case highlighted that for self-defence to be triggered, a state usually has to face physical\n⁹⁵ 18 US Code § 1030.\n⁹⁶ 18 US Code § 1030(e)(2)(B).\n⁹⁷ Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller, ‘Report on the Investigation into Russian Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election’ Department of Justice, March 2019, 174, available at: www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download (accessed 6 September 2022).\n⁹⁸ Article 51 of the UN Charter, 24 October 1945, in force 24 October 1945, 1 UNTS XVI.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009374576.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nRESPONDING TO PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CYBERATTACKS 123\nharm.⁹⁹ The case discussed the mining of ports and arming hostile militia by the United States. The judgment does, however, suggest that economic harm (e.g. tariffs and embargoes) may suffice as well if it is particularly serious. It usually takes time to gather and analyse facts related to cyberattacks, which often involve multiple jurisdictions. Therefore, some question whether self-defence can be available as a lawful response to the attack, which may essentially mean that states are effectively precluded from any lawful response, including self-defence, which in turn creates incentives to engage in covert retaliatory cyber operations.¹⁰⁰\nAs a matter of public international law, state responses should evolve using analogies for countering physical force. States may take non-forcible countermeasures against another state to procure cessation and achieve reparation for the injury.¹⁰¹ Countermeasures also have a prerequisite of proportionality and necessity.¹⁰² The state relying on them must also request reparation from the perpetrator and its intention to exercise countermeasures.¹⁰³ The ILC notes that countermeasures which are reciprocal to the harm are more likely to satisfy proportionality and necessity.¹⁰⁴\nOne example of such countermeasures is the US response to Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. The US response resulted in not only domestic indictments and prosecutions but comprehensive sanctions on the Russian economy and specific Russian nationals involved in the hybrid attacks and disinformation campaign.¹⁰⁵ State responses must be proportionate and, even in cases of less severe\n⁹⁹ Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

The argument is that states are obliged under customary and treaty law to prevent the activities of non-state actors from breaching the rights of third states, taking all reasonable means available to them on their territory and even in certain circumstances, extraterritorially.¹⁰⁸\nThe difficulty with applying traditional public international law is that countermeasures must be directed against the responsible state only,¹⁰⁹ which triggers questions about the determination of the identity of the offenders. The transnational character of offences complicates attributing cyber offences to a specific state. This is particularly the case when the state is hiding behind private actors based in multiple jurisdictions. The existing international law of state responsibility also fails to address the situations in which states systematically direct and support non-state actors based in multiple jurisdictions without putting that actor under its formal leadership or chain of command.¹¹⁰ Such situations may trigger the need for states to establish due diligence mechanisms to tackle unlawful non-state actors in their territory, including those which cause harm to other states.¹¹¹\nAmerica's Adversaries through Sanctions Act of 2017 (H.R.3364), available at: www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/3364/text (accessed 18 July 2022).\n¹⁰⁶ Generally, Anders Henriksen, 'Lawful State Responses to Low-Level Cyber-Attacks: Current Development' (2015) 84(2) Nordic Journal of International Law 323–351.\n¹⁰⁷ Ibid.\n¹⁰⁸ Generally, Susan Brenner, 'At Light Speed: Attribution and Response to Cybercrime/Terrorism/Warfare' (2007) 97(2) Journal of Criminal Law &amp; Criminology 379–476.\n¹⁰⁹ Ibid.\n¹¹⁰ Ibid.\n¹¹¹ It must be noted that even states which follow similar approaches to cybersecurity have different views about whether cybersecurity due diligence is mandatory as a matter of international law.

Espionage, for example,¹¹² although considered an unfriendly act, is not unlawful under international law.¹¹³ Following this logic, cyberespionage is also not unlawful under international law. Cyberattacks usually aim at procurement of information or surveillance and seldom cause physical damage. For this reason, it is difficult to distinguish between lawful cyberespionage and an unlawful cyberattack in the absence of conventional force.\nExamples of countermeasures following a state-on-state cyberattack are sparse, but retaliatory threats are not unusual.¹¹⁴ Recently, NATO leaders reaffirmed that a cyberattack against one of its members can trigger Article 5 of the NATO Convention and constitute an attack on all. Further, they reaffirm that countermeasures to a cyberattack need not be limited to cyberspace.¹¹⁵ Following the 2014 Sony Hack, North Korea reportedly had its internet infrastructure disabled and lost access to the Internet for some time. This occurred hours after President Obama publicly announced a ‘proportional response’ to the hack on Sony.¹¹⁶\nThe International Strategy for Cyber Space adopted by President Barack Obama proclaimed that the United States ‘will respond to hostile acts in cyberspace as we would to any other threat to our country’.

The back-and-forth between Iran and the United States and its allies over the Iranian nuclear enrichment programme underscores the need for a comprehensive re-evaluation of public international law on cyberattacks to prevent a cycle of unchecked aggression and escalation.\nIn a sense, countermeasures against public cyberattacks is still a very much uncharted territory, which lacks enough state practice. There is little doubt, however, that general public international law and attribution should apply in this context and account for the transborder and dispersed nature of cyberattacks.\n## 5.4.2.2 State Responsibility Based on Due Diligence and Strict Liability\nThe difficulty with collecting evidence related to cyberattacks, including on attribution of the conduct of private actors to states to state actors, has led to proposals to adopt due diligence or strict liability approaches to state responsibility.¹²⁷ Arguably, a strict liability model also encourages state co-operation by creating potential liability for reparations.\nIn the Corfu Channel case, the International Court of Justice highlighted the generally recognised principle of international law binding upon states ‘not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States’.¹²⁸ In other words, the state needs\n¹²⁴ Ronen Bergman, Rick Gladstone, and Farnaz Fassihi, ‘Blackout Hits Iran Nuclear Site in What Appears to Be Israeli Sabotage’ *New York Times*, 11 April 2021, available at: www.nytimes.com/2021/04/11/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-natanz.html (accessed 18 July 2022).\n¹²⁵ Patrick Wintour, ‘Iran to Boost Uranium Enrichment Levels in Wake of Israeli Attack’ *The Guardian*, 13 April 2021, available at: www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/13/natanz-nuclear-site-attack-iran-accuses-israel-of-bad-gamble (accessed 18 July 2022).\n¹²⁶ Sina Azodi and Mohsen Solhdoost, ‘An Escalating Israel-Iran Conflict Could Sink the JCPOA’ *Atlantic Council*, 1 September 2021, available at: www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/iransource/an-escalating-israel-iran-conflict-could-sink-the-jcpoa (accessed 18 July 2022).\n¹²⁷ Generally, James P.

The report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security also states that ‘States should not knowingly allow their territory to be used for internationally wrongful acts using ICTs’.¹²⁹\nAccording to Japan, the due diligence obligation may serve as a ground for the responsibility of the state from the territory of which a cyber operation not attributable to any state was conducted.¹³⁰ The Tallinn Manual 2.0 seems to contemplate a rule of cyber due diligence: ‘A State must exercise due diligence in not allowing its territory, or territory or cyber infrastructure under its governmental control, to be used for cyber operations that affect the rights of, and produce serious adverse consequences for, other States.’¹³¹ That prompted some states to view the due diligence obligation primarily as a duty to prevent rather than to prosecute.¹³²\nA number of states, including Germany,¹³³ France,¹³⁴ Japan,¹³⁵ and Australia,¹³⁶ argued for the application of this principle in cyberspace.\n¹²⁹ UN General Assembly, ‘Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security’ Note by the Secretary-General, 22 July 2015, UN Doc.

Israel sees the difficulty with the inherently different features of cyberspace – its decentralisation and private characteristics.¹³⁹\nIn other words, although many states advocate for the cybersecurity due diligence obligation, currently it has not yet crystallised into a specific obligation. Asking states to commit to concluding a treaty containing such obligations may prove to be a difficult task as the fragmented regime, in which many states will decide not to commit to this obligation, may penalise the states willing to commit to the due diligence obligation. However, there is little doubt that a due diligence approach offers a more effective way to create incentives for states to combat cyberattacks compared to traditional norms of state responsibility.\n## 5.4.2.3 Jurisdiction over Public Cyberattacks\nThe fundamental concept of territoriality applicable in international dispute resolution stems from sovereignty¹⁴⁰ and should also inform jurisdictional decisions of international courts and tribunals resolving state-to-state disputes. Sovereignty also confers responsibilities, which arguably include the responsibility to protect third states against cyberattacks that would violate international law.¹⁴¹ Territoriality might assist in determining whether a state is in breach of its cybersecurity due diligence obligations vis-à-vis another state.\n¹³⁷ UN General Assembly, ‘Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions on the Subject of How International Law Applies to the Use of Information and Communications Technologies by States Submitted by Participating Governmental Experts in the Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security Established Pursuant to General Assembly Resolution 73/266’, 13 July 2021, UN Doc.

It also does not answer whether one state's failure to exercise its due diligence gives the victim state a right to exercise jurisdiction over a cyberattack committed abroad. Taking anti-cyberattack action by targeting servers abroad might violate other states' sovereignty. State consent is therefore essential to the extraterritorial exercise of jurisdiction.¹⁴³ States seem reluctant to prosecute or investigate another state for cybersecurity allegations. The notable exception is the United States, which has commenced domestic proceedings against North Korea that resulted in an indictment.¹⁴⁴\nPublic cyberattacks orchestrated by states should be dealt by the norms of international public law, as any other state-to-state dispute. 'The Oxford Statement on International Law Protections in Cyberspace', prepared by academics, argues that existing international law concepts should be equally applied to cyberspace.¹⁴⁵ At the moment, specific international law rules dealing with public cyberattacks are almost nonexistent, as are specialised dispute resolution bodies. International courts and tribunals, rather than domestic courts, should have jurisdiction over interstate disputes. Following this logic, state-to-state cyberdisputes should be resolved in the same manner as other state-to-state disputes with institutions such as the ICJ and the Permanent Court of Arbitration playing a leading role.\n¹⁴² Ian Yuying Liu, 'State Responsibility and Cyberattacks: Defining Due Diligence Obligations' (2017) 4 Indonesian Journal of International and Comparative Law 191–260 at 257–258.\n¹⁴³ Harriet Moynihan, 'The Application of International Law to State Cyberattacks Sovereignty and Non-Intervention' Chatham House, December 2019, available at: www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/publications/research/2019-11-29-Intl-Law-Cyberattacks.pdf (accessed 18 July 2022).\n¹⁴⁴ United States of America v.

Traditional dispute resolution bodies may also find it difficult to deal with highly technical issues related to attribution and collection of evidence in cyberspace. That undermines the ability of the international community to effectively prevent and respond to cyberattacks. Therefore, the idea of creating a forum to resolve disputes related to cyberattacks, taking into account their public nature, should be seriously considered by states.¹⁴⁶\n## 5.5 Conclusion\nThe task of conceptualising cyberattacks as public or private is challenging, as it requires evidence-based determinations and making judgements related to the possible involvement of state actors. However, the difference between public and private cyberattacks is crucial as it subjects the attack to different legal regimes. States resort to domestic law solutions to deal with private cyberattacks, including measures allowed under domestic law to deal with criminal activities. In this context, international treaties play a limited role, potentially facilitating co-operation between law enforcement agencies.\nAs states dramatically increase their cybersecurity, public cyberattacks present a particular systemic and existential threat, disrupting multiple organisations and critical infrastructure. The analysis above suggests that the effective application of existing international law to public cyberattacks may require the reassessment of application of the concepts of self-defence and countermeasures in cyberspace. Further development of state practice and *opinio iuris* will help shape uniform approaches and crystallisation of principles of international law.\nThe encouragement of co-operation is the most common norm related to cybersecurity in international treaties. Mutual legal assistance treaties provide a right to request assistance, although the other party might not comply with such requests where it is itself behind the cyberattacks.¹⁴⁷\n¹⁴⁶ In this respect, the distinction between private and public adjudication should be taken into account in designing such dispute resolution institution.

Instead, states opt for naming and shaming, and framing accusations.¹⁴⁸ There are, however, efforts to include cyberattacks into major international criminal law treaties, most notably the Rome Statute.¹⁴⁹ Talks on this topic at the UN level are currently ongoing.¹⁵⁰\nAs this chapter has demonstrated, states with similar political regimes tend to co-operate and conclude treaties dealing with cybersecurity (e.g. the Budapest Convention adopted by Western States and the SCO Agreement dominated by China and Russia). Different approaches to cybersecurity and the acceptable level of state interference in matters of cybersecurity also demonstrate the limits of truly global co-operation, as opposed to co-operation between allies. In the absence of specialised treaties of international tribunals dealing with cybersecurity threats, general provisions of public international law should apply.\nInternational courts and tribunals should have jurisdiction over cyberattacks, as such disputes involve states and are governed by public international law. Although a cyberattack-related case has not yet been brought, the ICJ might be a natural forum for such state-to-state claims. Investment tribunals have in the past condemned cyberattacks in their decisions and by excluding evidence obtained by hacking.¹⁵¹ However, a dedicated international dispute resolution forum with jurisdiction over cyberattack is missing.¹⁵² Although existing public international law should apply equally to public cyberattacks, the novelty of cyberspace creates areas of confusion.

  "flat_text": "Jurisdiction, Self-Defence, and Countermeasures\nYARIK KRYVOI\n## 5.1 Introduction\nAlthough scholarship dealing with cybersecurity usually does not distinguish between private and public cyberattacks, this chapter demonstrates that this distinction is crucial to effectively respond to cyberattacks. A recent United Nations report suggested that international human rights law represents an important external reference point for criminalisation and procedural provisions related to cyberattacks. However, this is not necessarily the case for public cyberattacks, which involve state–state relations.\nThis chapter argues that the determination of whether a particular cyberattack is of public or private nature (a cybercrime) should define how states respond to cybersecurity risks. Section 5.3 of this chapter demonstrates that non-state actors motivated by financial gain or ideology perpetrate private cyberattacks, which typically target non-state entities, rather than states (see Section 5.3.1). Such cyberattacks require primarily domestic law responses based on the principle of territoriality and alternative principles.\nStates act as the main perpetrators of public cyberattacks, usually motivated not by financial gain but by political and strategic objectives such as causing harm, interfering with internal political processes or gaining access to sensitive information (see Section 5.3.2). They can\n United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, ‘Comprehensive Study on Cybercrime’ UN Publications, February 2013, available at: www.unodc.org/documents/organized-crime/UNODC_CCPCJ_EG.4_2013/CYBERCRIME_STUDY_210213.pdf (accessed 18 July 2022).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009374576.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nYARIK KRYVOI\nundermine critical infrastructure, national security, the democratic legitimacy of institutions, or political freedoms.\nSection 5.4 of this chapter shows that public cyberattacks require not only domestic law but also international law responses. If the state-sponsored nature of a cyberattack can be established with a degree of certainty, this should trigger the state's rights to self-defence and to respond with countermeasures to procure cessation and achieve reparation for the injury. The difficulty with collecting evidence related to cyberattacks, including on attribution of the conduct of private actors to state actors, has led to proposals to adopt due diligence or strict liability approaches to state responsibility (see Section 5.4.2).\nThe chapter concludes that the effective application of existing international law to public cyberattacks may require the reassessment of application of the concepts of self-defence and countermeasures in cyberspace. It highlights the limits of global treaty-making in the area of cybersecurity and calls for establishment of a dispute resolution body in charge of public cyberattacks, which could develop jurisprudence to assist in the application of existing norms to cyberspace and the development of new, cyberspace-specific, norms.\n## 5.2 Conceptual Framework\nTable 5.1 highlights the differences between private, hybrid, and public cyberattacks, discussed in more detail in subsequent sections. It shows that despite commonalities, public and private cyberattacks are governed by separate legal regimes, have different motivations, and vary in severity. Hybrid cyberattacks blur the distinction between the two – and while they appear as private attacks, they are in fact public. The rest of the chapter examines different aspects of the distinction between private and public cyberattacks and responses to them.\n## 5.3 The Nature and Legal Regimes of Private and Public Cyberattacks\n### 5.3.1 Private Cyberattacks\n#### 5.3.1.1 Nature of Private Cyberattacks\nCyberspace creates a fertile environment for criminal activities, as it allows perpetrators to pose security threats or engage in money laundering or data theft, or facilitate corruption across borders without leaving\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009374576.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTable 5.1 Key features of private and public cyberattacks\n|   | Private cyberattacks (cybercrimes) | Public cyberattacks  |   |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|   |   |  Hybrid cyberattacks | Direct cyberattacks  |\n|  Perpetrator | Non-state actors | Non-state and state actors | States  |\n|  Motivation | Usually, financially or ideologically motivated. Private cyberattacks often have an ulterior motive (obtain profit, strike fear or send a message), rather than merely cause damage for other reasons | A mix of financial, ideological, political motivation, and possibility of for-profit motivations | Mainly politically motivated, to cause damage or gain access to sensitive information  |\n|  Targets and severity of impact | Varies from small to large targets but usually targets other non-state entities, rather than states with varying severity of impact | Varies from small targets to large targets with severe impact | Highly severe. Public cyberattacks most often target other states but may also be aimed at non-state actors. They can undermine critical infrastructure, national security, democratic legitimacy and institutions, or political freedoms  |\n|  Dominant applicable law | Domestic law | Domestic and international law | International law  |\n|  Typical forms | • Ransomware attacks • Personal data leaks • Cyberterrorism • Malware hacking • Online child sexual exploitation • Cyber-enabled crimes | Can take the forms of private and public cyberattacks | • Election hacking • Cyberattacks on state digital infrastructure • Cyberattacks on foreign military targets • Cyberespionage  |\n|  Responses | In accordance with domestic laws: • Domestic administrative and criminal law countermeasures | In accordance with domestic and public international law, including: • Self-defence • Proportionate and necessary countermeasures • Domestic proceedings  |   |\nYARIK KRYVOI\ntheir homes. Criminals, extremists, and terrorists can exploit such new technologies, which allow them to pursue illicit activities or spread radical ideologies internationally from safe havens, thus circumventing traditional domestic legal systems and law enforcement measures.\nSome even labelled the cybercrime economy as the ‘Web of Profit’, with a variety of criminal activities, generating revenues from illicit online markets, IP and trade secret theft, and data crimeware and ransomware. According to some estimates, cybercrime revenues annually reach around US$1.5 trillion. Cyberattacks can also cause significant disruption and lead to very high costs – for example, some estimates suggest that potential cost of the 2017 WannaCry attack was US$4 billion.\nPrivate cyberattacks emanate from private individuals or groups usually motivated by gaining profit (e.g. ransom attacks) or ideological reasons (e.g. propaganda of terrorism). Private actors may engage in personal data leaks, economic crimes, terrorism, and sexual offences. With a few exceptions, normally such crimes do not rise to the level of posing a threat to national security since profit is the primary motivation of private cyberattacks.\nIt must be noted that the same cyberattacks can be perpetrated by either private or public actors. This includes hacking and illegal access, data or ID theft, cyber sabotage, spreading viruses, and distributing worms, spyware, and logic bombs. The United Nations Manual on Computer-related Crime includes fraud as well as forgery in its list of cybercrimes. What matters for the determination of public or private nature of cyberattacks is whether the ultimate perpetrator is a public or a private actor.\n Ibid.\n See, for example, European Commission, ‘Reflection Paper on Harnessing Globalisation’ (2017) EU Publications 12–13, available at: https://commission.europa.eu/publications/reflection-paper-harnessing-globalisation_en (accessed 6 September 2022).\n Michael McGuire, ‘Nation States, Cyberconflict and the Web of Profit’ (2021) HP Development Company, available at: https://threatresearch.ext.hp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/hp-bps-web-of-profit-report_APR_2021.pdf (accessed 6 September 2022).\n Ibid., 20.\n Jonathan Berr, “WannaCry” Ransomware Attack Losses Could Reach $4 billion’ CBS News, 16 May 2017, available at: www.cbsnews.com/news/wannacry-ransomware-attacks-wannacry-virus-losses/ (accessed 6 September 2022).\n United Nations, United Nations Manual on the Prevention and Control of Computer-Related Crime (New York: United Nations, 1994), available at: www.unodc.org/pdf/Manual_ComputerRelatedCrime.PDF (accessed 6 September 2022).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009374576.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nRESPONDING TO PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CYBERATTACKS 107\nAn example of a private cyberattack is the 2013 attack on the US web services provider Yahoo, which led to the loss of one billion users' data. In another incident, hackers gained access to the personal data of 100 million users of a major Australian tech company. One can think of situations in which private cyberattacks may go beyond causing damage to particular organisations and individuals and pose a threat to critical infrastructure (e.g. hospitals, electricity, or military facilities). For example, the 2021 Colonial Pipeline Hack in the United States was carried out by a private group seeking ransom, who disabled thousands of miles of US energy infrastructure for nearly a week. A cyberattack against a US water treatment facility in Florida, which temporarily increased the levels of chemicals in drinking water, was also likely caused by a private hacker.\nTo sum up, non-state actors commit private cyberattacks, most of which aim at financial gain but can also be motivated by ideological reasons. Such cyberattacks usually do not raise to the level of causing national security threats, although the largest ones may do so.\n## 5.3.1.2 Legal Norms to Tackle Private Cyberattacks\nDomestic rather than international law plays a key role in preventing and responding to private cyberattacks. However, many states, particularly those less economically developed, have neither laws penalising cyberattacks nor the capacity to enforce them.

Its signatories also include states from outside of the Council of Europe such as the United States, Australia, Japan, and Nigeria but nonetheless, most of its signatories are Western states. This convention influenced similar approaches to regulating cybercrimes in state parties of the Convention.\nFor example, in the United Kingdom, legal guidance broadens the scope of existing crimes such as fraud or sexual offences to cyberspace. The UK Computer Misuse Act 1990 relates to offences or attacks directly against computer systems and has been amended multiple times since its passing. English courts take jurisdiction where such crimes substantially relate to English laws or interests. Similarly, Germany, which adopted the IT Security Act of 2015, broadened the scope of existing offences to cyberspace and added many cybercrimes such as hacking and identity theft into its Criminal Code. The United States has no dedicated cybercrime legislation and instead amends existing statutes to apply to cyberspace.\nAs explained in more detail in Chapter 4 of this book, Russia has been critical of the Budapest Convention, arguing that it endangers national sovereignty, particularly on the provisions dealing with transborder\n McConnell International, ‘Cyber Crime . . . and Punishment?

Instead, it has advocated for a new UN Treaty to fight cybercrime. Russia presented what subsequently became the Resolution adopted by the General Assembly in 2019 on Countering the Use of Information and Communications Technologies for Criminal Purposes. Russia is seen as doing this in an effort to replace the Budapest Convention on cybercrime and laying the foundation for the possibility to extradite dissidents and expatriates in other states for using the Internet to upset those in power.\nNon-Western international law instruments include the 2009 Agreement on Cooperation in the Field of International Information Security, signed in Yekaterinburg by Shanghai Cooperation Organization countries, including China, Russia, and several former Soviet Union states ('SCO Agreement'). Among key cyberthreats, it mentions the development and deployment of information warfare, preparation and waging of information warfare, information terrorism, information crimes, and the exploitation of dominant positions in the information space to the detriment of other states' interests.\nThe SCO Agreement also explicitly mentions the threat of spreading of 'information causing harm to political and socio-economic systems, spiritual, moral and cultural sphere of other States'. In other words, it is much more specific about public cyberthreats and hints at Western states, which dominate cyberspace and are seen by signatories as a potential source of cyberthreats. The SCO Agreement does not attempt to harmonise domestic legislation but instead focuses on co-operation between states, information exchange, and joint cybersecurity threat evaluation.\n T.

The contrasts between the above-discussed Vietnamese and US cybersecurity regimes underscore the need for cross-jurisdictional co-operation and harmonisation, as cybercrimes are often international in nature.\nInternational agreements, such as the 2001 Budapest Convention, clearly target private cyberthreats and aim primarily at co-ordinating the efforts of states and ironing out differences in domestic law. The convention's preamble refers to the need to secure a balance between the interests of law enforcement and respect for fundamental rights, protection of personal data, and co-operation in the penal field. However, most international law instruments remain silent on harmonisation and the need to protect fundamental rights in response to private cyberthreats.\n## 5.3.2 Public Cyberattacks\n### 5.3.2.1 Nature of Public Cyberattacks\nA recent study identified over 200 cybersecurity incidents connected to nation-states over the last eleven years.[27] States are increasing their spending on cybersecurity. For example, the United States in 2021 increased it by 14 per cent.[28] China adopted a programme to grow its cybersecurity\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009374576.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nRESPONDING TO PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CYBERATTACKS 111\nindustry by 15 per cent annually in 2021–2023. Russia plans to increase spending on cybersecurity in 2022 and 2023 by 800 per cent in a dedicated federal project on information cybersecurity. This demonstrates an increased strategic interest in cybersecurity and significant funds invested in the capacity to launch new kinds of cyberattacks.\nState actors perpetrate public cyberattacks either directly or through affiliated private entities. Such cyberattacks may involve undermining political institutions and media, interfering with critical financial or military infrastructure, or merely stealing personal data. Although less frequent than private cyberattacks, the sophistication of public cyber-threats and the political sensitivity of such cases make responding to them difficult. Moreover, cyberattacks emanating from state actors usually pose a greater threat to national security.\nStates seldom openly engage in cyberattacks through official government entities and avoid admitting to such conduct. Consequently, the distinction between private and public cyberattacks is not always clear-cut, as hybrid cyberattacks involving co-operation between state and private actors become increasingly frequent. Many states increasingly deploy the tools and techniques used by private actors, and some recruit them to act as proxies in their interest.\nFor example, several recent attacks of which Russia is accused could be regarded as hybrid cyberattacks. For example, in May 2021 Russian-based hackers, with suspected links to the state, attacked over 150 different government agencies and human rights groups in the United States and other countries. In June 2021, Russian hackers (meaning Russian nationals) conducted ransomware attacks against one of the largest American meat processors. The US government has accused the Russian state of instigating these attacks.

The Russian state was also accused of conducting global campaigns to compromise enterprise and cloud environments in various countries, switching off electric power stations abroad, hacking electoral authorities, and creating some of the world's most destructive computer viruses and refusing to co-operate in investigating such attacks.\nMost public cyberattacks are clearly politically motivated. For example, in 2014, North Korea was blamed for an attack on Sony following the release of the film The Interview. In 2007, Estonia, one of Europe's smaller states, faced an attack by bots originating from almost 180 different countries, which was widely believed to be orchestrated by Russia. Russia also launched a cyberattack on Georgia in 2008, which supplemented the conventional phase of Russia–Georgia war. Geopolitically motivated cybersecurity threats can also target elections, such as Russian interference in the 2016 US election.\nState actors may also be involved in cyberattacks for financial gain.

Such attacks remain public even though motivated by financial gain, because state is the ultimate perpetrator.\nRussia and North Korea are by no means the only states conducting cyberattacks, but the explicit links between the above-listed attacks and Russian and North Korean state interests demonstrate that even when there is an apparently obvious link, definitively linking an attack to a specific state entity remains difficult.\nMoreover, a state entity might stand behind attacks seemingly conducted by private entities acting alone and of their own volition. For example, in the 2021 SolarWinds Hack, a group of Russian state-backed hackers infiltrated a US-based software group to gain access to the email networks of US federal agencies and corporations. Such attacks appear as private cyberattacks, but a state stands behind the non-state actors carrying them out. Essentially, they are public cyberattacks and the difficulty lies in attribution. Attribution of cyberattacks to a state presents complex factual and legal questions, which eventually determine whether such an attack can be regarded as private or public. This chapter deals primarily with issues of legal attribution, which is different from technical attribution (a factual and technical investigation) and political attribution (a policy decision attributing an attack to an actor without necessarily attaching legal consequences such as countermeasures).\nIn accordance with the International Law Commission (ILC) Articles on State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts, cyberattacks can be attributed to a state if they were conducted by organs of a state or if the conduct was directed or controlled by a state. If the state-sponsored nature of the attack can be established with certainty, this may\n Katrina Manson, Helen Warrell, and Hannah Murphy, ‘North Koreans Charged in $1.3bn Cyber-Hack Spree’ Financial Times, 18 February 2021, available at: www.ft.com/content/3556c699-8bff-4837-abb1-1ef70d2094d4 (accessed 6 September 2022).\n See, for example, Center for Strategic and International Studies, ‘Significant Cyber Incidents’ Center for Strategic and International Studies, available at: www.csis.org/programs/strategic-technologies-program/significant-cyber-incidents (accessed 6 September 2022).\n Hanna Murphy, ‘Russia-Linked Hackers Target IT Supply Chain with Ransomware’ Financial Times, 4 July 2021, available at: www.ft.com/content/a8e7c9a2-5819-424f-b087-c6f2e8f0c7a1 (accessed 6 September 2022).\n International Law Commission, ‘Commentaries to Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts’, UN GAOR 56th Session, Supp. No. 10, at 43, UN Doc.

However, the existing standards of attribution under Articles 4 and 8 of the ILC Articles fail to capture scenarios where state support to a private actor is sporadic or without involvement in the decision-making structures, or where a private actor is supported by more than one state.\nThe real difficulty with distinguishing private and public cyberattacks, and their attribution is the scarcity of evidence. For example, in December 2020, private companies and US officials unearthed a massive espionage campaign posing a ‘grave risk’ to the government, critical infrastructure, and private sector. They have blamed ‘nation-state’ hackers and suggested that Russia was to blame, who in turn, has strongly denied any involvement.\nAccording to the prevailing view, cyberattacks conducted by non-state actors are usually not attributable to states and do not constitute a use of force by states under the UN Charter. However, the conduct of a non-state actor may be attributed to a state where the non-state actor is ‘acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of’ the state, or where the state acknowledges and adopts the conduct as its own. In the Nicaragua case, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled that actions of individuals, which de jure are not organs of a state, may be attributable also if (1) they operated in accordance with ‘planning and direction’ of organs of that state, were paid, equipped, and generally supported by them or (2) the state paid or equipped them, although they had a degree of independence of that state (e.g. the Nicaraguan rebels in that case).\nIn Tadić, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia advanced the ‘overall control’ test, requiring that ‘the State wields overall control over the group, not only by equipping and financing\n For a more detailed analysis, see Nicholas Tsagourias, ‘Cyber Attacks, Self-defence and the Problem of Attribution’ (2012) 17 Journal of Conflict and Security Law 229–244.

This test lowers the threshold of control required for attributing responsibility to the state compared to the effective control test. Subsequently, the ICJ has rejected the use of the ‘overall control’ test. Regardless of whether the ‘overall control’ of the ‘effective control’ test applies, the attribution threshold is high and mere state funding or equipping groups will not result in attribution.\nBecause of difficulties with finding evidence, currently attribution of cyberattacks remains largely political rather than legal. A good example is the already-mentioned US attribution of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. The Obama administration quickly attributed it to Russia, but a thorough report prepared by the Select Committee on Intelligence on the Russian cyber intrusions came out only in 2020.\nTo sum up, state actors perpetrate public cyberattacks either directly or through affiliated private entities. Most of such attacks are clearly politically motivated. The real difficulty with distinguishing private and public cyberattacks, and their attribution is the scarcity of evidence. Attribution becomes even more complicated if a state entity stands behind attacks seemingly conducted by private entities acting alone and of their own volition.\n## 5.3.2.2 Legal Norms to Tackle Public Cyberattacks\nAs discussed above, international regulations on cyberattacks remain scarce.

Russia has been accused of such tactics by granting refuge to convicted foreign ransomware hackers. The UK National Cyber Security Centre, FBI, and the US Department of Homeland Security called on Russia to cease such activities. International law does not give a simple answer to whether harbouring individual criminals guilty of cyberattacks attributes that conduct to the state and the scope of the obligation of states under international law to prevent activities of non-state actors breaching the rights of third states.\nThe ILC has suggested that the Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities could apply to cyberattacks, even though this instrument does not explicitly mention cyberattacks. It applies to activities not prohibited by international law but ones causing transboundary harm and provides that the state of origin of the harm ‘shall take all appropriate measures to prevent significant transboundary harm or at any event to minimize the risk thereof’. This is known as the obligation of due diligence, regarded as a general principle of international law. The ICJ in the Corfu Channel case stated: ‘it is every State’s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States’.\n See, for example, Department of Justice, ‘Canadian Hacker Who Conspired With and Aided Russian FSB Officers Pleads Guilty’ Department of Justice, 28 November 2017, available at: www.justice.gov/opa/pr/canadian-hacker-who-conspired-and-aided-russian-fsb-officers-pleads-guilty (accessed 18 July 2022); Tim Maurer, ‘Why the Russian Government Turns a Blind Eye to Cybercriminals’ Slate, 2 February 2018, available at: https://slate.com/technology/2018/02/why-the-russian-government-turns-a-blind-eye-to-cybercriminals.html (accessed 18 July 2022).\n NCSC, ‘Russian State-Sponsored Cyber Actors Targeting Network Infrastructure Devices’ NCSC, 15 April 2018, available at: www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/russian-state-sponsored-cyber-actors-targeting-network-infrastructure-devices (accessed 18 July 2022).\n Ibid.\n International Law Commission, ‘Commentaries on Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities’ (2001) 2(2) Yearbook of the International Law Commission 148.\n Ibid., Article 1.\n Ibid., Article 3.\n Luke Chircop, ‘A Due Diligence Standard of Attribution in Cyberspace’ (2018) 67 International &amp; Comparative Law Quarterly 643–668 at 649–650; see also Scott J.

A state can only breach the due diligence obligation if (a) it had actual or constructive knowledge of the cyberattack launched from its territory, (b) that attack is contrary to the rights of another state, and (c) it failed to take reasonable measures to prevent it. Furthermore, as the Seabed Mining Advisory Opinion clarifies, the obligation may change in relation to the risk involved in the activity. The greater the risk, the stronger the obligation for the state to act.\nThe above requirements for due diligence should flexibly consider the technical capacity of the state to engage in due diligence. Cyberattacks seldom fit with the territorial logic – the criminals might be in one state but remotely conduct their activities through third countries.\nIt also raises the issue of attribution within the meaning of Article 4 (conducted by organs of a state) and Article 8 (conduct was directed or controlled by a state) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts. Following the logic of due diligence, if a state fails to exercise due diligence to prevent transboundary harms’ situation, that would also amount to ‘public cyberattacks’ that trigger state countermeasures as discussed in more detail in Section 5.3.1.\nRegardless of whether the cyberattacks are private or public, states need to be prepared to deal with them proactively, including before admitting investments through foreign direct investment review mechanisms, by regulating already admitted investments, or by responding to national security breaches as they occur.\n## 5.4 Responding to Cyberattacks\n### 5.4.1 Private Cyberattacks\nBecause not all attacks can be pre-empted, states must also consider how to respond to them. Whether a cyberattack is public or private in nature\n Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0, 30–50.\n Ibid.; see also Luke Chircop, ‘A Due Diligence Standard of Attribution in Cyberspace’ (2018) 67 International &amp; Comparative Law Quarterly 643–668 at 650–651.\n Seabed Mining (Advisory Opinion) [2011] International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, 50 ILM 458, para. 117.\n Karine Bannelier-Christakis, ‘Cyber Diligence: A Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations?’ (2014) 14 Baltic Yearbook of International Law 23–39 at 30.\n See Chapter 8 on this point.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009374576.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nYARIK KRYVOI\ndetermines the type of response available in accordance with domestic or international law.\nAs discussed above, private cyberattack regulation in domestic law does not differ greatly from the regulation of any other crime. In fact, cyberattacks are often understood as versions of existing crimes such as fraud or damage to property, committed through or facilitated using cyberspace. For this reason, the primary response to private cyberattacks is traditional criminal proceedings in domestic courts.\n## 5.4.1.1 Countermeasures against Private Cyberattacks\nStates can take countermeasures against private threats in accordance with domestic law. One example is the response to the 2021 ransomware hacking of a US pipeline (Colonial Pipeline Attack). That private cyberattack on critical domestic infrastructure was launched not for politically motivated offensive or strategic reasons but for pure financial gain. Attackers hacked the pipeline network and demanded ransom to unlock the pipeline. The response was a typical law enforcement activity. The US Department of Justice, using traditional law enforcement agencies (albeit with new, unprecedented integration of cyberspace strategies), seized the bitcoins used to pay the hackers' ransom. Host states may confiscate assets that they see as tools of cyberattacks or expropriate businesses, which pose cyberthreats to the host state. This is in effect no different from police seizing stolen money or assets from thieves or ransom-demanders.\nSimilarly, the group responsible for the Colonial Pipeline Attack had their accounts frozen and stolen bitcoins (used by Colonial to pay their ransom) forcibly recovered by the US Department of Justice. These examples demonstrate the extension of traditional law enforcement jurisdiction and strategies to cyberspace, even when that 'space' is beyond the traditional physical jurisdiction of the state.\n## 5.4.1.2 Jurisdiction over Private Cyberattacks\n5.4.1.2.1 The Territoriality Approach Since private cyberattacks are governed by domestic law like any other crime, territoriality is the cornerstone jurisdictional principle. It is based on the principle that a\n Alexander Mallin and Luke Barr, ‘DOJ Seizes Millions in Ransom Paid by Colonial Pipeline’ ABC, 7 June 2021, available at: https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/doj-seizes-millions-ransom-paid-colonial-pipeline/story?id=78135821 (accessed 18 July 2022).\n Ibid.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009374576.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nRESPONDING TO PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CYBERATTACKS 119\nstate and its organs will have jurisdiction over a crime if it occurred, wholly or in part, in the physical territory of that state. This principle has been enshrined in virtually all domestic criminal laws for centuries.71 It should follow from the territorial jurisdiction principle that if the act occurred, wholly or in part, in the physical territory of the state, it has authority to prosecute and adjudicate such acts. For example, the US government has claimed jurisdiction to prosecute state-sponsored cyberattacks in domestic courts, leading to several indictments.72\nThe application of the territoriality principle may be challenging in the context of cyberattacks, which are usually not physically grounded in one jurisdiction, can affect multiple states, be committed entirely remotely, and routed through several jurisdictions.73 Three challenges complicate asserting jurisdiction over cyberattacks: (a) the international dispersal of illegal activities; (b) jurisdiction may be impossible to assert because conduct may be legal in one jurisdiction but illegal in another, hindering prosecution; and (c) jurisdiction to prosecute may be claimed by several states simultaneously, causing problems with establishing priority between them.74\nFurther, different jurisdictional considerations apply to local cyberattacks and transnational cyberattacks. The former conforms to the traditional model of a crime.75 The latter might pose jurisdictional issues because of its detachment from state territory. However, states can still apply the principle of territoriality and assert jurisdiction over crimes where all or part of the cyberattack occurred in their territory (a ‘substantial effect’ doctrine).76\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009374576.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nYARIK KRYVOI\nThe Budapest Convention supports this reading of jurisdiction. In cases of conflicting jurisdictions, the Convention provides little guidance, merely noting that ‘the Parties involved shall . . . consult with a view to determining the most appropriate jurisdiction for prosecution’. The United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime contains language to the same effect.\nAnother difficulty is that, pursuant to the respect for sovereignty noted above, extradition treaties require ‘double criminality’, that is, the conduct at issue must have been a crime in both countries for extradition to be permissible. As noted earlier, criminality of cyberattacks is incoherent between jurisdictions, which prevents co-operation on extradition.\nReinterpretation of territoriality might solve the issue. Instead of searching for the location of the criminal act, states could instead consider the location of the computers themselves. Singapore claims jurisdiction over cyberattacks ‘if, for the offence in question . . . the computer, program or data was in Singapore at the material time’. Some US states, such as Connecticut, have statutes that confer jurisdiction in cybercrime cases on the fact that some part of the conduct constituting a cybercrime offence impacts a computer located in that state. Finally, states always retain jurisdiction over satellites launched from their territory. Since internet access is becoming increasingly dependent on satellites, this jurisdictional link might prove more useful.\nHowever, as this review suggests, the traditional territoriality approach has significant limitations if applied in the context of cyberattacks.\n5.4.1.2.2 Alternatives to the Territoriality Approach Asserting jurisdiction on the basis of the territory principle is particularly ineffective in\n Article 22 of the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, 23 November 2001, in force 1 July 2004, ETS No. 185 (Budapest Convention).\n Ibid., Article 22(5).\n Article 15 of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, 15 November 2000, in force 29 September 2003, UN Doc.

For these reasons, other jurisdictional principles could apply. The Budapest Convention requires parties to establish jurisdiction ‘when the offence is committed (...) by one of its nationals, if the offence is punishable under criminal law where it was committed or if the offence is committed outside the territorial jurisdiction of any State’. Several domestic criminal legal systems contain equivalent provisions.\nFor cyberattacks with the most serious consequences, such as cyberterrorism, some suggest universal jurisdiction could be attached. Others suggest that violations of human rights or crimes against humanity should also be covered by universal jurisdiction.\nJurisdiction based on the nationality of the target of the cyberattack is another approach adopted in domestic systems. For example, Germany has a very general jurisdiction provision based on the nationality of the victim: if an attack is committed against a German national regardless of whether the crime is punishable in the country where it was committed. Similarly, in Belgium, a crime against a Belgian national falls under the jurisdiction if the act is punishable in the country where it was committed. In the United States, the basic federal cybercrime provision confers jurisdiction to prosecute when the conduct at issue impacts the federal government, that is, where the United States is itself the victim.\nFinally, the protective principle allows states to assert jurisdiction where national security is threatened.

It is, inter alia, defined as a computer that is ‘used in interstate or foreign commerce or communication, including a computer located outside the United States that is used in a manner that affects interstate or foreign commerce or communication of the United States’.\nAs this review suggests, territoriality is not the only approach to determining jurisdiction over private cyberattacks. Different domestic legal systems follow other approaches, such as focusing on the nationality of the victim or the location of computers used in cyberattacks. More judicial practice could help adopt more cohesive and predictable approaches to jurisdiction over geographically dispersed cyberattacks. Approaches to conflict of laws issues vary widely between states, which requires not only judicial practice but also efforts to harmonise and codify jurisdictional rules on private cyberattacks.\n## 5.4.2 Public Cyberattacks\n### 5.4.2.1 Countermeasures against Public Cyberattacks\nResponses to public cyberattacks are very different from private cyberattacks. States may bring cases before domestic courts, explained in the previous section, but this has limited effectiveness vis-à-vis states, the ultimate perpetrators, due to sovereign immunity. In practice, because of the limited jurisdictional reach against state perpetrators, the target state has to respond to private individuals involved in cyberattacks as if these were private cyberattacks. For example, in 2018, a federal grand jury in the District of Columbia charged thirteen Russian nationals and three Russian entities with violating US criminal laws in order to interfere with US elections and political processes.\nStates can also respond to public cyberattacks in accordance with public international law. The UN Charter guarantees the right of states to self-defence against an armed attack. The Nicaragua case highlighted that for self-defence to be triggered, a state usually has to face physical\n\n Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller, ‘Report on the Investigation into Russian Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election’ Department of Justice, March 2019, 174, available at: www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download (accessed 6 September 2022).\n Article 51 of the UN Charter, 24 October 1945, in force 24 October 1945, 1 UNTS XVI.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009374576.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nRESPONDING TO PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CYBERATTACKS 123\nharm. The case discussed the mining of ports and arming hostile militia by the United States. The judgment does, however, suggest that economic harm (e.g. tariffs and embargoes) may suffice as well if it is particularly serious. It usually takes time to gather and analyse facts related to cyberattacks, which often involve multiple jurisdictions. Therefore, some question whether self-defence can be available as a lawful response to the attack, which may essentially mean that states are effectively precluded from any lawful response, including self-defence, which in turn creates incentives to engage in covert retaliatory cyber operations.\nAs a matter of public international law, state responses should evolve using analogies for countering physical force. States may take non-forcible countermeasures against another state to procure cessation and achieve reparation for the injury. Countermeasures also have a prerequisite of proportionality and necessity. The state relying on them must also request reparation from the perpetrator and its intention to exercise countermeasures. The ILC notes that countermeasures which are reciprocal to the harm are more likely to satisfy proportionality and necessity.\nOne example of such countermeasures is the US response to Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. The US response resulted in not only domestic indictments and prosecutions but comprehensive sanctions on the Russian economy and specific Russian nationals involved in the hybrid attacks and disinformation campaign. State responses must be proportionate and, even in cases of less severe\n Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

It has been argued that, when the cyberattack is not sufficiently serious to invoke a need for self-defence under the UN Charter, states may resort to countermeasures to bring the cyberattack to a halt.\nMoreover, the cyberattack does not have to be attributed to a state, but clear evidence should point to its origin in a particular territory. The argument is that states are obliged under customary and treaty law to prevent the activities of non-state actors from breaching the rights of third states, taking all reasonable means available to them on their territory and even in certain circumstances, extraterritorially.\nThe difficulty with applying traditional public international law is that countermeasures must be directed against the responsible state only, which triggers questions about the determination of the identity of the offenders. The transnational character of offences complicates attributing cyber offences to a specific state. This is particularly the case when the state is hiding behind private actors based in multiple jurisdictions. The existing international law of state responsibility also fails to address the situations in which states systematically direct and support non-state actors based in multiple jurisdictions without putting that actor under its formal leadership or chain of command. Such situations may trigger the need for states to establish due diligence mechanisms to tackle unlawful non-state actors in their territory, including those which cause harm to other states.\nAmerica's Adversaries through Sanctions Act of 2017 (H.R.3364), available at: www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/3364/text (accessed 18 July 2022).\n Generally, Anders Henriksen, 'Lawful State Responses to Low-Level Cyber-Attacks: Current Development' (2015) 84(2) Nordic Journal of International Law 323–351.\n Ibid.\n Generally, Susan Brenner, 'At Light Speed: Attribution and Response to Cybercrime/Terrorism/Warfare' (2007) 97(2) Journal of Criminal Law &amp; Criminology 379–476.\n Ibid.\n Ibid.\n It must be noted that even states which follow similar approaches to cybersecurity have different views about whether cybersecurity due diligence is mandatory as a matter of international law.

Espionage, for example, although considered an unfriendly act, is not unlawful under international law. Following this logic, cyberespionage is also not unlawful under international law. Cyberattacks usually aim at procurement of information or surveillance and seldom cause physical damage. For this reason, it is difficult to distinguish between lawful cyberespionage and an unlawful cyberattack in the absence of conventional force.\nExamples of countermeasures following a state-on-state cyberattack are sparse, but retaliatory threats are not unusual. Recently, NATO leaders reaffirmed that a cyberattack against one of its members can trigger Article 5 of the NATO Convention and constitute an attack on all. Further, they reaffirm that countermeasures to a cyberattack need not be limited to cyberspace. Following the 2014 Sony Hack, North Korea reportedly had its internet infrastructure disabled and lost access to the Internet for some time. This occurred hours after President Obama publicly announced a ‘proportional response’ to the hack on Sony.\nThe International Strategy for Cyber Space adopted by President Barack Obama proclaimed that the United States ‘will respond to hostile acts in cyberspace as we would to any other threat to our country’. It also highlights that ‘all states possess an inherent right to self-defence, and we recognise that certain hostile acts conducted through cyberspace could compel actions under the commitments we have with our military\n International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes ad hoc annulment committee in *Libananco v.

According to the 2018 US Department of Defense Defend Forward strategy, the US ‘will defend forward to disrupt or halt malicious cyber activity at its source, including activity that falls below the level of armed conflict’. The same document highlights the determination to engage in defence forward activities not episodically but to deter malicious cyberactivities and contest it on a ‘day-to-day’ basis.\nAn attack by the United States in 2010 against Iran’s nuclear capabilities resulted in Iran forming a ‘Cyber Defense Command’ under the Joint Staff of the Armed Forces. The Cyber Defense Command is similar to its American counterpart, US Cyber Command, which is also a civil intelligence command integrated into an operational military command, with the legal authority to conduct military operations.\nRetaliatory attacks by Iran’s Cyber Defense Command on the United States and its allies soon followed, with the US Department of Homeland Security attributing the attacks to the ‘Iranian nation-state’.

Since then, there has been a noted physical escalation of the conflict between Iran, the United States, and its ally Israel, including attacks by special operations forces from both sides. This shows the increasing connection between public cyberattacks and disproportional physical retaliatory measures, perhaps exaggerated by the lack of international standards and clarity of public international law on responses to public cyberattacks. The back-and-forth between Iran and the United States and its allies over the Iranian nuclear enrichment programme underscores the need for a comprehensive re-evaluation of public international law on cyberattacks to prevent a cycle of unchecked aggression and escalation.\nIn a sense, countermeasures against public cyberattacks is still a very much uncharted territory, which lacks enough state practice. There is little doubt, however, that general public international law and attribution should apply in this context and account for the transborder and dispersed nature of cyberattacks.\n## 5.4.2.2 State Responsibility Based on Due Diligence and Strict Liability\nThe difficulty with collecting evidence related to cyberattacks, including on attribution of the conduct of private actors to states to state actors, has led to proposals to adopt due diligence or strict liability approaches to state responsibility. Arguably, a strict liability model also encourages state co-operation by creating potential liability for reparations.\nIn the Corfu Channel case, the International Court of Justice highlighted the generally recognised principle of international law binding upon states ‘not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States’.

The report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security also states that ‘States should not knowingly allow their territory to be used for internationally wrongful acts using ICTs’.\nAccording to Japan, the due diligence obligation may serve as a ground for the responsibility of the state from the territory of which a cyber operation not attributable to any state was conducted. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 seems to contemplate a rule of cyber due diligence: ‘A State must exercise due diligence in not allowing its territory, or territory or cyber infrastructure under its governmental control, to be used for cyber operations that affect the rights of, and produce serious adverse consequences for, other States.’ That prompted some states to view the due diligence obligation primarily as a duty to prevent rather than to prosecute.\nA number of states, including Germany, France, Japan, and Australia, argued for the application of this principle in cyberspace.\n UN General Assembly, ‘Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security’ Note by the Secretary-General, 22 July 2015, UN Doc.

Israel sees the difficulty with the inherently different features of cyberspace – its decentralisation and private characteristics.\nIn other words, although many states advocate for the cybersecurity due diligence obligation, currently it has not yet crystallised into a specific obligation. Asking states to commit to concluding a treaty containing such obligations may prove to be a difficult task as the fragmented regime, in which many states will decide not to commit to this obligation, may penalise the states willing to commit to the due diligence obligation. However, there is little doubt that a due diligence approach offers a more effective way to create incentives for states to combat cyberattacks compared to traditional norms of state responsibility.\n## 5.4.2.3 Jurisdiction over Public Cyberattacks\nThe fundamental concept of territoriality applicable in international dispute resolution stems from sovereignty and should also inform jurisdictional decisions of international courts and tribunals resolving state-to-state disputes. Sovereignty also confers responsibilities, which arguably include the responsibility to protect third states against cyberattacks that would violate international law. Territoriality might assist in determining whether a state is in breach of its cybersecurity due diligence obligations vis-à-vis another state.\n UN General Assembly, ‘Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions on the Subject of How International Law Applies to the Use of Information and Communications Technologies by States Submitted by Participating Governmental Experts in the Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security Established Pursuant to General Assembly Resolution 73/266’, 13 July 2021, UN Doc.

Such an approach can result in blaming multiple states, as cyberattacks are typically highly dispersed. It also does not answer whether one state's failure to exercise its due diligence gives the victim state a right to exercise jurisdiction over a cyberattack committed abroad. Taking anti-cyberattack action by targeting servers abroad might violate other states' sovereignty. State consent is therefore essential to the extraterritorial exercise of jurisdiction. States seem reluctant to prosecute or investigate another state for cybersecurity allegations. The notable exception is the United States, which has commenced domestic proceedings against North Korea that resulted in an indictment.\nPublic cyberattacks orchestrated by states should be dealt by the norms of international public law, as any other state-to-state dispute. 'The Oxford Statement on International Law Protections in Cyberspace', prepared by academics, argues that existing international law concepts should be equally applied to cyberspace. At the moment, specific international law rules dealing with public cyberattacks are almost nonexistent, as are specialised dispute resolution bodies. International courts and tribunals, rather than domestic courts, should have jurisdiction over interstate disputes. Following this logic, state-to-state cyberdisputes should be resolved in the same manner as other state-to-state disputes with institutions such as the ICJ and the Permanent Court of Arbitration playing a leading role.\n Ian Yuying Liu, 'State Responsibility and Cyberattacks: Defining Due Diligence Obligations' (2017) 4 Indonesian Journal of International and Comparative Law 191–260 at 257–258.\n Harriet Moynihan, 'The Application of International Law to State Cyberattacks Sovereignty and Non-Intervention' Chatham House, December 2019, available at: www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/publications/research/2019-11-29-Intl-Law-Cyberattacks.pdf (accessed 18 July 2022).\n United States of America v.

Traditional dispute resolution bodies may also find it difficult to deal with highly technical issues related to attribution and collection of evidence in cyberspace. That undermines the ability of the international community to effectively prevent and respond to cyberattacks. Therefore, the idea of creating a forum to resolve disputes related to cyberattacks, taking into account their public nature, should be seriously considered by states.\n## 5.5 Conclusion\nThe task of conceptualising cyberattacks as public or private is challenging, as it requires evidence-based determinations and making judgements related to the possible involvement of state actors. However, the difference between public and private cyberattacks is crucial as it subjects the attack to different legal regimes. States resort to domestic law solutions to deal with private cyberattacks, including measures allowed under domestic law to deal with criminal activities. In this context, international treaties play a limited role, potentially facilitating co-operation between law enforcement agencies.\nAs states dramatically increase their cybersecurity, public cyberattacks present a particular systemic and existential threat, disrupting multiple organisations and critical infrastructure. The analysis above suggests that the effective application of existing international law to public cyberattacks may require the reassessment of application of the concepts of self-defence and countermeasures in cyberspace. Further development of state practice and *opinio iuris* will help shape uniform approaches and crystallisation of principles of international law.\nThe encouragement of co-operation is the most common norm related to cybersecurity in international treaties. Mutual legal assistance treaties provide a right to request assistance, although the other party might not comply with such requests where it is itself behind the cyberattacks.\n In this respect, the distinction between private and public adjudication should be taken into account in designing such dispute resolution institution. See, generally, Yarik Kryvoi, ‘Private or Public Adjudication? Procedure, Substance and Legitimacy’ (2021) 34(4) Leiden Journal of International Law 681–703.\n Generally, Scott J. Shackelford, ‘From Nuclear War to Net War: Analogizing Cyber Attacks in International Law’ (2009) 27(1) Berkeley Journal of International Law 192–251.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009374576.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nYARIK KRYVOI\nIt also restricts the ability of states to bring any such claims before international courts and tribunals. Instead, states opt for naming and shaming, and framing accusations. There are, however, efforts to include cyberattacks into major international criminal law treaties, most notably the Rome Statute. Talks on this topic at the UN level are currently ongoing.\nAs this chapter has demonstrated, states with similar political regimes tend to co-operate and conclude treaties dealing with cybersecurity (e.g. the Budapest Convention adopted by Western States and the SCO Agreement dominated by China and Russia). Different approaches to cybersecurity and the acceptable level of state interference in matters of cybersecurity also demonstrate the limits of truly global co-operation, as opposed to co-operation between allies. In the absence of specialised treaties of international tribunals dealing with cybersecurity threats, general provisions of public international law should apply.\nInternational courts and tribunals should have jurisdiction over cyberattacks, as such disputes involve states and are governed by public international law. Although a cyberattack-related case has not yet been brought, the ICJ might be a natural forum for such state-to-state claims. Investment tribunals have in the past condemned cyberattacks in their decisions and by excluding evidence obtained by hacking. However, a dedicated international dispute resolution forum with jurisdiction over cyberattack is missing. Although existing public international law should apply equally to public cyberattacks, the novelty of cyberspace creates areas of confusion. Going forward, the international community\n Martha Finnemore and Duncan B.

    "## 5.1 Introduction": "Although scholarship dealing with cybersecurity usually does not distinguish between private and public cyberattacks, this chapter demonstrates that this distinction is crucial to effectively respond to cyberattacks. A recent United Nations report suggested that international human rights law represents an important external reference point for criminalisation and procedural provisions related to cyberattacks.¹ However, this is not necessarily the case for public cyberattacks, which involve state–state relations.\nThis chapter argues that the determination of whether a particular cyberattack is of public or private nature (a cybercrime) should define how states respond to cybersecurity risks. Section 5.3 of this chapter demonstrates that non-state actors motivated by financial gain or ideology perpetrate private cyberattacks, which typically target non-state entities, rather than states (see Section 5.3.1). Such cyberattacks require primarily domestic law responses based on the principle of territoriality and alternative principles.\nStates act as the main perpetrators of public cyberattacks, usually motivated not by financial gain but by political and strategic objectives such as causing harm, interfering with internal political processes or gaining access to sensitive information (see Section 5.3.2). They can\n¹ United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, ‘Comprehensive Study on Cybercrime’ UN Publications, February 2013, available at: www.unodc.org/documents/organized-crime/UNODC_CCPCJ_EG.4_2013/CYBERCRIME_STUDY_210213.pdf (accessed 18 July 2022).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009374576.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nYARIK KRYVOI\nundermine critical infrastructure, national security, the democratic legitimacy of institutions, or political freedoms.\nSection 5.4 of this chapter shows that public cyberattacks require not only domestic law but also international law responses. If the state-sponsored nature of a cyberattack can be established with a degree of certainty, this should trigger the state's rights to self-defence and to respond with countermeasures to procure cessation and achieve reparation for the injury. The difficulty with collecting evidence related to cyberattacks, including on attribution of the conduct of private actors to state actors, has led to proposals to adopt due diligence or strict liability approaches to state responsibility (see Section 5.4.2).\nThe chapter concludes that the effective application of existing international law to public cyberattacks may require the reassessment of application of the concepts of self-defence and countermeasures in cyberspace. It highlights the limits of global treaty-making in the area of cybersecurity and calls for establishment of a dispute resolution body in charge of public cyberattacks, which could develop jurisprudence to assist in the application of existing norms to cyberspace and the development of new, cyberspace-specific, norms.",
    "## 5.2 Conceptual Framework": "Table 5.1 highlights the differences between private, hybrid, and public cyberattacks, discussed in more detail in subsequent sections. It shows that despite commonalities, public and private cyberattacks are governed by separate legal regimes, have different motivations, and vary in severity. Hybrid cyberattacks blur the distinction between the two – and while they appear as private attacks, they are in fact public. The rest of the chapter examines different aspects of the distinction between private and public cyberattacks and responses to them.",
    "## 5.3 The Nature and Legal Regimes of Private and Public Cyberattacks": "### 5.3.1 Private Cyberattacks\n#### 5.3.1.1 Nature of Private Cyberattacks\nCyberspace creates a fertile environment for criminal activities, as it allows perpetrators to pose security threats or engage in money laundering or data theft, or facilitate corruption across borders without leaving\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009374576.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTable 5.1 Key features of private and public cyberattacks\n|   | Private cyberattacks (cybercrimes) | Public cyberattacks  |   |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|   |   |  Hybrid cyberattacks | Direct cyberattacks  |\n|  Perpetrator | Non-state actors | Non-state and state actors | States  |\n|  Motivation | Usually, financially or ideologically motivated.

Private actors may engage in personal data leaks, economic crimes, terrorism, and sexual offences. With a few exceptions, normally such crimes do not rise to the level of posing a threat to national security since profit is the primary motivation of private cyberattacks.\nIt must be noted that the same cyberattacks can be perpetrated by either private or public actors. This includes hacking and illegal access, data or ID theft, cyber sabotage, spreading viruses, and distributing worms, spyware, and logic bombs. The United Nations Manual on Computer-related Crime includes fraud as well as forgery in its list of cybercrimes.⁷ What matters for the determination of public or private nature of cyberattacks is whether the ultimate perpetrator is a public or a private actor.\n² Ibid.\n³ See, for example, European Commission, ‘Reflection Paper on Harnessing Globalisation’ (2017) EU Publications 12–13, available at: https://commission.europa.eu/publications/reflection-paper-harnessing-globalisation_en (accessed 6 September 2022).\n⁴ Michael McGuire, ‘Nation States, Cyberconflict and the Web of Profit’ (2021) HP Development Company, available at: https://threatresearch.ext.hp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/hp-bps-web-of-profit-report_APR_2021.pdf (accessed 6 September 2022).\n⁵ Ibid., 20.\n⁶ Jonathan Berr, “WannaCry” Ransomware Attack Losses Could Reach $4 billion’ CBS News, 16 May 2017, available at: www.cbsnews.com/news/wannacry-ransomware-attacks-wannacry-virus-losses/ (accessed 6 September 2022).\n⁷ United Nations, United Nations Manual on the Prevention and Control of Computer-Related Crime (New York: United Nations, 1994), available at: www.unodc.org/pdf/Manual_ComputerRelatedCrime.PDF (accessed 6 September 2022).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009374576.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nRESPONDING TO PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CYBERATTACKS 107\nAn example of a private cyberattack is the 2013 attack on the US web services provider Yahoo, which led to the loss of one billion users' data.⁸ In another incident, hackers gained access to the personal data of 100 million users of a major Australian tech company.⁹ One can think of situations in which private cyberattacks may go beyond causing damage to particular organisations and individuals and pose a threat to critical infrastructure (e.g. hospitals, electricity, or military facilities). For example, the 2021 Colonial Pipeline Hack in the United States was carried out by a private group seeking ransom, who disabled thousands of miles of US energy infrastructure for nearly a week.¹⁰ A cyberattack against a US water treatment facility in Florida, which temporarily increased the levels of chemicals in drinking water, was also likely caused by a private hacker.¹¹\nTo sum up, non-state actors commit private cyberattacks, most of which aim at financial gain but can also be motivated by ideological reasons. Such cyberattacks usually do not raise to the level of causing national security threats, although the largest ones may do so.",

Its signatories also include states from outside of the Council of Europe such as the United States, Australia, Japan, and Nigeria but nonetheless, most of its signatories are Western states.¹⁴ This convention influenced similar approaches to regulating cybercrimes in state parties of the Convention.\nFor example, in the United Kingdom, legal guidance broadens the scope of existing crimes such as fraud or sexual offences to cyberspace.¹⁵ The UK Computer Misuse Act 1990 relates to offences or attacks directly against computer systems and has been amended multiple times since its passing.¹⁶ English courts take jurisdiction where such crimes substantially relate to English laws or interests.¹⁷ Similarly, Germany, which adopted the IT Security Act of 2015, broadened the scope of existing offences to cyberspace and added many cybercrimes such as hacking and identity theft into its Criminal Code.¹⁸ The United States has no dedicated cybercrime legislation and instead amends existing statutes to apply to cyberspace.¹⁹\nAs explained in more detail in Chapter 4 of this book, Russia has been critical of the Budapest Convention, arguing that it endangers national sovereignty, particularly on the provisions dealing with transborder\n¹³ McConnell International, ‘Cyber Crime . . . and Punishment?

The SCO Agreement does not attempt to harmonise domestic legislation but instead focuses on co-operation between states, information exchange, and joint cybersecurity threat evaluation.\n²⁰ T.

In contrast to the United States legal system which applies existing criminal offences to cyberspace, the Vietnam law also defines specific cybercrimes, such as obstructing cyberspace or attempting to or successfully attacking or neutralising cybersecurity defence measures.\nThis review suggests that regulation on the international level remains scarce and domestic legislation, the primary instrument which applies to private cyberattacks, significantly varies from one jurisdiction to another. The contrasts between the above-discussed Vietnamese and US cybersecurity regimes underscore the need for cross-jurisdictional co-operation and harmonisation, as cybercrimes are often international in nature.\nInternational agreements, such as the 2001 Budapest Convention, clearly target private cyberthreats and aim primarily at co-ordinating the efforts of states and ironing out differences in domestic law. The convention's preamble refers to the need to secure a balance between the interests of law enforcement and respect for fundamental rights, protection of personal data, and co-operation in the penal field. However, most international law instruments remain silent on harmonisation and the need to protect fundamental rights in response to private cyberthreats.",
    "## 5.3.2 Public Cyberattacks": "### 5.3.2.1 Nature of Public Cyberattacks\nA recent study identified over 200 cybersecurity incidents connected to nation-states over the last eleven years. States are increasing their spending on cybersecurity. For example, the United States in 2021 increased it by 14 per cent. China adopted a programme to grow its cybersecurity\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009374576.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nRESPONDING TO PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CYBERATTACKS 111\nindustry by 15 per cent annually in 2021–2023.²⁹ Russia plans to increase spending on cybersecurity in 2022 and 2023 by 800 per cent in a dedicated federal project on information cybersecurity.³⁰ This demonstrates an increased strategic interest in cybersecurity and significant funds invested in the capacity to launch new kinds of cyberattacks.\nState actors perpetrate public cyberattacks either directly or through affiliated private entities. Such cyberattacks may involve undermining political institutions and media, interfering with critical financial or military infrastructure, or merely stealing personal data. Although less frequent than private cyberattacks, the sophistication of public cyber-threats and the political sensitivity of such cases make responding to them difficult. Moreover, cyberattacks emanating from state actors usually pose a greater threat to national security.\nStates seldom openly engage in cyberattacks through official government entities and avoid admitting to such conduct. Consequently, the distinction between private and public cyberattacks is not always clear-cut, as hybrid cyberattacks involving co-operation between state and private actors become increasingly frequent. Many states increasingly deploy the tools and techniques used by private actors, and some recruit them to act as proxies in their interest.\nFor example, several recent attacks of which Russia is accused could be regarded as hybrid cyberattacks. For example, in May 2021 Russian-based hackers, with suspected links to the state, attacked over 150 different government agencies and human rights groups in the United States and other countries.³¹ In June 2021, Russian hackers (meaning Russian nationals) conducted ransomware attacks against one of the largest American meat processors.

For example, in 2014, North Korea was blamed for an attack on Sony following the release of the film The Interview.³⁵ In 2007, Estonia, one of Europe's smaller states, faced an attack by bots originating from almost 180 different countries, which was widely believed to be orchestrated by Russia. Russia also launched a cyberattack on Georgia in 2008,³⁶ which supplemented the conventional phase of Russia–Georgia war. Geopolitically motivated cybersecurity threats can also target elections, such as Russian interference in the 2016 US election.³⁷\nState actors may also be involved in cyberattacks for financial gain.

Essentially, they are public cyberattacks and the difficulty lies in attribution. Attribution of cyberattacks to a state presents complex factual and legal questions, which eventually determine whether such an attack can be regarded as private or public. This chapter deals primarily with issues of legal attribution, which is different from technical attribution (a factual and technical investigation) and political attribution (a policy decision attributing an attack to an actor without necessarily attaching legal consequences such as countermeasures).\nIn accordance with the International Law Commission (ILC) Articles on State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts,⁴¹ cyberattacks can be attributed to a state if they were conducted by organs of a state⁴² or if the conduct was directed or controlled by a state.⁴³ If the state-sponsored nature of the attack can be established with certainty, this may\n³⁸ Katrina Manson, Helen Warrell, and Hannah Murphy, ‘North Koreans Charged in $1.3bn Cyber-Hack Spree’ Financial Times, 18 February 2021, available at: www.ft.com/content/3556c699-8bff-4837-abb1-1ef70d2094d4 (accessed 6 September 2022).\n³⁹ See, for example, Center for Strategic and International Studies, ‘Significant Cyber Incidents’ Center for Strategic and International Studies, available at: www.csis.org/programs/strategic-technologies-program/significant-cyber-incidents (accessed 6 September 2022).\n⁴⁰ Hanna Murphy, ‘Russia-Linked Hackers Target IT Supply Chain with Ransomware’ Financial Times, 4 July 2021, available at: www.ft.com/content/a8e7c9a2-5819-424f-b087-c6f2e8f0c7a1 (accessed 6 September 2022).\n⁴¹ International Law Commission, ‘Commentaries to Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts’, UN GAOR 56th Session, Supp. No. 10, at 43, UN Doc.

Subsequently, the ICJ has rejected the use of the ‘overall control’ test.⁵² Regardless of whether the ‘overall control’ of the ‘effective control’ test applies, the attribution threshold is high and mere state funding or equipping groups will not result in attribution.⁵³\nBecause of difficulties with finding evidence, currently attribution of cyberattacks remains largely political rather than legal. A good example is the already-mentioned US attribution of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. The Obama administration quickly attributed it to Russia,⁵⁴ but a thorough report prepared by the Select Committee on Intelligence on the Russian cyber intrusions came out only in 2020.⁵⁵\nTo sum up, state actors perpetrate public cyberattacks either directly or through affiliated private entities. Most of such attacks are clearly politically motivated. The real difficulty with distinguishing private and public cyberattacks, and their attribution is the scarcity of evidence. Attribution becomes even more complicated if a state entity stands behind attacks seemingly conducted by private entities acting alone and of their own volition.",

Russia has been accused of such tactics by granting refuge to convicted foreign ransomware hackers.⁵⁶ The UK National Cyber Security Centre, FBI, and the US Department of Homeland Security called on Russia to cease such activities.⁵⁷ International law does not give a simple answer to whether harbouring individual criminals guilty of cyberattacks attributes that conduct to the state and the scope of the obligation of states under international law to prevent activities of non-state actors breaching the rights of third states.⁵⁸\nThe ILC has suggested that the Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities could apply to cyberattacks, even though this instrument does not explicitly mention cyberattacks.⁵⁹ It applies to activities not prohibited by international law but ones causing transboundary harm⁶⁰ and provides that the state of origin of the harm ‘shall take all appropriate measures to prevent significant transboundary harm or at any event to minimize the risk thereof’.⁶¹ This is known as the obligation of due diligence, regarded as a general principle of international law.⁶² The ICJ in the Corfu Channel case stated: ‘it is every State’s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States’.⁶³\n⁵⁶ See, for example, Department of Justice, ‘Canadian Hacker Who Conspired With and Aided Russian FSB Officers Pleads Guilty’ Department of Justice, 28 November 2017, available at: www.justice.gov/opa/pr/canadian-hacker-who-conspired-and-aided-russian-fsb-officers-pleads-guilty (accessed 18 July 2022); Tim Maurer, ‘Why the Russian Government Turns a Blind Eye to Cybercriminals’ Slate, 2 February 2018, available at: https://slate.com/technology/2018/02/why-the-russian-government-turns-a-blind-eye-to-cybercriminals.html (accessed 18 July 2022).\n⁵⁷ NCSC, ‘Russian State-Sponsored Cyber Actors Targeting Network Infrastructure Devices’ NCSC, 15 April 2018, available at: www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/russian-state-sponsored-cyber-actors-targeting-network-infrastructure-devices (accessed 18 July 2022).\n⁵⁸ Ibid.\n⁵⁹ International Law Commission, ‘Commentaries on Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities’ (2001) 2(2) Yearbook of the International Law Commission 148.\n⁶⁰ Ibid., Article 1.\n⁶¹ Ibid., Article 3.\n⁶² Luke Chircop, ‘A Due Diligence Standard of Attribution in Cyberspace’ (2018) 67 International &amp; Comparative Law Quarterly 643–668 at 649–650; see also Scott J.

The greater the risk, the stronger the obligation for the state to act.⁶⁶\nThe above requirements for due diligence should flexibly consider the technical capacity of the state to engage in due diligence.⁶⁷ Cyberattacks seldom fit with the territorial logic – the criminals might be in one state but remotely conduct their activities through third countries.\nIt also raises the issue of attribution within the meaning of Article 4 (conducted by organs of a state) and Article 8 (conduct was directed or controlled by a state) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts. Following the logic of due diligence, if a state fails to exercise due diligence to prevent transboundary harms’ situation, that would also amount to ‘public cyberattacks’ that trigger state countermeasures as discussed in more detail in Section 5.3.1.\nRegardless of whether the cyberattacks are private or public, states need to be prepared to deal with them proactively, including before admitting investments through foreign direct investment review mechanisms,⁶⁸ by regulating already admitted investments, or by responding to national security breaches as they occur.",

In fact, cyberattacks are often understood as versions of existing crimes such as fraud or damage to property, committed through or facilitated using cyberspace. For this reason, the primary response to private cyberattacks is traditional criminal proceedings in domestic courts.",
    "## 5.4.1.1 Countermeasures against Private Cyberattacks": "States can take countermeasures against private threats in accordance with domestic law. One example is the response to the 2021 ransomware hacking of a US pipeline (Colonial Pipeline Attack).⁶⁹ That private cyberattack on critical domestic infrastructure was launched not for politically motivated offensive or strategic reasons but for pure financial gain. Attackers hacked the pipeline network and demanded ransom to unlock the pipeline. The response was a typical law enforcement activity. The US Department of Justice, using traditional law enforcement agencies (albeit with new, unprecedented integration of cyberspace strategies), seized the bitcoins used to pay the hackers' ransom. Host states may confiscate assets that they see as tools of cyberattacks or expropriate businesses, which pose cyberthreats to the host state. This is in effect no different from police seizing stolen money or assets from thieves or ransom-demanders.\nSimilarly, the group responsible for the Colonial Pipeline Attack had their accounts frozen and stolen bitcoins (used by Colonial to pay their ransom) forcibly recovered by the US Department of Justice.⁷⁰ These examples demonstrate the extension of traditional law enforcement jurisdiction and strategies to cyberspace, even when that 'space' is beyond the traditional physical jurisdiction of the state.",
    "## 5.4.1.2 Jurisdiction over Private Cyberattacks": "5.4.1.2.1 The Territoriality Approach Since private cyberattacks are governed by domestic law like any other crime, territoriality is the cornerstone jurisdictional principle.

This principle has been enshrined in virtually all domestic criminal laws for centuries.71 It should follow from the territorial jurisdiction principle that if the act occurred, wholly or in part, in the physical territory of the state, it has authority to prosecute and adjudicate such acts. For example, the US government has claimed jurisdiction to prosecute state-sponsored cyberattacks in domestic courts, leading to several indictments.72\nThe application of the territoriality principle may be challenging in the context of cyberattacks, which are usually not physically grounded in one jurisdiction, can affect multiple states, be committed entirely remotely, and routed through several jurisdictions.73 Three challenges complicate asserting jurisdiction over cyberattacks: (a) the international dispersal of illegal activities; (b) jurisdiction may be impossible to assert because conduct may be legal in one jurisdiction but illegal in another, hindering prosecution; and (c) jurisdiction to prosecute may be claimed by several states simultaneously, causing problems with establishing priority between them.74\nFurther, different jurisdictional considerations apply to local cyberattacks and transnational cyberattacks. The former conforms to the traditional model of a crime.75 The latter might pose jurisdictional issues because of its detachment from state territory. However, states can still apply the principle of territoriality and assert jurisdiction over crimes where all or part of the cyberattack occurred in their territory (a ‘substantial effect’ doctrine).76\n71 Cedric Ryngaert, ‘Territorial Jurisdiction over Cross-Frontier Offences: Revisiting a Classic Problem of International Criminal Law’ (2009) 9(1) International Criminal Law Review 187–209 at 187; Manley O.

Instead of searching for the location of the criminal act, states could instead consider the location of the computers themselves. Singapore claims jurisdiction over cyberattacks ‘if, for the offence in question . . . the computer, program or data was in Singapore at the material time’.⁸² Some US states, such as Connecticut, have statutes that confer jurisdiction in cybercrime cases on the fact that some part of the conduct constituting a cybercrime offence impacts a computer located in that state.⁸³ Finally, states always retain jurisdiction over satellites launched from their territory. Since internet access is becoming increasingly dependent on satellites, this jurisdictional link might prove more useful.⁸⁴\nHowever, as this review suggests, the traditional territoriality approach has significant limitations if applied in the context of cyberattacks.\n5.4.1.2.2 Alternatives to the Territoriality Approach Asserting jurisdiction on the basis of the territory principle is particularly ineffective in\n⁷⁷ Article 22 of the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, 23 November 2001, in force 1 July 2004, ETS No. 185 (Budapest Convention).\n⁷⁸ Ibid., Article 22(5).\n⁷⁹ Article 15 of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, 15 November 2000, in force 29 September 2003, UN Doc.

The Budapest Convention requires parties to establish jurisdiction ‘when the offence is committed (...) by one of its nationals, if the offence is punishable under criminal law where it was committed or if the offence is committed outside the territorial jurisdiction of any State’.⁸⁷ Several domestic criminal legal systems contain equivalent provisions.⁸⁸\nFor cyberattacks with the most serious consequences, such as cyberterrorism, some suggest universal jurisdiction could be attached.⁸⁹ Others suggest that violations of human rights or crimes against humanity should also be covered by universal jurisdiction.⁹⁰\nJurisdiction based on the nationality of the target of the cyberattack is another approach adopted in domestic systems. For example, Germany has a very general jurisdiction provision based on the nationality of the victim: if an attack is committed against a German national regardless of whether the crime is punishable in the country where it was committed.⁹¹ Similarly, in Belgium, a crime against a Belgian national falls under the jurisdiction if the act is punishable in the country where it was committed.⁹² In the United States, the basic federal cybercrime provision confers jurisdiction to prosecute when the conduct at issue impacts the federal government, that is, where the United States is itself the victim.⁹³\nFinally, the protective principle allows states to assert jurisdiction where national security is threatened.⁹⁴ The US basic federal computer\n⁸⁵ Jean-Baptiste Maillart, ‘The Limits of Subjective Territorial Jurisdiction in the Context of Cybercrime’ (2018) 19(3) ERA Forum 375–390 at 375.\n⁸⁶ Brenner, ‘Cybercrime Jurisdiction’, 200–206.\n⁸⁷ Article 22(1)(d) of the Budapest Convention.\n⁸⁸ See, for example, Australian Criminal Code Act of 1995 §476.3; StGB.Strafgesetzbuch (German Criminal Code) §7 Nr.

Different domestic legal systems follow other approaches, such as focusing on the nationality of the victim or the location of computers used in cyberattacks. More judicial practice could help adopt more cohesive and predictable approaches to jurisdiction over geographically dispersed cyberattacks. Approaches to conflict of laws issues vary widely between states, which requires not only judicial practice but also efforts to harmonise and codify jurisdictional rules on private cyberattacks.",
    "## 5.4.2 Public Cyberattacks": "### 5.4.2.1 Countermeasures against Public Cyberattacks\nResponses to public cyberattacks are very different from private cyberattacks. States may bring cases before domestic courts, explained in the previous section, but this has limited effectiveness vis-à-vis states, the ultimate perpetrators, due to sovereign immunity. In practice, because of the limited jurisdictional reach against state perpetrators, the target state has to respond to private individuals involved in cyberattacks as if these were private cyberattacks. For example, in 2018, a federal grand jury in the District of Columbia charged thirteen Russian nationals and three Russian entities with violating US criminal laws in order to interfere with US elections and political processes.⁹⁷\nStates can also respond to public cyberattacks in accordance with public international law. The UN Charter guarantees the right of states to self-defence against an armed attack.⁹⁸ The Nicaragua case highlighted that for self-defence to be triggered, a state usually has to face physical\n⁹⁵ 18 US Code § 1030.\n⁹⁶ 18 US Code § 1030(e)(2)(B).\n⁹⁷ Special Counsel Robert S.

The judgment does, however, suggest that economic harm (e.g. tariffs and embargoes) may suffice as well if it is particularly serious. It usually takes time to gather and analyse facts related to cyberattacks, which often involve multiple jurisdictions. Therefore, some question whether self-defence can be available as a lawful response to the attack, which may essentially mean that states are effectively precluded from any lawful response, including self-defence, which in turn creates incentives to engage in covert retaliatory cyber operations.¹⁰⁰\nAs a matter of public international law, state responses should evolve using analogies for countering physical force. States may take non-forcible countermeasures against another state to procure cessation and achieve reparation for the injury.¹⁰¹ Countermeasures also have a prerequisite of proportionality and necessity.¹⁰² The state relying on them must also request reparation from the perpetrator and its intention to exercise countermeasures.¹⁰³ The ILC notes that countermeasures which are reciprocal to the harm are more likely to satisfy proportionality and necessity.¹⁰⁴\nOne example of such countermeasures is the US response to Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. The US response resulted in not only domestic indictments and prosecutions but comprehensive sanctions on the Russian economy and specific Russian nationals involved in the hybrid attacks and disinformation campaign.¹⁰⁵ State responses must be proportionate and, even in cases of less severe\n⁹⁹ Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

The argument is that states are obliged under customary and treaty law to prevent the activities of non-state actors from breaching the rights of third states, taking all reasonable means available to them on their territory and even in certain circumstances, extraterritorially.¹⁰⁸\nThe difficulty with applying traditional public international law is that countermeasures must be directed against the responsible state only,¹⁰⁹ which triggers questions about the determination of the identity of the offenders. The transnational character of offences complicates attributing cyber offences to a specific state. This is particularly the case when the state is hiding behind private actors based in multiple jurisdictions. The existing international law of state responsibility also fails to address the situations in which states systematically direct and support non-state actors based in multiple jurisdictions without putting that actor under its formal leadership or chain of command.¹¹⁰ Such situations may trigger the need for states to establish due diligence mechanisms to tackle unlawful non-state actors in their territory, including those which cause harm to other states.¹¹¹\nAmerica's Adversaries through Sanctions Act of 2017 (H.R.3364), available at: www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/3364/text (accessed 18 July 2022).\n¹⁰⁶ Generally, Anders Henriksen, 'Lawful State Responses to Low-Level Cyber-Attacks: Current Development' (2015) 84(2) Nordic Journal of International Law 323–351.\n¹⁰⁷ Ibid.\n¹⁰⁸ Generally, Susan Brenner, 'At Light Speed: Attribution and Response to Cybercrime/Terrorism/Warfare' (2007) 97(2) Journal of Criminal Law &amp; Criminology 379–476.\n¹⁰⁹ Ibid.\n¹¹⁰ Ibid.\n¹¹¹ It must be noted that even states which follow similar approaches to cybersecurity have different views about whether cybersecurity due diligence is mandatory as a matter of international law.

Espionage, for example,¹¹² although considered an unfriendly act, is not unlawful under international law.¹¹³ Following this logic, cyberespionage is also not unlawful under international law. Cyberattacks usually aim at procurement of information or surveillance and seldom cause physical damage. For this reason, it is difficult to distinguish between lawful cyberespionage and an unlawful cyberattack in the absence of conventional force.\nExamples of countermeasures following a state-on-state cyberattack are sparse, but retaliatory threats are not unusual.¹¹⁴ Recently, NATO leaders reaffirmed that a cyberattack against one of its members can trigger Article 5 of the NATO Convention and constitute an attack on all. Further, they reaffirm that countermeasures to a cyberattack need not be limited to cyberspace.¹¹⁵ Following the 2014 Sony Hack, North Korea reportedly had its internet infrastructure disabled and lost access to the Internet for some time. This occurred hours after President Obama publicly announced a ‘proportional response’ to the hack on Sony.¹¹⁶\nThe International Strategy for Cyber Space adopted by President Barack Obama proclaimed that the United States ‘will respond to hostile acts in cyberspace as we would to any other threat to our country’.

The back-and-forth between Iran and the United States and its allies over the Iranian nuclear enrichment programme underscores the need for a comprehensive re-evaluation of public international law on cyberattacks to prevent a cycle of unchecked aggression and escalation.\nIn a sense, countermeasures against public cyberattacks is still a very much uncharted territory, which lacks enough state practice. There is little doubt, however, that general public international law and attribution should apply in this context and account for the transborder and dispersed nature of cyberattacks.",
    "## 5.4.2.2 State Responsibility Based on Due Diligence and Strict Liability": "The difficulty with collecting evidence related to cyberattacks, including on attribution of the conduct of private actors to states to state actors, has led to proposals to adopt due diligence or strict liability approaches to state responsibility.¹²⁷ Arguably, a strict liability model also encourages state co-operation by creating potential liability for reparations.\nIn the Corfu Channel case, the International Court of Justice highlighted the generally recognised principle of international law binding upon states ‘not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States’.¹²⁸ In other words, the state needs\n¹²⁴ Ronen Bergman, Rick Gladstone, and Farnaz Fassihi, ‘Blackout Hits Iran Nuclear Site in What Appears to Be Israeli Sabotage’ *New York Times*, 11 April 2021, available at: www.nytimes.com/2021/04/11/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-natanz.html (accessed 18 July 2022).\n¹²⁵ Patrick Wintour, ‘Iran to Boost Uranium Enrichment Levels in Wake of Israeli Attack’ *The Guardian*, 13 April 2021, available at: www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/13/natanz-nuclear-site-attack-iran-accuses-israel-of-bad-gamble (accessed 18 July 2022).\n¹²⁶ Sina Azodi and Mohsen Solhdoost, ‘An Escalating Israel-Iran Conflict Could Sink the JCPOA’ *Atlantic Council*, 1 September 2021, available at: www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/iransource/an-escalating-israel-iran-conflict-could-sink-the-jcpoa (accessed 18 July 2022).\n¹²⁷ Generally, James P.

The report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security also states that ‘States should not knowingly allow their territory to be used for internationally wrongful acts using ICTs’.¹²⁹\nAccording to Japan, the due diligence obligation may serve as a ground for the responsibility of the state from the territory of which a cyber operation not attributable to any state was conducted.¹³⁰ The Tallinn Manual 2.0 seems to contemplate a rule of cyber due diligence: ‘A State must exercise due diligence in not allowing its territory, or territory or cyber infrastructure under its governmental control, to be used for cyber operations that affect the rights of, and produce serious adverse consequences for, other States.’¹³¹ That prompted some states to view the due diligence obligation primarily as a duty to prevent rather than to prosecute.¹³²\nA number of states, including Germany,¹³³ France,¹³⁴ Japan,¹³⁵ and Australia,¹³⁶ argued for the application of this principle in cyberspace.\n¹²⁹ UN General Assembly, ‘Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security’ Note by the Secretary-General, 22 July 2015, UN Doc.

Israel sees the difficulty with the inherently different features of cyberspace – its decentralisation and private characteristics.¹³⁹\nIn other words, although many states advocate for the cybersecurity due diligence obligation, currently it has not yet crystallised into a specific obligation. Asking states to commit to concluding a treaty containing such obligations may prove to be a difficult task as the fragmented regime, in which many states will decide not to commit to this obligation, may penalise the states willing to commit to the due diligence obligation. However, there is little doubt that a due diligence approach offers a more effective way to create incentives for states to combat cyberattacks compared to traditional norms of state responsibility.",
    "## 5.4.2.3 Jurisdiction over Public Cyberattacks": "The fundamental concept of territoriality applicable in international dispute resolution stems from sovereignty¹⁴⁰ and should also inform jurisdictional decisions of international courts and tribunals resolving state-to-state disputes. Sovereignty also confers responsibilities, which arguably include the responsibility to protect third states against cyberattacks that would violate international law.¹⁴¹ Territoriality might assist in determining whether a state is in breach of its cybersecurity due diligence obligations vis-à-vis another state.\n¹³⁷ UN General Assembly, ‘Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions on the Subject of How International Law Applies to the Use of Information and Communications Technologies by States Submitted by Participating Governmental Experts in the Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security Established Pursuant to General Assembly Resolution 73/266’, 13 July 2021, UN Doc.

It also does not answer whether one state's failure to exercise its due diligence gives the victim state a right to exercise jurisdiction over a cyberattack committed abroad. Taking anti-cyberattack action by targeting servers abroad might violate other states' sovereignty. State consent is therefore essential to the extraterritorial exercise of jurisdiction.¹⁴³ States seem reluctant to prosecute or investigate another state for cybersecurity allegations. The notable exception is the United States, which has commenced domestic proceedings against North Korea that resulted in an indictment.¹⁴⁴\nPublic cyberattacks orchestrated by states should be dealt by the norms of international public law, as any other state-to-state dispute. 'The Oxford Statement on International Law Protections in Cyberspace', prepared by academics, argues that existing international law concepts should be equally applied to cyberspace.¹⁴⁵ At the moment, specific international law rules dealing with public cyberattacks are almost nonexistent, as are specialised dispute resolution bodies. International courts and tribunals, rather than domestic courts, should have jurisdiction over interstate disputes. Following this logic, state-to-state cyberdisputes should be resolved in the same manner as other state-to-state disputes with institutions such as the ICJ and the Permanent Court of Arbitration playing a leading role.\n¹⁴² Ian Yuying Liu, 'State Responsibility and Cyberattacks: Defining Due Diligence Obligations' (2017) 4 Indonesian Journal of International and Comparative Law 191–260 at 257–258.\n¹⁴³ Harriet Moynihan, 'The Application of International Law to State Cyberattacks Sovereignty and Non-Intervention' Chatham House, December 2019, available at: www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/publications/research/2019-11-29-Intl-Law-Cyberattacks.pdf (accessed 18 July 2022).\n¹⁴⁴ United States of America v.

Traditional dispute resolution bodies may also find it difficult to deal with highly technical issues related to attribution and collection of evidence in cyberspace. That undermines the ability of the international community to effectively prevent and respond to cyberattacks. Therefore, the idea of creating a forum to resolve disputes related to cyberattacks, taking into account their public nature, should be seriously considered by states.¹⁴⁶",
    "## 5.5 Conclusion": "The task of conceptualising cyberattacks as public or private is challenging, as it requires evidence-based determinations and making judgements related to the possible involvement of state actors. However, the difference between public and private cyberattacks is crucial as it subjects the attack to different legal regimes. States resort to domestic law solutions to deal with private cyberattacks, including measures allowed under domestic law to deal with criminal activities. In this context, international treaties play a limited role, potentially facilitating co-operation between law enforcement agencies.\nAs states dramatically increase their cybersecurity, public cyberattacks present a particular systemic and existential threat, disrupting multiple organisations and critical infrastructure. The analysis above suggests that the effective application of existing international law to public cyberattacks may require the reassessment of application of the concepts of self-defence and countermeasures in cyberspace. Further development of state practice and *opinio iuris* will help shape uniform approaches and crystallisation of principles of international law.\nThe encouragement of co-operation is the most common norm related to cybersecurity in international treaties. Mutual legal assistance treaties provide a right to request assistance, although the other party might not comply with such requests where it is itself behind the cyberattacks.¹⁴⁷\n¹⁴⁶ In this respect, the distinction between private and public adjudication should be taken into account in designing such dispute resolution institution. See, generally, Yarik Kryvoi, ‘Private or Public Adjudication? Procedure, Substance and Legitimacy’ (2021) 34(4) Leiden Journal of International Law 681–703.\n¹⁴⁷ Generally, Scott J. Shackelford, ‘From Nuclear War to Net War: Analogizing Cyber Attacks in International Law’ (2009) 27(1) Berkeley Journal of International Law 192–251.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009374576.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nYARIK KRYVOI\nIt also restricts the ability of states to bring any such claims before international courts and tribunals. Instead, states opt for naming and shaming, and framing accusations.¹⁴⁸ There are, however, efforts to include cyberattacks into major international criminal law treaties, most notably the Rome Statute.¹⁴⁹ Talks on this topic at the UN level are currently ongoing.¹⁵⁰\nAs this chapter has demonstrated, states with similar political regimes tend to co-operate and conclude treaties dealing with cybersecurity (e.g. the Budapest Convention adopted by Western States and the SCO Agreement dominated by China and Russia). Different approaches to cybersecurity and the acceptable level of state interference in matters of cybersecurity also demonstrate the limits of truly global co-operation, as opposed to co-operation between allies. In the absence of specialised treaties of international tribunals dealing with cybersecurity threats, general provisions of public international law should apply.\nInternational courts and tribunals should have jurisdiction over cyberattacks, as such disputes involve states and are governed by public international law. Although a cyberattack-related case has not yet been brought, the ICJ might be a natural forum for such state-to-state claims. Investment tribunals have in the past condemned cyberattacks in their decisions and by excluding evidence obtained by hacking.¹⁵¹ However, a dedicated international dispute resolution forum with jurisdiction over cyberattack is missing.¹⁵² Although existing public international law should apply equally to public cyberattacks, the novelty of cyberspace creates areas of confusion. Going forward, the international community\n¹⁴⁸ Martha Finnemore and Duncan B.

A recent United Nations report suggested that international human rights law represents an important external reference point for criminalisation and procedural provisions related to cyberattacks. However, this is not necessarily the case for public cyberattacks, which involve state–state relations.\nThis chapter argues that the determination of whether a particular cyberattack is of public or private nature (a cybercrime) should define how states respond to cybersecurity risks. Section 5.3 of this chapter demonstrates that non-state actors motivated by financial gain or ideology perpetrate private cyberattacks, which typically target non-state entities, rather than states (see Section 5.3.1). Such cyberattacks require primarily domestic law responses based on the principle of territoriality and alternative principles.\nStates act as the main perpetrators of public cyberattacks, usually motivated not by financial gain but by political and strategic objectives such as causing harm, interfering with internal political processes or gaining access to sensitive information (see Section 5.3.2). They can\n United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, ‘Comprehensive Study on Cybercrime’ UN Publications, February 2013, available at: www.unodc.org/documents/organized-crime/UNODC_CCPCJ_EG.4_2013/CYBERCRIME_STUDY_210213.pdf (accessed 18 July 2022).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009374576.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nYARIK KRYVOI\nundermine critical infrastructure, national security, the democratic legitimacy of institutions, or political freedoms.\nSection 5.4 of this chapter shows that public cyberattacks require not only domestic law but also international law responses. If the state-sponsored nature of a cyberattack can be established with a degree of certainty, this should trigger the state's rights to self-defence and to respond with countermeasures to procure cessation and achieve reparation for the injury. The difficulty with collecting evidence related to cyberattacks, including on attribution of the conduct of private actors to state actors, has led to proposals to adopt due diligence or strict liability approaches to state responsibility (see Section 5.4.2).\nThe chapter concludes that the effective application of existing international law to public cyberattacks may require the reassessment of application of the concepts of self-defence and countermeasures in cyberspace. It highlights the limits of global treaty-making in the area of cybersecurity and calls for establishment of a dispute resolution body in charge of public cyberattacks, which could develop jurisprudence to assist in the application of existing norms to cyberspace and the development of new, cyberspace-specific, norms.\n## 5.2 Conceptual Framework\nTable 5.1 highlights the differences between private, hybrid, and public cyberattacks, discussed in more detail in subsequent sections. It shows that despite commonalities, public and private cyberattacks are governed by separate legal regimes, have different motivations, and vary in severity. Hybrid cyberattacks blur the distinction between the two – and while they appear as private attacks, they are in fact public. The rest of the chapter examines different aspects of the distinction between private and public cyberattacks and responses to them.\n## 5.3 The Nature and Legal Regimes of Private and Public Cyberattacks\n### 5.3.1 Private Cyberattacks\n#### 5.3.1.1 Nature of Private Cyberattacks\nCyberspace creates a fertile environment for criminal activities, as it allows perpetrators to pose security threats or engage in money laundering or data theft, or facilitate corruption across borders without leaving\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009374576.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTable 5.1 Key features of private and public cyberattacks\n|   | Private cyberattacks (cybercrimes) | Public cyberattacks  |   |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|   |   |  Hybrid cyberattacks | Direct cyberattacks  |\n|  Perpetrator | Non-state actors | Non-state and state actors | States  |\n|  Motivation | Usually, financially or ideologically motivated. Private cyberattacks often have an ulterior motive (obtain profit, strike fear or send a message), rather than merely cause damage for other reasons | A mix of financial, ideological, political motivation, and possibility of for-profit motivations | Mainly politically motivated, to cause damage or gain access to sensitive information  |\n|  Targets and severity of impact | Varies from small to large targets but usually targets other non-state entities, rather than states with varying severity of impact | Varies from small targets to large targets with severe impact | Highly severe. Public cyberattacks most often target other states but may also be aimed at non-state actors. They can undermine critical infrastructure, national security, democratic legitimacy and institutions, or political freedoms  |\n|  Dominant applicable law | Domestic law | Domestic and international law | International law  |\n|  Typical forms | • Ransomware attacks • Personal data leaks • Cyberterrorism • Malware hacking • Online child sexual exploitation • Cyber-enabled crimes | Can take the forms of private and public cyberattacks | • Election hacking • Cyberattacks on state digital infrastructure • Cyberattacks on foreign military targets • Cyberespionage  |\n|  Responses | In accordance with domestic laws: • Domestic administrative and criminal law countermeasures | In accordance with domestic and public international law, including: • Self-defence • Proportionate and necessary countermeasures • Domestic proceedings  |   |\nYARIK KRYVOI\ntheir homes. Criminals, extremists, and terrorists can exploit such new technologies, which allow them to pursue illicit activities or spread radical ideologies internationally from safe havens, thus circumventing traditional domestic legal systems and law enforcement measures.\nSome even labelled the cybercrime economy as the ‘Web of Profit’, with a variety of criminal activities, generating revenues from illicit online markets, IP and trade secret theft, and data crimeware and ransomware. According to some estimates, cybercrime revenues annually reach around US$1.5 trillion. Cyberattacks can also cause significant disruption and lead to very high costs – for example, some estimates suggest that potential cost of the 2017 WannaCry attack was US$4 billion.\nPrivate cyberattacks emanate from private individuals or groups usually motivated by gaining profit (e.g. ransom attacks) or ideological reasons (e.g. propaganda of terrorism). Private actors may engage in personal data leaks, economic crimes, terrorism, and sexual offences. With a few exceptions, normally such crimes do not rise to the level of posing a threat to national security since profit is the primary motivation of private cyberattacks.\nIt must be noted that the same cyberattacks can be perpetrated by either private or public actors. This includes hacking and illegal access, data or ID theft, cyber sabotage, spreading viruses, and distributing worms, spyware, and logic bombs. The United Nations Manual on Computer-related Crime includes fraud as well as forgery in its list of cybercrimes. What matters for the determination of public or private nature of cyberattacks is whether the ultimate perpetrator is a public or a private actor.\n Ibid.\n See, for example, European Commission, ‘Reflection Paper on Harnessing Globalisation’ (2017) EU Publications 12–13, available at: https://commission.europa.eu/publications/reflection-paper-harnessing-globalisation_en (accessed 6 September 2022).\n Michael McGuire, ‘Nation States, Cyberconflict and the Web of Profit’ (2021) HP Development Company, available at: https://threatresearch.ext.hp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/hp-bps-web-of-profit-report_APR_2021.pdf (accessed 6 September 2022).\n Ibid., 20.\n Jonathan Berr, “WannaCry” Ransomware Attack Losses Could Reach $4 billion’ CBS News, 16 May 2017, available at: www.cbsnews.com/news/wannacry-ransomware-attacks-wannacry-virus-losses/ (accessed 6 September 2022).\n United Nations, United Nations Manual on the Prevention and Control of Computer-Related Crime (New York: United Nations, 1994), available at: www.unodc.org/pdf/Manual_ComputerRelatedCrime.PDF (accessed 6 September 2022).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009374576.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nRESPONDING TO PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CYBERATTACKS 107\nAn example of a private cyberattack is the 2013 attack on the US web services provider Yahoo, which led to the loss of one billion users' data. In another incident, hackers gained access to the personal data of 100 million users of a major Australian tech company. One can think of situations in which private cyberattacks may go beyond causing damage to particular organisations and individuals and pose a threat to critical infrastructure (e.g. hospitals, electricity, or military facilities). For example, the 2021 Colonial Pipeline Hack in the United States was carried out by a private group seeking ransom, who disabled thousands of miles of US energy infrastructure for nearly a week. A cyberattack against a US water treatment facility in Florida, which temporarily increased the levels of chemicals in drinking water, was also likely caused by a private hacker.\nTo sum up, non-state actors commit private cyberattacks, most of which aim at financial gain but can also be motivated by ideological reasons. Such cyberattacks usually do not raise to the level of causing national security threats, although the largest ones may do so.\n## 5.3.1.2 Legal Norms to Tackle Private Cyberattacks\nDomestic rather than international law plays a key role in preventing and responding to private cyberattacks. However, many states, particularly those less economically developed, have neither laws penalising cyberattacks nor the capacity to enforce them. According to a recent survey, less than a third of states have substantially or fully updated their\n One billion users' data was lost.

Its signatories also include states from outside of the Council of Europe such as the United States, Australia, Japan, and Nigeria but nonetheless, most of its signatories are Western states. This convention influenced similar approaches to regulating cybercrimes in state parties of the Convention.\nFor example, in the United Kingdom, legal guidance broadens the scope of existing crimes such as fraud or sexual offences to cyberspace. The UK Computer Misuse Act 1990 relates to offences or attacks directly against computer systems and has been amended multiple times since its passing. English courts take jurisdiction where such crimes substantially relate to English laws or interests. Similarly, Germany, which adopted the IT Security Act of 2015, broadened the scope of existing offences to cyberspace and added many cybercrimes such as hacking and identity theft into its Criminal Code. The United States has no dedicated cybercrime legislation and instead amends existing statutes to apply to cyberspace.\nAs explained in more detail in Chapter 4 of this book, Russia has been critical of the Budapest Convention, arguing that it endangers national sovereignty, particularly on the provisions dealing with transborder\n McConnell International, ‘Cyber Crime . . . and Punishment?

Instead, it has advocated for a new UN Treaty to fight cybercrime. Russia presented what subsequently became the Resolution adopted by the General Assembly in 2019 on Countering the Use of Information and Communications Technologies for Criminal Purposes. Russia is seen as doing this in an effort to replace the Budapest Convention on cybercrime and laying the foundation for the possibility to extradite dissidents and expatriates in other states for using the Internet to upset those in power.\nNon-Western international law instruments include the 2009 Agreement on Cooperation in the Field of International Information Security, signed in Yekaterinburg by Shanghai Cooperation Organization countries, including China, Russia, and several former Soviet Union states ('SCO Agreement'). Among key cyberthreats, it mentions the development and deployment of information warfare, preparation and waging of information warfare, information terrorism, information crimes, and the exploitation of dominant positions in the information space to the detriment of other states' interests.\nThe SCO Agreement also explicitly mentions the threat of spreading of 'information causing harm to political and socio-economic systems, spiritual, moral and cultural sphere of other States'. In other words, it is much more specific about public cyberthreats and hints at Western states, which dominate cyberspace and are seen by signatories as a potential source of cyberthreats. The SCO Agreement does not attempt to harmonise domestic legislation but instead focuses on co-operation between states, information exchange, and joint cybersecurity threat evaluation.\n T.

The contrasts between the above-discussed Vietnamese and US cybersecurity regimes underscore the need for cross-jurisdictional co-operation and harmonisation, as cybercrimes are often international in nature.\nInternational agreements, such as the 2001 Budapest Convention, clearly target private cyberthreats and aim primarily at co-ordinating the efforts of states and ironing out differences in domestic law. The convention's preamble refers to the need to secure a balance between the interests of law enforcement and respect for fundamental rights, protection of personal data, and co-operation in the penal field. However, most international law instruments remain silent on harmonisation and the need to protect fundamental rights in response to private cyberthreats.\n## 5.3.2 Public Cyberattacks\n### 5.3.2.1 Nature of Public Cyberattacks\nA recent study identified over 200 cybersecurity incidents connected to nation-states over the last eleven years.[27] States are increasing their spending on cybersecurity. For example, the United States in 2021 increased it by 14 per cent.[28] China adopted a programme to grow its cybersecurity\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009374576.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nRESPONDING TO PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CYBERATTACKS 111\nindustry by 15 per cent annually in 2021–2023. Russia plans to increase spending on cybersecurity in 2022 and 2023 by 800 per cent in a dedicated federal project on information cybersecurity. This demonstrates an increased strategic interest in cybersecurity and significant funds invested in the capacity to launch new kinds of cyberattacks.\nState actors perpetrate public cyberattacks either directly or through affiliated private entities. Such cyberattacks may involve undermining political institutions and media, interfering with critical financial or military infrastructure, or merely stealing personal data. Although less frequent than private cyberattacks, the sophistication of public cyber-threats and the political sensitivity of such cases make responding to them difficult. Moreover, cyberattacks emanating from state actors usually pose a greater threat to national security.\nStates seldom openly engage in cyberattacks through official government entities and avoid admitting to such conduct. Consequently, the distinction between private and public cyberattacks is not always clear-cut, as hybrid cyberattacks involving co-operation between state and private actors become increasingly frequent. Many states increasingly deploy the tools and techniques used by private actors, and some recruit them to act as proxies in their interest.\nFor example, several recent attacks of which Russia is accused could be regarded as hybrid cyberattacks. For example, in May 2021 Russian-based hackers, with suspected links to the state, attacked over 150 different government agencies and human rights groups in the United States and other countries. In June 2021, Russian hackers (meaning Russian nationals) conducted ransomware attacks against one of the largest American meat processors. The US government has accused the Russian state of instigating these attacks. Germany recently accused Russia of illegally targeting its politicians with ‘phishing’ emails to gain\n Xiong Xinyi and Zhang Hongpei, ‘China Launches 3-year Draft Plan for Cybersecurity Sector after Regulatory Actions’ Global Times, 12 July 2021, available at: www.globaltimes.cn/page/202107/1228461.shtml (accessed 6 September 2022).\n Anna Ustinova, ‘It’s about the Cipher: Spending on Information Security in Russia Will Increase Eightfold’ IZ, 2 October 2020, available at: https://iz.ru/1068209/anna-ustinova/delo-v-shifre-traty-na-informbezopasnost-v-rossii-uvelichat-v-vosem-raz (accessed 6 September 2022).\n BBC News, ‘Russian Hackers Target Aid Groups in New Cyber-Attack, Says Microsoft’ BBC, 28 May 2021, available at: www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-57280510 (accessed 18 July 2022).\n Tom Polansek, ‘JBS Meat Plants Reopen as White House Blames Russia-linked Group over Hack’ Reuters, 3 June 2021, available at: www.reuters.com/world/us/russia-linked-\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009374576.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nYARIK KRYVOI\naccess to personal details to influence elections. The Russian state was also accused of conducting global campaigns to compromise enterprise and cloud environments in various countries, switching off electric power stations abroad, hacking electoral authorities, and creating some of the world's most destructive computer viruses and refusing to co-operate in investigating such attacks.\nMost public cyberattacks are clearly politically motivated. For example, in 2014, North Korea was blamed for an attack on Sony following the release of the film The Interview. In 2007, Estonia, one of Europe's smaller states, faced an attack by bots originating from almost 180 different countries, which was widely believed to be orchestrated by Russia. Russia also launched a cyberattack on Georgia in 2008, which supplemented the conventional phase of Russia–Georgia war. Geopolitically motivated cybersecurity threats can also target elections, such as Russian interference in the 2016 US election.\nState actors may also be involved in cyberattacks for financial gain.

Such attacks remain public even though motivated by financial gain, because state is the ultimate perpetrator.\nRussia and North Korea are by no means the only states conducting cyberattacks, but the explicit links between the above-listed attacks and Russian and North Korean state interests demonstrate that even when there is an apparently obvious link, definitively linking an attack to a specific state entity remains difficult.\nMoreover, a state entity might stand behind attacks seemingly conducted by private entities acting alone and of their own volition. For example, in the 2021 SolarWinds Hack, a group of Russian state-backed hackers infiltrated a US-based software group to gain access to the email networks of US federal agencies and corporations. Such attacks appear as private cyberattacks, but a state stands behind the non-state actors carrying them out. Essentially, they are public cyberattacks and the difficulty lies in attribution. Attribution of cyberattacks to a state presents complex factual and legal questions, which eventually determine whether such an attack can be regarded as private or public. This chapter deals primarily with issues of legal attribution, which is different from technical attribution (a factual and technical investigation) and political attribution (a policy decision attributing an attack to an actor without necessarily attaching legal consequences such as countermeasures).\nIn accordance with the International Law Commission (ILC) Articles on State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts, cyberattacks can be attributed to a state if they were conducted by organs of a state or if the conduct was directed or controlled by a state.

However, the existing standards of attribution under Articles 4 and 8 of the ILC Articles fail to capture scenarios where state support to a private actor is sporadic or without involvement in the decision-making structures, or where a private actor is supported by more than one state.\nThe real difficulty with distinguishing private and public cyberattacks, and their attribution is the scarcity of evidence. For example, in December 2020, private companies and US officials unearthed a massive espionage campaign posing a ‘grave risk’ to the government, critical infrastructure, and private sector. They have blamed ‘nation-state’ hackers and suggested that Russia was to blame, who in turn, has strongly denied any involvement.\nAccording to the prevailing view, cyberattacks conducted by non-state actors are usually not attributable to states and do not constitute a use of force by states under the UN Charter. However, the conduct of a non-state actor may be attributed to a state where the non-state actor is ‘acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of’ the state, or where the state acknowledges and adopts the conduct as its own. In the Nicaragua case, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled that actions of individuals, which de jure are not organs of a state, may be attributable also if (1) they operated in accordance with ‘planning and direction’ of organs of that state, were paid, equipped, and generally supported by them or (2) the state paid or equipped them, although they had a degree of independence of that state (e.g. the Nicaraguan rebels in that case).\nIn Tadić, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia advanced the ‘overall control’ test, requiring that ‘the State wields overall control over the group, not only by equipping and financing\n For a more detailed analysis, see Nicholas Tsagourias, ‘Cyber Attacks, Self-defence and the Problem of Attribution’ (2012) 17 Journal of Conflict and Security Law 229–244.

This test lowers the threshold of control required for attributing responsibility to the state compared to the effective control test. Subsequently, the ICJ has rejected the use of the ‘overall control’ test. Regardless of whether the ‘overall control’ of the ‘effective control’ test applies, the attribution threshold is high and mere state funding or equipping groups will not result in attribution.\nBecause of difficulties with finding evidence, currently attribution of cyberattacks remains largely political rather than legal. A good example is the already-mentioned US attribution of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. The Obama administration quickly attributed it to Russia, but a thorough report prepared by the Select Committee on Intelligence on the Russian cyber intrusions came out only in 2020.\nTo sum up, state actors perpetrate public cyberattacks either directly or through affiliated private entities. Most of such attacks are clearly politically motivated. The real difficulty with distinguishing private and public cyberattacks, and their attribution is the scarcity of evidence. Attribution becomes even more complicated if a state entity stands behind attacks seemingly conducted by private entities acting alone and of their own volition.\n## 5.3.2.2 Legal Norms to Tackle Public Cyberattacks\nAs discussed above, international regulations on cyberattacks remain scarce.

Russia has been accused of such tactics by granting refuge to convicted foreign ransomware hackers. The UK National Cyber Security Centre, FBI, and the US Department of Homeland Security called on Russia to cease such activities. International law does not give a simple answer to whether harbouring individual criminals guilty of cyberattacks attributes that conduct to the state and the scope of the obligation of states under international law to prevent activities of non-state actors breaching the rights of third states.\nThe ILC has suggested that the Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities could apply to cyberattacks, even though this instrument does not explicitly mention cyberattacks. It applies to activities not prohibited by international law but ones causing transboundary harm and provides that the state of origin of the harm ‘shall take all appropriate measures to prevent significant transboundary harm or at any event to minimize the risk thereof’. This is known as the obligation of due diligence, regarded as a general principle of international law. The ICJ in the Corfu Channel case stated: ‘it is every State’s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States’.\n See, for example, Department of Justice, ‘Canadian Hacker Who Conspired With and Aided Russian FSB Officers Pleads Guilty’ Department of Justice, 28 November 2017, available at: www.justice.gov/opa/pr/canadian-hacker-who-conspired-and-aided-russian-fsb-officers-pleads-guilty (accessed 18 July 2022); Tim Maurer, ‘Why the Russian Government Turns a Blind Eye to Cybercriminals’ Slate, 2 February 2018, available at: https://slate.com/technology/2018/02/why-the-russian-government-turns-a-blind-eye-to-cybercriminals.html (accessed 18 July 2022).\n NCSC, ‘Russian State-Sponsored Cyber Actors Targeting Network Infrastructure Devices’ NCSC, 15 April 2018, available at: www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/russian-state-sponsored-cyber-actors-targeting-network-infrastructure-devices (accessed 18 July 2022).\n Ibid.\n International Law Commission, ‘Commentaries on Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities’ (2001) 2(2) Yearbook of the International Law Commission 148.\n Ibid., Article 1.\n Ibid., Article 3.\n Luke Chircop, ‘A Due Diligence Standard of Attribution in Cyberspace’ (2018) 67 International &amp; Comparative Law Quarterly 643–668 at 649–650; see also Scott J.

A state can only breach the due diligence obligation if (a) it had actual or constructive knowledge of the cyberattack launched from its territory, (b) that attack is contrary to the rights of another state, and (c) it failed to take reasonable measures to prevent it. Furthermore, as the Seabed Mining Advisory Opinion clarifies, the obligation may change in relation to the risk involved in the activity. The greater the risk, the stronger the obligation for the state to act.\nThe above requirements for due diligence should flexibly consider the technical capacity of the state to engage in due diligence. Cyberattacks seldom fit with the territorial logic – the criminals might be in one state but remotely conduct their activities through third countries.\nIt also raises the issue of attribution within the meaning of Article 4 (conducted by organs of a state) and Article 8 (conduct was directed or controlled by a state) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts. Following the logic of due diligence, if a state fails to exercise due diligence to prevent transboundary harms’ situation, that would also amount to ‘public cyberattacks’ that trigger state countermeasures as discussed in more detail in Section 5.3.1.\nRegardless of whether the cyberattacks are private or public, states need to be prepared to deal with them proactively, including before admitting investments through foreign direct investment review mechanisms, by regulating already admitted investments, or by responding to national security breaches as they occur.\n## 5.4 Responding to Cyberattacks\n### 5.4.1 Private Cyberattacks\nBecause not all attacks can be pre-empted, states must also consider how to respond to them. Whether a cyberattack is public or private in nature\n Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0, 30–50.\n Ibid.; see also Luke Chircop, ‘A Due Diligence Standard of Attribution in Cyberspace’ (2018) 67 International &amp; Comparative Law Quarterly 643–668 at 650–651.\n Seabed Mining (Advisory Opinion) [2011] International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, 50 ILM 458, para. 117.\n Karine Bannelier-Christakis, ‘Cyber Diligence: A Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations?’ (2014) 14 Baltic Yearbook of International Law 23–39 at 30.\n See Chapter 8 on this point.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009374576.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nYARIK KRYVOI\ndetermines the type of response available in accordance with domestic or international law.\nAs discussed above, private cyberattack regulation in domestic law does not differ greatly from the regulation of any other crime. In fact, cyberattacks are often understood as versions of existing crimes such as fraud or damage to property, committed through or facilitated using cyberspace. For this reason, the primary response to private cyberattacks is traditional criminal proceedings in domestic courts.\n## 5.4.1.1 Countermeasures against Private Cyberattacks\nStates can take countermeasures against private threats in accordance with domestic law. One example is the response to the 2021 ransomware hacking of a US pipeline (Colonial Pipeline Attack). That private cyberattack on critical domestic infrastructure was launched not for politically motivated offensive or strategic reasons but for pure financial gain. Attackers hacked the pipeline network and demanded ransom to unlock the pipeline. The response was a typical law enforcement activity. The US Department of Justice, using traditional law enforcement agencies (albeit with new, unprecedented integration of cyberspace strategies), seized the bitcoins used to pay the hackers' ransom. Host states may confiscate assets that they see as tools of cyberattacks or expropriate businesses, which pose cyberthreats to the host state. This is in effect no different from police seizing stolen money or assets from thieves or ransom-demanders.\nSimilarly, the group responsible for the Colonial Pipeline Attack had their accounts frozen and stolen bitcoins (used by Colonial to pay their ransom) forcibly recovered by the US Department of Justice. These examples demonstrate the extension of traditional law enforcement jurisdiction and strategies to cyberspace, even when that 'space' is beyond the traditional physical jurisdiction of the state.\n## 5.4.1.2 Jurisdiction over Private Cyberattacks\n5.4.1.2.1 The Territoriality Approach Since private cyberattacks are governed by domestic law like any other crime, territoriality is the cornerstone jurisdictional principle. It is based on the principle that a\n Alexander Mallin and Luke Barr, ‘DOJ Seizes Millions in Ransom Paid by Colonial Pipeline’ ABC, 7 June 2021, available at: https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/doj-seizes-millions-ransom-paid-colonial-pipeline/story?id=78135821 (accessed 18 July 2022).\n Ibid.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009374576.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nRESPONDING TO PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CYBERATTACKS 119\nstate and its organs will have jurisdiction over a crime if it occurred, wholly or in part, in the physical territory of that state. This principle has been enshrined in virtually all domestic criminal laws for centuries.71 It should follow from the territorial jurisdiction principle that if the act occurred, wholly or in part, in the physical territory of the state, it has authority to prosecute and adjudicate such acts. For example, the US government has claimed jurisdiction to prosecute state-sponsored cyberattacks in domestic courts, leading to several indictments.72\nThe application of the territoriality principle may be challenging in the context of cyberattacks, which are usually not physically grounded in one jurisdiction, can affect multiple states, be committed entirely remotely, and routed through several jurisdictions.73 Three challenges complicate asserting jurisdiction over cyberattacks: (a) the international dispersal of illegal activities; (b) jurisdiction may be impossible to assert because conduct may be legal in one jurisdiction but illegal in another, hindering prosecution; and (c) jurisdiction to prosecute may be claimed by several states simultaneously, causing problems with establishing priority between them.74\nFurther, different jurisdictional considerations apply to local cyberattacks and transnational cyberattacks. The former conforms to the traditional model of a crime.75 The latter might pose jurisdictional issues because of its detachment from state territory. However, states can still apply the principle of territoriality and assert jurisdiction over crimes where all or part of the cyberattack occurred in their territory (a ‘substantial effect’ doctrine).76\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009374576.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nYARIK KRYVOI\nThe Budapest Convention supports this reading of jurisdiction. In cases of conflicting jurisdictions, the Convention provides little guidance, merely noting that ‘the Parties involved shall . . . consult with a view to determining the most appropriate jurisdiction for prosecution’. The United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime contains language to the same effect.\nAnother difficulty is that, pursuant to the respect for sovereignty noted above, extradition treaties require ‘double criminality’, that is, the conduct at issue must have been a crime in both countries for extradition to be permissible. As noted earlier, criminality of cyberattacks is incoherent between jurisdictions, which prevents co-operation on extradition.\nReinterpretation of territoriality might solve the issue. Instead of searching for the location of the criminal act, states could instead consider the location of the computers themselves. Singapore claims jurisdiction over cyberattacks ‘if, for the offence in question . . . the computer, program or data was in Singapore at the material time’. Some US states, such as Connecticut, have statutes that confer jurisdiction in cybercrime cases on the fact that some part of the conduct constituting a cybercrime offence impacts a computer located in that state. Finally, states always retain jurisdiction over satellites launched from their territory. Since internet access is becoming increasingly dependent on satellites, this jurisdictional link might prove more useful.\nHowever, as this review suggests, the traditional territoriality approach has significant limitations if applied in the context of cyberattacks.\n5.4.1.2.2 Alternatives to the Territoriality Approach Asserting jurisdiction on the basis of the territory principle is particularly ineffective in\n Article 22 of the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, 23 November 2001, in force 1 July 2004, ETS No. 185 (Budapest Convention).\n Ibid., Article 22(5).\n Article 15 of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, 15 November 2000, in force 29 September 2003, UN Doc.

For these reasons, other jurisdictional principles could apply. The Budapest Convention requires parties to establish jurisdiction ‘when the offence is committed (...) by one of its nationals, if the offence is punishable under criminal law where it was committed or if the offence is committed outside the territorial jurisdiction of any State’. Several domestic criminal legal systems contain equivalent provisions.\nFor cyberattacks with the most serious consequences, such as cyberterrorism, some suggest universal jurisdiction could be attached. Others suggest that violations of human rights or crimes against humanity should also be covered by universal jurisdiction.\nJurisdiction based on the nationality of the target of the cyberattack is another approach adopted in domestic systems. For example, Germany has a very general jurisdiction provision based on the nationality of the victim: if an attack is committed against a German national regardless of whether the crime is punishable in the country where it was committed. Similarly, in Belgium, a crime against a Belgian national falls under the jurisdiction if the act is punishable in the country where it was committed. In the United States, the basic federal cybercrime provision confers jurisdiction to prosecute when the conduct at issue impacts the federal government, that is, where the United States is itself the victim.\nFinally, the protective principle allows states to assert jurisdiction where national security is threatened.

It is, inter alia, defined as a computer that is ‘used in interstate or foreign commerce or communication, including a computer located outside the United States that is used in a manner that affects interstate or foreign commerce or communication of the United States’.\nAs this review suggests, territoriality is not the only approach to determining jurisdiction over private cyberattacks. Different domestic legal systems follow other approaches, such as focusing on the nationality of the victim or the location of computers used in cyberattacks. More judicial practice could help adopt more cohesive and predictable approaches to jurisdiction over geographically dispersed cyberattacks. Approaches to conflict of laws issues vary widely between states, which requires not only judicial practice but also efforts to harmonise and codify jurisdictional rules on private cyberattacks.\n## 5.4.2 Public Cyberattacks\n### 5.4.2.1 Countermeasures against Public Cyberattacks\nResponses to public cyberattacks are very different from private cyberattacks. States may bring cases before domestic courts, explained in the previous section, but this has limited effectiveness vis-à-vis states, the ultimate perpetrators, due to sovereign immunity. In practice, because of the limited jurisdictional reach against state perpetrators, the target state has to respond to private individuals involved in cyberattacks as if these were private cyberattacks. For example, in 2018, a federal grand jury in the District of Columbia charged thirteen Russian nationals and three Russian entities with violating US criminal laws in order to interfere with US elections and political processes.\nStates can also respond to public cyberattacks in accordance with public international law. The UN Charter guarantees the right of states to self-defence against an armed attack. The Nicaragua case highlighted that for self-defence to be triggered, a state usually has to face physical\n\n Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller, ‘Report on the Investigation into Russian Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election’ Department of Justice, March 2019, 174, available at: www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download (accessed 6 September 2022).\n Article 51 of the UN Charter, 24 October 1945, in force 24 October 1945, 1 UNTS XVI.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009374576.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nRESPONDING TO PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CYBERATTACKS 123\nharm. The case discussed the mining of ports and arming hostile militia by the United States. The judgment does, however, suggest that economic harm (e.g. tariffs and embargoes) may suffice as well if it is particularly serious. It usually takes time to gather and analyse facts related to cyberattacks, which often involve multiple jurisdictions. Therefore, some question whether self-defence can be available as a lawful response to the attack, which may essentially mean that states are effectively precluded from any lawful response, including self-defence, which in turn creates incentives to engage in covert retaliatory cyber operations.\nAs a matter of public international law, state responses should evolve using analogies for countering physical force. States may take non-forcible countermeasures against another state to procure cessation and achieve reparation for the injury. Countermeasures also have a prerequisite of proportionality and necessity. The state relying on them must also request reparation from the perpetrator and its intention to exercise countermeasures. The ILC notes that countermeasures which are reciprocal to the harm are more likely to satisfy proportionality and necessity.\nOne example of such countermeasures is the US response to Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. The US response resulted in not only domestic indictments and prosecutions but comprehensive sanctions on the Russian economy and specific Russian nationals involved in the hybrid attacks and disinformation campaign. State responses must be proportionate and, even in cases of less severe\n Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

It has been argued that, when the cyberattack is not sufficiently serious to invoke a need for self-defence under the UN Charter, states may resort to countermeasures to bring the cyberattack to a halt.\nMoreover, the cyberattack does not have to be attributed to a state, but clear evidence should point to its origin in a particular territory. The argument is that states are obliged under customary and treaty law to prevent the activities of non-state actors from breaching the rights of third states, taking all reasonable means available to them on their territory and even in certain circumstances, extraterritorially.\nThe difficulty with applying traditional public international law is that countermeasures must be directed against the responsible state only, which triggers questions about the determination of the identity of the offenders. The transnational character of offences complicates attributing cyber offences to a specific state. This is particularly the case when the state is hiding behind private actors based in multiple jurisdictions. The existing international law of state responsibility also fails to address the situations in which states systematically direct and support non-state actors based in multiple jurisdictions without putting that actor under its formal leadership or chain of command. Such situations may trigger the need for states to establish due diligence mechanisms to tackle unlawful non-state actors in their territory, including those which cause harm to other states.\nAmerica's Adversaries through Sanctions Act of 2017 (H.R.3364), available at: www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/3364/text (accessed 18 July 2022).\n Generally, Anders Henriksen, 'Lawful State Responses to Low-Level Cyber-Attacks: Current Development' (2015) 84(2) Nordic Journal of International Law 323–351.\n Ibid.\n Generally, Susan Brenner, 'At Light Speed: Attribution and Response to Cybercrime/Terrorism/Warfare' (2007) 97(2) Journal of Criminal Law &amp; Criminology 379–476.\n Ibid.\n Ibid.\n It must be noted that even states which follow similar approaches to cybersecurity have different views about whether cybersecurity due diligence is mandatory as a matter of international law.

Espionage, for example, although considered an unfriendly act, is not unlawful under international law. Following this logic, cyberespionage is also not unlawful under international law. Cyberattacks usually aim at procurement of information or surveillance and seldom cause physical damage. For this reason, it is difficult to distinguish between lawful cyberespionage and an unlawful cyberattack in the absence of conventional force.\nExamples of countermeasures following a state-on-state cyberattack are sparse, but retaliatory threats are not unusual. Recently, NATO leaders reaffirmed that a cyberattack against one of its members can trigger Article 5 of the NATO Convention and constitute an attack on all. Further, they reaffirm that countermeasures to a cyberattack need not be limited to cyberspace. Following the 2014 Sony Hack, North Korea reportedly had its internet infrastructure disabled and lost access to the Internet for some time. This occurred hours after President Obama publicly announced a ‘proportional response’ to the hack on Sony.\nThe International Strategy for Cyber Space adopted by President Barack Obama proclaimed that the United States ‘will respond to hostile acts in cyberspace as we would to any other threat to our country’. It also highlights that ‘all states possess an inherent right to self-defence, and we recognise that certain hostile acts conducted through cyberspace could compel actions under the commitments we have with our military\n International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes ad hoc annulment committee in *Libananco v.

According to the 2018 US Department of Defense Defend Forward strategy, the US ‘will defend forward to disrupt or halt malicious cyber activity at its source, including activity that falls below the level of armed conflict’. The same document highlights the determination to engage in defence forward activities not episodically but to deter malicious cyberactivities and contest it on a ‘day-to-day’ basis.\nAn attack by the United States in 2010 against Iran’s nuclear capabilities resulted in Iran forming a ‘Cyber Defense Command’ under the Joint Staff of the Armed Forces. The Cyber Defense Command is similar to its American counterpart, US Cyber Command, which is also a civil intelligence command integrated into an operational military command, with the legal authority to conduct military operations.\nRetaliatory attacks by Iran’s Cyber Defense Command on the United States and its allies soon followed, with the US Department of Homeland Security attributing the attacks to the ‘Iranian nation-state’.

Since then, there has been a noted physical escalation of the conflict between Iran, the United States, and its ally Israel, including attacks by special operations forces from both sides. This shows the increasing connection between public cyberattacks and disproportional physical retaliatory measures, perhaps exaggerated by the lack of international standards and clarity of public international law on responses to public cyberattacks. The back-and-forth between Iran and the United States and its allies over the Iranian nuclear enrichment programme underscores the need for a comprehensive re-evaluation of public international law on cyberattacks to prevent a cycle of unchecked aggression and escalation.\nIn a sense, countermeasures against public cyberattacks is still a very much uncharted territory, which lacks enough state practice. There is little doubt, however, that general public international law and attribution should apply in this context and account for the transborder and dispersed nature of cyberattacks.\n## 5.4.2.2 State Responsibility Based on Due Diligence and Strict Liability\nThe difficulty with collecting evidence related to cyberattacks, including on attribution of the conduct of private actors to states to state actors, has led to proposals to adopt due diligence or strict liability approaches to state responsibility. Arguably, a strict liability model also encourages state co-operation by creating potential liability for reparations.\nIn the Corfu Channel case, the International Court of Justice highlighted the generally recognised principle of international law binding upon states ‘not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States’. In other words, the state needs\n Ronen Bergman, Rick Gladstone, and Farnaz Fassihi, ‘Blackout Hits Iran Nuclear Site in What Appears to Be Israeli Sabotage’ *New York Times*, 11 April 2021, available at: www.nytimes.com/2021/04/11/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-natanz.html (accessed 18 July 2022).\n Patrick Wintour, ‘Iran to Boost Uranium Enrichment Levels in Wake of Israeli Attack’ *The Guardian*, 13 April 2021, available at: www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/13/natanz-nuclear-site-attack-iran-accuses-israel-of-bad-gamble (accessed 18 July 2022).\n Sina Azodi and Mohsen Solhdoost, ‘An Escalating Israel-Iran Conflict Could Sink the JCPOA’ *Atlantic Council*, 1 September 2021, available at: www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/iransource/an-escalating-israel-iran-conflict-could-sink-the-jcpoa (accessed 18 July 2022).\n Generally, James P.

The report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security also states that ‘States should not knowingly allow their territory to be used for internationally wrongful acts using ICTs’.\nAccording to Japan, the due diligence obligation may serve as a ground for the responsibility of the state from the territory of which a cyber operation not attributable to any state was conducted. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 seems to contemplate a rule of cyber due diligence: ‘A State must exercise due diligence in not allowing its territory, or territory or cyber infrastructure under its governmental control, to be used for cyber operations that affect the rights of, and produce serious adverse consequences for, other States.’ That prompted some states to view the due diligence obligation primarily as a duty to prevent rather than to prosecute.\nA number of states, including Germany, France, Japan, and Australia, argued for the application of this principle in cyberspace.\n UN General Assembly, ‘Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security’ Note by the Secretary-General, 22 July 2015, UN Doc.

Israel sees the difficulty with the inherently different features of cyberspace – its decentralisation and private characteristics.\nIn other words, although many states advocate for the cybersecurity due diligence obligation, currently it has not yet crystallised into a specific obligation. Asking states to commit to concluding a treaty containing such obligations may prove to be a difficult task as the fragmented regime, in which many states will decide not to commit to this obligation, may penalise the states willing to commit to the due diligence obligation. However, there is little doubt that a due diligence approach offers a more effective way to create incentives for states to combat cyberattacks compared to traditional norms of state responsibility.\n## 5.4.2.3 Jurisdiction over Public Cyberattacks\nThe fundamental concept of territoriality applicable in international dispute resolution stems from sovereignty and should also inform jurisdictional decisions of international courts and tribunals resolving state-to-state disputes. Sovereignty also confers responsibilities, which arguably include the responsibility to protect third states against cyberattacks that would violate international law. Territoriality might assist in determining whether a state is in breach of its cybersecurity due diligence obligations vis-à-vis another state.\n UN General Assembly, ‘Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions on the Subject of How International Law Applies to the Use of Information and Communications Technologies by States Submitted by Participating Governmental Experts in the Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security Established Pursuant to General Assembly Resolution 73/266’, 13 July 2021, UN Doc.

Such an approach can result in blaming multiple states, as cyberattacks are typically highly dispersed. It also does not answer whether one state's failure to exercise its due diligence gives the victim state a right to exercise jurisdiction over a cyberattack committed abroad. Taking anti-cyberattack action by targeting servers abroad might violate other states' sovereignty. State consent is therefore essential to the extraterritorial exercise of jurisdiction. States seem reluctant to prosecute or investigate another state for cybersecurity allegations. The notable exception is the United States, which has commenced domestic proceedings against North Korea that resulted in an indictment.\nPublic cyberattacks orchestrated by states should be dealt by the norms of international public law, as any other state-to-state dispute. 'The Oxford Statement on International Law Protections in Cyberspace', prepared by academics, argues that existing international law concepts should be equally applied to cyberspace. At the moment, specific international law rules dealing with public cyberattacks are almost nonexistent, as are specialised dispute resolution bodies. International courts and tribunals, rather than domestic courts, should have jurisdiction over interstate disputes. Following this logic, state-to-state cyberdisputes should be resolved in the same manner as other state-to-state disputes with institutions such as the ICJ and the Permanent Court of Arbitration playing a leading role.\n Ian Yuying Liu, 'State Responsibility and Cyberattacks: Defining Due Diligence Obligations' (2017) 4 Indonesian Journal of International and Comparative Law 191–260 at 257–258.\n Harriet Moynihan, 'The Application of International Law to State Cyberattacks Sovereignty and Non-Intervention' Chatham House, December 2019, available at: www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/publications/research/2019-11-29-Intl-Law-Cyberattacks.pdf (accessed 18 July 2022).\n United States of America v.

Traditional dispute resolution bodies may also find it difficult to deal with highly technical issues related to attribution and collection of evidence in cyberspace. That undermines the ability of the international community to effectively prevent and respond to cyberattacks. Therefore, the idea of creating a forum to resolve disputes related to cyberattacks, taking into account their public nature, should be seriously considered by states.\n## 5.5 Conclusion\nThe task of conceptualising cyberattacks as public or private is challenging, as it requires evidence-based determinations and making judgements related to the possible involvement of state actors. However, the difference between public and private cyberattacks is crucial as it subjects the attack to different legal regimes. States resort to domestic law solutions to deal with private cyberattacks, including measures allowed under domestic law to deal with criminal activities. In this context, international treaties play a limited role, potentially facilitating co-operation between law enforcement agencies.\nAs states dramatically increase their cybersecurity, public cyberattacks present a particular systemic and existential threat, disrupting multiple organisations and critical infrastructure. The analysis above suggests that the effective application of existing international law to public cyberattacks may require the reassessment of application of the concepts of self-defence and countermeasures in cyberspace. Further development of state practice and *opinio iuris* will help shape uniform approaches and crystallisation of principles of international law.\nThe encouragement of co-operation is the most common norm related to cybersecurity in international treaties. Mutual legal assistance treaties provide a right to request assistance, although the other party might not comply with such requests where it is itself behind the cyberattacks.\n In this respect, the distinction between private and public adjudication should be taken into account in designing such dispute resolution institution. See, generally, Yarik Kryvoi, ‘Private or Public Adjudication? Procedure, Substance and Legitimacy’ (2021) 34(4) Leiden Journal of International Law 681–703.\n Generally, Scott J. Shackelford, ‘From Nuclear War to Net War: Analogizing Cyber Attacks in International Law’ (2009) 27(1) Berkeley Journal of International Law 192–251.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009374576.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nYARIK KRYVOI\nIt also restricts the ability of states to bring any such claims before international courts and tribunals. Instead, states opt for naming and shaming, and framing accusations. There are, however, efforts to include cyberattacks into major international criminal law treaties, most notably the Rome Statute. Talks on this topic at the UN level are currently ongoing.\nAs this chapter has demonstrated, states with similar political regimes tend to co-operate and conclude treaties dealing with cybersecurity (e.g. the Budapest Convention adopted by Western States and the SCO Agreement dominated by China and Russia). Different approaches to cybersecurity and the acceptable level of state interference in matters of cybersecurity also demonstrate the limits of truly global co-operation, as opposed to co-operation between allies. In the absence of specialised treaties of international tribunals dealing with cybersecurity threats, general provisions of public international law should apply.\nInternational courts and tribunals should have jurisdiction over cyberattacks, as such disputes involve states and are governed by public international law. Although a cyberattack-related case has not yet been brought, the ICJ might be a natural forum for such state-to-state claims. Investment tribunals have in the past condemned cyberattacks in their decisions and by excluding evidence obtained by hacking. However, a dedicated international dispute resolution forum with jurisdiction over cyberattack is missing. Although existing public international law should apply equally to public cyberattacks, the novelty of cyberspace creates areas of confusion.

If international maritime, intellectual property, criminal law, and other types of disputes have their specialised dispute resolution bodies and treaties; hopefully, it is only a matter of time when such as dispute resolution forum will emerge for the cybersphere.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009374576.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press",

      "flat_text": "Jurisdiction, Self-Defence, and Countermeasures\nYARIK KRYVOI\n## 5.1 Introduction\nAlthough scholarship dealing with cybersecurity usually does not distinguish between private and public cyberattacks, this chapter demonstrates that this distinction is crucial to effectively respond to cyberattacks. A recent United Nations report suggested that international human rights law represents an important external reference point for criminalisation and procedural provisions related to cyberattacks. However, this is not necessarily the case for public cyberattacks, which involve state–state relations.\nThis chapter argues that the determination of whether a particular cyberattack is of public or private nature (a cybercrime) should define how states respond to cybersecurity risks. Section 5.3 of this chapter demonstrates that non-state actors motivated by financial gain or ideology perpetrate private cyberattacks, which typically target non-state entities, rather than states (see Section 5.3.1). Such cyberattacks require primarily domestic law responses based on the principle of territoriality and alternative principles.\nStates act as the main perpetrators of public cyberattacks, usually motivated not by financial gain but by political and strategic objectives such as causing harm, interfering with internal political processes or gaining access to sensitive information (see Section 5.3.2). They can\n United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, ‘Comprehensive Study on Cybercrime’ UN Publications, February 2013, available at: www.unodc.org/documents/organized-crime/UNODC_CCPCJ_EG.4_2013/CYBERCRIME_STUDY_210213.pdf (accessed 18 July 2022).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009374576.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nYARIK KRYVOI\nundermine critical infrastructure, national security, the democratic legitimacy of institutions, or political freedoms.\nSection 5.4 of this chapter shows that public cyberattacks require not only domestic law but also international law responses. If the state-sponsored nature of a cyberattack can be established with a degree of certainty, this should trigger the state's rights to self-defence and to respond with countermeasures to procure cessation and achieve reparation for the injury. The difficulty with collecting evidence related to cyberattacks, including on attribution of the conduct of private actors to state actors, has led to proposals to adopt due diligence or strict liability approaches to state responsibility (see Section 5.4.2).\nThe chapter concludes that the effective application of existing international law to public cyberattacks may require the reassessment of application of the concepts of self-defence and countermeasures in cyberspace. It highlights the limits of global treaty-making in the area of cybersecurity and calls for establishment of a dispute resolution body in charge of public cyberattacks, which could develop jurisprudence to assist in the application of existing norms to cyberspace and the development of new, cyberspace-specific, norms.\n## 5.2 Conceptual Framework\nTable 5.1 highlights the differences between private, hybrid, and public cyberattacks, discussed in more detail in subsequent sections. It shows that despite commonalities, public and private cyberattacks are governed by separate legal regimes, have different motivations, and vary in severity. Hybrid cyberattacks blur the distinction between the two – and while they appear as private attacks, they are in fact public. The rest of the chapter examines different aspects of the distinction between private and public cyberattacks and responses to them.\n## 5.3 The Nature and Legal Regimes of Private and Public Cyberattacks\n### 5.3.1 Private Cyberattacks\n#### 5.3.1.1 Nature of Private Cyberattacks\nCyberspace creates a fertile environment for criminal activities, as it allows perpetrators to pose security threats or engage in money laundering or data theft, or facilitate corruption across borders without leaving\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009374576.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTable 5.1 Key features of private and public cyberattacks\n|   | Private cyberattacks (cybercrimes) | Public cyberattacks  |   |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|   |   |  Hybrid cyberattacks | Direct cyberattacks  |\n|  Perpetrator | Non-state actors | Non-state and state actors | States  |\n|  Motivation | Usually, financially or ideologically motivated. Private cyberattacks often have an ulterior motive (obtain profit, strike fear or send a message), rather than merely cause damage for other reasons | A mix of financial, ideological, political motivation, and possibility of for-profit motivations | Mainly politically motivated, to cause damage or gain access to sensitive information  |\n|  Targets and severity of impact | Varies from small to large targets but usually targets other non-state entities, rather than states with varying severity of impact | Varies from small targets to large targets with severe impact | Highly severe. Public cyberattacks most often target other states but may also be aimed at non-state actors. They can undermine critical infrastructure, national security, democratic legitimacy and institutions, or political freedoms  |\n|  Dominant applicable law | Domestic law | Domestic and international law | International law  |\n|  Typical forms | • Ransomware attacks • Personal data leaks • Cyberterrorism • Malware hacking • Online child sexual exploitation • Cyber-enabled crimes | Can take the forms of private and public cyberattacks | • Election hacking • Cyberattacks on state digital infrastructure • Cyberattacks on foreign military targets • Cyberespionage  |\n|  Responses | In accordance with domestic laws: • Domestic administrative and criminal law countermeasures | In accordance with domestic and public international law, including: • Self-defence • Proportionate and necessary countermeasures • Domestic proceedings  |   |\nYARIK KRYVOI\ntheir homes. Criminals, extremists, and terrorists can exploit such new technologies, which allow them to pursue illicit activities or spread radical ideologies internationally from safe havens, thus circumventing traditional domestic legal systems and law enforcement measures.\nSome even labelled the cybercrime economy as the ‘Web of Profit’, with a variety of criminal activities, generating revenues from illicit online markets, IP and trade secret theft, and data crimeware and ransomware. According to some estimates, cybercrime revenues annually reach around US$1.5 trillion. Cyberattacks can also cause significant disruption and lead to very high costs – for example, some estimates suggest that potential cost of the 2017 WannaCry attack was US$4 billion.\nPrivate cyberattacks emanate from private individuals or groups usually motivated by gaining profit (e.g. ransom attacks) or ideological reasons (e.g. propaganda of terrorism). Private actors may engage in personal data leaks, economic crimes, terrorism, and sexual offences. With a few exceptions, normally such crimes do not rise to the level of posing a threat to national security since profit is the primary motivation of private cyberattacks.\nIt must be noted that the same cyberattacks can be perpetrated by either private or public actors. This includes hacking and illegal access, data or ID theft, cyber sabotage, spreading viruses, and distributing worms, spyware, and logic bombs. The United Nations Manual on Computer-related Crime includes fraud as well as forgery in its list of cybercrimes. What matters for the determination of public or private nature of cyberattacks is whether the ultimate perpetrator is a public or a private actor.\n Ibid.\n See, for example, European Commission, ‘Reflection Paper on Harnessing Globalisation’ (2017) EU Publications 12–13, available at: https://commission.europa.eu/publications/reflection-paper-harnessing-globalisation_en (accessed 6 September 2022).\n Michael McGuire, ‘Nation States, Cyberconflict and the Web of Profit’ (2021) HP Development Company, available at: https://threatresearch.ext.hp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/hp-bps-web-of-profit-report_APR_2021.pdf (accessed 6 September 2022).\n Ibid., 20.\n Jonathan Berr, “WannaCry” Ransomware Attack Losses Could Reach $4 billion’ CBS News, 16 May 2017, available at: www.cbsnews.com/news/wannacry-ransomware-attacks-wannacry-virus-losses/ (accessed 6 September 2022).\n United Nations, United Nations Manual on the Prevention and Control of Computer-Related Crime (New York: United Nations, 1994), available at: www.unodc.org/pdf/Manual_ComputerRelatedCrime.PDF (accessed 6 September 2022).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009374576.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nRESPONDING TO PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CYBERATTACKS 107\nAn example of a private cyberattack is the 2013 attack on the US web services provider Yahoo, which led to the loss of one billion users' data. In another incident, hackers gained access to the personal data of 100 million users of a major Australian tech company. One can think of situations in which private cyberattacks may go beyond causing damage to particular organisations and individuals and pose a threat to critical infrastructure (e.g. hospitals, electricity, or military facilities). For example, the 2021 Colonial Pipeline Hack in the United States was carried out by a private group seeking ransom, who disabled thousands of miles of US energy infrastructure for nearly a week. A cyberattack against a US water treatment facility in Florida, which temporarily increased the levels of chemicals in drinking water, was also likely caused by a private hacker.\nTo sum up, non-state actors commit private cyberattacks, most of which aim at financial gain but can also be motivated by ideological reasons. Such cyberattacks usually do not raise to the level of causing national security threats, although the largest ones may do so.\n## 5.3.1.2 Legal Norms to Tackle Private Cyberattacks\nDomestic rather than international law plays a key role in preventing and responding to private cyberattacks. However, many states, particularly those less economically developed, have neither laws penalising cyberattacks nor the capacity to enforce them.

Its signatories also include states from outside of the Council of Europe such as the United States, Australia, Japan, and Nigeria but nonetheless, most of its signatories are Western states. This convention influenced similar approaches to regulating cybercrimes in state parties of the Convention.\nFor example, in the United Kingdom, legal guidance broadens the scope of existing crimes such as fraud or sexual offences to cyberspace. The UK Computer Misuse Act 1990 relates to offences or attacks directly against computer systems and has been amended multiple times since its passing. English courts take jurisdiction where such crimes substantially relate to English laws or interests. Similarly, Germany, which adopted the IT Security Act of 2015, broadened the scope of existing offences to cyberspace and added many cybercrimes such as hacking and identity theft into its Criminal Code. The United States has no dedicated cybercrime legislation and instead amends existing statutes to apply to cyberspace.\nAs explained in more detail in Chapter 4 of this book, Russia has been critical of the Budapest Convention, arguing that it endangers national sovereignty, particularly on the provisions dealing with transborder\n McConnell International, ‘Cyber Crime . . . and Punishment?

Instead, it has advocated for a new UN Treaty to fight cybercrime. Russia presented what subsequently became the Resolution adopted by the General Assembly in 2019 on Countering the Use of Information and Communications Technologies for Criminal Purposes. Russia is seen as doing this in an effort to replace the Budapest Convention on cybercrime and laying the foundation for the possibility to extradite dissidents and expatriates in other states for using the Internet to upset those in power.\nNon-Western international law instruments include the 2009 Agreement on Cooperation in the Field of International Information Security, signed in Yekaterinburg by Shanghai Cooperation Organization countries, including China, Russia, and several former Soviet Union states ('SCO Agreement'). Among key cyberthreats, it mentions the development and deployment of information warfare, preparation and waging of information warfare, information terrorism, information crimes, and the exploitation of dominant positions in the information space to the detriment of other states' interests.\nThe SCO Agreement also explicitly mentions the threat of spreading of 'information causing harm to political and socio-economic systems, spiritual, moral and cultural sphere of other States'. In other words, it is much more specific about public cyberthreats and hints at Western states, which dominate cyberspace and are seen by signatories as a potential source of cyberthreats. The SCO Agreement does not attempt to harmonise domestic legislation but instead focuses on co-operation between states, information exchange, and joint cybersecurity threat evaluation.\n T.

The contrasts between the above-discussed Vietnamese and US cybersecurity regimes underscore the need for cross-jurisdictional co-operation and harmonisation, as cybercrimes are often international in nature.\nInternational agreements, such as the 2001 Budapest Convention, clearly target private cyberthreats and aim primarily at co-ordinating the efforts of states and ironing out differences in domestic law. The convention's preamble refers to the need to secure a balance between the interests of law enforcement and respect for fundamental rights, protection of personal data, and co-operation in the penal field. However, most international law instruments remain silent on harmonisation and the need to protect fundamental rights in response to private cyberthreats.\n## 5.3.2 Public Cyberattacks\n### 5.3.2.1 Nature of Public Cyberattacks\nA recent study identified over 200 cybersecurity incidents connected to nation-states over the last eleven years.[27] States are increasing their spending on cybersecurity. For example, the United States in 2021 increased it by 14 per cent.[28] China adopted a programme to grow its cybersecurity\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009374576.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nRESPONDING TO PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CYBERATTACKS 111\nindustry by 15 per cent annually in 2021–2023. Russia plans to increase spending on cybersecurity in 2022 and 2023 by 800 per cent in a dedicated federal project on information cybersecurity. This demonstrates an increased strategic interest in cybersecurity and significant funds invested in the capacity to launch new kinds of cyberattacks.\nState actors perpetrate public cyberattacks either directly or through affiliated private entities. Such cyberattacks may involve undermining political institutions and media, interfering with critical financial or military infrastructure, or merely stealing personal data. Although less frequent than private cyberattacks, the sophistication of public cyber-threats and the political sensitivity of such cases make responding to them difficult. Moreover, cyberattacks emanating from state actors usually pose a greater threat to national security.\nStates seldom openly engage in cyberattacks through official government entities and avoid admitting to such conduct. Consequently, the distinction between private and public cyberattacks is not always clear-cut, as hybrid cyberattacks involving co-operation between state and private actors become increasingly frequent. Many states increasingly deploy the tools and techniques used by private actors, and some recruit them to act as proxies in their interest.\nFor example, several recent attacks of which Russia is accused could be regarded as hybrid cyberattacks. For example, in May 2021 Russian-based hackers, with suspected links to the state, attacked over 150 different government agencies and human rights groups in the United States and other countries. In June 2021, Russian hackers (meaning Russian nationals) conducted ransomware attacks against one of the largest American meat processors. The US government has accused the Russian state of instigating these attacks.

The Russian state was also accused of conducting global campaigns to compromise enterprise and cloud environments in various countries, switching off electric power stations abroad, hacking electoral authorities, and creating some of the world's most destructive computer viruses and refusing to co-operate in investigating such attacks.\nMost public cyberattacks are clearly politically motivated. For example, in 2014, North Korea was blamed for an attack on Sony following the release of the film The Interview. In 2007, Estonia, one of Europe's smaller states, faced an attack by bots originating from almost 180 different countries, which was widely believed to be orchestrated by Russia. Russia also launched a cyberattack on Georgia in 2008, which supplemented the conventional phase of Russia–Georgia war. Geopolitically motivated cybersecurity threats can also target elections, such as Russian interference in the 2016 US election.\nState actors may also be involved in cyberattacks for financial gain.

Such attacks remain public even though motivated by financial gain, because state is the ultimate perpetrator.\nRussia and North Korea are by no means the only states conducting cyberattacks, but the explicit links between the above-listed attacks and Russian and North Korean state interests demonstrate that even when there is an apparently obvious link, definitively linking an attack to a specific state entity remains difficult.\nMoreover, a state entity might stand behind attacks seemingly conducted by private entities acting alone and of their own volition. For example, in the 2021 SolarWinds Hack, a group of Russian state-backed hackers infiltrated a US-based software group to gain access to the email networks of US federal agencies and corporations. Such attacks appear as private cyberattacks, but a state stands behind the non-state actors carrying them out. Essentially, they are public cyberattacks and the difficulty lies in attribution. Attribution of cyberattacks to a state presents complex factual and legal questions, which eventually determine whether such an attack can be regarded as private or public. This chapter deals primarily with issues of legal attribution, which is different from technical attribution (a factual and technical investigation) and political attribution (a policy decision attributing an attack to an actor without necessarily attaching legal consequences such as countermeasures).\nIn accordance with the International Law Commission (ILC) Articles on State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts, cyberattacks can be attributed to a state if they were conducted by organs of a state or if the conduct was directed or controlled by a state. If the state-sponsored nature of the attack can be established with certainty, this may\n Katrina Manson, Helen Warrell, and Hannah Murphy, ‘North Koreans Charged in $1.3bn Cyber-Hack Spree’ Financial Times, 18 February 2021, available at: www.ft.com/content/3556c699-8bff-4837-abb1-1ef70d2094d4 (accessed 6 September 2022).\n See, for example, Center for Strategic and International Studies, ‘Significant Cyber Incidents’ Center for Strategic and International Studies, available at: www.csis.org/programs/strategic-technologies-program/significant-cyber-incidents (accessed 6 September 2022).\n Hanna Murphy, ‘Russia-Linked Hackers Target IT Supply Chain with Ransomware’ Financial Times, 4 July 2021, available at: www.ft.com/content/a8e7c9a2-5819-424f-b087-c6f2e8f0c7a1 (accessed 6 September 2022).\n International Law Commission, ‘Commentaries to Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts’, UN GAOR 56th Session, Supp. No. 10, at 43, UN Doc.

However, the existing standards of attribution under Articles 4 and 8 of the ILC Articles fail to capture scenarios where state support to a private actor is sporadic or without involvement in the decision-making structures, or where a private actor is supported by more than one state.\nThe real difficulty with distinguishing private and public cyberattacks, and their attribution is the scarcity of evidence. For example, in December 2020, private companies and US officials unearthed a massive espionage campaign posing a ‘grave risk’ to the government, critical infrastructure, and private sector. They have blamed ‘nation-state’ hackers and suggested that Russia was to blame, who in turn, has strongly denied any involvement.\nAccording to the prevailing view, cyberattacks conducted by non-state actors are usually not attributable to states and do not constitute a use of force by states under the UN Charter. However, the conduct of a non-state actor may be attributed to a state where the non-state actor is ‘acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of’ the state, or where the state acknowledges and adopts the conduct as its own. In the Nicaragua case, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled that actions of individuals, which de jure are not organs of a state, may be attributable also if (1) they operated in accordance with ‘planning and direction’ of organs of that state, were paid, equipped, and generally supported by them or (2) the state paid or equipped them, although they had a degree of independence of that state (e.g. the Nicaraguan rebels in that case).\nIn Tadić, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia advanced the ‘overall control’ test, requiring that ‘the State wields overall control over the group, not only by equipping and financing\n For a more detailed analysis, see Nicholas Tsagourias, ‘Cyber Attacks, Self-defence and the Problem of Attribution’ (2012) 17 Journal of Conflict and Security Law 229–244.

This test lowers the threshold of control required for attributing responsibility to the state compared to the effective control test. Subsequently, the ICJ has rejected the use of the ‘overall control’ test. Regardless of whether the ‘overall control’ of the ‘effective control’ test applies, the attribution threshold is high and mere state funding or equipping groups will not result in attribution.\nBecause of difficulties with finding evidence, currently attribution of cyberattacks remains largely political rather than legal. A good example is the already-mentioned US attribution of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. The Obama administration quickly attributed it to Russia, but a thorough report prepared by the Select Committee on Intelligence on the Russian cyber intrusions came out only in 2020.\nTo sum up, state actors perpetrate public cyberattacks either directly or through affiliated private entities. Most of such attacks are clearly politically motivated. The real difficulty with distinguishing private and public cyberattacks, and their attribution is the scarcity of evidence. Attribution becomes even more complicated if a state entity stands behind attacks seemingly conducted by private entities acting alone and of their own volition.\n## 5.3.2.2 Legal Norms to Tackle Public Cyberattacks\nAs discussed above, international regulations on cyberattacks remain scarce.

Russia has been accused of such tactics by granting refuge to convicted foreign ransomware hackers. The UK National Cyber Security Centre, FBI, and the US Department of Homeland Security called on Russia to cease such activities. International law does not give a simple answer to whether harbouring individual criminals guilty of cyberattacks attributes that conduct to the state and the scope of the obligation of states under international law to prevent activities of non-state actors breaching the rights of third states.\nThe ILC has suggested that the Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities could apply to cyberattacks, even though this instrument does not explicitly mention cyberattacks. It applies to activities not prohibited by international law but ones causing transboundary harm and provides that the state of origin of the harm ‘shall take all appropriate measures to prevent significant transboundary harm or at any event to minimize the risk thereof’. This is known as the obligation of due diligence, regarded as a general principle of international law. The ICJ in the Corfu Channel case stated: ‘it is every State’s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States’.\n See, for example, Department of Justice, ‘Canadian Hacker Who Conspired With and Aided Russian FSB Officers Pleads Guilty’ Department of Justice, 28 November 2017, available at: www.justice.gov/opa/pr/canadian-hacker-who-conspired-and-aided-russian-fsb-officers-pleads-guilty (accessed 18 July 2022); Tim Maurer, ‘Why the Russian Government Turns a Blind Eye to Cybercriminals’ Slate, 2 February 2018, available at: https://slate.com/technology/2018/02/why-the-russian-government-turns-a-blind-eye-to-cybercriminals.html (accessed 18 July 2022).\n NCSC, ‘Russian State-Sponsored Cyber Actors Targeting Network Infrastructure Devices’ NCSC, 15 April 2018, available at: www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/russian-state-sponsored-cyber-actors-targeting-network-infrastructure-devices (accessed 18 July 2022).\n Ibid.\n International Law Commission, ‘Commentaries on Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities’ (2001) 2(2) Yearbook of the International Law Commission 148.\n Ibid., Article 1.\n Ibid., Article 3.\n Luke Chircop, ‘A Due Diligence Standard of Attribution in Cyberspace’ (2018) 67 International &amp; Comparative Law Quarterly 643–668 at 649–650; see also Scott J.

A state can only breach the due diligence obligation if (a) it had actual or constructive knowledge of the cyberattack launched from its territory, (b) that attack is contrary to the rights of another state, and (c) it failed to take reasonable measures to prevent it. Furthermore, as the Seabed Mining Advisory Opinion clarifies, the obligation may change in relation to the risk involved in the activity. The greater the risk, the stronger the obligation for the state to act.\nThe above requirements for due diligence should flexibly consider the technical capacity of the state to engage in due diligence. Cyberattacks seldom fit with the territorial logic – the criminals might be in one state but remotely conduct their activities through third countries.\nIt also raises the issue of attribution within the meaning of Article 4 (conducted by organs of a state) and Article 8 (conduct was directed or controlled by a state) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts. Following the logic of due diligence, if a state fails to exercise due diligence to prevent transboundary harms’ situation, that would also amount to ‘public cyberattacks’ that trigger state countermeasures as discussed in more detail in Section 5.3.1.\nRegardless of whether the cyberattacks are private or public, states need to be prepared to deal with them proactively, including before admitting investments through foreign direct investment review mechanisms, by regulating already admitted investments, or by responding to national security breaches as they occur.\n## 5.4 Responding to Cyberattacks\n### 5.4.1 Private Cyberattacks\nBecause not all attacks can be pre-empted, states must also consider how to respond to them. Whether a cyberattack is public or private in nature\n Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0, 30–50.\n Ibid.; see also Luke Chircop, ‘A Due Diligence Standard of Attribution in Cyberspace’ (2018) 67 International &amp; Comparative Law Quarterly 643–668 at 650–651.\n Seabed Mining (Advisory Opinion) [2011] International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, 50 ILM 458, para. 117.\n Karine Bannelier-Christakis, ‘Cyber Diligence: A Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations?’ (2014) 14 Baltic Yearbook of International Law 23–39 at 30.\n See Chapter 8 on this point.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009374576.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nYARIK KRYVOI\ndetermines the type of response available in accordance with domestic or international law.\nAs discussed above, private cyberattack regulation in domestic law does not differ greatly from the regulation of any other crime. In fact, cyberattacks are often understood as versions of existing crimes such as fraud or damage to property, committed through or facilitated using cyberspace. For this reason, the primary response to private cyberattacks is traditional criminal proceedings in domestic courts.\n## 5.4.1.1 Countermeasures against Private Cyberattacks\nStates can take countermeasures against private threats in accordance with domestic law. One example is the response to the 2021 ransomware hacking of a US pipeline (Colonial Pipeline Attack). That private cyberattack on critical domestic infrastructure was launched not for politically motivated offensive or strategic reasons but for pure financial gain. Attackers hacked the pipeline network and demanded ransom to unlock the pipeline. The response was a typical law enforcement activity. The US Department of Justice, using traditional law enforcement agencies (albeit with new, unprecedented integration of cyberspace strategies), seized the bitcoins used to pay the hackers' ransom. Host states may confiscate assets that they see as tools of cyberattacks or expropriate businesses, which pose cyberthreats to the host state. This is in effect no different from police seizing stolen money or assets from thieves or ransom-demanders.\nSimilarly, the group responsible for the Colonial Pipeline Attack had their accounts frozen and stolen bitcoins (used by Colonial to pay their ransom) forcibly recovered by the US Department of Justice. These examples demonstrate the extension of traditional law enforcement jurisdiction and strategies to cyberspace, even when that 'space' is beyond the traditional physical jurisdiction of the state.\n## 5.4.1.2 Jurisdiction over Private Cyberattacks\n5.4.1.2.1 The Territoriality Approach Since private cyberattacks are governed by domestic law like any other crime, territoriality is the cornerstone jurisdictional principle. It is based on the principle that a\n Alexander Mallin and Luke Barr, ‘DOJ Seizes Millions in Ransom Paid by Colonial Pipeline’ ABC, 7 June 2021, available at: https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/doj-seizes-millions-ransom-paid-colonial-pipeline/story?id=78135821 (accessed 18 July 2022).\n Ibid.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009374576.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nRESPONDING TO PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CYBERATTACKS 119\nstate and its organs will have jurisdiction over a crime if it occurred, wholly or in part, in the physical territory of that state. This principle has been enshrined in virtually all domestic criminal laws for centuries.71 It should follow from the territorial jurisdiction principle that if the act occurred, wholly or in part, in the physical territory of the state, it has authority to prosecute and adjudicate such acts. For example, the US government has claimed jurisdiction to prosecute state-sponsored cyberattacks in domestic courts, leading to several indictments.72\nThe application of the territoriality principle may be challenging in the context of cyberattacks, which are usually not physically grounded in one jurisdiction, can affect multiple states, be committed entirely remotely, and routed through several jurisdictions.73 Three challenges complicate asserting jurisdiction over cyberattacks: (a) the international dispersal of illegal activities; (b) jurisdiction may be impossible to assert because conduct may be legal in one jurisdiction but illegal in another, hindering prosecution; and (c) jurisdiction to prosecute may be claimed by several states simultaneously, causing problems with establishing priority between them.74\nFurther, different jurisdictional considerations apply to local cyberattacks and transnational cyberattacks. The former conforms to the traditional model of a crime.75 The latter might pose jurisdictional issues because of its detachment from state territory. However, states can still apply the principle of territoriality and assert jurisdiction over crimes where all or part of the cyberattack occurred in their territory (a ‘substantial effect’ doctrine).76\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009374576.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nYARIK KRYVOI\nThe Budapest Convention supports this reading of jurisdiction. In cases of conflicting jurisdictions, the Convention provides little guidance, merely noting that ‘the Parties involved shall . . . consult with a view to determining the most appropriate jurisdiction for prosecution’. The United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime contains language to the same effect.\nAnother difficulty is that, pursuant to the respect for sovereignty noted above, extradition treaties require ‘double criminality’, that is, the conduct at issue must have been a crime in both countries for extradition to be permissible. As noted earlier, criminality of cyberattacks is incoherent between jurisdictions, which prevents co-operation on extradition.\nReinterpretation of territoriality might solve the issue. Instead of searching for the location of the criminal act, states could instead consider the location of the computers themselves. Singapore claims jurisdiction over cyberattacks ‘if, for the offence in question . . . the computer, program or data was in Singapore at the material time’. Some US states, such as Connecticut, have statutes that confer jurisdiction in cybercrime cases on the fact that some part of the conduct constituting a cybercrime offence impacts a computer located in that state. Finally, states always retain jurisdiction over satellites launched from their territory. Since internet access is becoming increasingly dependent on satellites, this jurisdictional link might prove more useful.\nHowever, as this review suggests, the traditional territoriality approach has significant limitations if applied in the context of cyberattacks.\n5.4.1.2.2 Alternatives to the Territoriality Approach Asserting jurisdiction on the basis of the territory principle is particularly ineffective in\n Article 22 of the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, 23 November 2001, in force 1 July 2004, ETS No. 185 (Budapest Convention).\n Ibid., Article 22(5).\n Article 15 of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, 15 November 2000, in force 29 September 2003, UN Doc.

For these reasons, other jurisdictional principles could apply. The Budapest Convention requires parties to establish jurisdiction ‘when the offence is committed (...) by one of its nationals, if the offence is punishable under criminal law where it was committed or if the offence is committed outside the territorial jurisdiction of any State’. Several domestic criminal legal systems contain equivalent provisions.\nFor cyberattacks with the most serious consequences, such as cyberterrorism, some suggest universal jurisdiction could be attached. Others suggest that violations of human rights or crimes against humanity should also be covered by universal jurisdiction.\nJurisdiction based on the nationality of the target of the cyberattack is another approach adopted in domestic systems. For example, Germany has a very general jurisdiction provision based on the nationality of the victim: if an attack is committed against a German national regardless of whether the crime is punishable in the country where it was committed. Similarly, in Belgium, a crime against a Belgian national falls under the jurisdiction if the act is punishable in the country where it was committed. In the United States, the basic federal cybercrime provision confers jurisdiction to prosecute when the conduct at issue impacts the federal government, that is, where the United States is itself the victim.\nFinally, the protective principle allows states to assert jurisdiction where national security is threatened.

It is, inter alia, defined as a computer that is ‘used in interstate or foreign commerce or communication, including a computer located outside the United States that is used in a manner that affects interstate or foreign commerce or communication of the United States’.\nAs this review suggests, territoriality is not the only approach to determining jurisdiction over private cyberattacks. Different domestic legal systems follow other approaches, such as focusing on the nationality of the victim or the location of computers used in cyberattacks. More judicial practice could help adopt more cohesive and predictable approaches to jurisdiction over geographically dispersed cyberattacks. Approaches to conflict of laws issues vary widely between states, which requires not only judicial practice but also efforts to harmonise and codify jurisdictional rules on private cyberattacks.\n## 5.4.2 Public Cyberattacks\n### 5.4.2.1 Countermeasures against Public Cyberattacks\nResponses to public cyberattacks are very different from private cyberattacks. States may bring cases before domestic courts, explained in the previous section, but this has limited effectiveness vis-à-vis states, the ultimate perpetrators, due to sovereign immunity. In practice, because of the limited jurisdictional reach against state perpetrators, the target state has to respond to private individuals involved in cyberattacks as if these were private cyberattacks. For example, in 2018, a federal grand jury in the District of Columbia charged thirteen Russian nationals and three Russian entities with violating US criminal laws in order to interfere with US elections and political processes.\nStates can also respond to public cyberattacks in accordance with public international law. The UN Charter guarantees the right of states to self-defence against an armed attack. The Nicaragua case highlighted that for self-defence to be triggered, a state usually has to face physical\n\n Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller, ‘Report on the Investigation into Russian Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election’ Department of Justice, March 2019, 174, available at: www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download (accessed 6 September 2022).\n Article 51 of the UN Charter, 24 October 1945, in force 24 October 1945, 1 UNTS XVI.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009374576.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nRESPONDING TO PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CYBERATTACKS 123\nharm. The case discussed the mining of ports and arming hostile militia by the United States. The judgment does, however, suggest that economic harm (e.g. tariffs and embargoes) may suffice as well if it is particularly serious. It usually takes time to gather and analyse facts related to cyberattacks, which often involve multiple jurisdictions. Therefore, some question whether self-defence can be available as a lawful response to the attack, which may essentially mean that states are effectively precluded from any lawful response, including self-defence, which in turn creates incentives to engage in covert retaliatory cyber operations.\nAs a matter of public international law, state responses should evolve using analogies for countering physical force. States may take non-forcible countermeasures against another state to procure cessation and achieve reparation for the injury. Countermeasures also have a prerequisite of proportionality and necessity. The state relying on them must also request reparation from the perpetrator and its intention to exercise countermeasures. The ILC notes that countermeasures which are reciprocal to the harm are more likely to satisfy proportionality and necessity.\nOne example of such countermeasures is the US response to Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. The US response resulted in not only domestic indictments and prosecutions but comprehensive sanctions on the Russian economy and specific Russian nationals involved in the hybrid attacks and disinformation campaign. State responses must be proportionate and, even in cases of less severe\n Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

It has been argued that, when the cyberattack is not sufficiently serious to invoke a need for self-defence under the UN Charter, states may resort to countermeasures to bring the cyberattack to a halt.\nMoreover, the cyberattack does not have to be attributed to a state, but clear evidence should point to its origin in a particular territory. The argument is that states are obliged under customary and treaty law to prevent the activities of non-state actors from breaching the rights of third states, taking all reasonable means available to them on their territory and even in certain circumstances, extraterritorially.\nThe difficulty with applying traditional public international law is that countermeasures must be directed against the responsible state only, which triggers questions about the determination of the identity of the offenders. The transnational character of offences complicates attributing cyber offences to a specific state. This is particularly the case when the state is hiding behind private actors based in multiple jurisdictions. The existing international law of state responsibility also fails to address the situations in which states systematically direct and support non-state actors based in multiple jurisdictions without putting that actor under its formal leadership or chain of command. Such situations may trigger the need for states to establish due diligence mechanisms to tackle unlawful non-state actors in their territory, including those which cause harm to other states.\nAmerica's Adversaries through Sanctions Act of 2017 (H.R.3364), available at: www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/3364/text (accessed 18 July 2022).\n Generally, Anders Henriksen, 'Lawful State Responses to Low-Level Cyber-Attacks: Current Development' (2015) 84(2) Nordic Journal of International Law 323–351.\n Ibid.\n Generally, Susan Brenner, 'At Light Speed: Attribution and Response to Cybercrime/Terrorism/Warfare' (2007) 97(2) Journal of Criminal Law &amp; Criminology 379–476.\n Ibid.\n Ibid.\n It must be noted that even states which follow similar approaches to cybersecurity have different views about whether cybersecurity due diligence is mandatory as a matter of international law.

Espionage, for example, although considered an unfriendly act, is not unlawful under international law. Following this logic, cyberespionage is also not unlawful under international law. Cyberattacks usually aim at procurement of information or surveillance and seldom cause physical damage. For this reason, it is difficult to distinguish between lawful cyberespionage and an unlawful cyberattack in the absence of conventional force.\nExamples of countermeasures following a state-on-state cyberattack are sparse, but retaliatory threats are not unusual. Recently, NATO leaders reaffirmed that a cyberattack against one of its members can trigger Article 5 of the NATO Convention and constitute an attack on all. Further, they reaffirm that countermeasures to a cyberattack need not be limited to cyberspace. Following the 2014 Sony Hack, North Korea reportedly had its internet infrastructure disabled and lost access to the Internet for some time. This occurred hours after President Obama publicly announced a ‘proportional response’ to the hack on Sony.\nThe International Strategy for Cyber Space adopted by President Barack Obama proclaimed that the United States ‘will respond to hostile acts in cyberspace as we would to any other threat to our country’. It also highlights that ‘all states possess an inherent right to self-defence, and we recognise that certain hostile acts conducted through cyberspace could compel actions under the commitments we have with our military\n International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes ad hoc annulment committee in *Libananco v.

According to the 2018 US Department of Defense Defend Forward strategy, the US ‘will defend forward to disrupt or halt malicious cyber activity at its source, including activity that falls below the level of armed conflict’. The same document highlights the determination to engage in defence forward activities not episodically but to deter malicious cyberactivities and contest it on a ‘day-to-day’ basis.\nAn attack by the United States in 2010 against Iran’s nuclear capabilities resulted in Iran forming a ‘Cyber Defense Command’ under the Joint Staff of the Armed Forces.

Since then, there has been a noted physical escalation of the conflict between Iran, the United States, and its ally Israel, including attacks by special operations forces from both sides. This shows the increasing connection between public cyberattacks and disproportional physical retaliatory measures, perhaps exaggerated by the lack of international standards and clarity of public international law on responses to public cyberattacks. The back-and-forth between Iran and the United States and its allies over the Iranian nuclear enrichment programme underscores the need for a comprehensive re-evaluation of public international law on cyberattacks to prevent a cycle of unchecked aggression and escalation.\nIn a sense, countermeasures against public cyberattacks is still a very much uncharted territory, which lacks enough state practice. There is little doubt, however, that general public international law and attribution should apply in this context and account for the transborder and dispersed nature of cyberattacks.\n## 5.4.2.2 State Responsibility Based on Due Diligence and Strict Liability\nThe difficulty with collecting evidence related to cyberattacks, including on attribution of the conduct of private actors to states to state actors, has led to proposals to adopt due diligence or strict liability approaches to state responsibility. Arguably, a strict liability model also encourages state co-operation by creating potential liability for reparations.\nIn the Corfu Channel case, the International Court of Justice highlighted the generally recognised principle of international law binding upon states ‘not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States’.

The report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security also states that ‘States should not knowingly allow their territory to be used for internationally wrongful acts using ICTs’.\nAccording to Japan, the due diligence obligation may serve as a ground for the responsibility of the state from the territory of which a cyber operation not attributable to any state was conducted. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 seems to contemplate a rule of cyber due diligence: ‘A State must exercise due diligence in not allowing its territory, or territory or cyber infrastructure under its governmental control, to be used for cyber operations that affect the rights of, and produce serious adverse consequences for, other States.’ That prompted some states to view the due diligence obligation primarily as a duty to prevent rather than to prosecute.\nA number of states, including Germany, France, Japan, and Australia, argued for the application of this principle in cyberspace.\n UN General Assembly, ‘Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security’ Note by the Secretary-General, 22 July 2015, UN Doc.

Israel sees the difficulty with the inherently different features of cyberspace – its decentralisation and private characteristics.\nIn other words, although many states advocate for the cybersecurity due diligence obligation, currently it has not yet crystallised into a specific obligation. Asking states to commit to concluding a treaty containing such obligations may prove to be a difficult task as the fragmented regime, in which many states will decide not to commit to this obligation, may penalise the states willing to commit to the due diligence obligation. However, there is little doubt that a due diligence approach offers a more effective way to create incentives for states to combat cyberattacks compared to traditional norms of state responsibility.\n## 5.4.2.3 Jurisdiction over Public Cyberattacks\nThe fundamental concept of territoriality applicable in international dispute resolution stems from sovereignty and should also inform jurisdictional decisions of international courts and tribunals resolving state-to-state disputes. Sovereignty also confers responsibilities, which arguably include the responsibility to protect third states against cyberattacks that would violate international law. Territoriality might assist in determining whether a state is in breach of its cybersecurity due diligence obligations vis-à-vis another state.\n UN General Assembly, ‘Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions on the Subject of How International Law Applies to the Use of Information and Communications Technologies by States Submitted by Participating Governmental Experts in the Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security Established Pursuant to General Assembly Resolution 73/266’, 13 July 2021, UN Doc.

Such an approach can result in blaming multiple states, as cyberattacks are typically highly dispersed. It also does not answer whether one state's failure to exercise its due diligence gives the victim state a right to exercise jurisdiction over a cyberattack committed abroad. Taking anti-cyberattack action by targeting servers abroad might violate other states' sovereignty. State consent is therefore essential to the extraterritorial exercise of jurisdiction. States seem reluctant to prosecute or investigate another state for cybersecurity allegations. The notable exception is the United States, which has commenced domestic proceedings against North Korea that resulted in an indictment.\nPublic cyberattacks orchestrated by states should be dealt by the norms of international public law, as any other state-to-state dispute. 'The Oxford Statement on International Law Protections in Cyberspace', prepared by academics, argues that existing international law concepts should be equally applied to cyberspace. At the moment, specific international law rules dealing with public cyberattacks are almost nonexistent, as are specialised dispute resolution bodies. International courts and tribunals, rather than domestic courts, should have jurisdiction over interstate disputes. Following this logic, state-to-state cyberdisputes should be resolved in the same manner as other state-to-state disputes with institutions such as the ICJ and the Permanent Court of Arbitration playing a leading role.\n Ian Yuying Liu, 'State Responsibility and Cyberattacks: Defining Due Diligence Obligations' (2017) 4 Indonesian Journal of International and Comparative Law 191–260 at 257–258.\n Harriet Moynihan, 'The Application of International Law to State Cyberattacks Sovereignty and Non-Intervention' Chatham House, December 2019, available at: www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/publications/research/2019-11-29-Intl-Law-Cyberattacks.pdf (accessed 18 July 2022).\n United States of America v.

Traditional dispute resolution bodies may also find it difficult to deal with highly technical issues related to attribution and collection of evidence in cyberspace. That undermines the ability of the international community to effectively prevent and respond to cyberattacks. Therefore, the idea of creating a forum to resolve disputes related to cyberattacks, taking into account their public nature, should be seriously considered by states.\n## 5.5 Conclusion\nThe task of conceptualising cyberattacks as public or private is challenging, as it requires evidence-based determinations and making judgements related to the possible involvement of state actors. However, the difference between public and private cyberattacks is crucial as it subjects the attack to different legal regimes. States resort to domestic law solutions to deal with private cyberattacks, including measures allowed under domestic law to deal with criminal activities. In this context, international treaties play a limited role, potentially facilitating co-operation between law enforcement agencies.\nAs states dramatically increase their cybersecurity, public cyberattacks present a particular systemic and existential threat, disrupting multiple organisations and critical infrastructure. The analysis above suggests that the effective application of existing international law to public cyberattacks may require the reassessment of application of the concepts of self-defence and countermeasures in cyberspace. Further development of state practice and *opinio iuris* will help shape uniform approaches and crystallisation of principles of international law.\nThe encouragement of co-operation is the most common norm related to cybersecurity in international treaties. Mutual legal assistance treaties provide a right to request assistance, although the other party might not comply with such requests where it is itself behind the cyberattacks.\n In this respect, the distinction between private and public adjudication should be taken into account in designing such dispute resolution institution. See, generally, Yarik Kryvoi, ‘Private or Public Adjudication? Procedure, Substance and Legitimacy’ (2021) 34(4) Leiden Journal of International Law 681–703.\n Generally, Scott J. Shackelford, ‘From Nuclear War to Net War: Analogizing Cyber Attacks in International Law’ (2009) 27(1) Berkeley Journal of International Law 192–251.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009374576.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nYARIK KRYVOI\nIt also restricts the ability of states to bring any such claims before international courts and tribunals. Instead, states opt for naming and shaming, and framing accusations. There are, however, efforts to include cyberattacks into major international criminal law treaties, most notably the Rome Statute. Talks on this topic at the UN level are currently ongoing.\nAs this chapter has demonstrated, states with similar political regimes tend to co-operate and conclude treaties dealing with cybersecurity (e.g. the Budapest Convention adopted by Western States and the SCO Agreement dominated by China and Russia). Different approaches to cybersecurity and the acceptable level of state interference in matters of cybersecurity also demonstrate the limits of truly global co-operation, as opposed to co-operation between allies. In the absence of specialised treaties of international tribunals dealing with cybersecurity threats, general provisions of public international law should apply.\nInternational courts and tribunals should have jurisdiction over cyberattacks, as such disputes involve states and are governed by public international law. Although a cyberattack-related case has not yet been brought, the ICJ might be a natural forum for such state-to-state claims. Investment tribunals have in the past condemned cyberattacks in their decisions and by excluding evidence obtained by hacking. However, a dedicated international dispute resolution forum with jurisdiction over cyberattack is missing. Although existing public international law should apply equally to public cyberattacks, the novelty of cyberspace creates areas of confusion. Going forward, the international community\n Martha Finnemore and Duncan B.

A recent United Nations report suggested that international human rights law represents an important external reference point for criminalisation and procedural provisions related to cyberattacks.¹ However, this is not necessarily the case for public cyberattacks, which involve state–state relations.\nThis chapter argues that the determination of whether a particular cyberattack is of public or private nature (a cybercrime) should define how states respond to cybersecurity risks. Section 5.3 of this chapter demonstrates that non-state actors motivated by financial gain or ideology perpetrate private cyberattacks, which typically target non-state entities, rather than states (see Section 5.3.1). Such cyberattacks require primarily domestic law responses based on the principle of territoriality and alternative principles.\nStates act as the main perpetrators of public cyberattacks, usually motivated not by financial gain but by political and strategic objectives such as causing harm, interfering with internal political processes or gaining access to sensitive information (see Section 5.3.2). They can\n¹ United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, ‘Comprehensive Study on Cybercrime’ UN Publications, February 2013, available at: www.unodc.org/documents/organized-crime/UNODC_CCPCJ_EG.4_2013/CYBERCRIME_STUDY_210213.pdf (accessed 18 July 2022).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009374576.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nYARIK KRYVOI\nundermine critical infrastructure, national security, the democratic legitimacy of institutions, or political freedoms.\nSection 5.4 of this chapter shows that public cyberattacks require not only domestic law but also international law responses. If the state-sponsored nature of a cyberattack can be established with a degree of certainty, this should trigger the state's rights to self-defence and to respond with countermeasures to procure cessation and achieve reparation for the injury. The difficulty with collecting evidence related to cyberattacks, including on attribution of the conduct of private actors to state actors, has led to proposals to adopt due diligence or strict liability approaches to state responsibility (see Section 5.4.2).\nThe chapter concludes that the effective application of existing international law to public cyberattacks may require the reassessment of application of the concepts of self-defence and countermeasures in cyberspace. It highlights the limits of global treaty-making in the area of cybersecurity and calls for establishment of a dispute resolution body in charge of public cyberattacks, which could develop jurisprudence to assist in the application of existing norms to cyberspace and the development of new, cyberspace-specific, norms.\n## 5.2 Conceptual Framework\nTable 5.1 highlights the differences between private, hybrid, and public cyberattacks, discussed in more detail in subsequent sections. It shows that despite commonalities, public and private cyberattacks are governed by separate legal regimes, have different motivations, and vary in severity. Hybrid cyberattacks blur the distinction between the two – and while they appear as private attacks, they are in fact public. The rest of the chapter examines different aspects of the distinction between private and public cyberattacks and responses to them.\n## 5.3 The Nature and Legal Regimes of Private and Public Cyberattacks\n### 5.3.1 Private Cyberattacks\n#### 5.3.1.1 Nature of Private Cyberattacks\nCyberspace creates a fertile environment for criminal activities, as it allows perpetrators to pose security threats or engage in money laundering or data theft, or facilitate corruption across borders without leaving\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009374576.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTable 5.1 Key features of private and public cyberattacks\n|   | Private cyberattacks (cybercrimes) | Public cyberattacks  |   |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|   |   |  Hybrid cyberattacks | Direct cyberattacks  |\n|  Perpetrator | Non-state actors | Non-state and state actors | States  |\n|  Motivation | Usually, financially or ideologically motivated. Private cyberattacks often have an ulterior motive (obtain profit, strike fear or send a message), rather than merely cause damage for other reasons | A mix of financial, ideological, political motivation, and possibility of for-profit motivations | Mainly politically motivated, to cause damage or gain access to sensitive information  |\n|  Targets and severity of impact | Varies from small to large targets but usually targets other non-state entities, rather than states with varying severity of impact | Varies from small targets to large targets with severe impact | Highly severe. Public cyberattacks most often target other states but may also be aimed at non-state actors. They can undermine critical infrastructure, national security, democratic legitimacy and institutions, or political freedoms  |\n|  Dominant applicable law | Domestic law | Domestic and international law | International law  |\n|  Typical forms | • Ransomware attacks • Personal data leaks • Cyberterrorism • Malware hacking • Online child sexual exploitation • Cyber-enabled crimes | Can take the forms of private and public cyberattacks | • Election hacking • Cyberattacks on state digital infrastructure • Cyberattacks on foreign military targets • Cyberespionage  |\n|  Responses | In accordance with domestic laws: • Domestic administrative and criminal law countermeasures | In accordance with domestic and public international law, including: • Self-defence • Proportionate and necessary countermeasures • Domestic proceedings  |   |\nYARIK KRYVOI\ntheir homes.² Criminals, extremists, and terrorists can exploit such new technologies, which allow them to pursue illicit activities or spread radical ideologies internationally from safe havens, thus circumventing traditional domestic legal systems and law enforcement measures.³\nSome even labelled the cybercrime economy as the ‘Web of Profit’, with a variety of criminal activities, generating revenues from illicit online markets, IP and trade secret theft, and data crimeware and ransomware.⁴ According to some estimates, cybercrime revenues annually reach around US$1.5 trillion.⁵ Cyberattacks can also cause significant disruption and lead to very high costs – for example, some estimates suggest that potential cost of the 2017 WannaCry attack was US$4 billion.⁶\nPrivate cyberattacks emanate from private individuals or groups usually motivated by gaining profit (e.g. ransom attacks) or ideological reasons (e.g. propaganda of terrorism). Private actors may engage in personal data leaks, economic crimes, terrorism, and sexual offences. With a few exceptions, normally such crimes do not rise to the level of posing a threat to national security since profit is the primary motivation of private cyberattacks.\nIt must be noted that the same cyberattacks can be perpetrated by either private or public actors. This includes hacking and illegal access, data or ID theft, cyber sabotage, spreading viruses, and distributing worms, spyware, and logic bombs. The United Nations Manual on Computer-related Crime includes fraud as well as forgery in its list of cybercrimes.⁷ What matters for the determination of public or private nature of cyberattacks is whether the ultimate perpetrator is a public or a private actor.\n² Ibid.\n³ See, for example, European Commission, ‘Reflection Paper on Harnessing Globalisation’ (2017) EU Publications 12–13, available at: https://commission.europa.eu/publications/reflection-paper-harnessing-globalisation_en (accessed 6 September 2022).\n⁴ Michael McGuire, ‘Nation States, Cyberconflict and the Web of Profit’ (2021) HP Development Company, available at: https://threatresearch.ext.hp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/hp-bps-web-of-profit-report_APR_2021.pdf (accessed 6 September 2022).\n⁵ Ibid., 20.\n⁶ Jonathan Berr, “WannaCry” Ransomware Attack Losses Could Reach $4 billion’ CBS News, 16 May 2017, available at: www.cbsnews.com/news/wannacry-ransomware-attacks-wannacry-virus-losses/ (accessed 6 September 2022).\n⁷ United Nations, United Nations Manual on the Prevention and Control of Computer-Related Crime (New York: United Nations, 1994), available at: www.unodc.org/pdf/Manual_ComputerRelatedCrime.PDF (accessed 6 September 2022).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009374576.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nRESPONDING TO PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CYBERATTACKS 107\nAn example of a private cyberattack is the 2013 attack on the US web services provider Yahoo, which led to the loss of one billion users' data.⁸ In another incident, hackers gained access to the personal data of 100 million users of a major Australian tech company.⁹ One can think of situations in which private cyberattacks may go beyond causing damage to particular organisations and individuals and pose a threat to critical infrastructure (e.g. hospitals, electricity, or military facilities). For example, the 2021 Colonial Pipeline Hack in the United States was carried out by a private group seeking ransom, who disabled thousands of miles of US energy infrastructure for nearly a week.¹⁰ A cyberattack against a US water treatment facility in Florida, which temporarily increased the levels of chemicals in drinking water, was also likely caused by a private hacker.¹¹\nTo sum up, non-state actors commit private cyberattacks, most of which aim at financial gain but can also be motivated by ideological reasons. Such cyberattacks usually do not raise to the level of causing national security threats, although the largest ones may do so.\n## 5.3.1.2 Legal Norms to Tackle Private Cyberattacks\nDomestic rather than international law plays a key role in preventing and responding to private cyberattacks.

Its signatories also include states from outside of the Council of Europe such as the United States, Australia, Japan, and Nigeria but nonetheless, most of its signatories are Western states.¹⁴ This convention influenced similar approaches to regulating cybercrimes in state parties of the Convention.\nFor example, in the United Kingdom, legal guidance broadens the scope of existing crimes such as fraud or sexual offences to cyberspace.¹⁵ The UK Computer Misuse Act 1990 relates to offences or attacks directly against computer systems and has been amended multiple times since its passing.¹⁶ English courts take jurisdiction where such crimes substantially relate to English laws or interests.¹⁷ Similarly, Germany, which adopted the IT Security Act of 2015, broadened the scope of existing offences to cyberspace and added many cybercrimes such as hacking and identity theft into its Criminal Code.¹⁸ The United States has no dedicated cybercrime legislation and instead amends existing statutes to apply to cyberspace.¹⁹\nAs explained in more detail in Chapter 4 of this book, Russia has been critical of the Budapest Convention, arguing that it endangers national sovereignty, particularly on the provisions dealing with transborder\n¹³ McConnell International, ‘Cyber Crime . . . and Punishment?

The SCO Agreement does not attempt to harmonise domestic legislation but instead focuses on co-operation between states, information exchange, and joint cybersecurity threat evaluation.\n²⁰ T.

In contrast to the United States legal system which applies existing criminal offences to cyberspace, the Vietnam law also defines specific cybercrimes, such as obstructing cyberspace or attempting to or successfully attacking or neutralising cybersecurity defence measures.\nThis review suggests that regulation on the international level remains scarce and domestic legislation, the primary instrument which applies to private cyberattacks, significantly varies from one jurisdiction to another. The contrasts between the above-discussed Vietnamese and US cybersecurity regimes underscore the need for cross-jurisdictional co-operation and harmonisation, as cybercrimes are often international in nature.\nInternational agreements, such as the 2001 Budapest Convention, clearly target private cyberthreats and aim primarily at co-ordinating the efforts of states and ironing out differences in domestic law. The convention's preamble refers to the need to secure a balance between the interests of law enforcement and respect for fundamental rights, protection of personal data, and co-operation in the penal field. However, most international law instruments remain silent on harmonisation and the need to protect fundamental rights in response to private cyberthreats.\n## 5.3.2 Public Cyberattacks\n### 5.3.2.1 Nature of Public Cyberattacks\nA recent study identified over 200 cybersecurity incidents connected to nation-states over the last eleven years. States are increasing their spending on cybersecurity. For example, the United States in 2021 increased it by 14 per cent. China adopted a programme to grow its cybersecurity\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009374576.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nRESPONDING TO PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CYBERATTACKS 111\nindustry by 15 per cent annually in 2021–2023.²⁹ Russia plans to increase spending on cybersecurity in 2022 and 2023 by 800 per cent in a dedicated federal project on information cybersecurity.³⁰ This demonstrates an increased strategic interest in cybersecurity and significant funds invested in the capacity to launch new kinds of cyberattacks.\nState actors perpetrate public cyberattacks either directly or through affiliated private entities. Such cyberattacks may involve undermining political institutions and media, interfering with critical financial or military infrastructure, or merely stealing personal data. Although less frequent than private cyberattacks, the sophistication of public cyber-threats and the political sensitivity of such cases make responding to them difficult. Moreover, cyberattacks emanating from state actors usually pose a greater threat to national security.\nStates seldom openly engage in cyberattacks through official government entities and avoid admitting to such conduct. Consequently, the distinction between private and public cyberattacks is not always clear-cut, as hybrid cyberattacks involving co-operation between state and private actors become increasingly frequent. Many states increasingly deploy the tools and techniques used by private actors, and some recruit them to act as proxies in their interest.\nFor example, several recent attacks of which Russia is accused could be regarded as hybrid cyberattacks. For example, in May 2021 Russian-based hackers, with suspected links to the state, attacked over 150 different government agencies and human rights groups in the United States and other countries.³¹ In June 2021, Russian hackers (meaning Russian nationals) conducted ransomware attacks against one of the largest American meat processors. The US government has accused the Russian state of instigating these attacks.³² Germany recently accused Russia of illegally targeting its politicians with ‘phishing’ emails to gain\n²⁹ Xiong Xinyi and Zhang Hongpei, ‘China Launches 3-year Draft Plan for Cybersecurity Sector after Regulatory Actions’ Global Times, 12 July 2021, available at: www.globaltimes.cn/page/202107/1228461.shtml (accessed 6 September 2022).\n³⁰ Anna Ustinova, ‘It’s about the Cipher: Spending on Information Security in Russia Will Increase Eightfold’ IZ, 2 October 2020, available at: https://iz.ru/1068209/anna-ustinova/delo-v-shifre-traty-na-informbezopasnost-v-rossii-uvelichat-v-vosem-raz (accessed 6 September 2022).\n³¹ BBC News, ‘Russian Hackers Target Aid Groups in New Cyber-Attack, Says Microsoft’ BBC, 28 May 2021, available at: www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-57280510 (accessed 18 July 2022).\n³² Tom Polansek, ‘JBS Meat Plants Reopen as White House Blames Russia-linked Group over Hack’ Reuters, 3 June 2021, available at: www.reuters.com/world/us/russia-linked-\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009374576.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nYARIK KRYVOI\naccess to personal details to influence elections.³³ The Russian state was also accused of conducting global campaigns to compromise enterprise and cloud environments in various countries, switching off electric power stations abroad, hacking electoral authorities, and creating some of the world's most destructive computer viruses and refusing to co-operate in investigating such attacks.³⁴\nMost public cyberattacks are clearly politically motivated. For example, in 2014, North Korea was blamed for an attack on Sony following the release of the film The Interview.³⁵ In 2007, Estonia, one of Europe's smaller states, faced an attack by bots originating from almost 180 different countries, which was widely believed to be orchestrated by Russia. Russia also launched a cyberattack on Georgia in 2008,³⁶ which supplemented the conventional phase of Russia–Georgia war. Geopolitically motivated cybersecurity threats can also target elections, such as Russian interference in the 2016 US election.³⁷\nState actors may also be involved in cyberattacks for financial gain.

Essentially, they are public cyberattacks and the difficulty lies in attribution. Attribution of cyberattacks to a state presents complex factual and legal questions, which eventually determine whether such an attack can be regarded as private or public. This chapter deals primarily with issues of legal attribution, which is different from technical attribution (a factual and technical investigation) and political attribution (a policy decision attributing an attack to an actor without necessarily attaching legal consequences such as countermeasures).\nIn accordance with the International Law Commission (ILC) Articles on State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts,⁴¹ cyberattacks can be attributed to a state if they were conducted by organs of a state⁴² or if the conduct was directed or controlled by a state.⁴³ If the state-sponsored nature of the attack can be established with certainty, this may\n³⁸ Katrina Manson, Helen Warrell, and Hannah Murphy, ‘North Koreans Charged in $1.3bn Cyber-Hack Spree’ Financial Times, 18 February 2021, available at: www.ft.com/content/3556c699-8bff-4837-abb1-1ef70d2094d4 (accessed 6 September 2022).\n³⁹ See, for example, Center for Strategic and International Studies, ‘Significant Cyber Incidents’ Center for Strategic and International Studies, available at: www.csis.org/programs/strategic-technologies-program/significant-cyber-incidents (accessed 6 September 2022).\n⁴⁰ Hanna Murphy, ‘Russia-Linked Hackers Target IT Supply Chain with Ransomware’ Financial Times, 4 July 2021, available at: www.ft.com/content/a8e7c9a2-5819-424f-b087-c6f2e8f0c7a1 (accessed 6 September 2022).\n⁴¹ International Law Commission, ‘Commentaries to Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts’, UN GAOR 56th Session, Supp. No. 10, at 43, UN Doc.

Subsequently, the ICJ has rejected the use of the ‘overall control’ test.⁵² Regardless of whether the ‘overall control’ of the ‘effective control’ test applies, the attribution threshold is high and mere state funding or equipping groups will not result in attribution.⁵³\nBecause of difficulties with finding evidence, currently attribution of cyberattacks remains largely political rather than legal. A good example is the already-mentioned US attribution of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. The Obama administration quickly attributed it to Russia,⁵⁴ but a thorough report prepared by the Select Committee on Intelligence on the Russian cyber intrusions came out only in 2020.⁵⁵\nTo sum up, state actors perpetrate public cyberattacks either directly or through affiliated private entities. Most of such attacks are clearly politically motivated. The real difficulty with distinguishing private and public cyberattacks, and their attribution is the scarcity of evidence. Attribution becomes even more complicated if a state entity stands behind attacks seemingly conducted by private entities acting alone and of their own volition.\n## 5.3.2.2 Legal Norms to Tackle Public Cyberattacks\nAs discussed above, international regulations on cyberattacks remain scarce. Moreover, they struggle to adequately respond to the challenge of transboundary cyberattacks, which often involve computers in multiple jurisdictions.\n⁵¹ Prosecutor v.

Russia has been accused of such tactics by granting refuge to convicted foreign ransomware hackers.⁵⁶ The UK National Cyber Security Centre, FBI, and the US Department of Homeland Security called on Russia to cease such activities.⁵⁷ International law does not give a simple answer to whether harbouring individual criminals guilty of cyberattacks attributes that conduct to the state and the scope of the obligation of states under international law to prevent activities of non-state actors breaching the rights of third states.⁵⁸\nThe ILC has suggested that the Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities could apply to cyberattacks, even though this instrument does not explicitly mention cyberattacks.⁵⁹ It applies to activities not prohibited by international law but ones causing transboundary harm⁶⁰ and provides that the state of origin of the harm ‘shall take all appropriate measures to prevent significant transboundary harm or at any event to minimize the risk thereof’.⁶¹ This is known as the obligation of due diligence, regarded as a general principle of international law.⁶² The ICJ in the Corfu Channel case stated: ‘it is every State’s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States’.⁶³\n⁵⁶ See, for example, Department of Justice, ‘Canadian Hacker Who Conspired With and Aided Russian FSB Officers Pleads Guilty’ Department of Justice, 28 November 2017, available at: www.justice.gov/opa/pr/canadian-hacker-who-conspired-and-aided-russian-fsb-officers-pleads-guilty (accessed 18 July 2022); Tim Maurer, ‘Why the Russian Government Turns a Blind Eye to Cybercriminals’ Slate, 2 February 2018, available at: https://slate.com/technology/2018/02/why-the-russian-government-turns-a-blind-eye-to-cybercriminals.html (accessed 18 July 2022).\n⁵⁷ NCSC, ‘Russian State-Sponsored Cyber Actors Targeting Network Infrastructure Devices’ NCSC, 15 April 2018, available at: www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/russian-state-sponsored-cyber-actors-targeting-network-infrastructure-devices (accessed 18 July 2022).\n⁵⁸ Ibid.\n⁵⁹ International Law Commission, ‘Commentaries on Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities’ (2001) 2(2) Yearbook of the International Law Commission 148.\n⁶⁰ Ibid., Article 1.\n⁶¹ Ibid., Article 3.\n⁶² Luke Chircop, ‘A Due Diligence Standard of Attribution in Cyberspace’ (2018) 67 International &amp; Comparative Law Quarterly 643–668 at 649–650; see also Scott J.

The greater the risk, the stronger the obligation for the state to act.⁶⁶\nThe above requirements for due diligence should flexibly consider the technical capacity of the state to engage in due diligence.⁶⁷ Cyberattacks seldom fit with the territorial logic – the criminals might be in one state but remotely conduct their activities through third countries.\nIt also raises the issue of attribution within the meaning of Article 4 (conducted by organs of a state) and Article 8 (conduct was directed or controlled by a state) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts. Following the logic of due diligence, if a state fails to exercise due diligence to prevent transboundary harms’ situation, that would also amount to ‘public cyberattacks’ that trigger state countermeasures as discussed in more detail in Section 5.3.1.\nRegardless of whether the cyberattacks are private or public, states need to be prepared to deal with them proactively, including before admitting investments through foreign direct investment review mechanisms,⁶⁸ by regulating already admitted investments, or by responding to national security breaches as they occur.\n## 5.4 Responding to Cyberattacks\n### 5.4.1 Private Cyberattacks\nBecause not all attacks can be pre-empted, states must also consider how to respond to them. Whether a cyberattack is public or private in nature\n⁶⁴ Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0, 30–50.\n⁶⁵ Ibid.; see also Luke Chircop, ‘A Due Diligence Standard of Attribution in Cyberspace’ (2018) 67 International &amp; Comparative Law Quarterly 643–668 at 650–651.\n⁶⁶ Seabed Mining (Advisory Opinion)  International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, 50 ILM 458, para. 117.\n⁶⁷ Karine Bannelier-Christakis, ‘Cyber Diligence: A Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations?’ (2014) 14 Baltic Yearbook of International Law 23–39 at 30.\n⁶⁸ See Chapter 8 on this point.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009374576.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nYARIK KRYVOI\ndetermines the type of response available in accordance with domestic or international law.\nAs discussed above, private cyberattack regulation in domestic law does not differ greatly from the regulation of any other crime. In fact, cyberattacks are often understood as versions of existing crimes such as fraud or damage to property, committed through or facilitated using cyberspace. For this reason, the primary response to private cyberattacks is traditional criminal proceedings in domestic courts.\n## 5.4.1.1 Countermeasures against Private Cyberattacks\nStates can take countermeasures against private threats in accordance with domestic law. One example is the response to the 2021 ransomware hacking of a US pipeline (Colonial Pipeline Attack).⁶⁹ That private cyberattack on critical domestic infrastructure was launched not for politically motivated offensive or strategic reasons but for pure financial gain. Attackers hacked the pipeline network and demanded ransom to unlock the pipeline. The response was a typical law enforcement activity. The US Department of Justice, using traditional law enforcement agencies (albeit with new, unprecedented integration of cyberspace strategies), seized the bitcoins used to pay the hackers' ransom. Host states may confiscate assets that they see as tools of cyberattacks or expropriate businesses, which pose cyberthreats to the host state. This is in effect no different from police seizing stolen money or assets from thieves or ransom-demanders.\nSimilarly, the group responsible for the Colonial Pipeline Attack had their accounts frozen and stolen bitcoins (used by Colonial to pay their ransom) forcibly recovered by the US Department of Justice.⁷⁰ These examples demonstrate the extension of traditional law enforcement jurisdiction and strategies to cyberspace, even when that 'space' is beyond the traditional physical jurisdiction of the state.\n## 5.4.1.2 Jurisdiction over Private Cyberattacks\n5.4.1.2.1 The Territoriality Approach Since private cyberattacks are governed by domestic law like any other crime, territoriality is the cornerstone jurisdictional principle. It is based on the principle that a\n⁶⁹ Alexander Mallin and Luke Barr, ‘DOJ Seizes Millions in Ransom Paid by Colonial Pipeline’ ABC, 7 June 2021, available at: https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/doj-seizes-millions-ransom-paid-colonial-pipeline/story?id=78135821 (accessed 18 July 2022).\n⁷⁰ Ibid.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009374576.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nRESPONDING TO PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CYBERATTACKS 119\nstate and its organs will have jurisdiction over a crime if it occurred, wholly or in part, in the physical territory of that state. This principle has been enshrined in virtually all domestic criminal laws for centuries.71 It should follow from the territorial jurisdiction principle that if the act occurred, wholly or in part, in the physical territory of the state, it has authority to prosecute and adjudicate such acts. For example, the US government has claimed jurisdiction to prosecute state-sponsored cyberattacks in domestic courts, leading to several indictments.72\nThe application of the territoriality principle may be challenging in the context of cyberattacks, which are usually not physically grounded in one jurisdiction, can affect multiple states, be committed entirely remotely, and routed through several jurisdictions.73 Three challenges complicate asserting jurisdiction over cyberattacks: (a) the international dispersal of illegal activities; (b) jurisdiction may be impossible to assert because conduct may be legal in one jurisdiction but illegal in another, hindering prosecution; and (c) jurisdiction to prosecute may be claimed by several states simultaneously, causing problems with establishing priority between them.74\nFurther, different jurisdictional considerations apply to local cyberattacks and transnational cyberattacks. The former conforms to the traditional model of a crime.75 The latter might pose jurisdictional issues because of its detachment from state territory. However, states can still apply the principle of territoriality and assert jurisdiction over crimes where all or part of the cyberattack occurred in their territory (a ‘substantial effect’ doctrine).76\n71 Cedric Ryngaert, ‘Territorial Jurisdiction over Cross-Frontier Offences: Revisiting a Classic Problem of International Criminal Law’ (2009) 9(1) International Criminal Law Review 187–209 at 187; Manley O.

Instead of searching for the location of the criminal act, states could instead consider the location of the computers themselves. Singapore claims jurisdiction over cyberattacks ‘if, for the offence in question . . . the computer, program or data was in Singapore at the material time’.⁸² Some US states, such as Connecticut, have statutes that confer jurisdiction in cybercrime cases on the fact that some part of the conduct constituting a cybercrime offence impacts a computer located in that state.⁸³ Finally, states always retain jurisdiction over satellites launched from their territory. Since internet access is becoming increasingly dependent on satellites, this jurisdictional link might prove more useful.⁸⁴\nHowever, as this review suggests, the traditional territoriality approach has significant limitations if applied in the context of cyberattacks.\n5.4.1.2.2 Alternatives to the Territoriality Approach Asserting jurisdiction on the basis of the territory principle is particularly ineffective in\n⁷⁷ Article 22 of the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, 23 November 2001, in force 1 July 2004, ETS No. 185 (Budapest Convention).\n⁷⁸ Ibid., Article 22(5).\n⁷⁹ Article 15 of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, 15 November 2000, in force 29 September 2003, UN Doc.

The Budapest Convention requires parties to establish jurisdiction ‘when the offence is committed (...) by one of its nationals, if the offence is punishable under criminal law where it was committed or if the offence is committed outside the territorial jurisdiction of any State’.⁸⁷ Several domestic criminal legal systems contain equivalent provisions.⁸⁸\nFor cyberattacks with the most serious consequences, such as cyberterrorism, some suggest universal jurisdiction could be attached.⁸⁹ Others suggest that violations of human rights or crimes against humanity should also be covered by universal jurisdiction.⁹⁰\nJurisdiction based on the nationality of the target of the cyberattack is another approach adopted in domestic systems. For example, Germany has a very general jurisdiction provision based on the nationality of the victim: if an attack is committed against a German national regardless of whether the crime is punishable in the country where it was committed.⁹¹ Similarly, in Belgium, a crime against a Belgian national falls under the jurisdiction if the act is punishable in the country where it was committed.⁹² In the United States, the basic federal cybercrime provision confers jurisdiction to prosecute when the conduct at issue impacts the federal government, that is, where the United States is itself the victim.⁹³\nFinally, the protective principle allows states to assert jurisdiction where national security is threatened.⁹⁴ The US basic federal computer\n⁸⁵ Jean-Baptiste Maillart, ‘The Limits of Subjective Territorial Jurisdiction in the Context of Cybercrime’ (2018) 19(3) ERA Forum 375–390 at 375.\n⁸⁶ Brenner, ‘Cybercrime Jurisdiction’, 200–206.\n⁸⁷ Article 22(1)(d) of the Budapest Convention.\n⁸⁸ See, for example, Australian Criminal Code Act of 1995 §476.3; StGB.Strafgesetzbuch (German Criminal Code) §7 Nr.

Different domestic legal systems follow other approaches, such as focusing on the nationality of the victim or the location of computers used in cyberattacks. More judicial practice could help adopt more cohesive and predictable approaches to jurisdiction over geographically dispersed cyberattacks. Approaches to conflict of laws issues vary widely between states, which requires not only judicial practice but also efforts to harmonise and codify jurisdictional rules on private cyberattacks.\n## 5.4.2 Public Cyberattacks\n### 5.4.2.1 Countermeasures against Public Cyberattacks\nResponses to public cyberattacks are very different from private cyberattacks. States may bring cases before domestic courts, explained in the previous section, but this has limited effectiveness vis-à-vis states, the ultimate perpetrators, due to sovereign immunity. In practice, because of the limited jurisdictional reach against state perpetrators, the target state has to respond to private individuals involved in cyberattacks as if these were private cyberattacks. For example, in 2018, a federal grand jury in the District of Columbia charged thirteen Russian nationals and three Russian entities with violating US criminal laws in order to interfere with US elections and political processes.⁹⁷\nStates can also respond to public cyberattacks in accordance with public international law. The UN Charter guarantees the right of states to self-defence against an armed attack.⁹⁸ The Nicaragua case highlighted that for self-defence to be triggered, a state usually has to face physical\n⁹⁵ 18 US Code § 1030.\n⁹⁶ 18 US Code § 1030(e)(2)(B).\n⁹⁷ Special Counsel Robert S.

The judgment does, however, suggest that economic harm (e.g. tariffs and embargoes) may suffice as well if it is particularly serious. It usually takes time to gather and analyse facts related to cyberattacks, which often involve multiple jurisdictions. Therefore, some question whether self-defence can be available as a lawful response to the attack, which may essentially mean that states are effectively precluded from any lawful response, including self-defence, which in turn creates incentives to engage in covert retaliatory cyber operations.¹⁰⁰\nAs a matter of public international law, state responses should evolve using analogies for countering physical force. States may take non-forcible countermeasures against another state to procure cessation and achieve reparation for the injury.¹⁰¹ Countermeasures also have a prerequisite of proportionality and necessity.¹⁰² The state relying on them must also request reparation from the perpetrator and its intention to exercise countermeasures.¹⁰³ The ILC notes that countermeasures which are reciprocal to the harm are more likely to satisfy proportionality and necessity.¹⁰⁴\nOne example of such countermeasures is the US response to Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. The US response resulted in not only domestic indictments and prosecutions but comprehensive sanctions on the Russian economy and specific Russian nationals involved in the hybrid attacks and disinformation campaign.¹⁰⁵ State responses must be proportionate and, even in cases of less severe\n⁹⁹ Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

The argument is that states are obliged under customary and treaty law to prevent the activities of non-state actors from breaching the rights of third states, taking all reasonable means available to them on their territory and even in certain circumstances, extraterritorially.¹⁰⁸\nThe difficulty with applying traditional public international law is that countermeasures must be directed against the responsible state only,¹⁰⁹ which triggers questions about the determination of the identity of the offenders. The transnational character of offences complicates attributing cyber offences to a specific state. This is particularly the case when the state is hiding behind private actors based in multiple jurisdictions. The existing international law of state responsibility also fails to address the situations in which states systematically direct and support non-state actors based in multiple jurisdictions without putting that actor under its formal leadership or chain of command.¹¹⁰ Such situations may trigger the need for states to establish due diligence mechanisms to tackle unlawful non-state actors in their territory, including those which cause harm to other states.¹¹¹\nAmerica's Adversaries through Sanctions Act of 2017 (H.R.3364), available at: www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/3364/text (accessed 18 July 2022).\n¹⁰⁶ Generally, Anders Henriksen, 'Lawful State Responses to Low-Level Cyber-Attacks: Current Development' (2015) 84(2) Nordic Journal of International Law 323–351.\n¹⁰⁷ Ibid.\n¹⁰⁸ Generally, Susan Brenner, 'At Light Speed: Attribution and Response to Cybercrime/Terrorism/Warfare' (2007) 97(2) Journal of Criminal Law &amp; Criminology 379–476.\n¹⁰⁹ Ibid.\n¹¹⁰ Ibid.\n¹¹¹ It must be noted that even states which follow similar approaches to cybersecurity have different views about whether cybersecurity due diligence is mandatory as a matter of international law.

Espionage, for example,¹¹² although considered an unfriendly act, is not unlawful under international law.¹¹³ Following this logic, cyberespionage is also not unlawful under international law. Cyberattacks usually aim at procurement of information or surveillance and seldom cause physical damage. For this reason, it is difficult to distinguish between lawful cyberespionage and an unlawful cyberattack in the absence of conventional force.\nExamples of countermeasures following a state-on-state cyberattack are sparse, but retaliatory threats are not unusual.¹¹⁴ Recently, NATO leaders reaffirmed that a cyberattack against one of its members can trigger Article 5 of the NATO Convention and constitute an attack on all. Further, they reaffirm that countermeasures to a cyberattack need not be limited to cyberspace.¹¹⁵ Following the 2014 Sony Hack, North Korea reportedly had its internet infrastructure disabled and lost access to the Internet for some time. This occurred hours after President Obama publicly announced a ‘proportional response’ to the hack on Sony.¹¹⁶\nThe International Strategy for Cyber Space adopted by President Barack Obama proclaimed that the United States ‘will respond to hostile acts in cyberspace as we would to any other threat to our country’.

The back-and-forth between Iran and the United States and its allies over the Iranian nuclear enrichment programme underscores the need for a comprehensive re-evaluation of public international law on cyberattacks to prevent a cycle of unchecked aggression and escalation.\nIn a sense, countermeasures against public cyberattacks is still a very much uncharted territory, which lacks enough state practice. There is little doubt, however, that general public international law and attribution should apply in this context and account for the transborder and dispersed nature of cyberattacks.\n## 5.4.2.2 State Responsibility Based on Due Diligence and Strict Liability\nThe difficulty with collecting evidence related to cyberattacks, including on attribution of the conduct of private actors to states to state actors, has led to proposals to adopt due diligence or strict liability approaches to state responsibility.¹²⁷ Arguably, a strict liability model also encourages state co-operation by creating potential liability for reparations.\nIn the Corfu Channel case, the International Court of Justice highlighted the generally recognised principle of international law binding upon states ‘not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States’.¹²⁸ In other words, the state needs\n¹²⁴ Ronen Bergman, Rick Gladstone, and Farnaz Fassihi, ‘Blackout Hits Iran Nuclear Site in What Appears to Be Israeli Sabotage’ *New York Times*, 11 April 2021, available at: www.nytimes.com/2021/04/11/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-natanz.html (accessed 18 July 2022).\n¹²⁵ Patrick Wintour, ‘Iran to Boost Uranium Enrichment Levels in Wake of Israeli Attack’ *The Guardian*, 13 April 2021, available at: www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/13/natanz-nuclear-site-attack-iran-accuses-israel-of-bad-gamble (accessed 18 July 2022).\n¹²⁶ Sina Azodi and Mohsen Solhdoost, ‘An Escalating Israel-Iran Conflict Could Sink the JCPOA’ *Atlantic Council*, 1 September 2021, available at: www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/iransource/an-escalating-israel-iran-conflict-could-sink-the-jcpoa (accessed 18 July 2022).\n¹²⁷ Generally, James P.

The report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security also states that ‘States should not knowingly allow their territory to be used for internationally wrongful acts using ICTs’.¹²⁹\nAccording to Japan, the due diligence obligation may serve as a ground for the responsibility of the state from the territory of which a cyber operation not attributable to any state was conducted.¹³⁰ The Tallinn Manual 2.0 seems to contemplate a rule of cyber due diligence: ‘A State must exercise due diligence in not allowing its territory, or territory or cyber infrastructure under its governmental control, to be used for cyber operations that affect the rights of, and produce serious adverse consequences for, other States.’¹³¹ That prompted some states to view the due diligence obligation primarily as a duty to prevent rather than to prosecute.¹³²\nA number of states, including Germany,¹³³ France,¹³⁴ Japan,¹³⁵ and Australia,¹³⁶ argued for the application of this principle in cyberspace.\n¹²⁹ UN General Assembly, ‘Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security’ Note by the Secretary-General, 22 July 2015, UN Doc.

Asking states to commit to concluding a treaty containing such obligations may prove to be a difficult task as the fragmented regime, in which many states will decide not to commit to this obligation, may penalise the states willing to commit to the due diligence obligation. However, there is little doubt that a due diligence approach offers a more effective way to create incentives for states to combat cyberattacks compared to traditional norms of state responsibility.\n## 5.4.2.3 Jurisdiction over Public Cyberattacks\nThe fundamental concept of territoriality applicable in international dispute resolution stems from sovereignty¹⁴⁰ and should also inform jurisdictional decisions of international courts and tribunals resolving state-to-state disputes. Sovereignty also confers responsibilities, which arguably include the responsibility to protect third states against cyberattacks that would violate international law.¹⁴¹ Territoriality might assist in determining whether a state is in breach of its cybersecurity due diligence obligations vis-à-vis another state.\n¹³⁷ UN General Assembly, ‘Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions on the Subject of How International Law Applies to the Use of Information and Communications Technologies by States Submitted by Participating Governmental Experts in the Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security Established Pursuant to General Assembly Resolution 73/266’, 13 July 2021, UN Doc.

It also does not answer whether one state's failure to exercise its due diligence gives the victim state a right to exercise jurisdiction over a cyberattack committed abroad. Taking anti-cyberattack action by targeting servers abroad might violate other states' sovereignty. State consent is therefore essential to the extraterritorial exercise of jurisdiction.¹⁴³ States seem reluctant to prosecute or investigate another state for cybersecurity allegations. The notable exception is the United States, which has commenced domestic proceedings against North Korea that resulted in an indictment.¹⁴⁴\nPublic cyberattacks orchestrated by states should be dealt by the norms of international public law, as any other state-to-state dispute. 'The Oxford Statement on International Law Protections in Cyberspace', prepared by academics, argues that existing international law concepts should be equally applied to cyberspace.¹⁴⁵ At the moment, specific international law rules dealing with public cyberattacks are almost nonexistent, as are specialised dispute resolution bodies. International courts and tribunals, rather than domestic courts, should have jurisdiction over interstate disputes. Following this logic, state-to-state cyberdisputes should be resolved in the same manner as other state-to-state disputes with institutions such as the ICJ and the Permanent Court of Arbitration playing a leading role.\n¹⁴² Ian Yuying Liu, 'State Responsibility and Cyberattacks: Defining Due Diligence Obligations' (2017) 4 Indonesian Journal of International and Comparative Law 191–260 at 257–258.\n¹⁴³ Harriet Moynihan, 'The Application of International Law to State Cyberattacks Sovereignty and Non-Intervention' Chatham House, December 2019, available at: www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/publications/research/2019-11-29-Intl-Law-Cyberattacks.pdf (accessed 18 July 2022).\n¹⁴⁴ United States of America v.

Traditional dispute resolution bodies may also find it difficult to deal with highly technical issues related to attribution and collection of evidence in cyberspace. That undermines the ability of the international community to effectively prevent and respond to cyberattacks. Therefore, the idea of creating a forum to resolve disputes related to cyberattacks, taking into account their public nature, should be seriously considered by states.¹⁴⁶\n## 5.5 Conclusion\nThe task of conceptualising cyberattacks as public or private is challenging, as it requires evidence-based determinations and making judgements related to the possible involvement of state actors. However, the difference between public and private cyberattacks is crucial as it subjects the attack to different legal regimes. States resort to domestic law solutions to deal with private cyberattacks, including measures allowed under domestic law to deal with criminal activities. In this context, international treaties play a limited role, potentially facilitating co-operation between law enforcement agencies.\nAs states dramatically increase their cybersecurity, public cyberattacks present a particular systemic and existential threat, disrupting multiple organisations and critical infrastructure. The analysis above suggests that the effective application of existing international law to public cyberattacks may require the reassessment of application of the concepts of self-defence and countermeasures in cyberspace. Further development of state practice and *opinio iuris* will help shape uniform approaches and crystallisation of principles of international law.\nThe encouragement of co-operation is the most common norm related to cybersecurity in international treaties. Mutual legal assistance treaties provide a right to request assistance, although the other party might not comply with such requests where it is itself behind the cyberattacks.¹⁴⁷\n¹⁴⁶ In this respect, the distinction between private and public adjudication should be taken into account in designing such dispute resolution institution. See, generally, Yarik Kryvoi, ‘Private or Public Adjudication? Procedure, Substance and Legitimacy’ (2021) 34(4) Leiden Journal of International Law 681–703.\n¹⁴⁷ Generally, Scott J. Shackelford, ‘From Nuclear War to Net War: Analogizing Cyber Attacks in International Law’ (2009) 27(1) Berkeley Journal of International Law 192–251.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009374576.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nYARIK KRYVOI\nIt also restricts the ability of states to bring any such claims before international courts and tribunals. Instead, states opt for naming and shaming, and framing accusations.¹⁴⁸ There are, however, efforts to include cyberattacks into major international criminal law treaties, most notably the Rome Statute.¹⁴⁹ Talks on this topic at the UN level are currently ongoing.¹⁵⁰\nAs this chapter has demonstrated, states with similar political regimes tend to co-operate and conclude treaties dealing with cybersecurity (e.g. the Budapest Convention adopted by Western States and the SCO Agreement dominated by China and Russia). Different approaches to cybersecurity and the acceptable level of state interference in matters of cybersecurity also demonstrate the limits of truly global co-operation, as opposed to co-operation between allies. In the absence of specialised treaties of international tribunals dealing with cybersecurity threats, general provisions of public international law should apply.\nInternational courts and tribunals should have jurisdiction over cyberattacks, as such disputes involve states and are governed by public international law. Although a cyberattack-related case has not yet been brought, the ICJ might be a natural forum for such state-to-state claims. Investment tribunals have in the past condemned cyberattacks in their decisions and by excluding evidence obtained by hacking.¹⁵¹ However, a dedicated international dispute resolution forum with jurisdiction over cyberattack is missing.¹⁵² Although existing public international law should apply equally to public cyberattacks, the novelty of cyberspace creates areas of confusion. Going forward, the international community\n¹⁴⁸ Martha Finnemore and Duncan B.

A recent United Nations report suggested that international human rights law represents an important external reference point for criminalisation and procedural provisions related to cyberattacks.¹ However, this is not necessarily the case for public cyberattacks, which involve state–state relations.\nThis chapter argues that the determination of whether a particular cyberattack is of public or private nature (a cybercrime) should define how states respond to cybersecurity risks. Section 5.3 of this chapter demonstrates that non-state actors motivated by financial gain or ideology perpetrate private cyberattacks, which typically target non-state entities, rather than states (see Section 5.3.1). Such cyberattacks require primarily domestic law responses based on the principle of territoriality and alternative principles.\nStates act as the main perpetrators of public cyberattacks, usually motivated not by financial gain but by political and strategic objectives such as causing harm, interfering with internal political processes or gaining access to sensitive information (see Section 5.3.2). They can\n¹ United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, ‘Comprehensive Study on Cybercrime’ UN Publications, February 2013, available at: www.unodc.org/documents/organized-crime/UNODC_CCPCJ_EG.4_2013/CYBERCRIME_STUDY_210213.pdf (accessed 18 July 2022).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009374576.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nYARIK KRYVOI\nundermine critical infrastructure, national security, the democratic legitimacy of institutions, or political freedoms.\nSection 5.4 of this chapter shows that public cyberattacks require not only domestic law but also international law responses. If the state-sponsored nature of a cyberattack can be established with a degree of certainty, this should trigger the state's rights to self-defence and to respond with countermeasures to procure cessation and achieve reparation for the injury. The difficulty with collecting evidence related to cyberattacks, including on attribution of the conduct of private actors to state actors, has led to proposals to adopt due diligence or strict liability approaches to state responsibility (see Section 5.4.2).\nThe chapter concludes that the effective application of existing international law to public cyberattacks may require the reassessment of application of the concepts of self-defence and countermeasures in cyberspace. It highlights the limits of global treaty-making in the area of cybersecurity and calls for establishment of a dispute resolution body in charge of public cyberattacks, which could develop jurisprudence to assist in the application of existing norms to cyberspace and the development of new, cyberspace-specific, norms.\n## 5.2 Conceptual Framework\nTable 5.1 highlights the differences between private, hybrid, and public cyberattacks, discussed in more detail in subsequent sections. It shows that despite commonalities, public and private cyberattacks are governed by separate legal regimes, have different motivations, and vary in severity. Hybrid cyberattacks blur the distinction between the two – and while they appear as private attacks, they are in fact public. The rest of the chapter examines different aspects of the distinction between private and public cyberattacks and responses to them.\n## 5.3 The Nature and Legal Regimes of Private and Public Cyberattacks\n### 5.3.1 Private Cyberattacks\n#### 5.3.1.1 Nature of Private Cyberattacks\nCyberspace creates a fertile environment for criminal activities, as it allows perpetrators to pose security threats or engage in money laundering or data theft, or facilitate corruption across borders without leaving\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009374576.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTable 5.1 Key features of private and public cyberattacks\n|   | Private cyberattacks (cybercrimes) | Public cyberattacks  |   |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|   |   |  Hybrid cyberattacks | Direct cyberattacks  |\n|  Perpetrator | Non-state actors | Non-state and state actors | States  |\n|  Motivation | Usually, financially or ideologically motivated. Private cyberattacks often have an ulterior motive (obtain profit, strike fear or send a message), rather than merely cause damage for other reasons | A mix of financial, ideological, political motivation, and possibility of for-profit motivations | Mainly politically motivated, to cause damage or gain access to sensitive information  |\n|  Targets and severity of impact | Varies from small to large targets but usually targets other non-state entities, rather than states with varying severity of impact | Varies from small targets to large targets with severe impact | Highly severe. Public cyberattacks most often target other states but may also be aimed at non-state actors. They can undermine critical infrastructure, national security, democratic legitimacy and institutions, or political freedoms  |\n|  Dominant applicable law | Domestic law | Domestic and international law | International law  |\n|  Typical forms | • Ransomware attacks • Personal data leaks • Cyberterrorism • Malware hacking • Online child sexual exploitation • Cyber-enabled crimes | Can take the forms of private and public cyberattacks | • Election hacking • Cyberattacks on state digital infrastructure • Cyberattacks on foreign military targets • Cyberespionage  |\n|  Responses | In accordance with domestic laws: • Domestic administrative and criminal law countermeasures | In accordance with domestic and public international law, including: • Self-defence • Proportionate and necessary countermeasures • Domestic proceedings  |   |\nYARIK KRYVOI\ntheir homes.² Criminals, extremists, and terrorists can exploit such new technologies, which allow them to pursue illicit activities or spread radical ideologies internationally from safe havens, thus circumventing traditional domestic legal systems and law enforcement measures.³\nSome even labelled the cybercrime economy as the ‘Web of Profit’, with a variety of criminal activities, generating revenues from illicit online markets, IP and trade secret theft, and data crimeware and ransomware.⁴ According to some estimates, cybercrime revenues annually reach around US$1.5 trillion.⁵ Cyberattacks can also cause significant disruption and lead to very high costs – for example, some estimates suggest that potential cost of the 2017 WannaCry attack was US$4 billion.⁶\nPrivate cyberattacks emanate from private individuals or groups usually motivated by gaining profit (e.g. ransom attacks) or ideological reasons (e.g. propaganda of terrorism). Private actors may engage in personal data leaks, economic crimes, terrorism, and sexual offences. With a few exceptions, normally such crimes do not rise to the level of posing a threat to national security since profit is the primary motivation of private cyberattacks.\nIt must be noted that the same cyberattacks can be perpetrated by either private or public actors. This includes hacking and illegal access, data or ID theft, cyber sabotage, spreading viruses, and distributing worms, spyware, and logic bombs. The United Nations Manual on Computer-related Crime includes fraud as well as forgery in its list of cybercrimes.⁷ What matters for the determination of public or private nature of cyberattacks is whether the ultimate perpetrator is a public or a private actor.\n² Ibid.\n³ See, for example, European Commission, ‘Reflection Paper on Harnessing Globalisation’ (2017) EU Publications 12–13, available at: https://commission.europa.eu/publications/reflection-paper-harnessing-globalisation_en (accessed 6 September 2022).\n⁴ Michael McGuire, ‘Nation States, Cyberconflict and the Web of Profit’ (2021) HP Development Company, available at: https://threatresearch.ext.hp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/hp-bps-web-of-profit-report_APR_2021.pdf (accessed 6 September 2022).\n⁵ Ibid., 20.\n⁶ Jonathan Berr, “WannaCry” Ransomware Attack Losses Could Reach $4 billion’ CBS News, 16 May 2017, available at: www.cbsnews.com/news/wannacry-ransomware-attacks-wannacry-virus-losses/ (accessed 6 September 2022).\n⁷ United Nations, United Nations Manual on the Prevention and Control of Computer-Related Crime (New York: United Nations, 1994), available at: www.unodc.org/pdf/Manual_ComputerRelatedCrime.PDF (accessed 6 September 2022).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009374576.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nRESPONDING TO PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CYBERATTACKS 107\nAn example of a private cyberattack is the 2013 attack on the US web services provider Yahoo, which led to the loss of one billion users' data.⁸ In another incident, hackers gained access to the personal data of 100 million users of a major Australian tech company.⁹ One can think of situations in which private cyberattacks may go beyond causing damage to particular organisations and individuals and pose a threat to critical infrastructure (e.g. hospitals, electricity, or military facilities). For example, the 2021 Colonial Pipeline Hack in the United States was carried out by a private group seeking ransom, who disabled thousands of miles of US energy infrastructure for nearly a week.¹⁰ A cyberattack against a US water treatment facility in Florida, which temporarily increased the levels of chemicals in drinking water, was also likely caused by a private hacker.¹¹\nTo sum up, non-state actors commit private cyberattacks, most of which aim at financial gain but can also be motivated by ideological reasons. Such cyberattacks usually do not raise to the level of causing national security threats, although the largest ones may do so.\n## 5.3.1.2 Legal Norms to Tackle Private Cyberattacks\nDomestic rather than international law plays a key role in preventing and responding to private cyberattacks. However, many states, particularly those less economically developed, have neither laws penalising cyberattacks nor the capacity to enforce them.¹² According to a recent survey, less than a third of states have substantially or fully updated their\n⁸ One billion users' data was lost.

Its signatories also include states from outside of the Council of Europe such as the United States, Australia, Japan, and Nigeria but nonetheless, most of its signatories are Western states.¹⁴ This convention influenced similar approaches to regulating cybercrimes in state parties of the Convention.\nFor example, in the United Kingdom, legal guidance broadens the scope of existing crimes such as fraud or sexual offences to cyberspace.¹⁵ The UK Computer Misuse Act 1990 relates to offences or attacks directly against computer systems and has been amended multiple times since its passing.¹⁶ English courts take jurisdiction where such crimes substantially relate to English laws or interests.¹⁷ Similarly, Germany, which adopted the IT Security Act of 2015, broadened the scope of existing offences to cyberspace and added many cybercrimes such as hacking and identity theft into its Criminal Code.¹⁸ The United States has no dedicated cybercrime legislation and instead amends existing statutes to apply to cyberspace.¹⁹\nAs explained in more detail in Chapter 4 of this book, Russia has been critical of the Budapest Convention, arguing that it endangers national sovereignty, particularly on the provisions dealing with transborder\n¹³ McConnell International, ‘Cyber Crime . . . and Punishment?

The SCO Agreement does not attempt to harmonise domestic legislation but instead focuses on co-operation between states, information exchange, and joint cybersecurity threat evaluation.\n²⁰ T.

The contrasts between the above-discussed Vietnamese and US cybersecurity regimes underscore the need for cross-jurisdictional co-operation and harmonisation, as cybercrimes are often international in nature.\nInternational agreements, such as the 2001 Budapest Convention, clearly target private cyberthreats and aim primarily at co-ordinating the efforts of states and ironing out differences in domestic law. The convention's preamble refers to the need to secure a balance between the interests of law enforcement and respect for fundamental rights, protection of personal data, and co-operation in the penal field. However, most international law instruments remain silent on harmonisation and the need to protect fundamental rights in response to private cyberthreats.\n## 5.3.2 Public Cyberattacks\n### 5.3.2.1 Nature of Public Cyberattacks\nA recent study identified over 200 cybersecurity incidents connected to nation-states over the last eleven years.[27] States are increasing their spending on cybersecurity. For example, the United States in 2021 increased it by 14 per cent.[28] China adopted a programme to grow its cybersecurity\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009374576.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nRESPONDING TO PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CYBERATTACKS 111\nindustry by 15 per cent annually in 2021–2023.²⁹ Russia plans to increase spending on cybersecurity in 2022 and 2023 by 800 per cent in a dedicated federal project on information cybersecurity.³⁰ This demonstrates an increased strategic interest in cybersecurity and significant funds invested in the capacity to launch new kinds of cyberattacks.\nState actors perpetrate public cyberattacks either directly or through affiliated private entities. Such cyberattacks may involve undermining political institutions and media, interfering with critical financial or military infrastructure, or merely stealing personal data. Although less frequent than private cyberattacks, the sophistication of public cyber-threats and the political sensitivity of such cases make responding to them difficult. Moreover, cyberattacks emanating from state actors usually pose a greater threat to national security.\nStates seldom openly engage in cyberattacks through official government entities and avoid admitting to such conduct. Consequently, the distinction between private and public cyberattacks is not always clear-cut, as hybrid cyberattacks involving co-operation between state and private actors become increasingly frequent. Many states increasingly deploy the tools and techniques used by private actors, and some recruit them to act as proxies in their interest.\nFor example, several recent attacks of which Russia is accused could be regarded as hybrid cyberattacks. For example, in May 2021 Russian-based hackers, with suspected links to the state, attacked over 150 different government agencies and human rights groups in the United States and other countries.³¹ In June 2021, Russian hackers (meaning Russian nationals) conducted ransomware attacks against one of the largest American meat processors. The US government has accused the Russian state of instigating these attacks.³² Germany recently accused Russia of illegally targeting its politicians with ‘phishing’ emails to gain\n²⁹ Xiong Xinyi and Zhang Hongpei, ‘China Launches 3-year Draft Plan for Cybersecurity Sector after Regulatory Actions’ Global Times, 12 July 2021, available at: www.globaltimes.cn/page/202107/1228461.shtml (accessed 6 September 2022).\n³⁰ Anna Ustinova, ‘It’s about the Cipher: Spending on Information Security in Russia Will Increase Eightfold’ IZ, 2 October 2020, available at: https://iz.ru/1068209/anna-ustinova/delo-v-shifre-traty-na-informbezopasnost-v-rossii-uvelichat-v-vosem-raz (accessed 6 September 2022).\n³¹ BBC News, ‘Russian Hackers Target Aid Groups in New Cyber-Attack, Says Microsoft’ BBC, 28 May 2021, available at: www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-57280510 (accessed 18 July 2022).\n³² Tom Polansek, ‘JBS Meat Plants Reopen as White House Blames Russia-linked Group over Hack’ Reuters, 3 June 2021, available at: www.reuters.com/world/us/russia-linked-\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009374576.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nYARIK KRYVOI\naccess to personal details to influence elections.³³ The Russian state was also accused of conducting global campaigns to compromise enterprise and cloud environments in various countries, switching off electric power stations abroad, hacking electoral authorities, and creating some of the world's most destructive computer viruses and refusing to co-operate in investigating such attacks.³⁴\nMost public cyberattacks are clearly politically motivated. For example, in 2014, North Korea was blamed for an attack on Sony following the release of the film The Interview.³⁵ In 2007, Estonia, one of Europe's smaller states, faced an attack by bots originating from almost 180 different countries, which was widely believed to be orchestrated by Russia. Russia also launched a cyberattack on Georgia in 2008,³⁶ which supplemented the conventional phase of Russia–Georgia war. Geopolitically motivated cybersecurity threats can also target elections, such as Russian interference in the 2016 US election.³⁷\nState actors may also be involved in cyberattacks for financial gain.

Essentially, they are public cyberattacks and the difficulty lies in attribution. Attribution of cyberattacks to a state presents complex factual and legal questions, which eventually determine whether such an attack can be regarded as private or public. This chapter deals primarily with issues of legal attribution, which is different from technical attribution (a factual and technical investigation) and political attribution (a policy decision attributing an attack to an actor without necessarily attaching legal consequences such as countermeasures).\nIn accordance with the International Law Commission (ILC) Articles on State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts,⁴¹ cyberattacks can be attributed to a state if they were conducted by organs of a state⁴² or if the conduct was directed or controlled by a state.⁴³ If the state-sponsored nature of the attack can be established with certainty, this may\n³⁸ Katrina Manson, Helen Warrell, and Hannah Murphy, ‘North Koreans Charged in $1.3bn Cyber-Hack Spree’ Financial Times, 18 February 2021, available at: www.ft.com/content/3556c699-8bff-4837-abb1-1ef70d2094d4 (accessed 6 September 2022).\n³⁹ See, for example, Center for Strategic and International Studies, ‘Significant Cyber Incidents’ Center for Strategic and International Studies, available at: www.csis.org/programs/strategic-technologies-program/significant-cyber-incidents (accessed 6 September 2022).\n⁴⁰ Hanna Murphy, ‘Russia-Linked Hackers Target IT Supply Chain with Ransomware’ Financial Times, 4 July 2021, available at: www.ft.com/content/a8e7c9a2-5819-424f-b087-c6f2e8f0c7a1 (accessed 6 September 2022).\n⁴¹ International Law Commission, ‘Commentaries to Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts’, UN GAOR 56th Session, Supp. No. 10, at 43, UN Doc.

Subsequently, the ICJ has rejected the use of the ‘overall control’ test.⁵² Regardless of whether the ‘overall control’ of the ‘effective control’ test applies, the attribution threshold is high and mere state funding or equipping groups will not result in attribution.⁵³\nBecause of difficulties with finding evidence, currently attribution of cyberattacks remains largely political rather than legal. A good example is the already-mentioned US attribution of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. The Obama administration quickly attributed it to Russia,⁵⁴ but a thorough report prepared by the Select Committee on Intelligence on the Russian cyber intrusions came out only in 2020.⁵⁵\nTo sum up, state actors perpetrate public cyberattacks either directly or through affiliated private entities. Most of such attacks are clearly politically motivated. The real difficulty with distinguishing private and public cyberattacks, and their attribution is the scarcity of evidence. Attribution becomes even more complicated if a state entity stands behind attacks seemingly conducted by private entities acting alone and of their own volition.\n## 5.3.2.2 Legal Norms to Tackle Public Cyberattacks\nAs discussed above, international regulations on cyberattacks remain scarce.

Russia has been accused of such tactics by granting refuge to convicted foreign ransomware hackers.⁵⁶ The UK National Cyber Security Centre, FBI, and the US Department of Homeland Security called on Russia to cease such activities.⁵⁷ International law does not give a simple answer to whether harbouring individual criminals guilty of cyberattacks attributes that conduct to the state and the scope of the obligation of states under international law to prevent activities of non-state actors breaching the rights of third states.⁵⁸\nThe ILC has suggested that the Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities could apply to cyberattacks, even though this instrument does not explicitly mention cyberattacks.⁵⁹ It applies to activities not prohibited by international law but ones causing transboundary harm⁶⁰ and provides that the state of origin of the harm ‘shall take all appropriate measures to prevent significant transboundary harm or at any event to minimize the risk thereof’.⁶¹ This is known as the obligation of due diligence, regarded as a general principle of international law.⁶² The ICJ in the Corfu Channel case stated: ‘it is every State’s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States’.⁶³\n⁵⁶ See, for example, Department of Justice, ‘Canadian Hacker Who Conspired With and Aided Russian FSB Officers Pleads Guilty’ Department of Justice, 28 November 2017, available at: www.justice.gov/opa/pr/canadian-hacker-who-conspired-and-aided-russian-fsb-officers-pleads-guilty (accessed 18 July 2022); Tim Maurer, ‘Why the Russian Government Turns a Blind Eye to Cybercriminals’ Slate, 2 February 2018, available at: https://slate.com/technology/2018/02/why-the-russian-government-turns-a-blind-eye-to-cybercriminals.html (accessed 18 July 2022).\n⁵⁷ NCSC, ‘Russian State-Sponsored Cyber Actors Targeting Network Infrastructure Devices’ NCSC, 15 April 2018, available at: www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/russian-state-sponsored-cyber-actors-targeting-network-infrastructure-devices (accessed 18 July 2022).\n⁵⁸ Ibid.\n⁵⁹ International Law Commission, ‘Commentaries on Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities’ (2001) 2(2) Yearbook of the International Law Commission 148.\n⁶⁰ Ibid., Article 1.\n⁶¹ Ibid., Article 3.\n⁶² Luke Chircop, ‘A Due Diligence Standard of Attribution in Cyberspace’ (2018) 67 International &amp; Comparative Law Quarterly 643–668 at 649–650; see also Scott J.

The greater the risk, the stronger the obligation for the state to act.⁶⁶\nThe above requirements for due diligence should flexibly consider the technical capacity of the state to engage in due diligence.⁶⁷ Cyberattacks seldom fit with the territorial logic – the criminals might be in one state but remotely conduct their activities through third countries.\nIt also raises the issue of attribution within the meaning of Article 4 (conducted by organs of a state) and Article 8 (conduct was directed or controlled by a state) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts. Following the logic of due diligence, if a state fails to exercise due diligence to prevent transboundary harms’ situation, that would also amount to ‘public cyberattacks’ that trigger state countermeasures as discussed in more detail in Section 5.3.1.\nRegardless of whether the cyberattacks are private or public, states need to be prepared to deal with them proactively, including before admitting investments through foreign direct investment review mechanisms,⁶⁸ by regulating already admitted investments, or by responding to national security breaches as they occur.\n## 5.4 Responding to Cyberattacks\n### 5.4.1 Private Cyberattacks\nBecause not all attacks can be pre-empted, states must also consider how to respond to them. Whether a cyberattack is public or private in nature\n⁶⁴ Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0, 30–50.\n⁶⁵ Ibid.; see also Luke Chircop, ‘A Due Diligence Standard of Attribution in Cyberspace’ (2018) 67 International &amp; Comparative Law Quarterly 643–668 at 650–651.\n⁶⁶ Seabed Mining (Advisory Opinion) [2011] International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, 50 ILM 458, para. 117.\n⁶⁷ Karine Bannelier-Christakis, ‘Cyber Diligence: A Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations?’ (2014) 14 Baltic Yearbook of International Law 23–39 at 30.\n⁶⁸ See Chapter 8 on this point.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009374576.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nYARIK KRYVOI\ndetermines the type of response available in accordance with domestic or international law.\nAs discussed above, private cyberattack regulation in domestic law does not differ greatly from the regulation of any other crime. In fact, cyberattacks are often understood as versions of existing crimes such as fraud or damage to property, committed through or facilitated using cyberspace. For this reason, the primary response to private cyberattacks is traditional criminal proceedings in domestic courts.\n## 5.4.1.1 Countermeasures against Private Cyberattacks\nStates can take countermeasures against private threats in accordance with domestic law. One example is the response to the 2021 ransomware hacking of a US pipeline (Colonial Pipeline Attack).⁶⁹ That private cyberattack on critical domestic infrastructure was launched not for politically motivated offensive or strategic reasons but for pure financial gain. Attackers hacked the pipeline network and demanded ransom to unlock the pipeline. The response was a typical law enforcement activity. The US Department of Justice, using traditional law enforcement agencies (albeit with new, unprecedented integration of cyberspace strategies), seized the bitcoins used to pay the hackers' ransom. Host states may confiscate assets that they see as tools of cyberattacks or expropriate businesses, which pose cyberthreats to the host state. This is in effect no different from police seizing stolen money or assets from thieves or ransom-demanders.\nSimilarly, the group responsible for the Colonial Pipeline Attack had their accounts frozen and stolen bitcoins (used by Colonial to pay their ransom) forcibly recovered by the US Department of Justice.⁷⁰ These examples demonstrate the extension of traditional law enforcement jurisdiction and strategies to cyberspace, even when that 'space' is beyond the traditional physical jurisdiction of the state.\n## 5.4.1.2 Jurisdiction over Private Cyberattacks\n5.4.1.2.1 The Territoriality Approach Since private cyberattacks are governed by domestic law like any other crime, territoriality is the cornerstone jurisdictional principle. It is based on the principle that a\n⁶⁹ Alexander Mallin and Luke Barr, ‘DOJ Seizes Millions in Ransom Paid by Colonial Pipeline’ ABC, 7 June 2021, available at: https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/doj-seizes-millions-ransom-paid-colonial-pipeline/story?id=78135821 (accessed 18 July 2022).\n⁷⁰ Ibid.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009374576.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nRESPONDING TO PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CYBERATTACKS 119\nstate and its organs will have jurisdiction over a crime if it occurred, wholly or in part, in the physical territory of that state. This principle has been enshrined in virtually all domestic criminal laws for centuries.71 It should follow from the territorial jurisdiction principle that if the act occurred, wholly or in part, in the physical territory of the state, it has authority to prosecute and adjudicate such acts. For example, the US government has claimed jurisdiction to prosecute state-sponsored cyberattacks in domestic courts, leading to several indictments.72\nThe application of the territoriality principle may be challenging in the context of cyberattacks, which are usually not physically grounded in one jurisdiction, can affect multiple states, be committed entirely remotely, and routed through several jurisdictions.73 Three challenges complicate asserting jurisdiction over cyberattacks: (a) the international dispersal of illegal activities; (b) jurisdiction may be impossible to assert because conduct may be legal in one jurisdiction but illegal in another, hindering prosecution; and (c) jurisdiction to prosecute may be claimed by several states simultaneously, causing problems with establishing priority between them.74\nFurther, different jurisdictional considerations apply to local cyberattacks and transnational cyberattacks. The former conforms to the traditional model of a crime.75 The latter might pose jurisdictional issues because of its detachment from state territory. However, states can still apply the principle of territoriality and assert jurisdiction over crimes where all or part of the cyberattack occurred in their territory (a ‘substantial effect’ doctrine).76\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009374576.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press YARIK KRYVOI The Budapest Convention supports this reading of jurisdiction.⁷⁷ In cases of conflicting jurisdictions, the Convention provides little guidance, merely noting that ‘the Parties involved shall... consult with a view to determining the most appropriate jurisdiction for prosecution’.⁷⁸ The United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime contains language to the same effect.⁷⁹ Another difficulty is that, pursuant to the respect for sovereignty noted above, extradition treaties require ‘double criminality’, that is, the conduct at issue must have been a crime in both countries for extradition to be permissible.⁸⁰ As noted earlier, criminality of cyberattacks is incoherent between jurisdictions, which prevents co-operation on extradition.⁸¹ Reinterpretation of territoriality might solve the issue. Instead of searching for the location of the criminal act, states could instead consider the location of the computers themselves. Singapore claims jurisdiction over cyberattacks ‘if, for the offence in question... the computer, program or data was in Singapore at the material time’.⁸² Some US states, such as Connecticut, have statutes that confer jurisdiction in cybercrime cases on the fact that some part of the conduct constituting a cybercrime offence impacts a computer located in that state.⁸³ Finally, states always retain jurisdiction over satellites launched from their territory. Since internet access is becoming increasingly dependent on satellites, this jurisdictional link might prove more useful.⁸⁴ However, as this review suggests, the traditional territoriality approach has significant limitations if applied in the context of cyberattacks.\n5.4.1.2.2 Alternatives to the Territoriality Approach Asserting jurisdiction on the basis of the territory principle is particularly ineffective in ⁷⁷ Article 22 of the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, 23 November 2001, in force 1 July 2004, ETS No. 185 (Budapest Convention).\n⁷⁸ Ibid., Article 22(5).\n⁷⁹ Article 15 of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, 15 November 2000, in force 29 September 2003, UN Doc.

The Budapest Convention requires parties to establish jurisdiction ‘when the offence is committed (...) by one of its nationals, if the offence is punishable under criminal law where it was committed or if the offence is committed outside the territorial jurisdiction of any State’.⁸⁷ Several domestic criminal legal systems contain equivalent provisions.⁸⁸ For cyberattacks with the most serious consequences, such as cyberterrorism, some suggest universal jurisdiction could be attached.⁸⁹ Others suggest that violations of human rights or crimes against humanity should also be covered by universal jurisdiction.⁹⁰ Jurisdiction based on the nationality of the target of the cyberattack is another approach adopted in domestic systems. For example, Germany has a very general jurisdiction provision based on the nationality of the victim: if an attack is committed against a German national regardless of whether the crime is punishable in the country where it was committed.⁹¹ Similarly, in Belgium, a crime against a Belgian national falls under the jurisdiction if the act is punishable in the country where it was committed.⁹² In the United States, the basic federal cybercrime provision confers jurisdiction to prosecute when the conduct at issue impacts the federal government, that is, where the United States is itself the victim.⁹³ Finally, the protective principle allows states to assert jurisdiction where national security is threatened.⁹⁴ The US basic federal computer ⁸⁵ Jean-Baptiste Maillart, ‘The Limits of Subjective Territorial Jurisdiction in the Context of Cybercrime’ (2018) 19(3) ERA Forum 375–390 at 375.\n⁸⁶ Brenner, ‘Cybercrime Jurisdiction’, 200–206.\n⁸⁷ Article 22(1)(d) of the Budapest Convention.\n⁸⁸ See, for example, Australian Criminal Code Act of 1995 §476.3; StGB.Strafgesetzbuch (German Criminal Code) §7 Nr.

Different domestic legal systems follow other approaches, such as focusing on the nationality of the victim or the location of computers used in cyberattacks. More judicial practice could help adopt more cohesive and predictable approaches to jurisdiction over geographically dispersed cyberattacks. Approaches to conflict of laws issues vary widely between states, which requires not only judicial practice but also efforts to harmonise and codify jurisdictional rules on private cyberattacks.\n## 5.4.2 Public Cyberattacks ### 5.4.2.1 Countermeasures against Public Cyberattacks Responses to public cyberattacks are very different from private cyberattacks. States may bring cases before domestic courts, explained in the previous section, but this has limited effectiveness vis-à-vis states, the ultimate perpetrators, due to sovereign immunity. In practice, because of the limited jurisdictional reach against state perpetrators, the target state has to respond to private individuals involved in cyberattacks as if these were private cyberattacks. For example, in 2018, a federal grand jury in the District of Columbia charged thirteen Russian nationals and three Russian entities with violating US criminal laws in order to interfere with US elections and political processes.⁹⁷ States can also respond to public cyberattacks in accordance with public international law. The UN Charter guarantees the right of states to self-defence against an armed attack.⁹⁸ The Nicaragua case highlighted that for self-defence to be triggered, a state usually has to face physical ⁹⁵ 18 US Code § 1030.\n⁹⁶ 18 US Code § 1030(e)(2)(B).\n⁹⁷ Special Counsel Robert S.

The judgment does, however, suggest that economic harm (e.g. tariffs and embargoes) may suffice as well if it is particularly serious. It usually takes time to gather and analyse facts related to cyberattacks, which often involve multiple jurisdictions. Therefore, some question whether self-defence can be available as a lawful response to the attack, which may essentially mean that states are effectively precluded from any lawful response, including self-defence, which in turn creates incentives to engage in covert retaliatory cyber operations.¹⁰⁰ As a matter of public international law, state responses should evolve using analogies for countering physical force. States may take non-forcible countermeasures against another state to procure cessation and achieve reparation for the injury.¹⁰¹ Countermeasures also have a prerequisite of proportionality and necessity.¹⁰² The state relying on them must also request reparation from the perpetrator and its intention to exercise countermeasures.¹⁰³ The ILC notes that countermeasures which are reciprocal to the harm are more likely to satisfy proportionality and necessity.¹⁰⁴ One example of such countermeasures is the US response to Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. The US response resulted in not only domestic indictments and prosecutions but comprehensive sanctions on the Russian economy and specific Russian nationals involved in the hybrid attacks and disinformation campaign.¹⁰⁵ State responses must be proportionate and, even in cases of less severe ⁹⁹ Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

The argument is that states are obliged under customary and treaty law to prevent the activities of non-state actors from breaching the rights of third states, taking all reasonable means available to them on their territory and even in certain circumstances, extraterritorially.¹⁰⁸ The difficulty with applying traditional public international law is that countermeasures must be directed against the responsible state only,¹⁰⁹ which triggers questions about the determination of the identity of the offenders. The transnational character of offences complicates attributing cyber offences to a specific state. This is particularly the case when the state is hiding behind private actors based in multiple jurisdictions. The existing international law of state responsibility also fails to address the situations in which states systematically direct and support non-state actors based in multiple jurisdictions without putting that actor under its formal leadership or chain of command.¹¹⁰ Such situations may trigger the need for states to establish due diligence mechanisms to tackle unlawful non-state actors in their territory, including those which cause harm to other states.¹¹¹ America's Adversaries through Sanctions Act of 2017 (H.R.3364), available at: www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/3364/text (accessed 18 July 2022).\n¹⁰⁶ Generally, Anders Henriksen, 'Lawful State Responses to Low-Level Cyber-Attacks: Current Development' (2015) 84(2) Nordic Journal of International Law 323–351.\n¹⁰⁷ Ibid.\n¹⁰⁸ Generally, Susan Brenner, 'At Light Speed: Attribution and Response to Cybercrime/Terrorism/Warfare' (2007) 97(2) Journal of Criminal Law &amp; Criminology 379–476.\n¹⁰⁹ Ibid.\n¹¹⁰ Ibid.\n¹¹¹ It must be noted that even states which follow similar approaches to cybersecurity have different views about whether cybersecurity due diligence is mandatory as a matter of international law.

Espionage, for example,¹¹² although considered an unfriendly act, is not unlawful under international law.¹¹³ Following this logic, cyberespionage is also not unlawful under international law. Cyberattacks usually aim at procurement of information or surveillance and seldom cause physical damage. For this reason, it is difficult to distinguish between lawful cyberespionage and an unlawful cyberattack in the absence of conventional force.\nExamples of countermeasures following a state-on-state cyberattack are sparse, but retaliatory threats are not unusual.¹¹⁴ Recently, NATO leaders reaffirmed that a cyberattack against one of its members can trigger Article 5 of the NATO Convention and constitute an attack on all. Further, they reaffirm that countermeasures to a cyberattack need not be limited to cyberspace.¹¹⁵ Following the 2014 Sony Hack, North Korea reportedly had its internet infrastructure disabled and lost access to the Internet for some time. This occurred hours after President Obama publicly announced a ‘proportional response’ to the hack on Sony.¹¹⁶ The International Strategy for Cyber Space adopted by President Barack Obama proclaimed that the United States ‘will respond to hostile acts in cyberspace as we would to any other threat to our country’. It also highlights that ‘all states possess an inherent right to self-defence, and we recognise that certain hostile acts conducted through cyberspace could compel actions under the commitments we have with our military ¹¹² International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes ad hoc annulment committee in *Libananco v.

The back-and-forth between Iran and the United States and its allies over the Iranian nuclear enrichment programme underscores the need for a comprehensive re-evaluation of public international law on cyberattacks to prevent a cycle of unchecked aggression and escalation.\nIn a sense, countermeasures against public cyberattacks is still a very much uncharted territory, which lacks enough state practice. There is little doubt, however, that general public international law and attribution should apply in this context and account for the transborder and dispersed nature of cyberattacks.\n## 5.4.2.2 State Responsibility Based on Due Diligence and Strict Liability The difficulty with collecting evidence related to cyberattacks, including on attribution of the conduct of private actors to states to state actors, has led to proposals to adopt due diligence or strict liability approaches to state responsibility.¹²⁷ Arguably, a strict liability model also encourages state co-operation by creating potential liability for reparations.\nIn the Corfu Channel case, the International Court of Justice highlighted the generally recognised principle of international law binding upon states ‘not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States’.¹²⁸ In other words, the state needs ¹²⁴ Ronen Bergman, Rick Gladstone, and Farnaz Fassihi, ‘Blackout Hits Iran Nuclear Site in What Appears to Be Israeli Sabotage’ *New York Times*, 11 April 2021, available at: www.nytimes.com/2021/04/11/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-natanz.html (accessed 18 July 2022).\n¹²⁵ Patrick Wintour, ‘Iran to Boost Uranium Enrichment Levels in Wake of Israeli Attack’ *The Guardian*, 13 April 2021, available at: www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/13/natanz-nuclear-site-attack-iran-accuses-israel-of-bad-gamble (accessed 18 July 2022).\n¹²⁶ Sina Azodi and Mohsen Solhdoost, ‘An Escalating Israel-Iran Conflict Could Sink the JCPOA’ *Atlantic Council*, 1 September 2021, available at: www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/iransource/an-escalating-israel-iran-conflict-could-sink-the-jcpoa (accessed 18 July 2022).\n¹²⁷ Generally, James P.

The report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security also states that ‘States should not knowingly allow their territory to be used for internationally wrongful acts using ICTs’.¹²⁹ According to Japan, the due diligence obligation may serve as a ground for the responsibility of the state from the territory of which a cyber operation not attributable to any state was conducted.¹³⁰ The Tallinn Manual 2.0 seems to contemplate a rule of cyber due diligence: ‘A State must exercise due diligence in not allowing its territory, or territory or cyber infrastructure under its governmental control, to be used for cyber operations that affect the rights of, and produce serious adverse consequences for, other States.’¹³¹ That prompted some states to view the due diligence obligation primarily as a duty to prevent rather than to prosecute.¹³² A number of states, including Germany,¹³³ France,¹³⁴ Japan,¹³⁵ and Australia,¹³⁶ argued for the application of this principle in cyberspace.\n¹²⁹ UN General Assembly, ‘Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security’ Note by the Secretary-General, 22 July 2015, UN Doc.

Israel sees the difficulty with the inherently different features of cyberspace – its decentralisation and private characteristics.¹³⁹ In other words, although many states advocate for the cybersecurity due diligence obligation, currently it has not yet crystallised into a specific obligation. Asking states to commit to concluding a treaty containing such obligations may prove to be a difficult task as the fragmented regime, in which many states will decide not to commit to this obligation, may penalise the states willing to commit to the due diligence obligation. However, there is little doubt that a due diligence approach offers a more effective way to create incentives for states to combat cyberattacks compared to traditional norms of state responsibility.\n## 5.4.2.3 Jurisdiction over Public Cyberattacks The fundamental concept of territoriality applicable in international dispute resolution stems from sovereignty¹⁴⁰ and should also inform jurisdictional decisions of international courts and tribunals resolving state-to-state disputes. Sovereignty also confers responsibilities, which arguably include the responsibility to protect third states against cyberattacks that would violate international law.¹⁴¹ Territoriality might assist in determining whether a state is in breach of its cybersecurity due diligence obligations vis-à-vis another state.\n¹³⁷ UN General Assembly, ‘Official Compendium of Voluntary National Contributions on the Subject of How International Law Applies to the Use of Information and Communications Technologies by States Submitted by Participating Governmental Experts in the Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security Established Pursuant to General Assembly Resolution 73/266’, 13 July 2021, UN Doc.

It also does not answer whether one state's failure to exercise its due diligence gives the victim state a right to exercise jurisdiction over a cyberattack committed abroad. Taking anti-cyberattack action by targeting servers abroad might violate other states' sovereignty. State consent is therefore essential to the extraterritorial exercise of jurisdiction.¹⁴³ States seem reluctant to prosecute or investigate another state for cybersecurity allegations. The notable exception is the United States, which has commenced domestic proceedings against North Korea that resulted in an indictment.¹⁴⁴ Public cyberattacks orchestrated by states should be dealt by the norms of international public law, as any other state-to-state dispute. 'The Oxford Statement on International Law Protections in Cyberspace', prepared by academics, argues that existing international law concepts should be equally applied to cyberspace.¹⁴⁵ At the moment, specific international law rules dealing with public cyberattacks are almost nonexistent, as are specialised dispute resolution bodies. International courts and tribunals, rather than domestic courts, should have jurisdiction over interstate disputes. Following this logic, state-to-state cyberdisputes should be resolved in the same manner as other state-to-state disputes with institutions such as the ICJ and the Permanent Court of Arbitration playing a leading role.\n¹⁴² Ian Yuying Liu, 'State Responsibility and Cyberattacks: Defining Due Diligence Obligations' (2017) 4 Indonesian Journal of International and Comparative Law 191–260 at 257–258.\n¹⁴³ Harriet Moynihan, 'The Application of International Law to State Cyberattacks Sovereignty and Non-Intervention' Chatham House, December 2019, available at: www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/publications/research/2019-11-29-Intl-Law-Cyberattacks.pdf (accessed 18 July 2022).\n¹⁴⁴ United States of America v.

Traditional dispute resolution bodies may also find it difficult to deal with highly technical issues related to attribution and collection of evidence in cyberspace. That undermines the ability of the international community to effectively prevent and respond to cyberattacks. Therefore, the idea of creating a forum to resolve disputes related to cyberattacks, taking into account their public nature, should be seriously considered by states.¹⁴⁶ ## 5.5 Conclusion The task of conceptualising cyberattacks as public or private is challenging, as it requires evidence-based determinations and making judgements related to the possible involvement of state actors. However, the difference between public and private cyberattacks is crucial as it subjects the attack to different legal regimes. States resort to domestic law solutions to deal with private cyberattacks, including measures allowed under domestic law to deal with criminal activities. In this context, international treaties play a limited role, potentially facilitating co-operation between law enforcement agencies.\nAs states dramatically increase their cybersecurity, public cyberattacks present a particular systemic and existential threat, disrupting multiple organisations and critical infrastructure. The analysis above suggests that the effective application of existing international law to public cyberattacks may require the reassessment of application of the concepts of self-defence and countermeasures in cyberspace. Further development of state practice and *opinio iuris* will help shape uniform approaches and crystallisation of principles of international law.\nThe encouragement of co-operation is the most common norm related to cybersecurity in international treaties. Mutual legal assistance treaties provide a right to request assistance, although the other party might not comply with such requests where it is itself behind the cyberattacks.¹⁴⁷ ¹⁴⁶ In this respect, the distinction between private and public adjudication should be taken into account in designing such dispute resolution institution.

A recent United Nations report suggested that international human rights law represents an important external reference point for criminalisation and procedural provisions related to cyberattacks.¹ However, this is not necessarily the case for public cyberattacks, which involve state–state relations.\nThis chapter argues that the determination of whether a particular cyberattack is of public or private nature (a cybercrime) should define how states respond to cybersecurity risks. Section 5.3 of this chapter demonstrates that non-state actors motivated by financial gain or ideology perpetrate private cyberattacks, which typically target non-state entities, rather than states (see Section 5.3.1). Such cyberattacks require primarily domestic law responses based on the principle of territoriality and alternative principles.\nStates act as the main perpetrators of public cyberattacks, usually motivated not by financial gain but by political and strategic objectives such as causing harm, interfering with internal political processes or gaining access to sensitive information (see Section 5.3.2).

If the state-sponsored nature of a cyberattack can be established with a degree of certainty, this should trigger the state's rights to self-defence and to respond with countermeasures to procure cessation and achieve reparation for the injury. The difficulty with collecting evidence related to cyberattacks, including on attribution of the conduct of private actors to state actors, has led to proposals to adopt due diligence or strict liability approaches to state responsibility (see Section 5.4.2).\nThe chapter concludes that the effective application of existing international law to public cyberattacks may require the reassessment of application of the concepts of self-defence and countermeasures in cyberspace. It highlights the limits of global treaty-making in the area of cybersecurity and calls for establishment of a dispute resolution body in charge of public cyberattacks, which could develop jurisprudence to assist in the application of existing norms to cyberspace and the development of new, cyberspace-specific, norms.\n\n---\n\n## ## 5.5 Conclusion\n\nThe task of conceptualising cyberattacks as public or private is challenging, as it requires evidence-based determinations and making judgements related to the possible involvement of state actors. However, the difference between public and private cyberattacks is crucial as it subjects the attack to different legal regimes. States resort to domestic law solutions to deal with private cyberattacks, including measures allowed under domestic law to deal with criminal activities. In this context, international treaties play a limited role, potentially facilitating co-operation between law enforcement agencies.\nAs states dramatically increase their cybersecurity, public cyberattacks present a particular systemic and existential threat, disrupting multiple organisations and critical infrastructure. The analysis above suggests that the effective application of existing international law to public cyberattacks may require the reassessment of application of the concepts of self-defence and countermeasures in cyberspace. Further development of state practice and *opinio iuris* will help shape uniform approaches and crystallisation of principles of international law.\nThe encouragement of co-operation is the most common norm related to cybersecurity in international treaties. Mutual legal assistance treaties provide a right to request assistance, although the other party might not comply with such requests where it is itself behind the cyberattacks.¹⁴⁷\n¹⁴⁶ In this respect, the distinction between private and public adjudication should be taken into account in designing such dispute resolution institution.

A recent United Nations report suggested that international human rights law represents an important external reference point for criminalisation and procedural provisions related to cyberattacks.¹ However, this is not necessarily the case for public cyberattacks, which involve state–state relations.\n\nThis chapter argues that the determination of whether a particular cyberattack is of public or private nature (a cybercrime) should define how states respond to cybersecurity risks.

It shows that despite commonalities, public and private cyberattacks are governed by separate legal regimes, have different motivations, and vary in severity. Hybrid cyberattacks blur the distinction between the two – and while they appear as private attacks, they are in fact public. The rest of the chapter examines different aspects of the distinction between private and public cyberattacks and responses to them.\n\n## 5.3 The Nature and Legal Regimes of Private and Public Cyberattacks\n\n### 5.3.1 Private Cyberattacks\n\n#### 5.3.1.1 Nature of Private Cyberattacks\n\nCyberspace creates a fertile environment for criminal activities, as it allows perpetrators to pose security threats or engage in money laundering or data theft, or facilitate corruption across borders without leaving\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009374576.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press",

Private actors may engage in personal data leaks, economic crimes, terrorism, and sexual offences. With a few exceptions, normally such crimes do not rise to the level of posing a threat to national security since profit is the primary motivation of private cyberattacks.\n\nIt must be noted that the same cyberattacks can be perpetrated by either private or public actors. This includes hacking and illegal access, data or ID theft, cyber sabotage, spreading viruses, and distributing worms, spyware, and logic bombs. The United Nations Manual on Computer-related Crime includes fraud as well as forgery in its list of cybercrimes.⁷ What matters for the determination of public or private nature of cyberattacks is whether the ultimate perpetrator is a public or a private actor.\n\n² Ibid.\n³ See, for example, European Commission, ‘Reflection Paper on Harnessing Globalisation’ (2017) EU Publications 12–13, available at: https://commission.europa.eu/publications/reflection-paper-harnessing-globalisation_en (accessed 6 September 2022).\n⁴ Michael McGuire, ‘Nation States, Cyberconflict and the Web of Profit’ (2021) HP Development Company, available at: https://threatresearch.ext.hp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/hp-bps-web-of-profit-report_APR_2021.pdf (accessed 6 September 2022).\n⁵ Ibid., 20.\n⁶ Jonathan Berr, “WannaCry” Ransomware Attack Losses Could Reach $4 billion’ CBS News, 16 May 2017, available at: www.cbsnews.com/news/wannacry-ransomware-attacks-wannacry-virus-losses/ (accessed 6 September 2022).\n⁷ United Nations, United Nations Manual on the Prevention and Control of Computer-Related Crime (New York: United Nations, 1994), available at: www.unodc.org/pdf/Manual_ComputerRelatedCrime.PDF (accessed 6 September 2022).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009374576.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press",
    "RESPONDING TO PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CYBERATTACKS 107\n\nAn example of a private cyberattack is the 2013 attack on the US web services provider Yahoo, which led to the loss of one billion users' data.⁸ In another incident, hackers gained access to the personal data of 100 million users of a major Australian tech company.⁹ One can think of situations in which private cyberattacks may go beyond causing damage to particular organisations and individuals and pose a threat to critical infrastructure (e.g. hospitals, electricity, or military facilities). For example, the 2021 Colonial Pipeline Hack in the United States was carried out by a private group seeking ransom, who disabled thousands of miles of US energy infrastructure for nearly a week.¹⁰ A cyberattack against a US water treatment facility in Florida, which temporarily increased the levels of chemicals in drinking water, was also likely caused by a private hacker.¹¹\n\nTo sum up, non-state actors commit private cyberattacks, most of which aim at financial gain but can also be motivated by ideological reasons. Such cyberattacks usually do not raise to the level of causing national security threats, although the largest ones may do so.\n\n## 5.3.1.2 Legal Norms to Tackle Private Cyberattacks\n\nDomestic rather than international law plays a key role in preventing and responding to private cyberattacks.

Its signatories also include states from outside of the Council of Europe such as the United States, Australia, Japan, and Nigeria but nonetheless, most of its signatories are Western states.¹⁴ This convention influenced similar approaches to regulating cybercrimes in state parties of the Convention.\n\nFor example, in the United Kingdom, legal guidance broadens the scope of existing crimes such as fraud or sexual offences to cyberspace.¹⁵ The UK Computer Misuse Act 1990 relates to offences or attacks directly against computer systems and has been amended multiple times since its passing.¹⁶ English courts take jurisdiction where such crimes substantially relate to English laws or interests.¹⁷ Similarly, Germany, which adopted the IT Security Act of 2015, broadened the scope of existing offences to cyberspace and added many cybercrimes such as hacking and identity theft into its Criminal Code.¹⁸ The United States has no dedicated cybercrime legislation and instead amends existing statutes to apply to cyberspace.¹⁹\n\nAs explained in more detail in Chapter 4 of this book, Russia has been critical of the Budapest Convention, arguing that it endangers national sovereignty, particularly on the provisions dealing with transborder\n\n¹³ McConnell International, ‘Cyber Crime . . . and Punishment?

The SCO Agreement does not attempt to harmonise domestic legislation but instead focuses on co-operation between states, information exchange, and joint cybersecurity threat evaluation.\n\n²⁰ T.

The contrasts between the above-discussed Vietnamese and US cybersecurity regimes underscore the need for cross-jurisdictional co-operation and harmonisation, as cybercrimes are often international in nature.\n\nInternational agreements, such as the 2001 Budapest Convention, clearly target private cyberthreats and aim primarily at co-ordinating the efforts of states and ironing out differences in domestic law. The convention's preamble refers to the need to secure a balance between the interests of law enforcement and respect for fundamental rights, protection of personal data, and co-operation in the penal field. However, most international law instruments remain silent on harmonisation and the need to protect fundamental rights in response to private cyberthreats.\n\n## 5.3.2 Public Cyberattacks\n\n### 5.3.2.1 Nature of Public Cyberattacks\n\nA recent study identified over 200 cybersecurity incidents connected to nation-states over the last eleven years.[27] States are increasing their spending on cybersecurity. For example, the United States in 2021 increased it by 14 per cent.[28] China adopted a programme to grow its cybersecurity\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009374576.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press",

Such cyberattacks may involve undermining political institutions and media, interfering with critical financial or military infrastructure, or merely stealing personal data. Although less frequent than private cyberattacks, the sophistication of public cyber-threats and the political sensitivity of such cases make responding to them difficult. Moreover, cyberattacks emanating from state actors usually pose a greater threat to national security.\n\nStates seldom openly engage in cyberattacks through official government entities and avoid admitting to such conduct. Consequently, the distinction between private and public cyberattacks is not always clear-cut, as hybrid cyberattacks involving co-operation between state and private actors become increasingly frequent. Many states increasingly deploy the tools and techniques used by private actors, and some recruit them to act as proxies in their interest.\n\nFor example, several recent attacks of which Russia is accused could be regarded as hybrid cyberattacks. For example, in May 2021 Russian-based hackers, with suspected links to the state, attacked over 150 different government agencies and human rights groups in the United States and other countries.³¹ In June 2021, Russian hackers (meaning Russian nationals) conducted ransomware attacks against one of the largest American meat processors.

For example, in 2014, North Korea was blamed for an attack on Sony following the release of the film The Interview.³⁵ In 2007, Estonia, one of Europe's smaller states, faced an attack by bots originating from almost 180 different countries, which was widely believed to be orchestrated by Russia.

Geopolitically motivated cybersecurity threats can also target elections, such as Russian interference in the 2016 US election.³⁷\n\nState actors may also be involved in cyberattacks for financial gain.

Essentially, they are public cyberattacks and the difficulty lies in attribution. Attribution of cyberattacks to a state presents complex factual and legal questions, which eventually determine whether such an attack can be regarded as private or public. This chapter deals primarily with issues of legal attribution, which is different from technical attribution (a factual and technical investigation) and political attribution (a policy decision attributing an attack to an actor without necessarily attaching legal consequences such as countermeasures).\n\nIn accordance with the International Law Commission (ILC) Articles on State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts,⁴¹ cyberattacks can be attributed to a state if they were conducted by organs of a state⁴² or if the conduct was directed or controlled by a state.⁴³ If the state-sponsored nature of the attack can be established with certainty, this may\n\n³⁸ Katrina Manson, Helen Warrell, and Hannah Murphy, ‘North Koreans Charged in $1.3bn Cyber-Hack Spree’ Financial Times, 18 February 2021, available at: www.ft.com/content/3556c699-8bff-4837-abb1-1ef70d2094d4 (accessed 6 September 2022).\n\n³⁹ See, for example, Center for Strategic and International Studies, ‘Significant Cyber Incidents’ Center for Strategic and International Studies, available at: www.csis.org/programs/strategic-technologies-program/significant-cyber-incidents (accessed 6 September 2022).\n\n⁴⁰ Hanna Murphy, ‘Russia-Linked Hackers Target IT Supply Chain with Ransomware’ Financial Times, 4 July 2021, available at: www.ft.com/content/a8e7c9a2-5819-424f-b087-c6f2e8f0c7a1 (accessed 6 September 2022).\n\n⁴¹ International Law Commission, ‘Commentaries to Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts’, UN GAOR 56th Session, Supp. No. 10, at 43, UN Doc.

Subsequently, the ICJ has rejected the use of the ‘overall control’ test.⁵² Regardless of whether the ‘overall control’ of the ‘effective control’ test applies, the attribution threshold is high and mere state funding or equipping groups will not result in attribution.⁵³\n\nBecause of difficulties with finding evidence, currently attribution of cyberattacks remains largely political rather than legal. A good example is the already-mentioned US attribution of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. The Obama administration quickly attributed it to Russia,⁵⁴ but a thorough report prepared by the Select Committee on Intelligence on the Russian cyber intrusions came out only in 2020.⁵⁵\n\nTo sum up, state actors perpetrate public cyberattacks either directly or through affiliated private entities. Most of such attacks are clearly politically motivated. The real difficulty with distinguishing private and public cyberattacks, and their attribution is the scarcity of evidence. Attribution becomes even more complicated if a state entity stands behind attacks seemingly conducted by private entities acting alone and of their own volition.\n\n## 5.3.2.2 Legal Norms to Tackle Public Cyberattacks\n\nAs discussed above, international regulations on cyberattacks remain scarce.

    "YARIK KRYVOI\n\nA related challenge is that states might turn a blind eye to cyberattacks and harbour cybercriminals. Russia has been accused of such tactics by granting refuge to convicted foreign ransomware hackers.⁵⁶ The UK National Cyber Security Centre, FBI, and the US Department of Homeland Security called on Russia to cease such activities.⁵⁷ International law does not give a simple answer to whether harbouring individual criminals guilty of cyberattacks attributes that conduct to the state and the scope of the obligation of states under international law to prevent activities of non-state actors breaching the rights of third states.⁵⁸\n\nThe ILC has suggested that the Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities could apply to cyberattacks, even though this instrument does not explicitly mention cyberattacks.⁵⁹ It applies to activities not prohibited by international law but ones causing transboundary harm⁶⁰ and provides that the state of origin of the harm ‘shall take all appropriate measures to prevent significant transboundary harm or at any event to minimize the risk thereof’.⁶¹ This is known as the obligation of due diligence, regarded as a general principle of international law.⁶² The ICJ in the Corfu Channel case stated: ‘it is every State’s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States’.⁶³\n\n⁵⁶ See, for example, Department of Justice, ‘Canadian Hacker Who Conspired With and Aided Russian FSB Officers Pleads Guilty’ Department of Justice, 28 November 2017, available at: www.justice.gov/opa/pr/canadian-hacker-who-conspired-and-aided-russian-fsb-officers-pleads-guilty (accessed 18 July 2022); Tim Maurer, ‘Why the Russian Government Turns a Blind Eye to Cybercriminals’ Slate, 2 February 2018, available at: https://slate.com/technology/2018/02/why-the-russian-government-turns-a-blind-eye-to-cybercriminals.html (accessed 18 July 2022).\n\n⁵⁷ NCSC, ‘Russian State-Sponsored Cyber Actors Targeting Network Infrastructure Devices’ NCSC, 15 April 2018, available at: www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/russian-state-sponsored-cyber-actors-targeting-network-infrastructure-devices (accessed 18 July 2022).\n\n⁵⁸ Ibid.\n\n⁵⁹ International Law Commission, ‘Commentaries on Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities’ (2001) 2(2) Yearbook of the International Law Commission 148.\n\n⁶⁰ Ibid., Article 1.\n\n⁶¹ Ibid., Article 3.\n\n⁶² Luke Chircop, ‘A Due Diligence Standard of Attribution in Cyberspace’ (2018) 67 International &amp; Comparative Law Quarterly 643–668 at 649–650; see also Scott J.

    "RESPONDING TO PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CYBERATTACKS 117\n\nThe Tallinn Manual 2.0, a non-binding list of cybersecurity recommendations from leading academics, contains a similar due diligence obligation applied to cybersecurity.⁶⁴ A state can only breach the due diligence obligation if (a) it had actual or constructive knowledge of the cyberattack launched from its territory, (b) that attack is contrary to the rights of another state, and (c) it failed to take reasonable measures to prevent it.⁶⁵ Furthermore, as the Seabed Mining Advisory Opinion clarifies, the obligation may change in relation to the risk involved in the activity. The greater the risk, the stronger the obligation for the state to act.⁶⁶\n\nThe above requirements for due diligence should flexibly consider the technical capacity of the state to engage in due diligence.⁶⁷ Cyberattacks seldom fit with the territorial logic – the criminals might be in one state but remotely conduct their activities through third countries.\n\nIt also raises the issue of attribution within the meaning of Article 4 (conducted by organs of a state) and Article 8 (conduct was directed or controlled by a state) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts. Following the logic of due diligence, if a state fails to exercise due diligence to prevent transboundary harms’ situation, that would also amount to ‘public cyberattacks’ that trigger state countermeasures as discussed in more detail in Section 5.3.1.\n\nRegardless of whether the cyberattacks are private or public, states need to be prepared to deal with them proactively, including before admitting investments through foreign direct investment review mechanisms,⁶⁸ by regulating already admitted investments, or by responding to national security breaches as they occur.\n\n## 5.4 Responding to Cyberattacks\n\n### 5.4.1 Private Cyberattacks\n\nBecause not all attacks can be pre-empted, states must also consider how to respond to them.

In fact, cyberattacks are often understood as versions of existing crimes such as fraud or damage to property, committed through or facilitated using cyberspace. For this reason, the primary response to private cyberattacks is traditional criminal proceedings in domestic courts.\n\n## 5.4.1.1 Countermeasures against Private Cyberattacks\n\nStates can take countermeasures against private threats in accordance with domestic law. One example is the response to the 2021 ransomware hacking of a US pipeline (Colonial Pipeline Attack).⁶⁹ That private cyberattack on critical domestic infrastructure was launched not for politically motivated offensive or strategic reasons but for pure financial gain. Attackers hacked the pipeline network and demanded ransom to unlock the pipeline. The response was a typical law enforcement activity. The US Department of Justice, using traditional law enforcement agencies (albeit with new, unprecedented integration of cyberspace strategies), seized the bitcoins used to pay the hackers' ransom. Host states may confiscate assets that they see as tools of cyberattacks or expropriate businesses, which pose cyberthreats to the host state. This is in effect no different from police seizing stolen money or assets from thieves or ransom-demanders.\n\nSimilarly, the group responsible for the Colonial Pipeline Attack had their accounts frozen and stolen bitcoins (used by Colonial to pay their ransom) forcibly recovered by the US Department of Justice.⁷⁰ These examples demonstrate the extension of traditional law enforcement jurisdiction and strategies to cyberspace, even when that 'space' is beyond the traditional physical jurisdiction of the state.\n\n## 5.4.1.2 Jurisdiction over Private Cyberattacks\n\n5.4.1.2.1 The Territoriality Approach Since private cyberattacks are governed by domestic law like any other crime, territoriality is the cornerstone jurisdictional principle.

This principle has been enshrined in virtually all domestic criminal laws for centuries.71 It should follow from the territorial jurisdiction principle that if the act occurred, wholly or in part, in the physical territory of the state, it has authority to prosecute and adjudicate such acts. For example, the US government has claimed jurisdiction to prosecute state-sponsored cyberattacks in domestic courts, leading to several indictments.72\n\nThe application of the territoriality principle may be challenging in the context of cyberattacks, which are usually not physically grounded in one jurisdiction, can affect multiple states, be committed entirely remotely, and routed through several jurisdictions.73 Three challenges complicate asserting jurisdiction over cyberattacks: (a) the international dispersal of illegal activities; (b) jurisdiction may be impossible to assert because conduct may be legal in one jurisdiction but illegal in another, hindering prosecution; and (c) jurisdiction to prosecute may be claimed by several states simultaneously, causing problems with establishing priority between them.74\n\nFurther, different jurisdictional considerations apply to local cyberattacks and transnational cyberattacks. The former conforms to the traditional model of a crime.75 The latter might pose jurisdictional issues because of its detachment from state territory. However, states can still apply the principle of territoriality and assert jurisdiction over crimes where all or part of the cyberattack occurred in their territory (a ‘substantial effect’ doctrine).76\n\n71 Cedric Ryngaert, ‘Territorial Jurisdiction over Cross-Frontier Offences: Revisiting a Classic Problem of International Criminal Law’ (2009) 9(1) International Criminal Law Review 187–209 at 187; Manley O.

    "YARIK KRYVOI\n\nThe Budapest Convention supports this reading of jurisdiction.⁷⁷ In cases of conflicting jurisdictions, the Convention provides little guidance, merely noting that ‘the Parties involved shall . . . consult with a view to determining the most appropriate jurisdiction for prosecution’.⁷⁸ The United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime contains language to the same effect.⁷⁹\n\nAnother difficulty is that, pursuant to the respect for sovereignty noted above, extradition treaties require ‘double criminality’, that is, the conduct at issue must have been a crime in both countries for extradition to be permissible.⁸⁰ As noted earlier, criminality of cyberattacks is incoherent between jurisdictions, which prevents co-operation on extradition.⁸¹\n\nReinterpretation of territoriality might solve the issue. Instead of searching for the location of the criminal act, states could instead consider the location of the computers themselves. Singapore claims jurisdiction over cyberattacks ‘if, for the offence in question . . . the computer, program or data was in Singapore at the material time’.⁸² Some US states, such as Connecticut, have statutes that confer jurisdiction in cybercrime cases on the fact that some part of the conduct constituting a cybercrime offence impacts a computer located in that state.⁸³ Finally, states always retain jurisdiction over satellites launched from their territory. Since internet access is becoming increasingly dependent on satellites, this jurisdictional link might prove more useful.⁸⁴\n\nHowever, as this review suggests, the traditional territoriality approach has significant limitations if applied in the context of cyberattacks.\n\n5.4.1.2.2 Alternatives to the Territoriality Approach Asserting jurisdiction on the basis of the territory principle is particularly ineffective in\n\n⁷⁷ Article 22 of the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, 23 November 2001, in force 1 July 2004, ETS No. 185 (Budapest Convention).\n⁷⁸ Ibid., Article 22(5).\n⁷⁹ Article 15 of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, 15 November 2000, in force 29 September 2003, UN Doc.

The Budapest Convention requires parties to establish jurisdiction ‘when the offence is committed (...) by one of its nationals, if the offence is punishable under criminal law where it was committed or if the offence is committed outside the territorial jurisdiction of any State’.⁸⁷ Several domestic criminal legal systems contain equivalent provisions.⁸⁸\n\nFor cyberattacks with the most serious consequences, such as cyberterrorism, some suggest universal jurisdiction could be attached.⁸⁹ Others suggest that violations of human rights or crimes against humanity should also be covered by universal jurisdiction.⁹⁰\n\nJurisdiction based on the nationality of the target of the cyberattack is another approach adopted in domestic systems. For example, Germany has a very general jurisdiction provision based on the nationality of the victim: if an attack is committed against a German national regardless of whether the crime is punishable in the country where it was committed.⁹¹ Similarly, in Belgium, a crime against a Belgian national falls under the jurisdiction if the act is punishable in the country where it was committed.⁹² In the United States, the basic federal cybercrime provision confers jurisdiction to prosecute when the conduct at issue impacts the federal government, that is, where the United States is itself the victim.⁹³\n\nFinally, the protective principle allows states to assert jurisdiction where national security is threatened.⁹⁴ The US basic federal computer\n\n⁸⁵ Jean-Baptiste Maillart, ‘The Limits of Subjective Territorial Jurisdiction in the Context of Cybercrime’ (2018) 19(3) ERA Forum 375–390 at 375.\n⁸⁶ Brenner, ‘Cybercrime Jurisdiction’, 200–206.\n⁸⁷ Article 22(1)(d) of the Budapest Convention.\n⁸⁸ See, for example, Australian Criminal Code Act of 1995 §476.3; StGB.Strafgesetzbuch (German Criminal Code) §7 Nr.

Different domestic legal systems follow other approaches, such as focusing on the nationality of the victim or the location of computers used in cyberattacks. More judicial practice could help adopt more cohesive and predictable approaches to jurisdiction over geographically dispersed cyberattacks. Approaches to conflict of laws issues vary widely between states, which requires not only judicial practice but also efforts to harmonise and codify jurisdictional rules on private cyberattacks.\n\n## 5.4.2 Public Cyberattacks\n\n### 5.4.2.1 Countermeasures against Public Cyberattacks\n\nResponses to public cyberattacks are very different from private cyberattacks. States may bring cases before domestic courts, explained in the previous section, but this has limited effectiveness vis-à-vis states, the ultimate perpetrators, due to sovereign immunity. In practice, because of the limited jurisdictional reach against state perpetrators, the target state has to respond to private individuals involved in cyberattacks as if these were private cyberattacks. For example, in 2018, a federal grand jury in the District of Columbia charged thirteen Russian nationals and three Russian entities with violating US criminal laws in order to interfere with US elections and political processes.⁹⁷\n\nStates can also respond to public cyberattacks in accordance with public international law.

The judgment does, however, suggest that economic harm (e.g. tariffs and embargoes) may suffice as well if it is particularly serious. It usually takes time to gather and analyse facts related to cyberattacks, which often involve multiple jurisdictions. Therefore, some question whether self-defence can be available as a lawful response to the attack, which may essentially mean that states are effectively precluded from any lawful response, including self-defence, which in turn creates incentives to engage in covert retaliatory cyber operations.¹⁰⁰\n\nAs a matter of public international law, state responses should evolve using analogies for countering physical force. States may take non-forcible countermeasures against another state to procure cessation and achieve reparation for the injury.¹⁰¹ Countermeasures also have a prerequisite of proportionality and necessity.¹⁰² The state relying on them must also request reparation from the perpetrator and its intention to exercise countermeasures.¹⁰³ The ILC notes that countermeasures which are reciprocal to the harm are more likely to satisfy proportionality and necessity.¹⁰⁴\n\nOne example of such countermeasures is the US response to Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.

The argument is that states are obliged under customary and treaty law to prevent the activities of non-state actors from breaching the rights of third states, taking all reasonable means available to them on their territory and even in certain circumstances, extraterritorially.¹⁰⁸\n\nThe difficulty with applying traditional public international law is that countermeasures must be directed against the responsible state only,¹⁰⁹ which triggers questions about the determination of the identity of the offenders. The transnational character of offences complicates attributing cyber offences to a specific state. This is particularly the case when the state is hiding behind private actors based in multiple jurisdictions. The existing international law of state responsibility also fails to address the situations in which states systematically direct and support non-state actors based in multiple jurisdictions without putting that actor under its formal leadership or chain of command.¹¹⁰ Such situations may trigger the need for states to establish due diligence mechanisms to tackle unlawful non-state actors in their territory, including those which cause harm to other states.¹¹¹\n\nAmerica's Adversaries through Sanctions Act of 2017 (H.R.3364), available at: www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/3364/text (accessed 18 July 2022).\n\n¹⁰⁶ Generally, Anders Henriksen, 'Lawful State Responses to Low-Level Cyber-Attacks: Current Development' (2015) 84(2) Nordic Journal of International Law 323–351.\n¹⁰⁷ Ibid.\n¹⁰⁸ Generally, Susan Brenner, 'At Light Speed: Attribution and Response to Cybercrime/Terrorism/Warfare' (2007) 97(2) Journal of Criminal Law &amp; Criminology 379–476.\n¹⁰⁹ Ibid.\n¹¹⁰ Ibid.\n¹¹¹ It must be noted that even states which follow similar approaches to cybersecurity have different views about whether cybersecurity due diligence is mandatory as a matter of international law.

Espionage, for example,¹¹² although considered an unfriendly act, is not unlawful under international law.¹¹³ Following this logic, cyberespionage is also not unlawful under international law. Cyberattacks usually aim at procurement of information or surveillance and seldom cause physical damage. For this reason, it is difficult to distinguish between lawful cyberespionage and an unlawful cyberattack in the absence of conventional force.\n\nExamples of countermeasures following a state-on-state cyberattack are sparse, but retaliatory threats are not unusual.¹¹⁴ Recently, NATO leaders reaffirmed that a cyberattack against one of its members can trigger Article 5 of the NATO Convention and constitute an attack on all. Further, they reaffirm that countermeasures to a cyberattack need not be limited to cyberspace.¹¹⁵ Following the 2014 Sony Hack, North Korea reportedly had its internet infrastructure disabled and lost access to the Internet for some time.

It also does not answer whether one state's failure to exercise its due diligence gives the victim state a right to exercise jurisdiction over a cyberattack committed abroad. Taking anti-cyberattack action by targeting servers abroad might violate other states' sovereignty. State consent is therefore essential to the extraterritorial exercise of jurisdiction.¹⁴³ States seem reluctant to prosecute or investigate another state for cybersecurity allegations.

'The Oxford Statement on International Law Protections in Cyberspace', prepared by academics, argues that existing international law concepts should be equally applied to cyberspace.¹⁴⁵ At the moment, specific international law rules dealing with public cyberattacks are almost nonexistent, as are specialised dispute resolution bodies. International courts and tribunals, rather than domestic courts, should have jurisdiction over interstate disputes.

    "RESPONDING TO PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CYBERATTACKS 131\n\nCyberattacks do not fit squarely within public international law concepts, creating various borderline scenarios, particularly around what constitutes permissible responses and jurisdiction. Traditional dispute resolution bodies may also find it difficult to deal with highly technical issues related to attribution and collection of evidence in cyberspace. That undermines the ability of the international community to effectively prevent and respond to cyberattacks. Therefore, the idea of creating a forum to resolve disputes related to cyberattacks, taking into account their public nature, should be seriously considered by states.¹⁴⁶\n\n## 5.5 Conclusion\n\nThe task of conceptualising cyberattacks as public or private is challenging, as it requires evidence-based determinations and making judgements related to the possible involvement of state actors. However, the difference between public and private cyberattacks is crucial as it subjects the attack to different legal regimes. States resort to domestic law solutions to deal with private cyberattacks, including measures allowed under domestic law to deal with criminal activities. In this context, international treaties play a limited role, potentially facilitating co-operation between law enforcement agencies.\n\nAs states dramatically increase their cybersecurity, public cyberattacks present a particular systemic and existential threat, disrupting multiple organisations and critical infrastructure. The analysis above suggests that the effective application of existing international law to public cyberattacks may require the reassessment of application of the concepts of self-defence and countermeasures in cyberspace. Further development of state practice and *opinio iuris* will help shape uniform approaches and crystallisation of principles of international law.\n\nThe encouragement of co-operation is the most common norm related to cybersecurity in international treaties. Mutual legal assistance treaties provide a right to request assistance, although the other party might not comply with such requests where it is itself behind the cyberattacks.¹⁴⁷\n\n¹⁴⁶ In this respect, the distinction between private and public adjudication should be taken into account in designing such dispute resolution institution. See, generally, Yarik Kryvoi, ‘Private or Public Adjudication? Procedure, Substance and Legitimacy’ (2021) 34(4) Leiden Journal of International Law 681–703.\n\n¹⁴⁷ Generally, Scott J. Shackelford, ‘From Nuclear War to Net War: Analogizing Cyber Attacks in International Law’ (2009) 27(1) Berkeley Journal of International Law 192–251.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009374576.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press",
    "YARIK KRYVOI\n\nIt also restricts the ability of states to bring any such claims before international courts and tribunals. Instead, states opt for naming and shaming, and framing accusations.¹⁴⁸ There are, however, efforts to include cyberattacks into major international criminal law treaties, most notably the Rome Statute.¹⁴⁹ Talks on this topic at the UN level are currently ongoing.¹⁵⁰\n\nAs this chapter has demonstrated, states with similar political regimes tend to co-operate and conclude treaties dealing with cybersecurity (e.g. the Budapest Convention adopted by Western States and the SCO Agreement dominated by China and Russia). Different approaches to cybersecurity and the acceptable level of state interference in matters of cybersecurity also demonstrate the limits of truly global co-operation, as opposed to co-operation between allies. In the absence of specialised treaties of international tribunals dealing with cybersecurity threats, general provisions of public international law should apply.\n\nInternational courts and tribunals should have jurisdiction over cyberattacks, as such disputes involve states and are governed by public international law. Although a cyberattack-related case has not yet been brought, the ICJ might be a natural forum for such state-to-state claims. Investment tribunals have in the past condemned cyberattacks in their decisions and by excluding evidence obtained by hacking.¹⁵¹ However, a dedicated international dispute resolution forum with jurisdiction over cyberattack is missing.¹⁵² Although existing public international law should apply equally to public cyberattacks, the novelty of cyberspace creates areas of confusion. Going forward, the international community\n\n¹⁴⁸ Martha Finnemore and Duncan B.

If international maritime, intellectual property, criminal law, and other types of disputes have their specialised dispute resolution bodies and treaties; hopefully, it is only a matter of time when such as dispute resolution forum will emerge for the cybersphere.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009374576.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press"
