Today, the United States faces strategic threats in cyberspace from China as well as from Russia, two longtime key adversaries in this domain.¹⁷ The United States and its allies also face tactical threats from a range of actors including increasingly active nation-states like North Korea and Iran as well as a wide array of non-state actors, from criminal gangs to terrorist groups.¹⁸ And\nNewer, evolving doctrine in both nations also recognizes that in the cyber domain—as well as in others—the current status quo represents more of a state of “continuous competition” rather than the traditional war-versus-peace paradigm and also understands the cyber battlespace as one where the lines between defense and offense are increasingly fluid.\nA key question for the United States is how it can maintain the relative dominance it has enjoyed in this new domain of warfare going forward.\nsome of these latter actors are working on behalf of, or alongside, the nation-states that are also operating against the United States in the cyber domain.¹⁹\nThis paper argues that the best route to continued success for the United States in the cyber domain is to (1) create a more defensible national ecosystem at home and in partnership with key allies; (2) continue to invest significant resources in cyber intelligence collection, offensive and defensive cyber capability development, and game-changing capabilities, including cognitive computing and quantum systems; and (3) create a sustainable deterrence capability in the cyber realm.\n## Creating a More Defensible National Cyber Ecosystem\nIn the modern era, it is critically important that governments fundamentally rethink their architectures for cyber defense. The reality is not only that nation-states like the United States and China view cyberspace doctrinally as a domain for warfare but also that globally cyberspace has become an actual domain of conflict. Indeed, the United States and its allies are very much in the throes today of a series of ongoing—albeit low-level—conflicts in cyberspace.²⁰ Moreover, these cyber conflicts not only have a classic political component to them but, in many instances, they also have a significant economic component. For example, in the case of China, the United States has long known that its economic security is being directly challenged through the use of\nGEORGETOWN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS\nENSURING US DOMINANCE IN CYBERSPACE\nChinese government cyber capabilities to siphon off massive amounts of economic wealth through the theft and coerced transfer of intellectual property that is at the heart of the modern American economy.²¹ In recognition of the critically important role that economic capabilities play, the recently released National Security Strategy makes clear that the United States views economic security as part and parcel of its national security interests.²² Moreover, the United States is hardly alone among its allies in facing down such threats. Japan and South Korea, for example, have both recently suffered significant economic theft in the form of cryptocurrency hacking allegedly undertaken by North Korea.²³\nAt the same time, economic threats are not the only challenges facing the United States and its allies in cyberspace. The national security of America and its allies is also directly threatened by nations like Russia, which have engaged in obvious efforts to undermine confidence in the American political system.²⁴ Russia has sought to embed long-term penetrations in critical infrastructure sectors in order to conduct espionage and prepare the battlespace for potential future conflict scenarios,²⁵ and has conducted what our government recently referred to as the most “destructive and costly cyber-attack in history.”²⁶ Concerns raised by these classic economic and political threats are further enhanced by the fact that nation-states like Iran²⁷ and North Korea,²⁸ which typically would not be viewed as near-peer competitors to the United States and its allies in the cyber domain, are nonetheless conducting significant cyber-attacks on United States soil and against American allies.²⁹\nGiven this range of threats and the fact that the United States and other nations find themselves currently in the middle of a very real series of (albeit minor) military skirmishes in cyberspace, it may be\nThe national security of America and its allies is also directly threatened by nations like Russia, which have engaged in obvious efforts to undermine confidence in the American political system.\nsurprising that the United States still finds itself challenged in providing “for the common defense” of the nation in the cyber domain.³⁰ The challenges in the United States do not primarily relate to a lack of forces or capabilities.³¹ To the contrary, the creation of US Cyber Command in 2009 provides the United States with very real and robust capabilities in both the offensive and defensive areas, capabilities that have the ability to both protect the United States writ large and to make cyber deterrence a reality in the global arena.³²\nAt least in the United States, the challenges to creating a more defensible national cybersecurity ecosystem relate principally to how core roles, responsibilities, and authorities are allocated.

Given the speed at which cyber conflicts take place, governments need to ensure that warfighters can act with speed and agility to stop an attack before an enemy strikes, as well as respond effectively to an attack in progress. This requires advance authority for USCYBERCOM to take action and clear ROE that provide a broad range of options to use in appropriate circumstances while also limiting action to appropriate bounds outside the United States. Although the idea of providing advance authority to take action that admittedly might spark a larger conflict is almost certainly controversial, if structured properly with appropriate limitations, effective civilian oversight, and significant, timely reporting to the legislative branch, many of the key concerns can be effectively mitigated.35 Similarly, within the United States, agencies like the Federal Bureau of Investigation will need advance authority to take action domestically against potential cyber actors who are utilizing co-opted infrastructure located at home.\nAt the same time, simply providing USCYBERCOM and other agencies with robust authorities and solid ROEs is not enough.36 Because the vast majority of American cyber infrastructure is owned and operated by the private sector, in order to defend the nation, the government must work closely with the private sector by setting the conditions for a truly defensible cyber infrastructure. This would include empowering private sector defensive capabilities and providing for interoperable capabilities that can be used if a national crisis requires direct government assistance to industry, as well as joint exercises to test out such operations.37\nThe fact is that no single entity—whether a private sector company or a government agency—can stand alone against the most capable threat actors.38 Indeed, in no other area do we expect individual private companies to defend themselves against nation-states.39 For example, while we reasonably expect private corporations to have high fences and armed guards around their warehouses to protect against thieves, we don't expect those same companies to have surface-to-air missiles on their warehouses to defend against foreign bombers dropping ordnance.40 When it comes to cyberspace, however, we expect exactly that: individual companies, standing alone, are expected to defend themselves against all comers, from script kiddies to nation-states.41 This is a policy destined to fail under its own weight.42\nRather than rely on private companies to defend themselves alone against such serious actors, governments should move to a collective defense architecture both within the private sector as well as between the public and private sectors.43 The first step would be industries sharing information on cyber threats at scale and speed within and across critical sectors and then, over time, between governments and the private sector more generally.44 Indeed, in order to stop an attack before it happens, governments need to be able to assess their enemy's plans, intentions, and capabilities and must be able to identify the attacks as they are progressing but before they actually have an impact. In many ways, the visibility needed to stop an attack before it has an impact can be analogized to the national air traffic control system.45 Successful, robust sharing of cyber-threat\nENSURING US DOMINANCE IN CYBERSPACE\ndata between the government and industry can help empower the development of such a cyber common operational picture.⁴⁶ Just as the air traffic control picture ensures aviation safety and helps synchronize government and civil flights, a cyber common operational picture can help synchronize our national common cyber defense and enable rapid response in a time of crisis.⁴⁷ In the United States, the energy and financial sectors, working collaboratively with government-funded institutions⁴⁸ and outside providers,⁴⁹ are beginning to lead in this space by creating robust information sharing collaborations both internally to these sectors, as well as with the government.⁵⁰\nBeyond creating a common operational picture, governments can also assist industry more directly.⁵¹ They can do so by sharing cyber-threat information with the private sector in real time and at machine speed.⁵² In addition, governments could use their overseas intelligence-collection architectures to collect on threats to their private sector and pass on this information—even in its highly classified form—to home industry so that it may be used to defend the nation's economic base.⁵³\nFinally, governments and private industry ought to work together to develop interoperable capabilities that can be utilized in a crisis.⁵⁴ Such interoperable capabilities would allow governments to directly provide assistance to the private sector and utilize appropriate governmental authorities to respond to attacks in progress.⁵⁵ Moreover, exercising these capabilities in advance of an\n&gt; Governments and private industry ought to work together to develop interoperable capabilities that can be utilized in a crisis.\nactual threat would allow both governments and private industry to be prepared in actual cyber conflict scenario.⁵⁶\n## Investing Resources in Key Cyber Capabilities\nBoth the United States and China have made clear that they expect to invest significant resources in building cyber capabilities in the near term.⁵⁷ The same is true for many actors around the world, including edge competitors like Iran and North Korea. As a result, significant investment in key areas will be required for the United States and its allies to continue to maintain their collective lead in cyberspace and to ensure more comprehensive national defense across the board. Some of the key areas for such investment ought to include improving cyber intelligence collection, achieving better attribution capabilities, creating advanced offensive and defensive cyber capabilities, and expanding on game-changing capabilities, including artificial intelligence and cognitive computing.\nImproved intelligence collection overseas is a minimum first step for all nations seeking to address significant threats facing them in cyberspace. If a nation is able to understand the potential threats facing both its government as well as its private industry, it will be better placed to defend against such threats in the first instance and to take action to respond as needed. Such intelligence collection can also provide advance warning of a potential threat or may provide attribution of an attack in progress or when completed.\nWhile many of the nation-states operating against the United States and its allies in cyberspace have long sought to escape detection by concealing their activities through the use of non-attributable organizations and infrastructure, as well as the use\nFALL 2018, VOLUME XIX 55\nGEN. KEITH B. ALEXANDER, USA (RET.), AND JAMIL N. JAFFER\nof co-opted systems, $^{58}$ the United States and other nations have committed significant resources to addressing the attribution problem and have increased their ability to more reliably attribute attacks. $^{59}$ Indeed, recent authoritative attributions by the US government of certain major attacks to nation-state actors, from WannaCry to North Korea to NotPetya to Russia, as well as a number of others, highlight this newer trend. $^{60}$ At the same time, the reality for the United States and allied governments is that key actors, including Russia and China, are aggressively targeting non-governmental entities, particularly critical infrastructure providers, for which the government has limited access to data. Similarly, many of the hop points (computers used by attackers to obscure where the attacks originate) that are being used by attackers—whether nation-states or otherwise—reside on private sector networks. Governments like the United States often cannot directly access such hop points, whether for legal or operational reasons. As such, in order to truly extend its attribution capabilities, the US government and others must work closely with private industry in order to truly understand the nature and scope of attacks. Such collaboration will allow both industry and government to benefit from combining information about what is taking place inside the United States or other allied nations with the information collected overseas by their intelligence agencies to better attribute attacks and to prevent further incidents.\nDeveloping advanced offensive and defensive capabilities is likewise critical for further investment by the United States and its allies. Recent attacks have demonstrated that nation-states and non-nation-states alike have developed the ability to repurpose leaked foreign nation-state capabilities to their own ends as well as to develop significant new intelligence tools domestically.\nAs such, in order to truly extend its attribution capabilities, the US government and others must work closely with private industry in order to truly understand the nature and scope of attacks. Such collaboration will allow both industry and government to benefit from combining information about what is taking place inside the United States or other allied nations with the information collected overseas by their intelligence agencies to better attribute attacks and to prevent further incidents.\nBeing able to effectively defend against such nation-state-level capabilities is likely to be an important tool for cyber defenders going forward. At the same time, having the demonstrated capacity to use offensive cyber tools will likely be necessary to deter other states, including states that can't be deterred by other means like diplomatic pressure or sanctions.\nFinally, continuing to invest in and leverage game-changing capabilities, including cognitive computing and quantum systems, will be critical to maintaining the US and allied edge in cyberspace. The reality is that application of these capabilities has the ability to fundamentally and rapidly change the cyber battlespace. In particular, effective application of cognitive computing—which seeks to model human thought processes using computers—to large amounts of cyber-threat data can provide the ability to evaluate next steps that might be taken to defend against an evolving threat. Specifically, in a scenario in which a nation-state is able to attribute a particular pattern of behavior around a set of attacks, the application of cognitive computing may permit the defender to get ahead of future attacks\nGEORGETOWN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS\nor to identify them earlier in the kill chain. Similarly, the potential use of such capabilities to calculate a series of possible outcomes in a given threat scenario, such as the probability of adversary success, could also provide cyber defenders with hugely valuable information. In addition, the potential use of quantum capabilities—which apply certain aspects of quantum physics to allow computers to accomplish calculations much faster than is currently possible—to defeat encrypted malware could also provide cyber defenders with valuable information. This is so because aspects of today's most common encryption methodologies are based on the inability of current systems to rapidly conduct calculations against certain very large numbers (e.g. finding the prime factors of a very large number). Thus, if quantum computing allows much more rapid calculations against such numbers, key aspects of modern encryption—including that used to encrypt malware—may become significantly more vulnerable.61\n## Creating a Sustainable Cyber Deterrence Capability\nDeterrence in cyberspace also represents a key strategic area of focus for Chinese military scholars and war planners,62 as it does in the United States.63 The actual consequences of the application of traditional deterrence theory in cyberspace today remain somewhat opaque. While it is clear that nation-states with leading cyber capabilities like the United States, China, and Russia are not currently prepared to utilize their most robust capabilities against what they perceive as peer competitors because they do fear a potential response, it is also clear that other nations are willing to take specific limited actions that, in other contexts, might be seen as crossing the line against such major players. For example, the destructive nature of attacks undertaken in the continental United States against certain American private sector companies by Iran and North Korea64 represents a calculation (apparently correct—at least to date) by those nations that such action would not provoke a major response. Likewise, major nations appear to have taken the view that significant cyber activities against non-peer competitors, like Russia's attacks against Estonia and Ukraine,65 would likewise not provoke an effective response, whether by those nations or other nations with the ability to respond. At least in the latter scenario, the calculation that peer competitors would not risk a major confrontation over edge states or that such peer competitors remain concerned with their own cyber exposure to respond in that domain, appears also to have been correct. Lastly, at least in one instance, major nation-states have faced off in cyberspace, with Russia assessing that its manipulation of American public opinion through social media during the 2016 elections would not provoke a significant American response.66 In that case, we have seen a significant response in the form of public criticism, sanctions, expulsions of intelligence officers, and closure of diplomatic facilities, but we have yet to see the type of response that is likely to effectively limit such efforts in the future.\nIn order to effectively deter attacks in cyberspace, the United States and its allies must be willing to increasingly describe some measure of the nature and scope of their capabilities in the cyber domain and to set out specific criteria under which cyber-attacks may be responded to and the potential nature of such responses.67 Moreover, the government must be prepared to actually respond when such attacks take place. Today, little if any information is intentionally made public about the nature of the US's strategic and tactical capabilities in cyberspace. Indeed, what little is known\nGEN. KEITH B. ALEXANDER, USA (RET.), AND JAMIL N. JAFFER\nlargely comes from leaks related to alleged cyber operations. The same is largely true of American allies. And while it is without question that the United States and its allies reserve the right to respond to cyber operations conducted against them, refusing to provide insight into some of the nation's capabilities in this arena makes it nearly impossible to credibly leverage deterrence based on a potential cyber-based response.\nSimilarly, without an understanding or a declared policy of certain redlines with respect to cyber operations, potential threat actors are left to guess about what actions might trigger a response and what the nature of that response might be. While strategic ambiguity has its place in international relations, it is most effective when such ambiguity is on the edges of a fairly clear policy. At the present time, in the cyber domain, given that little is understood about when and how nations may respond, it is unsurprising that we see various nations testing the boundaries and engaging in operations that may otherwise be deterred if it were understood that a clear response would be forthcoming. If the United States and its allies are able to agree to a basic set of rules of the road, this framework could create the basis for a sustainable deterrence architecture. The basic elements of such a set of rules can be based on analogies to traditional military or intelligence activities—cyber-attacks causing significant loss of life, physical damage to infrastructure, or significant financial harm or loss would be actionable, whereas traditional forms of espionage, such as a theft of government defense or foreign policy information, would not be. The obvious challenge to such an effort would be the more equivocal cases, such as attempts to influence public opinion, theft of significant amounts of intellectual property, attacks that cause limited physical damage,\nSimilarly, without an understanding or a declared policy of certain redlines with respect to cyber operations, potential threat actors are left to guess about what actions might trigger a response and what the nature of that response might be. While strategic ambiguity has its place in international relations, it is most effective when such ambiguity is on the edges of a fairly clear policy.\nor efforts to penetrate infrastructure for long-term access versus immediate action, all of which may reasonably be analogized to traditional actions that may or may not provoke a response. The fact that these cases create a significant challenge, however, is not a reason to avoid making tough choices about how the United States and its allies ought to react to malicious cyber activities. To the contrary, the fact that there remains ambiguity in this area and that US and allied responses have been limited (at least in the public space) to date means that other nations are more likely to continue to probe our boundaries.\nFinally, as with all forms of deterrence, cyber deterrence will be effective only to the extent that nation-states are willing to stand by the redlines they set and actually enforce them. At the same time, long-term deterrence can be dramatically undermined where nation-states set unwise redlines or create redlines that they are not actually willing to enforce, as in the case of Syria's use of chemical weapons in 2012-13. As such, in cyberspace, significant attention must be given to establishing clear boundaries and setting out clear consequences only where governments are actually prepared and willing to take action.\nGEORGETOWN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS\nENSURING US DOMINANCE IN CYBERSPACE\n# Conclusion\nThe establishment of the SSF by China, which was informed by the creation of USCYBERCOM in the United States, highlights the importance of the United States and its allies undertaking a concerted effort to maintain their collective edge in the cyber domain. This will require a significant rethinking of the roles and responsibilities of the government and the private sector when it comes to cyber defense. It will demand significant investment in new, advanced capabilities and a new approach to deterrence in the cyber arena. All of these changes are within the realm of the possible, but significant barriers to success remain, including fundamental disconnects within the American political system and between the defense, intelligence, and homeland security communities in the government. Thus, if the United States is to maintain its relative dominance in cyberspace over the long term, it is likely to require a sustained commitment from the leadership of the executive branch and the commitment of a significant amount of political and financial resources in the near term.",

This would include empowering private sector defensive capabilities and providing for interoperable capabilities that can be used if a national crisis requires direct government assistance to industry, as well as joint exercises to test out such operations.37 The fact is that no single entity—whether a private sector company or a government agency—can stand alone against the most capable threat actors.38 Indeed, in no other area do we expect individual private companies to defend themselves against nation-states.39 For example, while we reasonably expect private corporations to have high fences and armed guards around their warehouses to protect against thieves, we don't expect those same companies to have surface-to-air missiles on their warehouses to defend against foreign bombers dropping ordnance.40 When it comes to cyberspace, however, we expect exactly that: individual companies, standing alone, are expected to defend themselves against all comers, from script kiddies to nation-states.41 This is a policy destined to fail under its own weight.42 Rather than rely on private companies to defend themselves alone against such serious actors, governments should move to a collective defense architecture both within the private sector as well as between the public and private sectors.43 The first step would be industries sharing information on cyber threats at scale and speed within and across critical sectors and then, over time, between governments and the private sector more generally.44 Indeed, in order to stop an attack before it happens, governments need to be able to assess their enemy's plans, intentions, and capabilities and must be able to identify the attacks as they are progressing but before they actually have an impact. In many ways, the visibility needed to stop an attack before it has an impact can be analogized to the national air traffic control system.45 Successful, robust sharing of cyber-threat ENSURING US DOMINANCE IN CYBERSPACE data between the government and industry can help empower the development of such a cyber common operational picture.⁴⁶ Just as the air traffic control picture ensures aviation safety and helps synchronize government and civil flights, a cyber common operational picture can help synchronize our national common cyber defense and enable rapid response in a time of crisis.⁴⁷ In the United States, the energy and financial sectors, working collaboratively with government-funded institutions⁴⁸ and outside providers,⁴⁹ are beginning to lead in this space by creating robust information sharing collaborations both internally to these sectors, as well as with the government.⁵⁰ Beyond creating a common operational picture, governments can also assist industry more directly.⁵¹ They can do so by sharing cyber-threat information with the private sector in real time and at machine speed.⁵² In addition, governments could use their overseas intelligence-collection architectures to collect on threats to their private sector and pass on this information—even in its highly classified form—to home industry so that it may be used to defend the nation's economic base.⁵³ Finally, governments and private industry ought to work together to develop interoperable capabilities that can be utilized in a crisis.⁵⁴ Such interoperable capabilities would allow governments to directly provide assistance to the private sector and utilize appropriate governmental authorities to respond to attacks in progress.⁵⁵ Moreover, exercising these capabilities in advance of an &gt; Governments and private industry ought to work together to develop interoperable capabilities that can be utilized in a crisis.\nactual threat would allow both governments and private industry to be prepared in actual cyber conflict scenario.⁵⁶ ## Investing Resources in Key Cyber Capabilities Both the United States and China have made clear that they expect to invest significant resources in building cyber capabilities in the near term.⁵⁷ The same is true for many actors around the world, including edge competitors like Iran and North Korea. As a result, significant investment in key areas will be required for the United States and its allies to continue to maintain their collective lead in cyberspace and to ensure more comprehensive national defense across the board. Some of the key areas for such investment ought to include improving cyber intelligence collection, achieving better attribution capabilities, creating advanced offensive and defensive cyber capabilities, and expanding on game-changing capabilities, including artificial intelligence and cognitive computing.\nImproved intelligence collection overseas is a minimum first step for all nations seeking to address significant threats facing them in cyberspace. If a nation is able to understand the potential threats facing both its government as well as its private industry, it will be better placed to defend against such threats in the first instance and to take action to respond as needed. Such intelligence collection can also provide advance warning of a potential threat or may provide attribution of an attack in progress or when completed.\nWhile many of the nation-states operating against the United States and its allies in cyberspace have long sought to escape detection by concealing their activities through the use of non-attributable organizations and infrastructure, as well as the use FALL 2018, VOLUME XIX 55 GEN. KEITH B. ALEXANDER, USA (RET.), AND JAMIL N. JAFFER of co-opted systems, the United States and other nations have committed significant resources to addressing the attribution problem and have increased their ability to more reliably attribute attacks. Indeed, recent authoritative attributions by the US government of certain major attacks to nation-state actors, from WannaCry to North Korea to NotPetya to Russia, as well as a number of others, highlight this newer trend. At the same time, the reality for the United States and allied governments is that key actors, including Russia and China, are aggressively targeting non-governmental entities, particularly critical infrastructure providers, for which the government has limited access to data. Similarly, many of the hop points (computers used by attackers to obscure where the attacks originate) that are being used by attackers—whether nation-states or otherwise—reside on private sector networks. Governments like the United States often cannot directly access such hop points, whether for legal or operational reasons. As such, in order to truly extend its attribution capabilities, the US government and others must work closely with private industry in order to truly understand the nature and scope of attacks. Such collaboration will allow both industry and government to benefit from combining information about what is taking place inside the United States or other allied nations with the information collected overseas by their intelligence agencies to better attribute attacks and to prevent further incidents.\nDeveloping advanced offensive and defensive capabilities is likewise critical for further investment by the United States and its allies. Recent attacks have demonstrated that nation-states and non-nation-states alike have developed the ability to repurpose leaked foreign nation-state capabilities to their own ends as well as to develop significant new intelligence tools domestically.\nAs such, in order to truly extend its attribution capabilities, the US government and others must work closely with private industry in order to truly understand the nature and scope of attacks. Such collaboration will allow both industry and government to benefit from combining information about what is taking place inside the United States or other allied nations with the information collected overseas by their intelligence agencies to better attribute attacks and to prevent further incidents.\nBeing able to effectively defend against such nation-state-level capabilities is likely to be an important tool for cyber defenders going forward. At the same time, having the demonstrated capacity to use offensive cyber tools will likely be necessary to deter other states, including states that can't be deterred by other means like diplomatic pressure or sanctions.\nFinally, continuing to invest in and leverage game-changing capabilities, including cognitive computing and quantum systems, will be critical to maintaining the US and allied edge in cyberspace. The reality is that application of these capabilities has the ability to fundamentally and rapidly change the cyber battlespace. In particular, effective application of cognitive computing—which seeks to model human thought processes using computers—to large amounts of cyber-threat data can provide the ability to evaluate next steps that might be taken to defend against an evolving threat. Specifically, in a scenario in which a nation-state is able to attribute a particular pattern of behavior around a set of attacks, the application of cognitive computing may permit the defender to get ahead of future attacks GEORGETOWN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS or to identify them earlier in the kill chain. Similarly, the potential use of such capabilities to calculate a series of possible outcomes in a given threat scenario, such as the probability of adversary success, could also provide cyber defenders with hugely valuable information. In addition, the potential use of quantum capabilities—which apply certain aspects of quantum physics to allow computers to accomplish calculations much faster than is currently possible—to defeat encrypted malware could also provide cyber defenders with valuable information. This is so because aspects of today's most common encryption methodologies are based on the inability of current systems to rapidly conduct calculations against certain very large numbers (e.g. finding the prime factors of a very large number). Thus, if quantum computing allows much more rapid calculations against such numbers, key aspects of modern encryption—including that used to encrypt malware—may become significantly more vulnerable.61 ## Creating a Sustainable Cyber Deterrence Capability Deterrence in cyberspace also represents a key strategic area of focus for Chinese military scholars and war planners,62 as it does in the United States.63 The actual consequences of the application of traditional deterrence theory in cyberspace today remain somewhat opaque. While it is clear that nation-states with leading cyber capabilities like the United States, China, and Russia are not currently prepared to utilize their most robust capabilities against what they perceive as peer competitors because they do fear a potential response, it is also clear that other nations are willing to take specific limited actions that, in other contexts, might be seen as crossing the line against such major players. For example, the destructive nature of attacks undertaken in the continental United States against certain American private sector companies by Iran and North Korea64 represents a calculation (apparently correct—at least to date) by those nations that such action would not provoke a major response. Likewise, major nations appear to have taken the view that significant cyber activities against non-peer competitors, like Russia's attacks against Estonia and Ukraine,65 would likewise not provoke an effective response, whether by those nations or other nations with the ability to respond. At least in the latter scenario, the calculation that peer competitors would not risk a major confrontation over edge states or that such peer competitors remain concerned with their own cyber exposure to respond in that domain, appears also to have been correct. Lastly, at least in one instance, major nation-states have faced off in cyberspace, with Russia assessing that its manipulation of American public opinion through social media during the 2016 elections would not provoke a significant American response.66 In that case, we have seen a significant response in the form of public criticism, sanctions, expulsions of intelligence officers, and closure of diplomatic facilities, but we have yet to see the type of response that is likely to effectively limit such efforts in the future.\nIn order to effectively deter attacks in cyberspace, the United States and its allies must be willing to increasingly describe some measure of the nature and scope of their capabilities in the cyber domain and to set out specific criteria under which cyber-attacks may be responded to and the potential nature of such responses.67 Moreover, the government must be prepared to actually respond when such attacks take place. Today, little if any information is intentionally made public about the nature of the US's strategic and tactical capabilities in cyberspace. Indeed, what little is known GEN. KEITH B. ALEXANDER, USA (RET.), AND JAMIL N. JAFFER largely comes from leaks related to alleged cyber operations. The same is largely true of American allies. And while it is without question that the United States and its allies reserve the right to respond to cyber operations conducted against them, refusing to provide insight into some of the nation's capabilities in this arena makes it nearly impossible to credibly leverage deterrence based on a potential cyber-based response.\nSimilarly, without an understanding or a declared policy of certain redlines with respect to cyber operations, potential threat actors are left to guess about what actions might trigger a response and what the nature of that response might be. While strategic ambiguity has its place in international relations, it is most effective when such ambiguity is on the edges of a fairly clear policy. At the present time, in the cyber domain, given that little is understood about when and how nations may respond, it is unsurprising that we see various nations testing the boundaries and engaging in operations that may otherwise be deterred if it were understood that a clear response would be forthcoming. If the United States and its allies are able to agree to a basic set of rules of the road, this framework could create the basis for a sustainable deterrence architecture. The basic elements of such a set of rules can be based on analogies to traditional military or intelligence activities—cyber-attacks causing significant loss of life, physical damage to infrastructure, or significant financial harm or loss would be actionable, whereas traditional forms of espionage, such as a theft of government defense or foreign policy information, would not be. The obvious challenge to such an effort would be the more equivocal cases, such as attempts to influence public opinion, theft of significant amounts of intellectual property, attacks that cause limited physical damage, Similarly, without an understanding or a declared policy of certain redlines with respect to cyber operations, potential threat actors are left to guess about what actions might trigger a response and what the nature of that response might be. While strategic ambiguity has its place in international relations, it is most effective when such ambiguity is on the edges of a fairly clear policy.\nor efforts to penetrate infrastructure for long-term access versus immediate action, all of which may reasonably be analogized to traditional actions that may or may not provoke a response. The fact that these cases create a significant challenge, however, is not a reason to avoid making tough choices about how the United States and its allies ought to react to malicious cyber activities. To the contrary, the fact that there remains ambiguity in this area and that US and allied responses have been limited (at least in the public space) to date means that other nations are more likely to continue to probe our boundaries.\nFinally, as with all forms of deterrence, cyber deterrence will be effective only to the extent that nation-states are willing to stand by the redlines they set and actually enforce them. At the same time, long-term deterrence can be dramatically undermined where nation-states set unwise redlines or create redlines that they are not actually willing to enforce, as in the case of Syria's use of chemical weapons in 2012-13. As such, in cyberspace, significant attention must be given to establishing clear boundaries and setting out clear consequences only where governments are actually prepared and willing to take action.\nGEORGETOWN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS ENSURING US DOMINANCE IN CYBERSPACE # Conclusion The establishment of the SSF by China, which was informed by the creation of USCYBERCOM in the United States, highlights the importance of the United States and its allies undertaking a concerted effort to maintain their collective edge in the cyber domain. This will require a significant rethinking of the roles and responsibilities of the government and the private sector when it comes to cyber defense. It will demand significant investment in new, advanced capabilities and a new approach to deterrence in the cyber arena. All of these changes are within the realm of the possible, but significant barriers to success remain, including fundamental disconnects within the American political system and between the defense, intelligence, and homeland security communities in the government. Thus, if the United States is to maintain its relative dominance in cyberspace over the long term, it is likely to require a sustained commitment from the leadership of the executive branch and the commitment of a significant amount of political and financial resources in the near term.",

Indeed, the United States and its allies are very much in the throes today of a series of ongoing—albeit low-level—conflicts in cyberspace.²⁰ Moreover, these cyber conflicts not only have a classic political component to them but, in many instances, they also have a significant economic component.

Keith B. Alexander, USA (Ret.), and Jamil N. Jaffer In late 2015, China announced the creation of its Strategic Support Force (SSF) to unify the People's Liberation Army's (PLA) cyber, space, and electronic warfare capabilities,¹ an effort that parallels the creation of United States Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) in 2009.² Just like the United States, in recent years China has begun to describe cyberspace as a separate domain of warfare and strategic competition.³ Both China and the United States believe that their respective defense establishments should play a central role in protection of national assets from threats in cyberspace.⁴ According to the US Department of Defense, the creation of the SSF likely represents China's\"first step in developing a cyber force that creates efficiencies by combining cyber reconnaissance, attack, and defense capabilities into one organization.\"⁵ This likewise parallels the mission of USCYBERCOM—namely, of achieving and maintaining superiority in cyberspace by unifying cyberspace operations, securing data and systems, and providing military options to leadership.⁶ Indeed, Chinese military authors cite the development of USCYBERCOM as having successfully combined cyber functions under a single command structure, including the combination of offensive and defense capabilities.⁷ Just as US Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta noted in 2012 that it is the responsibility of the Department of Defense to\"defend the nation\"in cyberspace,⁸ the Chinese view the role of the PLA's SSF as\"safeguard[ing] China's interests in new domains such as... cyberspace.\"⁹ Furthermore, USCYBERCOM explicitly differentiates its responsibility to\"defend the nation\"in cyberspace from its offensive capabilities and its support for active military operations.¹⁰ Similarly, Chinese military doctrine writers also differentiate between peacetime defensive operations and wartime military Gen. Keith B. Alexander, USA (Ret.), is the former director of the National Security Agency and founding commander of the US Cyber Command. General Alexander recently served as a member of the President's Task Force on Enhancing National Cybersecurity and currently serves as president and CEO of IronNet Cybersecurity, a startup cybersecurity firm, as well as in a number of other public and private roles.\nJamil N. Jaffer is the former chief counsel and senior advisor to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and senior counsel to the House Intelligence Committee as well as an associate counsel to President George W. Bush. Mr. Jaffer currently serves as founder of the National Security Institute at the Scalia Law School at George Mason University and as a visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution as well as a vice president at IronNet Cybersecurity. Certain portions of this paper—in particular the section on creating a more defensible national cyber ecosystem—are drawn directly or principally from testimony presented by General Alexander on April 11, 2018, before the House Armed Services Committee.\nGEN.

Today, the United States faces strategic threats in cyberspace from China as well as from Russia, two longtime key adversaries in this domain.¹⁷ The United States and its allies also face tactical threats from a range of actors including increasingly active nation-states like North Korea and Iran as well as a wide array of non-state actors, from criminal gangs to terrorist groups.¹⁸ And Newer, evolving doctrine in both nations also recognizes that in the cyber domain—as well as in others—the current status quo represents more of a state of “continuous competition” rather than the traditional war-versus-peace paradigm and also understands the cyber battlespace as one where the lines between defense and offense are increasingly fluid.\nA key question for the United States is how it can maintain the relative dominance it has enjoyed in this new domain of warfare going forward.\nsome of these latter actors are working on behalf of, or alongside, the nation-states that are also operating against the United States in the cyber domain.¹⁹ This paper argues that the best route to continued success for the United States in the cyber domain is to (1) create a more defensible national ecosystem at home and in partnership with key allies; (2) continue to invest significant resources in cyber intelligence collection, offensive and defensive cyber capability development, and game-changing capabilities, including cognitive computing and quantum systems; and (3) create a sustainable deterrence capability in the cyber realm.",

Given the speed at which cyber conflicts take place, governments need to ensure that warfighters can act with speed and agility to stop an attack before an enemy strikes, as well as respond effectively to an attack in progress. This requires advance authority for USCYBERCOM to take action and clear ROE that provide a broad range of options to use in appropriate circumstances while also limiting action to appropriate bounds outside the United States. Although the idea of providing advance authority to take action that admittedly might spark a larger conflict is almost certainly controversial, if structured properly with appropriate limitations, effective civilian oversight, and significant, timely reporting to the legislative branch, many of the key concerns can be effectively mitigated.35 Similarly, within the United States, agencies like the Federal Bureau of Investigation will need advance authority to take action domestically against potential cyber actors who are utilizing co-opted infrastructure located at home.\nAt the same time, simply providing USCYBERCOM and other agencies with robust authorities and solid ROEs is not enough.36 Because the vast majority of American cyber infrastructure is owned and operated by the private sector, in order to defend the nation, the government must work closely with the private sector by setting the conditions for a truly defensible cyber infrastructure.

Specifically, in a scenario in which a nation-state is able to attribute a particular pattern of behavior around a set of attacks, the application of cognitive computing may permit the defender to get ahead of future attacks GEORGETOWN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS or to identify them earlier in the kill chain. Similarly, the potential use of such capabilities to calculate a series of possible outcomes in a given threat scenario, such as the probability of adversary success, could also provide cyber defenders with hugely valuable information. In addition, the potential use of quantum capabilities—which apply certain aspects of quantum physics to allow computers to accomplish calculations much faster than is currently possible—to defeat encrypted malware could also provide cyber defenders with valuable information. This is so because aspects of today's most common encryption methodologies are based on the inability of current systems to rapidly conduct calculations against certain very large numbers (e.g. finding the prime factors of a very large number). Thus, if quantum computing allows much more rapid calculations against such numbers, key aspects of modern encryption—including that used to encrypt malware—may become significantly more vulnerable.61 ## Creating a Sustainable Cyber Deterrence Capability Deterrence in cyberspace also represents a key strategic area of focus for Chinese military scholars and war planners,62 as it does in the United States.63 The actual consequences of the application of traditional deterrence theory in cyberspace today remain somewhat opaque. While it is clear that nation-states with leading cyber capabilities like the United States, China, and Russia are not currently prepared to utilize their most robust capabilities against what they perceive as peer competitors because they do fear a potential response, it is also clear that other nations are willing to take specific limited actions that, in other contexts, might be seen as crossing the line against such major players. For example, the destructive nature of attacks undertaken in the continental United States against certain American private sector companies by Iran and North Korea64 represents a calculation (apparently correct—at least to date) by those nations that such action would not provoke a major response. Likewise, major nations appear to have taken the view that significant cyber activities against non-peer competitors, like Russia's attacks against Estonia and Ukraine,65 would likewise not provoke an effective response, whether by those nations or other nations with the ability to respond. At least in the latter scenario, the calculation that peer competitors would not risk a major confrontation over edge states or that such peer competitors remain concerned with their own cyber exposure to respond in that domain, appears also to have been correct. Lastly, at least in one instance, major nation-states have faced off in cyberspace, with Russia assessing that its manipulation of American public opinion through social media during the 2016 elections would not provoke a significant American response.66 In that case, we have seen a significant response in the form of public criticism, sanctions, expulsions of intelligence officers, and closure of diplomatic facilities, but we have yet to see the type of response that is likely to effectively limit such efforts in the future.\nIn order to effectively deter attacks in cyberspace, the United States and its allies must be willing to increasingly describe some measure of the nature and scope of their capabilities in the cyber domain and to set out specific criteria under which cyber-attacks may be responded to and the potential nature of such responses.67 Moreover, the government must be prepared to actually respond when such attacks take place. Today, little if any information is intentionally made public about the nature of the US's strategic and tactical capabilities in cyberspace. Indeed, what little is known GEN. KEITH B. ALEXANDER, USA (RET.), AND JAMIL N. JAFFER largely comes from leaks related to alleged cyber operations. The same is largely true of American allies. And while it is without question that the United States and its allies reserve the right to respond to cyber operations conducted against them, refusing to provide insight into some of the nation's capabilities in this arena makes it nearly impossible to credibly leverage deterrence based on a potential cyber-based response.\nSimilarly, without an understanding or a declared policy of certain redlines with respect to cyber operations, potential threat actors are left to guess about what actions might trigger a response and what the nature of that response might be. While strategic ambiguity has its place in international relations, it is most effective when such ambiguity is on the edges of a fairly clear policy. At the present time, in the cyber domain, given that little is understood about when and how nations may respond, it is unsurprising that we see various nations testing the boundaries and engaging in operations that may otherwise be deterred if it were understood that a clear response would be forthcoming. If the United States and its allies are able to agree to a basic set of rules of the road, this framework could create the basis for a sustainable deterrence architecture. The basic elements of such a set of rules can be based on analogies to traditional military or intelligence activities—cyber-attacks causing significant loss of life, physical damage to infrastructure, or significant financial harm or loss would be actionable, whereas traditional forms of espionage, such as a theft of government defense or foreign policy information, would not be. The obvious challenge to such an effort would be the more equivocal cases, such as attempts to influence public opinion, theft of significant amounts of intellectual property, attacks that cause limited physical damage, Similarly, without an understanding or a declared policy of certain redlines with respect to cyber operations, potential threat actors are left to guess about what actions might trigger a response and what the nature of that response might be. While strategic ambiguity has its place in international relations, it is most effective when such ambiguity is on the edges of a fairly clear policy.\nor efforts to penetrate infrastructure for long-term access versus immediate action, all of which may reasonably be analogized to traditional actions that may or may not provoke a response. The fact that these cases create a significant challenge, however, is not a reason to avoid making tough choices about how the United States and its allies ought to react to malicious cyber activities. To the contrary, the fact that there remains ambiguity in this area and that US and allied responses have been limited (at least in the public space) to date means that other nations are more likely to continue to probe our boundaries.\nFinally, as with all forms of deterrence, cyber deterrence will be effective only to the extent that nation-states are willing to stand by the redlines they set and actually enforce them. At the same time, long-term deterrence can be dramatically undermined where nation-states set unwise redlines or create redlines that they are not actually willing to enforce, as in the case of Syria's use of chemical weapons in 2012-13. As such, in cyberspace, significant attention must be given to establishing clear boundaries and setting out clear consequences only where governments are actually prepared and willing to take action.\nGEORGETOWN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS ENSURING US DOMINANCE IN CYBERSPACE # Conclusion The establishment of the SSF by China, which was informed by the creation of USCYBERCOM in the United States, highlights the importance of the United States and its allies undertaking a concerted effort to maintain their collective edge in the cyber domain. This will require a significant rethinking of the roles and responsibilities of the government and the private sector when it comes to cyber defense. It will demand significant investment in new, advanced capabilities and a new approach to deterrence in the cyber arena. All of these changes are within the realm of the possible, but significant barriers to success remain, including fundamental disconnects within the American political system and between the defense, intelligence, and homeland security communities in the government. Thus, if the United States is to maintain its relative dominance in cyberspace over the long term, it is likely to require a sustained commitment from the leadership of the executive branch and the commitment of a significant amount of political and financial resources in the near term."

Keith B. Alexander, USA (Ret.), and Jamil N. Jaffer In late 2015, China announced the creation of its Strategic Support Force (SSF) to unify the People's Liberation Army's (PLA) cyber, space, and electronic warfare capabilities,¹ an effort that parallels the creation of United States Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) in 2009.² Just like the United States, in recent years China has begun to describe cyberspace as a separate domain of warfare and strategic competition.³ Both China and the United States believe that their respective defense establishments should play a central role in protection of national assets from threats in cyberspace.⁴ According to the US Department of Defense, the creation of the SSF likely represents China's\"first step in developing a cyber force that creates efficiencies by combining cyber reconnaissance, attack, and defense capabilities into one organization.\"⁵ This likewise parallels the mission of USCYBERCOM—namely, of achieving and maintaining superiority in cyberspace by unifying cyberspace operations, securing data and systems, and providing military options to leadership.⁶ Indeed, Chinese military authors cite the development of USCYBERCOM as having successfully combined cyber functions under a single command structure, including the combination of offensive and defense capabilities.⁷ Just as US Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta noted in 2012 that it is the responsibility of the Department of Defense to\"defend the nation\"in cyberspace,⁸ the Chinese view the role of the PLA's SSF as\"safeguard[ing] China's interests in new domains such as... cyberspace.\"⁹ Furthermore, USCYBERCOM explicitly differentiates its responsibility to\"defend the nation\"in cyberspace from its offensive capabilities and its support for active military operations.¹⁰ Similarly, Chinese military doctrine writers also differentiate between peacetime defensive operations and wartime military Gen. Keith B. Alexander, USA (Ret.), is the former director of the National Security Agency and founding commander of the US Cyber Command. General Alexander recently served as a member of the President's Task Force on Enhancing National Cybersecurity and currently serves as president and CEO of IronNet Cybersecurity, a startup cybersecurity firm, as well as in a number of other public and private roles.\nJamil N. Jaffer is the former chief counsel and senior advisor to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and senior counsel to the House Intelligence Committee as well as an associate counsel to President George W. Bush. Mr. Jaffer currently serves as founder of the National Security Institute at the Scalia Law School at George Mason University and as a visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution as well as a vice president at IronNet Cybersecurity. Certain portions of this paper—in particular the section on creating a more defensible national cyber ecosystem—are drawn directly or principally from testimony presented by General Alexander on April 11, 2018, before the House Armed Services Committee.\nGEN. KEITH B. ALEXANDER, USA (RET.), AND JAMIL N. JAFFER support and offensive operations.¹¹ At the same time, newer, evolving doctrine in both nations also recognizes that in the cyber domain—as well as in others—the current status quo represents more of a state of “continuous competition” rather than the traditional war-versus-peace paradigm¹² and also understands the cyber battlespace as one where the lines between defense and offense are increasingly fluid.¹³ Given that one primary goal of the SSF is to accelerate the development of Chinese offensive and defensive cyber capabilities,¹⁴ and given the rise of a number of other peer and near-peer competitors in cyberspace,¹⁵ as well as the inherently asymmetric nature of cyber capabilities, a key question for the United States is how it can maintain the relative dominance it has enjoyed in this new domain of warfare going forward.¹⁶ The reality today is that America’s relative hegemony in cyberspace as a domain of warfare is being (and will continue to be) contested in cyberspace. Today, the United States faces strategic threats in cyberspace from China as well as from Russia, two longtime key adversaries in this domain.¹⁷ The United States and its allies also face tactical threats from a range of actors including increasingly active nation-states like North Korea and Iran as well as a wide array of non-state actors, from criminal gangs to terrorist groups.¹⁸ And Newer, evolving doctrine in both nations also recognizes that in the cyber domain—as well as in others—the current status quo represents more of a state of “continuous competition” rather than the traditional war-versus-peace paradigm and also understands the cyber battlespace as one where the lines between defense and offense are increasingly fluid.\nA key question for the United States is how it can maintain the relative dominance it has enjoyed in this new domain of warfare going forward.\nsome of these latter actors are working on behalf of, or alongside, the nation-states that are also operating against the United States in the cyber domain.¹⁹ This paper argues that the best route to continued success for the United States in the cyber domain is to (1) create a more defensible national ecosystem at home and in partnership with key allies; (2) continue to invest significant resources in cyber intelligence collection, offensive and defensive cyber capability development, and game-changing capabilities, including cognitive computing and quantum systems; and (3) create a sustainable deterrence capability in the cyber realm.\n## Creating a More Defensible National Cyber Ecosystem In the modern era, it is critically important that governments fundamentally rethink their architectures for cyber defense. The reality is not only that nation-states like the United States and China view cyberspace doctrinally as a domain for warfare but also that globally cyberspace has become an actual domain of conflict. Indeed, the United States and its allies are very much in the throes today of a series of ongoing—albeit low-level—conflicts in cyberspace.²⁰ Moreover, these cyber conflicts not only have a classic political component to them but, in many instances, they also have a significant economic component. For example, in the case of China, the United States has long known that its economic security is being directly challenged through the use of GEORGETOWN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS ENSURING US DOMINANCE IN CYBERSPACE Chinese government cyber capabilities to siphon off massive amounts of economic wealth through the theft and coerced transfer of intellectual property that is at the heart of the modern American economy.²¹ In recognition of the critically important role that economic capabilities play, the recently released National Security Strategy makes clear that the United States views economic security as part and parcel of its national security interests.²² Moreover, the United States is hardly alone among its allies in facing down such threats. Japan and South Korea, for example, have both recently suffered significant economic theft in the form of cryptocurrency hacking allegedly undertaken by North Korea.²³ At the same time, economic threats are not the only challenges facing the United States and its allies in cyberspace. The national security of America and its allies is also directly threatened by nations like Russia, which have engaged in obvious efforts to undermine confidence in the American political system.²⁴ Russia has sought to embed long-term penetrations in critical infrastructure sectors in order to conduct espionage and prepare the battlespace for potential future conflict scenarios,²⁵ and has conducted what our government recently referred to as the most “destructive and costly cyber-attack in history.”²⁶ Concerns raised by these classic economic and political threats are further enhanced by the fact that nation-states like Iran²⁷ and North Korea,²⁸ which typically would not be viewed as near-peer competitors to the United States and its allies in the cyber domain, are nonetheless conducting significant cyber-attacks on United States soil and against American allies.²⁹ Given this range of threats and the fact that the United States and other nations find themselves currently in the middle of a very real series of (albeit minor) military skirmishes in cyberspace, it may be The national security of America and its allies is also directly threatened by nations like Russia, which have engaged in obvious efforts to undermine confidence in the American political system.\nsurprising that the United States still finds itself challenged in providing “for the common defense” of the nation in the cyber domain.³⁰ The challenges in the United States do not primarily relate to a lack of forces or capabilities.³¹ To the contrary, the creation of US Cyber Command in 2009 provides the United States with very real and robust capabilities in both the offensive and defensive areas, capabilities that have the ability to both protect the United States writ large and to make cyber deterrence a reality in the global arena.³² At least in the United States, the challenges to creating a more defensible national cybersecurity ecosystem relate principally to how core roles, responsibilities, and authorities are allocated. In particular, the United States faces two core challenges when it comes to cyberspace: how to organize as a government to defend and fight in this domain, and how to build jointness against The challenges in the United States do not primarily relate to a lack of forces or capabilities. To the contrary, the creation of US Cyber Command in 2009 provides the United States with very real and robust capabilities in both the offensive and defensive areas, capabilities that have the ability to both protect the United States writ large and to make cyber deterrence a reality in the global arena.\nFALL 2018, VOLUME XIX cyber-attacks between the public and private sectors during conflicts that require acting with both speed and vigor to defend the nation.33 One principal challenge facing the United States is that USCYBERCOM—ostensibly charged since 2012 with the mission of defending the nation against cyber-attacks—lacks clear authority and rules of engagement (ROE).34 The goal should not be to respond to an attack but rather to protect against an attack before damage to infrastructure occurs. Given the speed at which cyber conflicts take place, governments need to ensure that warfighters can act with speed and agility to stop an attack before an enemy strikes, as well as respond effectively to an attack in progress. This requires advance authority for USCYBERCOM to take action and clear ROE that provide a broad range of options to use in appropriate circumstances while also limiting action to appropriate bounds outside the United States. Although the idea of providing advance authority to take action that admittedly might spark a larger conflict is almost certainly controversial, if structured properly with appropriate limitations, effective civilian oversight, and significant, timely reporting to the legislative branch, many of the key concerns can be effectively mitigated.35 Similarly, within the United States, agencies like the Federal Bureau of Investigation will need advance authority to take action domestically against potential cyber actors who are utilizing co-opted infrastructure located at home.\nAt the same time, simply providing USCYBERCOM and other agencies with robust authorities and solid ROEs is not enough.36 Because the vast majority of American cyber infrastructure is owned and operated by the private sector, in order to defend the nation, the government must work closely with the private sector by setting the conditions for a truly defensible cyber infrastructure. This would include empowering private sector defensive capabilities and providing for interoperable capabilities that can be used if a national crisis requires direct government assistance to industry, as well as joint exercises to test out such operations.37 The fact is that no single entity—whether a private sector company or a government agency—can stand alone against the most capable threat actors.38 Indeed, in no other area do we expect individual private companies to defend themselves against nation-states.39 For example, while we reasonably expect private corporations to have high fences and armed guards around their warehouses to protect against thieves, we don't expect those same companies to have surface-to-air missiles on their warehouses to defend against foreign bombers dropping ordnance.40 When it comes to cyberspace, however, we expect exactly that: individual companies, standing alone, are expected to defend themselves against all comers, from script kiddies to nation-states.41 This is a policy destined to fail under its own weight.42 Rather than rely on private companies to defend themselves alone against such serious actors, governments should move to a collective defense architecture both within the private sector as well as between the public and private sectors.43 The first step would be industries sharing information on cyber threats at scale and speed within and across critical sectors and then, over time, between governments and the private sector more generally.44 Indeed, in order to stop an attack before it happens, governments need to be able to assess their enemy's plans, intentions, and capabilities and must be able to identify the attacks as they are progressing but before they actually have an impact. In many ways, the visibility needed to stop an attack before it has an impact can be analogized to the national air traffic control system.45 Successful, robust sharing of cyber-threat ENSURING US DOMINANCE IN CYBERSPACE data between the government and industry can help empower the development of such a cyber common operational picture.⁴⁶ Just as the air traffic control picture ensures aviation safety and helps synchronize government and civil flights, a cyber common operational picture can help synchronize our national common cyber defense and enable rapid response in a time of crisis.⁴⁷ In the United States, the energy and financial sectors, working collaboratively with government-funded institutions⁴⁸ and outside providers,⁴⁹ are beginning to lead in this space by creating robust information sharing collaborations both internally to these sectors, as well as with the government.⁵⁰ Beyond creating a common operational picture, governments can also assist industry more directly.⁵¹ They can do so by sharing cyber-threat information with the private sector in real time and at machine speed.⁵² In addition, governments could use their overseas intelligence-collection architectures to collect on threats to their private sector and pass on this information—even in its highly classified form—to home industry so that it may be used to defend the nation's economic base.⁵³ Finally, governments and private industry ought to work together to develop interoperable capabilities that can be utilized in a crisis.⁵⁴ Such interoperable capabilities would allow governments to directly provide assistance to the private sector and utilize appropriate governmental authorities to respond to attacks in progress.⁵⁵ Moreover, exercising these capabilities in advance of an &gt; Governments and private industry ought to work together to develop interoperable capabilities that can be utilized in a crisis.\nactual threat would allow both governments and private industry to be prepared in actual cyber conflict scenario.⁵⁶ ## Investing Resources in Key Cyber Capabilities Both the United States and China have made clear that they expect to invest significant resources in building cyber capabilities in the near term.⁵⁷ The same is true for many actors around the world, including edge competitors like Iran and North Korea. As a result, significant investment in key areas will be required for the United States and its allies to continue to maintain their collective lead in cyberspace and to ensure more comprehensive national defense across the board. Some of the key areas for such investment ought to include improving cyber intelligence collection, achieving better attribution capabilities, creating advanced offensive and defensive cyber capabilities, and expanding on game-changing capabilities, including artificial intelligence and cognitive computing.\nImproved intelligence collection overseas is a minimum first step for all nations seeking to address significant threats facing them in cyberspace. If a nation is able to understand the potential threats facing both its government as well as its private industry, it will be better placed to defend against such threats in the first instance and to take action to respond as needed. Such intelligence collection can also provide advance warning of a potential threat or may provide attribution of an attack in progress or when completed.\nWhile many of the nation-states operating against the United States and its allies in cyberspace have long sought to escape detection by concealing their activities through the use of non-attributable organizations and infrastructure, as well as the use FALL 2018, VOLUME XIX 55 GEN. KEITH B. ALEXANDER, USA (RET.), AND JAMIL N. JAFFER of co-opted systems, the United States and other nations have committed significant resources to addressing the attribution problem and have increased their ability to more reliably attribute attacks. Indeed, recent authoritative attributions by the US government of certain major attacks to nation-state actors, from WannaCry to North Korea to NotPetya to Russia, as well as a number of others, highlight this newer trend. At the same time, the reality for the United States and allied governments is that key actors, including Russia and China, are aggressively targeting non-governmental entities, particularly critical infrastructure providers, for which the government has limited access to data. Similarly, many of the hop points (computers used by attackers to obscure where the attacks originate) that are being used by attackers—whether nation-states or otherwise—reside on private sector networks. Governments like the United States often cannot directly access such hop points, whether for legal or operational reasons. As such, in order to truly extend its attribution capabilities, the US government and others must work closely with private industry in order to truly understand the nature and scope of attacks. Such collaboration will allow both industry and government to benefit from combining information about what is taking place inside the United States or other allied nations with the information collected overseas by their intelligence agencies to better attribute attacks and to prevent further incidents.\nDeveloping advanced offensive and defensive capabilities is likewise critical for further investment by the United States and its allies. Recent attacks have demonstrated that nation-states and non-nation-states alike have developed the ability to repurpose leaked foreign nation-state capabilities to their own ends as well as to develop significant new intelligence tools domestically.\nAs such, in order to truly extend its attribution capabilities, the US government and others must work closely with private industry in order to truly understand the nature and scope of attacks. Such collaboration will allow both industry and government to benefit from combining information about what is taking place inside the United States or other allied nations with the information collected overseas by their intelligence agencies to better attribute attacks and to prevent further incidents.\nBeing able to effectively defend against such nation-state-level capabilities is likely to be an important tool for cyber defenders going forward. At the same time, having the demonstrated capacity to use offensive cyber tools will likely be necessary to deter other states, including states that can't be deterred by other means like diplomatic pressure or sanctions.\nFinally, continuing to invest in and leverage game-changing capabilities, including cognitive computing and quantum systems, will be critical to maintaining the US and allied edge in cyberspace. The reality is that application of these capabilities has the ability to fundamentally and rapidly change the cyber battlespace. In particular, effective application of cognitive computing—which seeks to model human thought processes using computers—to large amounts of cyber-threat data can provide the ability to evaluate next steps that might be taken to defend against an evolving threat. Specifically, in a scenario in which a nation-state is able to attribute a particular pattern of behavior around a set of attacks, the application of cognitive computing may permit the defender to get ahead of future attacks GEORGETOWN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS or to identify them earlier in the kill chain. Similarly, the potential use of such capabilities to calculate a series of possible outcomes in a given threat scenario, such as the probability of adversary success, could also provide cyber defenders with hugely valuable information. In addition, the potential use of quantum capabilities—which apply certain aspects of quantum physics to allow computers to accomplish calculations much faster than is currently possible—to defeat encrypted malware could also provide cyber defenders with valuable information. This is so because aspects of today's most common encryption methodologies are based on the inability of current systems to rapidly conduct calculations against certain very large numbers (e.g. finding the prime factors of a very large number). Thus, if quantum computing allows much more rapid calculations against such numbers, key aspects of modern encryption—including that used to encrypt malware—may become significantly more vulnerable.61 ## Creating a Sustainable Cyber Deterrence Capability Deterrence in cyberspace also represents a key strategic area of focus for Chinese military scholars and war planners,62 as it does in the United States.63 The actual consequences of the application of traditional deterrence theory in cyberspace today remain somewhat opaque. While it is clear that nation-states with leading cyber capabilities like the United States, China, and Russia are not currently prepared to utilize their most robust capabilities against what they perceive as peer competitors because they do fear a potential response, it is also clear that other nations are willing to take specific limited actions that, in other contexts, might be seen as crossing the line against such major players. For example, the destructive nature of attacks undertaken in the continental United States against certain American private sector companies by Iran and North Korea64 represents a calculation (apparently correct—at least to date) by those nations that such action would not provoke a major response. Likewise, major nations appear to have taken the view that significant cyber activities against non-peer competitors, like Russia's attacks against Estonia and Ukraine,65 would likewise not provoke an effective response, whether by those nations or other nations with the ability to respond. At least in the latter scenario, the calculation that peer competitors would not risk a major confrontation over edge states or that such peer competitors remain concerned with their own cyber exposure to respond in that domain, appears also to have been correct. Lastly, at least in one instance, major nation-states have faced off in cyberspace, with Russia assessing that its manipulation of American public opinion through social media during the 2016 elections would not provoke a significant American response.66 In that case, we have seen a significant response in the form of public criticism, sanctions, expulsions of intelligence officers, and closure of diplomatic facilities, but we have yet to see the type of response that is likely to effectively limit such efforts in the future.\nIn order to effectively deter attacks in cyberspace, the United States and its allies must be willing to increasingly describe some measure of the nature and scope of their capabilities in the cyber domain and to set out specific criteria under which cyber-attacks may be responded to and the potential nature of such responses.67 Moreover, the government must be prepared to actually respond when such attacks take place. Today, little if any information is intentionally made public about the nature of the US's strategic and tactical capabilities in cyberspace. Indeed, what little is known GEN. KEITH B. ALEXANDER, USA (RET.), AND JAMIL N. JAFFER largely comes from leaks related to alleged cyber operations. The same is largely true of American allies. And while it is without question that the United States and its allies reserve the right to respond to cyber operations conducted against them, refusing to provide insight into some of the nation's capabilities in this arena makes it nearly impossible to credibly leverage deterrence based on a potential cyber-based response.\nSimilarly, without an understanding or a declared policy of certain redlines with respect to cyber operations, potential threat actors are left to guess about what actions might trigger a response and what the nature of that response might be. While strategic ambiguity has its place in international relations, it is most effective when such ambiguity is on the edges of a fairly clear policy. At the present time, in the cyber domain, given that little is understood about when and how nations may respond, it is unsurprising that we see various nations testing the boundaries and engaging in operations that may otherwise be deterred if it were understood that a clear response would be forthcoming. If the United States and its allies are able to agree to a basic set of rules of the road, this framework could create the basis for a sustainable deterrence architecture. The basic elements of such a set of rules can be based on analogies to traditional military or intelligence activities—cyber-attacks causing significant loss of life, physical damage to infrastructure, or significant financial harm or loss would be actionable, whereas traditional forms of espionage, such as a theft of government defense or foreign policy information, would not be. The obvious challenge to such an effort would be the more equivocal cases, such as attempts to influence public opinion, theft of significant amounts of intellectual property, attacks that cause limited physical damage, Similarly, without an understanding or a declared policy of certain redlines with respect to cyber operations, potential threat actors are left to guess about what actions might trigger a response and what the nature of that response might be. While strategic ambiguity has its place in international relations, it is most effective when such ambiguity is on the edges of a fairly clear policy.\nor efforts to penetrate infrastructure for long-term access versus immediate action, all of which may reasonably be analogized to traditional actions that may or may not provoke a response. The fact that these cases create a significant challenge, however, is not a reason to avoid making tough choices about how the United States and its allies ought to react to malicious cyber activities. To the contrary, the fact that there remains ambiguity in this area and that US and allied responses have been limited (at least in the public space) to date means that other nations are more likely to continue to probe our boundaries.\nFinally, as with all forms of deterrence, cyber deterrence will be effective only to the extent that nation-states are willing to stand by the redlines they set and actually enforce them. At the same time, long-term deterrence can be dramatically undermined where nation-states set unwise redlines or create redlines that they are not actually willing to enforce, as in the case of Syria's use of chemical weapons in 2012-13. As such, in cyberspace, significant attention must be given to establishing clear boundaries and setting out clear consequences only where governments are actually prepared and willing to take action.\nGEORGETOWN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS ENSURING US DOMINANCE IN CYBERSPACE # Conclusion The establishment of the SSF by China, which was informed by the creation of USCYBERCOM in the United States, highlights the importance of the United States and its allies undertaking a concerted effort to maintain their collective edge in the cyber domain. This will require a significant rethinking of the roles and responsibilities of the government and the private sector when it comes to cyber defense. It will demand significant investment in new, advanced capabilities and a new approach to deterrence in the cyber arena. All of these changes are within the realm of the possible, but significant barriers to success remain, including fundamental disconnects within the American political system and between the defense, intelligence, and homeland security communities in the government. Thus, if the United States is to maintain its relative dominance in cyberspace over the long term, it is likely to require a sustained commitment from the leadership of the executive branch and the commitment of a significant amount of political and financial resources in the near term.",

Keith B. Alexander, USA (Ret.), and Jamil N. Jaffer In late 2015, China announced the creation of its Strategic Support Force (SSF) to unify the People's Liberation Army's (PLA) cyber, space, and electronic warfare capabilities,¹ an effort that parallels the creation of United States Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) in 2009.² Just like the United States, in recent years China has begun to describe cyberspace as a separate domain of warfare and strategic competition.³ Both China and the United States believe that their respective defense establishments should play a central role in protection of national assets from threats in cyberspace.⁴ According to the US Department of Defense, the creation of the SSF likely represents China's\"first step in developing a cyber force that creates efficiencies by combining cyber reconnaissance, attack, and defense capabilities into one organization.\"⁵ This likewise parallels the mission of USCYBERCOM—namely, of achieving and maintaining superiority in cyberspace by unifying cyberspace operations, securing data and systems, and providing military options to leadership.⁶ Indeed, Chinese military authors cite the development of USCYBERCOM as having successfully combined cyber functions under a single command structure, including the combination of offensive and defense capabilities.⁷ Just as US Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta noted in 2012 that it is the responsibility of the Department of Defense to\"defend the nation\"in cyberspace,⁸ the Chinese view the role of the PLA's SSF as\"safeguard[ing] China's interests in new domains such as... cyberspace.\"⁹ Furthermore, USCYBERCOM explicitly differentiates its responsibility to\"defend the nation\"in cyberspace from its offensive capabilities and its support for active military operations.¹⁰ Similarly, Chinese military doctrine writers also differentiate between peacetime defensive operations and wartime military Gen. Keith B. Alexander, USA (Ret.), is the former director of the National Security Agency and founding commander of the US Cyber Command. General Alexander recently served as a member of the President's Task Force on Enhancing National Cybersecurity and currently serves as president and CEO of IronNet Cybersecurity, a startup cybersecurity firm, as well as in a number of other public and private roles.\nJamil N. Jaffer is the former chief counsel and senior advisor to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and senior counsel to the House Intelligence Committee as well as an associate counsel to President George W. Bush. Mr. Jaffer currently serves as founder of the National Security Institute at the Scalia Law School at George Mason University and as a visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution as well as a vice president at IronNet Cybersecurity. Certain portions of this paper—in particular the section on creating a more defensible national cyber ecosystem—are drawn directly or principally from testimony presented by General Alexander on April 11, 2018, before the House Armed Services Committee.\nGEN. KEITH B. ALEXANDER, USA (RET.), AND JAMIL N. JAFFER support and offensive operations.¹¹ At the same time, newer, evolving doctrine in both nations also recognizes that in the cyber domain—as well as in others—the current status quo represents more of a state of “continuous competition” rather than the traditional war-versus-peace paradigm¹² and also understands the cyber battlespace as one where the lines between defense and offense are increasingly fluid.¹³ Given that one primary goal of the SSF is to accelerate the development of Chinese offensive and defensive cyber capabilities,¹⁴ and given the rise of a number of other peer and near-peer competitors in cyberspace,¹⁵ as well as the inherently asymmetric nature of cyber capabilities, a key question for the United States is how it can maintain the relative dominance it has enjoyed in this new domain of warfare going forward.¹⁶ The reality today is that America’s relative hegemony in cyberspace as a domain of warfare is being (and will continue to be) contested in cyberspace. Today, the United States faces strategic threats in cyberspace from China as well as from Russia, two longtime key adversaries in this domain.¹⁷ The United States and its allies also face tactical threats from a range of actors including increasingly active nation-states like North Korea and Iran as well as a wide array of non-state actors, from criminal gangs to terrorist groups.¹⁸ And Newer, evolving doctrine in both nations also recognizes that in the cyber domain—as well as in others—the current status quo represents more of a state of “continuous competition” rather than the traditional war-versus-peace paradigm and also understands the cyber battlespace as one where the lines between defense and offense are increasingly fluid.\nA key question for the United States is how it can maintain the relative dominance it has enjoyed in this new domain of warfare going forward.\nsome of these latter actors are working on behalf of, or alongside, the nation-states that are also operating against the United States in the cyber domain.¹⁹ This paper argues that the best route to continued success for the United States in the cyber domain is to (1) create a more defensible national ecosystem at home and in partnership with key allies; (2) continue to invest significant resources in cyber intelligence collection, offensive and defensive cyber capability development, and game-changing capabilities, including cognitive computing and quantum systems; and (3) create a sustainable deterrence capability in the cyber realm.\n## Creating a More Defensible National Cyber Ecosystem In the modern era, it is critically important that governments fundamentally rethink their architectures for cyber defense. The reality is not only that nation-states like the United States and China view cyberspace doctrinally as a domain for warfare but also that globally cyberspace has become an actual domain of conflict. Indeed, the United States and its allies are very much in the throes today of a series of ongoing—albeit low-level—conflicts in cyberspace.²⁰ Moreover, these cyber conflicts not only have a classic political component to them but, in many instances, they also have a significant economic component. For example, in the case of China, the United States has long known that its economic security is being directly challenged through the use of GEORGETOWN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS ENSURING US DOMINANCE IN CYBERSPACE Chinese government cyber capabilities to siphon off massive amounts of economic wealth through the theft and coerced transfer of intellectual property that is at the heart of the modern American economy.²¹ In recognition of the critically important role that economic capabilities play, the recently released National Security Strategy makes clear that the United States views economic security as part and parcel of its national security interests.²² Moreover, the United States is hardly alone among its allies in facing down such threats. Japan and South Korea, for example, have both recently suffered significant economic theft in the form of cryptocurrency hacking allegedly undertaken by North Korea.²³ At the same time, economic threats are not the only challenges facing the United States and its allies in cyberspace. The national security of America and its allies is also directly threatened by nations like Russia, which have engaged in obvious efforts to undermine confidence in the American political system.²⁴ Russia has sought to embed long-term penetrations in critical infrastructure sectors in order to conduct espionage and prepare the battlespace for potential future conflict scenarios,²⁵ and has conducted what our government recently referred to as the most “destructive and costly cyber-attack in history.”²⁶ Concerns raised by these classic economic and political threats are further enhanced by the fact that nation-states like Iran²⁷ and North Korea,²⁸ which typically would not be viewed as near-peer competitors to the United States and its allies in the cyber domain, are nonetheless conducting significant cyber-attacks on United States soil and against American allies.²⁹ Given this range of threats and the fact that the United States and other nations find themselves currently in the middle of a very real series of (albeit minor) military skirmishes in cyberspace, it may be The national security of America and its allies is also directly threatened by nations like Russia, which have engaged in obvious efforts to undermine confidence in the American political system.\nsurprising that the United States still finds itself challenged in providing “for the common defense” of the nation in the cyber domain.³⁰ The challenges in the United States do not primarily relate to a lack of forces or capabilities.³¹ To the contrary, the creation of US Cyber Command in 2009 provides the United States with very real and robust capabilities in both the offensive and defensive areas, capabilities that have the ability to both protect the United States writ large and to make cyber deterrence a reality in the global arena.³² At least in the United States, the challenges to creating a more defensible national cybersecurity ecosystem relate principally to how core roles, responsibilities, and authorities are allocated. In particular, the United States faces two core challenges when it comes to cyberspace: how to organize as a government to defend and fight in this domain, and how to build jointness against The challenges in the United States do not primarily relate to a lack of forces or capabilities. To the contrary, the creation of US Cyber Command in 2009 provides the United States with very real and robust capabilities in both the offensive and defensive areas, capabilities that have the ability to both protect the United States writ large and to make cyber deterrence a reality in the global arena.\nFALL 2018, VOLUME XIX cyber-attacks between the public and private sectors during conflicts that require acting with both speed and vigor to defend the nation.33 One principal challenge facing the United States is that USCYBERCOM—ostensibly charged since 2012 with the mission of defending the nation against cyber-attacks—lacks clear authority and rules of engagement (ROE).34 The goal should not be to respond to an attack but rather to protect against an attack before damage to infrastructure occurs. Given the speed at which cyber conflicts take place, governments need to ensure that warfighters can act with speed and agility to stop an attack before an enemy strikes, as well as respond effectively to an attack in progress. This requires advance authority for USCYBERCOM to take action and clear ROE that provide a broad range of options to use in appropriate circumstances while also limiting action to appropriate bounds outside the United States. Although the idea of providing advance authority to take action that admittedly might spark a larger conflict is almost certainly controversial, if structured properly with appropriate limitations, effective civilian oversight, and significant, timely reporting to the legislative branch, many of the key concerns can be effectively mitigated.35 Similarly, within the United States, agencies like the Federal Bureau of Investigation will need advance authority to take action domestically against potential cyber actors who are utilizing co-opted infrastructure located at home.\nAt the same time, simply providing USCYBERCOM and other agencies with robust authorities and solid ROEs is not enough.36 Because the vast majority of American cyber infrastructure is owned and operated by the private sector, in order to defend the nation, the government must work closely with the private sector by setting the conditions for a truly defensible cyber infrastructure. This would include empowering private sector defensive capabilities and providing for interoperable capabilities that can be used if a national crisis requires direct government assistance to industry, as well as joint exercises to test out such operations.37 The fact is that no single entity—whether a private sector company or a government agency—can stand alone against the most capable threat actors.38 Indeed, in no other area do we expect individual private companies to defend themselves against nation-states.39 For example, while we reasonably expect private corporations to have high fences and armed guards around their warehouses to protect against thieves, we don't expect those same companies to have surface-to-air missiles on their warehouses to defend against foreign bombers dropping ordnance.40 When it comes to cyberspace, however, we expect exactly that: individual companies, standing alone, are expected to defend themselves against all comers, from script kiddies to nation-states.41 This is a policy destined to fail under its own weight.42 Rather than rely on private companies to defend themselves alone against such serious actors, governments should move to a collective defense architecture both within the private sector as well as between the public and private sectors.43 The first step would be industries sharing information on cyber threats at scale and speed within and across critical sectors and then, over time, between governments and the private sector more generally.44 Indeed, in order to stop an attack before it happens, governments need to be able to assess their enemy's plans, intentions, and capabilities and must be able to identify the attacks as they are progressing but before they actually have an impact. In many ways, the visibility needed to stop an attack before it has an impact can be analogized to the national air traffic control system.45 Successful, robust sharing of cyber-threat ENSURING US DOMINANCE IN CYBERSPACE data between the government and industry can help empower the development of such a cyber common operational picture.⁴⁶ Just as the air traffic control picture ensures aviation safety and helps synchronize government and civil flights, a cyber common operational picture can help synchronize our national common cyber defense and enable rapid response in a time of crisis.⁴⁷ In the United States, the energy and financial sectors, working collaboratively with government-funded institutions⁴⁸ and outside providers,⁴⁹ are beginning to lead in this space by creating robust information sharing collaborations both internally to these sectors, as well as with the government.⁵⁰ Beyond creating a common operational picture, governments can also assist industry more directly.⁵¹ They can do so by sharing cyber-threat information with the private sector in real time and at machine speed.⁵² In addition, governments could use their overseas intelligence-collection architectures to collect on threats to their private sector and pass on this information—even in its highly classified form—to home industry so that it may be used to defend the nation's economic base.⁵³ Finally, governments and private industry ought to work together to develop interoperable capabilities that can be utilized in a crisis.⁵⁴ Such interoperable capabilities would allow governments to directly provide assistance to the private sector and utilize appropriate governmental authorities to respond to attacks in progress.⁵⁵ Moreover, exercising these capabilities in advance of an &gt; Governments and private industry ought to work together to develop interoperable capabilities that can be utilized in a crisis.\nactual threat would allow both governments and private industry to be prepared in actual cyber conflict scenario.⁵⁶ ## Investing Resources in Key Cyber Capabilities Both the United States and China have made clear that they expect to invest significant resources in building cyber capabilities in the near term.⁵⁷ The same is true for many actors around the world, including edge competitors like Iran and North Korea. As a result, significant investment in key areas will be required for the United States and its allies to continue to maintain their collective lead in cyberspace and to ensure more comprehensive national defense across the board. Some of the key areas for such investment ought to include improving cyber intelligence collection, achieving better attribution capabilities, creating advanced offensive and defensive cyber capabilities, and expanding on game-changing capabilities, including artificial intelligence and cognitive computing.\nImproved intelligence collection overseas is a minimum first step for all nations seeking to address significant threats facing them in cyberspace. If a nation is able to understand the potential threats facing both its government as well as its private industry, it will be better placed to defend against such threats in the first instance and to take action to respond as needed. Such intelligence collection can also provide advance warning of a potential threat or may provide attribution of an attack in progress or when completed.\nWhile many of the nation-states operating against the United States and its allies in cyberspace have long sought to escape detection by concealing their activities through the use of non-attributable organizations and infrastructure, as well as the use FALL 2018, VOLUME XIX 55 GEN. KEITH B. ALEXANDER, USA (RET.), AND JAMIL N. JAFFER of co-opted systems, the United States and other nations have committed significant resources to addressing the attribution problem and have increased their ability to more reliably attribute attacks. Indeed, recent authoritative attributions by the US government of certain major attacks to nation-state actors, from WannaCry to North Korea to NotPetya to Russia, as well as a number of others, highlight this newer trend. At the same time, the reality for the United States and allied governments is that key actors, including Russia and China, are aggressively targeting non-governmental entities, particularly critical infrastructure providers, for which the government has limited access to data. Similarly, many of the hop points (computers used by attackers to obscure where the attacks originate) that are being used by attackers—whether nation-states or otherwise—reside on private sector networks. Governments like the United States often cannot directly access such hop points, whether for legal or operational reasons. As such, in order to truly extend its attribution capabilities, the US government and others must work closely with private industry in order to truly understand the nature and scope of attacks. Such collaboration will allow both industry and government to benefit from combining information about what is taking place inside the United States or other allied nations with the information collected overseas by their intelligence agencies to better attribute attacks and to prevent further incidents.\nDeveloping advanced offensive and defensive capabilities is likewise critical for further investment by the United States and its allies. Recent attacks have demonstrated that nation-states and non-nation-states alike have developed the ability to repurpose leaked foreign nation-state capabilities to their own ends as well as to develop significant new intelligence tools domestically.\nAs such, in order to truly extend its attribution capabilities, the US government and others must work closely with private industry in order to truly understand the nature and scope of attacks. Such collaboration will allow both industry and government to benefit from combining information about what is taking place inside the United States or other allied nations with the information collected overseas by their intelligence agencies to better attribute attacks and to prevent further incidents.\nBeing able to effectively defend against such nation-state-level capabilities is likely to be an important tool for cyber defenders going forward. At the same time, having the demonstrated capacity to use offensive cyber tools will likely be necessary to deter other states, including states that can't be deterred by other means like diplomatic pressure or sanctions.\nFinally, continuing to invest in and leverage game-changing capabilities, including cognitive computing and quantum systems, will be critical to maintaining the US and allied edge in cyberspace. The reality is that application of these capabilities has the ability to fundamentally and rapidly change the cyber battlespace. In particular, effective application of cognitive computing—which seeks to model human thought processes using computers—to large amounts of cyber-threat data can provide the ability to evaluate next steps that might be taken to defend against an evolving threat. Specifically, in a scenario in which a nation-state is able to attribute a particular pattern of behavior around a set of attacks, the application of cognitive computing may permit the defender to get ahead of future attacks GEORGETOWN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS or to identify them earlier in the kill chain. Similarly, the potential use of such capabilities to calculate a series of possible outcomes in a given threat scenario, such as the probability of adversary success, could also provide cyber defenders with hugely valuable information. In addition, the potential use of quantum capabilities—which apply certain aspects of quantum physics to allow computers to accomplish calculations much faster than is currently possible—to defeat encrypted malware could also provide cyber defenders with valuable information. This is so because aspects of today's most common encryption methodologies are based on the inability of current systems to rapidly conduct calculations against certain very large numbers (e.g. finding the prime factors of a very large number). Thus, if quantum computing allows much more rapid calculations against such numbers, key aspects of modern encryption—including that used to encrypt malware—may become significantly more vulnerable.61 ## Creating a Sustainable Cyber Deterrence Capability Deterrence in cyberspace also represents a key strategic area of focus for Chinese military scholars and war planners,62 as it does in the United States.63 The actual consequences of the application of traditional deterrence theory in cyberspace today remain somewhat opaque. While it is clear that nation-states with leading cyber capabilities like the United States, China, and Russia are not currently prepared to utilize their most robust capabilities against what they perceive as peer competitors because they do fear a potential response, it is also clear that other nations are willing to take specific limited actions that, in other contexts, might be seen as crossing the line against such major players. For example, the destructive nature of attacks undertaken in the continental United States against certain American private sector companies by Iran and North Korea64 represents a calculation (apparently correct—at least to date) by those nations that such action would not provoke a major response. Likewise, major nations appear to have taken the view that significant cyber activities against non-peer competitors, like Russia's attacks against Estonia and Ukraine,65 would likewise not provoke an effective response, whether by those nations or other nations with the ability to respond. At least in the latter scenario, the calculation that peer competitors would not risk a major confrontation over edge states or that such peer competitors remain concerned with their own cyber exposure to respond in that domain, appears also to have been correct. Lastly, at least in one instance, major nation-states have faced off in cyberspace, with Russia assessing that its manipulation of American public opinion through social media during the 2016 elections would not provoke a significant American response.66 In that case, we have seen a significant response in the form of public criticism, sanctions, expulsions of intelligence officers, and closure of diplomatic facilities, but we have yet to see the type of response that is likely to effectively limit such efforts in the future.\nIn order to effectively deter attacks in cyberspace, the United States and its allies must be willing to increasingly describe some measure of the nature and scope of their capabilities in the cyber domain and to set out specific criteria under which cyber-attacks may be responded to and the potential nature of such responses.67 Moreover, the government must be prepared to actually respond when such attacks take place.

Today, the United States faces strategic threats in cyberspace from China as well as from Russia, two longtime key adversaries in this domain.¹⁷ The United States and its allies also face tactical threats from a range of actors including increasingly active nation-states like North Korea and Iran as well as a wide array of non-state actors, from criminal gangs to terrorist groups.¹⁸ And\nNewer, evolving doctrine in both nations also recognizes that in the cyber domain—as well as in others—the current status quo represents more of a state of “continuous competition” rather than the traditional war-versus-peace paradigm and also understands the cyber battlespace as one where the lines between defense and offense are increasingly fluid.\nA key question for the United States is how it can maintain the relative dominance it has enjoyed in this new domain of warfare going forward.\nsome of these latter actors are working on behalf of, or alongside, the nation-states that are also operating against the United States in the cyber domain.¹⁹\nThis paper argues that the best route to continued success for the United States in the cyber domain is to (1) create a more defensible national ecosystem at home and in partnership with key allies; (2) continue to invest significant resources in cyber intelligence collection, offensive and defensive cyber capability development, and game-changing capabilities, including cognitive computing and quantum systems; and (3) create a sustainable deterrence capability in the cyber realm.\n## Creating a More Defensible National Cyber Ecosystem\nIn the modern era, it is critically important that governments fundamentally rethink their architectures for cyber defense. The reality is not only that nation-states like the United States and China view cyberspace doctrinally as a domain for warfare but also that globally cyberspace has become an actual domain of conflict. Indeed, the United States and its allies are very much in the throes today of a series of ongoing—albeit low-level—conflicts in cyberspace.²⁰ Moreover, these cyber conflicts not only have a classic political component to them but, in many instances, they also have a significant economic component. For example, in the case of China, the United States has long known that its economic security is being directly challenged through the use of\nGEORGETOWN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS\nENSURING US DOMINANCE IN CYBERSPACE\nChinese government cyber capabilities to siphon off massive amounts of economic wealth through the theft and coerced transfer of intellectual property that is at the heart of the modern American economy.²¹ In recognition of the critically important role that economic capabilities play, the recently released National Security Strategy makes clear that the United States views economic security as part and parcel of its national security interests.²² Moreover, the United States is hardly alone among its allies in facing down such threats. Japan and South Korea, for example, have both recently suffered significant economic theft in the form of cryptocurrency hacking allegedly undertaken by North Korea.²³\nAt the same time, economic threats are not the only challenges facing the United States and its allies in cyberspace. The national security of America and its allies is also directly threatened by nations like Russia, which have engaged in obvious efforts to undermine confidence in the American political system.²⁴ Russia has sought to embed long-term penetrations in critical infrastructure sectors in order to conduct espionage and prepare the battlespace for potential future conflict scenarios,²⁵ and has conducted what our government recently referred to as the most “destructive and costly cyber-attack in history.”²⁶ Concerns raised by these classic economic and political threats are further enhanced by the fact that nation-states like Iran²⁷ and North Korea,²⁸ which typically would not be viewed as near-peer competitors to the United States and its allies in the cyber domain, are nonetheless conducting significant cyber-attacks on United States soil and against American allies.²⁹\nGiven this range of threats and the fact that the United States and other nations find themselves currently in the middle of a very real series of (albeit minor) military skirmishes in cyberspace, it may be\nThe national security of America and its allies is also directly threatened by nations like Russia, which have engaged in obvious efforts to undermine confidence in the American political system.\nsurprising that the United States still finds itself challenged in providing “for the common defense” of the nation in the cyber domain.³⁰ The challenges in the United States do not primarily relate to a lack of forces or capabilities.³¹ To the contrary, the creation of US Cyber Command in 2009 provides the United States with very real and robust capabilities in both the offensive and defensive areas, capabilities that have the ability to both protect the United States writ large and to make cyber deterrence a reality in the global arena.³²\nAt least in the United States, the challenges to creating a more defensible national cybersecurity ecosystem relate principally to how core roles, responsibilities, and authorities are allocated. In particular, the United States faces two core challenges when it comes to cyberspace: how to organize as a government to defend and fight in this domain, and how to build jointness against\nThe challenges in the United States do not primarily relate to a lack of forces or capabilities. To the contrary, the creation of US Cyber Command in 2009 provides the United States with very real and robust capabilities in both the offensive and defensive areas, capabilities that have the ability to both protect the United States writ large and to make cyber deterrence a reality in the global arena.\nFALL 2018, VOLUME XIX\ncyber-attacks between the public and private sectors during conflicts that require acting with both speed and vigor to defend the nation.33\nOne principal challenge facing the United States is that USCYBERCOM—ostensibly charged since 2012 with the mission of defending the nation against cyber-attacks—lacks clear authority and rules of engagement (ROE).34 The goal should not be to respond to an attack but rather to protect against an attack before damage to infrastructure occurs. Given the speed at which cyber conflicts take place, governments need to ensure that warfighters can act with speed and agility to stop an attack before an enemy strikes, as well as respond effectively to an attack in progress. This requires advance authority for USCYBERCOM to take action and clear ROE that provide a broad range of options to use in appropriate circumstances while also limiting action to appropriate bounds outside the United States. Although the idea of providing advance authority to take action that admittedly might spark a larger conflict is almost certainly controversial, if structured properly with appropriate limitations, effective civilian oversight, and significant, timely reporting to the legislative branch, many of the key concerns can be effectively mitigated.35 Similarly, within the United States, agencies like the Federal Bureau of Investigation will need advance authority to take action domestically against potential cyber actors who are utilizing co-opted infrastructure located at home.\nAt the same time, simply providing USCYBERCOM and other agencies with robust authorities and solid ROEs is not enough.36 Because the vast majority of American cyber infrastructure is owned and operated by the private sector, in order to defend the nation, the government must work closely with the private sector by setting the conditions for a truly defensible cyber infrastructure. This would include empowering private sector defensive capabilities and providing for interoperable capabilities that can be used if a national crisis requires direct government assistance to industry, as well as joint exercises to test out such operations.37\nThe fact is that no single entity—whether a private sector company or a government agency—can stand alone against the most capable threat actors.38 Indeed, in no other area do we expect individual private companies to defend themselves against nation-states.39 For example, while we reasonably expect private corporations to have high fences and armed guards around their warehouses to protect against thieves, we don't expect those same companies to have surface-to-air missiles on their warehouses to defend against foreign bombers dropping ordnance.40 When it comes to cyberspace, however, we expect exactly that: individual companies, standing alone, are expected to defend themselves against all comers, from script kiddies to nation-states.41 This is a policy destined to fail under its own weight.42\nRather than rely on private companies to defend themselves alone against such serious actors, governments should move to a collective defense architecture both within the private sector as well as between the public and private sectors.43 The first step would be industries sharing information on cyber threats at scale and speed within and across critical sectors and then, over time, between governments and the private sector more generally.44 Indeed, in order to stop an attack before it happens, governments need to be able to assess their enemy's plans, intentions, and capabilities and must be able to identify the attacks as they are progressing but before they actually have an impact. In many ways, the visibility needed to stop an attack before it has an impact can be analogized to the national air traffic control system.45 Successful, robust sharing of cyber-threat\nENSURING US DOMINANCE IN CYBERSPACE\ndata between the government and industry can help empower the development of such a cyber common operational picture.⁴⁶ Just as the air traffic control picture ensures aviation safety and helps synchronize government and civil flights, a cyber common operational picture can help synchronize our national common cyber defense and enable rapid response in a time of crisis.⁴⁷ In the United States, the energy and financial sectors, working collaboratively with government-funded institutions⁴⁸ and outside providers,⁴⁹ are beginning to lead in this space by creating robust information sharing collaborations both internally to these sectors, as well as with the government.⁵⁰\nBeyond creating a common operational picture, governments can also assist industry more directly.⁵¹ They can do so by sharing cyber-threat information with the private sector in real time and at machine speed.⁵² In addition, governments could use their overseas intelligence-collection architectures to collect on threats to their private sector and pass on this information—even in its highly classified form—to home industry so that it may be used to defend the nation's economic base.⁵³\nFinally, governments and private industry ought to work together to develop interoperable capabilities that can be utilized in a crisis.⁵⁴ Such interoperable capabilities would allow governments to directly provide assistance to the private sector and utilize appropriate governmental authorities to respond to attacks in progress.⁵⁵ Moreover, exercising these capabilities in advance of an\n&gt; Governments and private industry ought to work together to develop interoperable capabilities that can be utilized in a crisis.\nactual threat would allow both governments and private industry to be prepared in actual cyber conflict scenario.⁵⁶\n## Investing Resources in Key Cyber Capabilities\nBoth the United States and China have made clear that they expect to invest significant resources in building cyber capabilities in the near term.⁵⁷ The same is true for many actors around the world, including edge competitors like Iran and North Korea. As a result, significant investment in key areas will be required for the United States and its allies to continue to maintain their collective lead in cyberspace and to ensure more comprehensive national defense across the board. Some of the key areas for such investment ought to include improving cyber intelligence collection, achieving better attribution capabilities, creating advanced offensive and defensive cyber capabilities, and expanding on game-changing capabilities, including artificial intelligence and cognitive computing.\nImproved intelligence collection overseas is a minimum first step for all nations seeking to address significant threats facing them in cyberspace. If a nation is able to understand the potential threats facing both its government as well as its private industry, it will be better placed to defend against such threats in the first instance and to take action to respond as needed. Such intelligence collection can also provide advance warning of a potential threat or may provide attribution of an attack in progress or when completed.\nWhile many of the nation-states operating against the United States and its allies in cyberspace have long sought to escape detection by concealing their activities through the use of non-attributable organizations and infrastructure, as well as the use\nFALL 2018, VOLUME XIX 55\nGEN. KEITH B. ALEXANDER, USA (RET.), AND JAMIL N. JAFFER\nof co-opted systems, $^{58}$ the United States and other nations have committed significant resources to addressing the attribution problem and have increased their ability to more reliably attribute attacks. $^{59}$ Indeed, recent authoritative attributions by the US government of certain major attacks to nation-state actors, from WannaCry to North Korea to NotPetya to Russia, as well as a number of others, highlight this newer trend. $^{60}$ At the same time, the reality for the United States and allied governments is that key actors, including Russia and China, are aggressively targeting non-governmental entities, particularly critical infrastructure providers, for which the government has limited access to data. Similarly, many of the hop points (computers used by attackers to obscure where the attacks originate) that are being used by attackers—whether nation-states or otherwise—reside on private sector networks. Governments like the United States often cannot directly access such hop points, whether for legal or operational reasons. As such, in order to truly extend its attribution capabilities, the US government and others must work closely with private industry in order to truly understand the nature and scope of attacks. Such collaboration will allow both industry and government to benefit from combining information about what is taking place inside the United States or other allied nations with the information collected overseas by their intelligence agencies to better attribute attacks and to prevent further incidents.\nDeveloping advanced offensive and defensive capabilities is likewise critical for further investment by the United States and its allies. Recent attacks have demonstrated that nation-states and non-nation-states alike have developed the ability to repurpose leaked foreign nation-state capabilities to their own ends as well as to develop significant new intelligence tools domestically.\nAs such, in order to truly extend its attribution capabilities, the US government and others must work closely with private industry in order to truly understand the nature and scope of attacks. Such collaboration will allow both industry and government to benefit from combining information about what is taking place inside the United States or other allied nations with the information collected overseas by their intelligence agencies to better attribute attacks and to prevent further incidents.\nBeing able to effectively defend against such nation-state-level capabilities is likely to be an important tool for cyber defenders going forward. At the same time, having the demonstrated capacity to use offensive cyber tools will likely be necessary to deter other states, including states that can't be deterred by other means like diplomatic pressure or sanctions.\nFinally, continuing to invest in and leverage game-changing capabilities, including cognitive computing and quantum systems, will be critical to maintaining the US and allied edge in cyberspace. The reality is that application of these capabilities has the ability to fundamentally and rapidly change the cyber battlespace. In particular, effective application of cognitive computing—which seeks to model human thought processes using computers—to large amounts of cyber-threat data can provide the ability to evaluate next steps that might be taken to defend against an evolving threat. Specifically, in a scenario in which a nation-state is able to attribute a particular pattern of behavior around a set of attacks, the application of cognitive computing may permit the defender to get ahead of future attacks\nGEORGETOWN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS\nor to identify them earlier in the kill chain. Similarly, the potential use of such capabilities to calculate a series of possible outcomes in a given threat scenario, such as the probability of adversary success, could also provide cyber defenders with hugely valuable information. In addition, the potential use of quantum capabilities—which apply certain aspects of quantum physics to allow computers to accomplish calculations much faster than is currently possible—to defeat encrypted malware could also provide cyber defenders with valuable information. This is so because aspects of today's most common encryption methodologies are based on the inability of current systems to rapidly conduct calculations against certain very large numbers (e.g. finding the prime factors of a very large number). Thus, if quantum computing allows much more rapid calculations against such numbers, key aspects of modern encryption—including that used to encrypt malware—may become significantly more vulnerable.61\n## Creating a Sustainable Cyber Deterrence Capability\nDeterrence in cyberspace also represents a key strategic area of focus for Chinese military scholars and war planners,62 as it does in the United States.63 The actual consequences of the application of traditional deterrence theory in cyberspace today remain somewhat opaque. While it is clear that nation-states with leading cyber capabilities like the United States, China, and Russia are not currently prepared to utilize their most robust capabilities against what they perceive as peer competitors because they do fear a potential response, it is also clear that other nations are willing to take specific limited actions that, in other contexts, might be seen as crossing the line against such major players. For example, the destructive nature of attacks undertaken in the continental United States against certain American private sector companies by Iran and North Korea64 represents a calculation (apparently correct—at least to date) by those nations that such action would not provoke a major response. Likewise, major nations appear to have taken the view that significant cyber activities against non-peer competitors, like Russia's attacks against Estonia and Ukraine,65 would likewise not provoke an effective response, whether by those nations or other nations with the ability to respond. At least in the latter scenario, the calculation that peer competitors would not risk a major confrontation over edge states or that such peer competitors remain concerned with their own cyber exposure to respond in that domain, appears also to have been correct. Lastly, at least in one instance, major nation-states have faced off in cyberspace, with Russia assessing that its manipulation of American public opinion through social media during the 2016 elections would not provoke a significant American response.66 In that case, we have seen a significant response in the form of public criticism, sanctions, expulsions of intelligence officers, and closure of diplomatic facilities, but we have yet to see the type of response that is likely to effectively limit such efforts in the future.\nIn order to effectively deter attacks in cyberspace, the United States and its allies must be willing to increasingly describe some measure of the nature and scope of their capabilities in the cyber domain and to set out specific criteria under which cyber-attacks may be responded to and the potential nature of such responses.67 Moreover, the government must be prepared to actually respond when such attacks take place. Today, little if any information is intentionally made public about the nature of the US's strategic and tactical capabilities in cyberspace. Indeed, what little is known\nGEN. KEITH B.

The reality is not only that nation-states like the United States and China view cyberspace doctrinally as a domain for warfare but also that globally cyberspace has become an actual domain of conflict. Indeed, the United States and its allies are very much in the throes today of a series of ongoing—albeit low-level—conflicts in cyberspace.²⁰ Moreover, these cyber conflicts not only have a classic political component to them but, in many instances, they also have a significant economic component. For example, in the case of China, the United States has long known that its economic security is being directly challenged through the use of GEORGETOWN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS ENSURING US DOMINANCE IN CYBERSPACE Chinese government cyber capabilities to siphon off massive amounts of economic wealth through the theft and coerced transfer of intellectual property that is at the heart of the modern American economy.²¹ In recognition of the critically important role that economic capabilities play, the recently released National Security Strategy makes clear that the United States views economic security as part and parcel of its national security interests.²² Moreover, the United States is hardly alone among its allies in facing down such threats. Japan and South Korea, for example, have both recently suffered significant economic theft in the form of cryptocurrency hacking allegedly undertaken by North Korea.²³ At the same time, economic threats are not the only challenges facing the United States and its allies in cyberspace. The national security of America and its allies is also directly threatened by nations like Russia, which have engaged in obvious efforts to undermine confidence in the American political system.²⁴ Russia has sought to embed long-term penetrations in critical infrastructure sectors in order to conduct espionage and prepare the battlespace for potential future conflict scenarios,²⁵ and has conducted what our government recently referred to as the most “destructive and costly cyber-attack in history.”²⁶ Concerns raised by these classic economic and political threats are further enhanced by the fact that nation-states like Iran²⁷ and North Korea,²⁸ which typically would not be viewed as near-peer competitors to the United States and its allies in the cyber domain, are nonetheless conducting significant cyber-attacks on United States soil and against American allies.²⁹ Given this range of threats and the fact that the United States and other nations find themselves currently in the middle of a very real series of (albeit minor) military skirmishes in cyberspace, it may be The national security of America and its allies is also directly threatened by nations like Russia, which have engaged in obvious efforts to undermine confidence in the American political system.\nsurprising that the United States still finds itself challenged in providing “for the common defense” of the nation in the cyber domain.³⁰ The challenges in the United States do not primarily relate to a lack of forces or capabilities.³¹ To the contrary, the creation of US Cyber Command in 2009 provides the United States with very real and robust capabilities in both the offensive and defensive areas, capabilities that have the ability to both protect the United States writ large and to make cyber deterrence a reality in the global arena.³² At least in the United States, the challenges to creating a more defensible national cybersecurity ecosystem relate principally to how core roles, responsibilities, and authorities are allocated. In particular, the United States faces two core challenges when it comes to cyberspace: how to organize as a government to defend and fight in this domain, and how to build jointness against The challenges in the United States do not primarily relate to a lack of forces or capabilities. To the contrary, the creation of US Cyber Command in 2009 provides the United States with very real and robust capabilities in both the offensive and defensive areas, capabilities that have the ability to both protect the United States writ large and to make cyber deterrence a reality in the global arena.\nFALL 2018, VOLUME XIX cyber-attacks between the public and private sectors during conflicts that require acting with both speed and vigor to defend the nation.33 One principal challenge facing the United States is that USCYBERCOM—ostensibly charged since 2012 with the mission of defending the nation against cyber-attacks—lacks clear authority and rules of engagement (ROE).34 The goal should not be to respond to an attack but rather to protect against an attack before damage to infrastructure occurs. Given the speed at which cyber conflicts take place, governments need to ensure that warfighters can act with speed and agility to stop an attack before an enemy strikes, as well as respond effectively to an attack in progress. This requires advance authority for USCYBERCOM to take action and clear ROE that provide a broad range of options to use in appropriate circumstances while also limiting action to appropriate bounds outside the United States. Although the idea of providing advance authority to take action that admittedly might spark a larger conflict is almost certainly controversial, if structured properly with appropriate limitations, effective civilian oversight, and significant, timely reporting to the legislative branch, many of the key concerns can be effectively mitigated.35 Similarly, within the United States, agencies like the Federal Bureau of Investigation will need advance authority to take action domestically against potential cyber actors who are utilizing co-opted infrastructure located at home.\nAt the same time, simply providing USCYBERCOM and other agencies with robust authorities and solid ROEs is not enough.36 Because the vast majority of American cyber infrastructure is owned and operated by the private sector, in order to defend the nation, the government must work closely with the private sector by setting the conditions for a truly defensible cyber infrastructure. This would include empowering private sector defensive capabilities and providing for interoperable capabilities that can be used if a national crisis requires direct government assistance to industry, as well as joint exercises to test out such operations.37 The fact is that no single entity—whether a private sector company or a government agency—can stand alone against the most capable threat actors.38 Indeed, in no other area do we expect individual private companies to defend themselves against nation-states.39 For example, while we reasonably expect private corporations to have high fences and armed guards around their warehouses to protect against thieves, we don't expect those same companies to have surface-to-air missiles on their warehouses to defend against foreign bombers dropping ordnance.40 When it comes to cyberspace, however, we expect exactly that: individual companies, standing alone, are expected to defend themselves against all comers, from script kiddies to nation-states.41 This is a policy destined to fail under its own weight.42 Rather than rely on private companies to defend themselves alone against such serious actors, governments should move to a collective defense architecture both within the private sector as well as between the public and private sectors.43 The first step would be industries sharing information on cyber threats at scale and speed within and across critical sectors and then, over time, between governments and the private sector more generally.44 Indeed, in order to stop an attack before it happens, governments need to be able to assess their enemy's plans, intentions, and capabilities and must be able to identify the attacks as they are progressing but before they actually have an impact. In many ways, the visibility needed to stop an attack before it has an impact can be analogized to the national air traffic control system.45 Successful, robust sharing of cyber-threat ENSURING US DOMINANCE IN CYBERSPACE data between the government and industry can help empower the development of such a cyber common operational picture.⁴⁶ Just as the air traffic control picture ensures aviation safety and helps synchronize government and civil flights, a cyber common operational picture can help synchronize our national common cyber defense and enable rapid response in a time of crisis.⁴⁷ In the United States, the energy and financial sectors, working collaboratively with government-funded institutions⁴⁸ and outside providers,⁴⁹ are beginning to lead in this space by creating robust information sharing collaborations both internally to these sectors, as well as with the government.⁵⁰ Beyond creating a common operational picture, governments can also assist industry more directly.⁵¹ They can do so by sharing cyber-threat information with the private sector in real time and at machine speed.⁵² In addition, governments could use their overseas intelligence-collection architectures to collect on threats to their private sector and pass on this information—even in its highly classified form—to home industry so that it may be used to defend the nation's economic base.⁵³ Finally, governments and private industry ought to work together to develop interoperable capabilities that can be utilized in a crisis.⁵⁴ Such interoperable capabilities would allow governments to directly provide assistance to the private sector and utilize appropriate governmental authorities to respond to attacks in progress.⁵⁵ Moreover, exercising these capabilities in advance of an &gt; Governments and private industry ought to work together to develop interoperable capabilities that can be utilized in a crisis.\nactual threat would allow both governments and private industry to be prepared in actual cyber conflict scenario.⁵⁶ ## Investing Resources in Key Cyber Capabilities Both the United States and China have made clear that they expect to invest significant resources in building cyber capabilities in the near term.⁵⁷ The same is true for many actors around the world, including edge competitors like Iran and North Korea. As a result, significant investment in key areas will be required for the United States and its allies to continue to maintain their collective lead in cyberspace and to ensure more comprehensive national defense across the board. Some of the key areas for such investment ought to include improving cyber intelligence collection, achieving better attribution capabilities, creating advanced offensive and defensive cyber capabilities, and expanding on game-changing capabilities, including artificial intelligence and cognitive computing.\nImproved intelligence collection overseas is a minimum first step for all nations seeking to address significant threats facing them in cyberspace. If a nation is able to understand the potential threats facing both its government as well as its private industry, it will be better placed to defend against such threats in the first instance and to take action to respond as needed. Such intelligence collection can also provide advance warning of a potential threat or may provide attribution of an attack in progress or when completed.\nWhile many of the nation-states operating against the United States and its allies in cyberspace have long sought to escape detection by concealing their activities through the use of non-attributable organizations and infrastructure, as well as the use FALL 2018, VOLUME XIX 55 GEN. KEITH B. ALEXANDER, USA (RET.), AND JAMIL N. JAFFER of co-opted systems, the United States and other nations have committed significant resources to addressing the attribution problem and have increased their ability to more reliably attribute attacks. Indeed, recent authoritative attributions by the US government of certain major attacks to nation-state actors, from WannaCry to North Korea to NotPetya to Russia, as well as a number of others, highlight this newer trend. At the same time, the reality for the United States and allied governments is that key actors, including Russia and China, are aggressively targeting non-governmental entities, particularly critical infrastructure providers, for which the government has limited access to data. Similarly, many of the hop points (computers used by attackers to obscure where the attacks originate) that are being used by attackers—whether nation-states or otherwise—reside on private sector networks. Governments like the United States often cannot directly access such hop points, whether for legal or operational reasons. As such, in order to truly extend its attribution capabilities, the US government and others must work closely with private industry in order to truly understand the nature and scope of attacks. Such collaboration will allow both industry and government to benefit from combining information about what is taking place inside the United States or other allied nations with the information collected overseas by their intelligence agencies to better attribute attacks and to prevent further incidents.\nDeveloping advanced offensive and defensive capabilities is likewise critical for further investment by the United States and its allies. Recent attacks have demonstrated that nation-states and non-nation-states alike have developed the ability to repurpose leaked foreign nation-state capabilities to their own ends as well as to develop significant new intelligence tools domestically.\nAs such, in order to truly extend its attribution capabilities, the US government and others must work closely with private industry in order to truly understand the nature and scope of attacks. Such collaboration will allow both industry and government to benefit from combining information about what is taking place inside the United States or other allied nations with the information collected overseas by their intelligence agencies to better attribute attacks and to prevent further incidents.\nBeing able to effectively defend against such nation-state-level capabilities is likely to be an important tool for cyber defenders going forward. At the same time, having the demonstrated capacity to use offensive cyber tools will likely be necessary to deter other states, including states that can't be deterred by other means like diplomatic pressure or sanctions.\nFinally, continuing to invest in and leverage game-changing capabilities, including cognitive computing and quantum systems, will be critical to maintaining the US and allied edge in cyberspace. The reality is that application of these capabilities has the ability to fundamentally and rapidly change the cyber battlespace. In particular, effective application of cognitive computing—which seeks to model human thought processes using computers—to large amounts of cyber-threat data can provide the ability to evaluate next steps that might be taken to defend against an evolving threat. Specifically, in a scenario in which a nation-state is able to attribute a particular pattern of behavior around a set of attacks, the application of cognitive computing may permit the defender to get ahead of future attacks GEORGETOWN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS or to identify them earlier in the kill chain. Similarly, the potential use of such capabilities to calculate a series of possible outcomes in a given threat scenario, such as the probability of adversary success, could also provide cyber defenders with hugely valuable information. In addition, the potential use of quantum capabilities—which apply certain aspects of quantum physics to allow computers to accomplish calculations much faster than is currently possible—to defeat encrypted malware could also provide cyber defenders with valuable information. This is so because aspects of today's most common encryption methodologies are based on the inability of current systems to rapidly conduct calculations against certain very large numbers (e.g. finding the prime factors of a very large number). Thus, if quantum computing allows much more rapid calculations against such numbers, key aspects of modern encryption—including that used to encrypt malware—may become significantly more vulnerable.61 ## Creating a Sustainable Cyber Deterrence Capability Deterrence in cyberspace also represents a key strategic area of focus for Chinese military scholars and war planners,62 as it does in the United States.63 The actual consequences of the application of traditional deterrence theory in cyberspace today remain somewhat opaque. While it is clear that nation-states with leading cyber capabilities like the United States, China, and Russia are not currently prepared to utilize their most robust capabilities against what they perceive as peer competitors because they do fear a potential response, it is also clear that other nations are willing to take specific limited actions that, in other contexts, might be seen as crossing the line against such major players. For example, the destructive nature of attacks undertaken in the continental United States against certain American private sector companies by Iran and North Korea64 represents a calculation (apparently correct—at least to date) by those nations that such action would not provoke a major response. Likewise, major nations appear to have taken the view that significant cyber activities against non-peer competitors, like Russia's attacks against Estonia and Ukraine,65 would likewise not provoke an effective response, whether by those nations or other nations with the ability to respond. At least in the latter scenario, the calculation that peer competitors would not risk a major confrontation over edge states or that such peer competitors remain concerned with their own cyber exposure to respond in that domain, appears also to have been correct. Lastly, at least in one instance, major nation-states have faced off in cyberspace, with Russia assessing that its manipulation of American public opinion through social media during the 2016 elections would not provoke a significant American response.66 In that case, we have seen a significant response in the form of public criticism, sanctions, expulsions of intelligence officers, and closure of diplomatic facilities, but we have yet to see the type of response that is likely to effectively limit such efforts in the future.\nIn order to effectively deter attacks in cyberspace, the United States and its allies must be willing to increasingly describe some measure of the nature and scope of their capabilities in the cyber domain and to set out specific criteria under which cyber-attacks may be responded to and the potential nature of such responses.67 Moreover, the government must be prepared to actually respond when such attacks take place. Today, little if any information is intentionally made public about the nature of the US's strategic and tactical capabilities in cyberspace. Indeed, what little is known GEN. KEITH B. ALEXANDER, USA (RET.), AND JAMIL N. JAFFER largely comes from leaks related to alleged cyber operations. The same is largely true of American allies. And while it is without question that the United States and its allies reserve the right to respond to cyber operations conducted against them, refusing to provide insight into some of the nation's capabilities in this arena makes it nearly impossible to credibly leverage deterrence based on a potential cyber-based response.\nSimilarly, without an understanding or a declared policy of certain redlines with respect to cyber operations, potential threat actors are left to guess about what actions might trigger a response and what the nature of that response might be. While strategic ambiguity has its place in international relations, it is most effective when such ambiguity is on the edges of a fairly clear policy. At the present time, in the cyber domain, given that little is understood about when and how nations may respond, it is unsurprising that we see various nations testing the boundaries and engaging in operations that may otherwise be deterred if it were understood that a clear response would be forthcoming. If the United States and its allies are able to agree to a basic set of rules of the road, this framework could create the basis for a sustainable deterrence architecture. The basic elements of such a set of rules can be based on analogies to traditional military or intelligence activities—cyber-attacks causing significant loss of life, physical damage to infrastructure, or significant financial harm or loss would be actionable, whereas traditional forms of espionage, such as a theft of government defense or foreign policy information, would not be. The obvious challenge to such an effort would be the more equivocal cases, such as attempts to influence public opinion, theft of significant amounts of intellectual property, attacks that cause limited physical damage, Similarly, without an understanding or a declared policy of certain redlines with respect to cyber operations, potential threat actors are left to guess about what actions might trigger a response and what the nature of that response might be. While strategic ambiguity has its place in international relations, it is most effective when such ambiguity is on the edges of a fairly clear policy.\nor efforts to penetrate infrastructure for long-term access versus immediate action, all of which may reasonably be analogized to traditional actions that may or may not provoke a response. The fact that these cases create a significant challenge, however, is not a reason to avoid making tough choices about how the United States and its allies ought to react to malicious cyber activities. To the contrary, the fact that there remains ambiguity in this area and that US and allied responses have been limited (at least in the public space) to date means that other nations are more likely to continue to probe our boundaries.\nFinally, as with all forms of deterrence, cyber deterrence will be effective only to the extent that nation-states are willing to stand by the redlines they set and actually enforce them. At the same time, long-term deterrence can be dramatically undermined where nation-states set unwise redlines or create redlines that they are not actually willing to enforce, as in the case of Syria's use of chemical weapons in 2012-13. As such, in cyberspace, significant attention must be given to establishing clear boundaries and setting out clear consequences only where governments are actually prepared and willing to take action.\nGEORGETOWN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS ENSURING US DOMINANCE IN CYBERSPACE # Conclusion The establishment of the SSF by China, which was informed by the creation of USCYBERCOM in the United States, highlights the importance of the United States and its allies undertaking a concerted effort to maintain their collective edge in the cyber domain. This will require a significant rethinking of the roles and responsibilities of the government and the private sector when it comes to cyber defense. It will demand significant investment in new, advanced capabilities and a new approach to deterrence in the cyber arena. All of these changes are within the realm of the possible, but significant barriers to success remain, including fundamental disconnects within the American political system and between the defense, intelligence, and homeland security communities in the government. Thus, if the United States is to maintain its relative dominance in cyberspace over the long term, it is likely to require a sustained commitment from the leadership of the executive branch and the commitment of a significant amount of political and financial resources in the near term."

Keith B. Alexander, USA (Ret.), and Jamil N. Jaffer In late 2015, China announced the creation of its Strategic Support Force (SSF) to unify the People's Liberation Army's (PLA) cyber, space, and electronic warfare capabilities,¹ an effort that parallels the creation of United States Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) in 2009.² Just like the United States, in recent years China has begun to describe cyberspace as a separate domain of warfare and strategic competition.³ Both China and the United States believe that their respective defense establishments should play a central role in protection of national assets from threats in cyberspace.⁴ According to the US Department of Defense, the creation of the SSF likely represents China's\"first step in developing a cyber force that creates efficiencies by combining cyber reconnaissance, attack, and defense capabilities into one organization.\"⁵ This likewise parallels the mission of USCYBERCOM—namely, of achieving and maintaining superiority in cyberspace by unifying cyberspace operations, securing data and systems, and providing military options to leadership.⁶ Indeed, Chinese military authors cite the development of USCYBERCOM as having successfully combined cyber functions under a single command structure, including the combination of offensive and defense capabilities.⁷ Just as US Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta noted in 2012 that it is the responsibility of the Department of Defense to\"defend the nation\"in cyberspace,⁸ the Chinese view the role of the PLA's SSF as\"safeguard[ing] China's interests in new domains such as... cyberspace.\"⁹ Furthermore, USCYBERCOM explicitly differentiates its responsibility to\"defend the nation\"in cyberspace from its offensive capabilities and its support for active military operations.¹⁰ Similarly, Chinese military doctrine writers also differentiate between peacetime defensive operations and wartime military Gen.

Jaffer\n\nIn late 2015, China announced the creation of its Strategic Support Force (SSF) to unify the People's Liberation Army's (PLA) cyber, space, and electronic warfare capabilities,¹ an effort that parallels the creation of United States Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) in 2009.² Just like the United States, in recent years China has begun to describe cyberspace as a separate domain of warfare and strategic competition.³ Both China and the United States believe that their respective defense establishments should play a central role in protection of national assets from threats in cyberspace.⁴\n\nAccording to the US Department of Defense, the creation of the SSF likely represents China's \"first step in developing a cyber force that creates efficiencies by combining cyber reconnaissance, attack, and defense capabilities into one organization.\"⁵ This likewise parallels the mission of USCYBERCOM—namely, of achieving and maintaining superiority in cyberspace by unifying cyberspace operations, securing data and systems, and providing military options to leadership.⁶ Indeed, Chinese military authors cite the development of USCYBERCOM as having successfully combined cyber functions under a single command structure, including the combination of offensive and defense capabilities.⁷\n\nJust as US Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta noted in 2012 that it is the responsibility of the Department of Defense to \"defend the nation\" in cyberspace,⁸ the Chinese view the role of the PLA's SSF as \"safeguard[ing] China's interests in new domains such as . . . cyberspace.\"⁹ Furthermore, USCYBERCOM explicitly differentiates its responsibility to \"defend the nation\" in cyberspace from its offensive capabilities and its support for active military operations.¹⁰ Similarly, Chinese military doctrine writers also differentiate between peacetime defensive operations and wartime military\n\nGen.

General Alexander recently served as a member of the President's Task Force on Enhancing National Cybersecurity and currently serves as president and CEO of IronNet Cybersecurity, a startup cybersecurity firm, as well as in a number of other public and private roles.\n\nJamil N.

Today, the United States faces strategic threats in cyberspace from China as well as from Russia, two longtime key adversaries in this domain.¹⁷ The United States and its allies also face tactical threats from a range of actors including increasingly active nation-states like North Korea and Iran as well as a wide array of non-state actors, from criminal gangs to terrorist groups.¹⁸ And\n\nNewer, evolving doctrine in both nations also recognizes that in the cyber domain—as well as in others—the current status quo represents more of a state of “continuous competition” rather than the traditional war-versus-peace paradigm and also understands the cyber battlespace as one where the lines between defense and offense are increasingly fluid.\n\nA key question for the United States is how it can maintain the relative dominance it has enjoyed in this new domain of warfare going forward.\n\nsome of these latter actors are working on behalf of, or alongside, the nation-states that are also operating against the United States in the cyber domain.¹⁹\n\nThis paper argues that the best route to continued success for the United States in the cyber domain is to (1) create a more defensible national ecosystem at home and in partnership with key allies; (2) continue to invest significant resources in cyber intelligence collection, offensive and defensive cyber capability development, and game-changing capabilities, including cognitive computing and quantum systems; and (3) create a sustainable deterrence capability in the cyber realm.\n\n## Creating a More Defensible National Cyber Ecosystem\n\nIn the modern era, it is critically important that governments fundamentally rethink their architectures for cyber defense. The reality is not only that nation-states like the United States and China view cyberspace doctrinally as a domain for warfare but also that globally cyberspace has become an actual domain of conflict. Indeed, the United States and its allies are very much in the throes today of a series of ongoing—albeit low-level—conflicts in cyberspace.²⁰ Moreover, these cyber conflicts not only have a classic political component to them but, in many instances, they also have a significant economic component. For example, in the case of China, the United States has long known that its economic security is being directly challenged through the use of\n\nGEORGETOWN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS",
    "ENSURING US DOMINANCE IN CYBERSPACE\n\nChinese government cyber capabilities to siphon off massive amounts of economic wealth through the theft and coerced transfer of intellectual property that is at the heart of the modern American economy.²¹ In recognition of the critically important role that economic capabilities play, the recently released National Security Strategy makes clear that the United States views economic security as part and parcel of its national security interests.²² Moreover, the United States is hardly alone among its allies in facing down such threats. Japan and South Korea, for example, have both recently suffered significant economic theft in the form of cryptocurrency hacking allegedly undertaken by North Korea.²³\n\nAt the same time, economic threats are not the only challenges facing the United States and its allies in cyberspace. The national security of America and its allies is also directly threatened by nations like Russia, which have engaged in obvious efforts to undermine confidence in the American political system.²⁴ Russia has sought to embed long-term penetrations in critical infrastructure sectors in order to conduct espionage and prepare the battlespace for potential future conflict scenarios,²⁵ and has conducted what our government recently referred to as the most “destructive and costly cyber-attack in history.”²⁶ Concerns raised by these classic economic and political threats are further enhanced by the fact that nation-states like Iran²⁷ and North Korea,²⁸ which typically would not be viewed as near-peer competitors to the United States and its allies in the cyber domain, are nonetheless conducting significant cyber-attacks on United States soil and against American allies.²⁹\n\nGiven this range of threats and the fact that the United States and other nations find themselves currently in the middle of a very real series of (albeit minor) military skirmishes in cyberspace, it may be\n\nThe national security of America and its allies is also directly threatened by nations like Russia, which have engaged in obvious efforts to undermine confidence in the American political system.\n\nsurprising that the United States still finds itself challenged in providing “for the common defense” of the nation in the cyber domain.³⁰ The challenges in the United States do not primarily relate to a lack of forces or capabilities.³¹ To the contrary, the creation of US Cyber Command in 2009 provides the United States with very real and robust capabilities in both the offensive and defensive areas, capabilities that have the ability to both protect the United States writ large and to make cyber deterrence a reality in the global arena.³²\n\nAt least in the United States, the challenges to creating a more defensible national cybersecurity ecosystem relate principally to how core roles, responsibilities, and authorities are allocated. In particular, the United States faces two core challenges when it comes to cyberspace: how to organize as a government to defend and fight in this domain, and how to build jointness against\n\nThe challenges in the United States do not primarily relate to a lack of forces or capabilities.

    "cyber-attacks between the public and private sectors during conflicts that require acting with both speed and vigor to defend the nation.33\n\nOne principal challenge facing the United States is that USCYBERCOM—ostensibly charged since 2012 with the mission of defending the nation against cyber-attacks—lacks clear authority and rules of engagement (ROE).34 The goal should not be to respond to an attack but rather to protect against an attack before damage to infrastructure occurs. Given the speed at which cyber conflicts take place, governments need to ensure that warfighters can act with speed and agility to stop an attack before an enemy strikes, as well as respond effectively to an attack in progress. This requires advance authority for USCYBERCOM to take action and clear ROE that provide a broad range of options to use in appropriate circumstances while also limiting action to appropriate bounds outside the United States. Although the idea of providing advance authority to take action that admittedly might spark a larger conflict is almost certainly controversial, if structured properly with appropriate limitations, effective civilian oversight, and significant, timely reporting to the legislative branch, many of the key concerns can be effectively mitigated.35 Similarly, within the United States, agencies like the Federal Bureau of Investigation will need advance authority to take action domestically against potential cyber actors who are utilizing co-opted infrastructure located at home.\n\nAt the same time, simply providing USCYBERCOM and other agencies with robust authorities and solid ROEs is not enough.36 Because the vast majority of American cyber infrastructure is owned and operated by the private sector, in order to defend the nation, the government must work closely with the private sector by setting the conditions for a truly defensible cyber infrastructure. This would include empowering private sector defensive capabilities and providing for interoperable capabilities that can be used if a national crisis requires direct government assistance to industry, as well as joint exercises to test out such operations.37\n\nThe fact is that no single entity—whether a private sector company or a government agency—can stand alone against the most capable threat actors.38 Indeed, in no other area do we expect individual private companies to defend themselves against nation-states.39 For example, while we reasonably expect private corporations to have high fences and armed guards around their warehouses to protect against thieves, we don't expect those same companies to have surface-to-air missiles on their warehouses to defend against foreign bombers dropping ordnance.40 When it comes to cyberspace, however, we expect exactly that: individual companies, standing alone, are expected to defend themselves against all comers, from script kiddies to nation-states.41 This is a policy destined to fail under its own weight.42\n\nRather than rely on private companies to defend themselves alone against such serious actors, governments should move to a collective defense architecture both within the private sector as well as between the public and private sectors.43 The first step would be industries sharing information on cyber threats at scale and speed within and across critical sectors and then, over time, between governments and the private sector more generally.44 Indeed, in order to stop an attack before it happens, governments need to be able to assess their enemy's plans, intentions, and capabilities and must be able to identify the attacks as they are progressing but before they actually have an impact. In many ways, the visibility needed to stop an attack before it has an impact can be analogized to the national air traffic control system.45 Successful, robust sharing of cyber-threat",
    "ENSURING US DOMINANCE IN CYBERSPACE\n\ndata between the government and industry can help empower the development of such a cyber common operational picture.⁴⁶ Just as the air traffic control picture ensures aviation safety and helps synchronize government and civil flights, a cyber common operational picture can help synchronize our national common cyber defense and enable rapid response in a time of crisis.⁴⁷ In the United States, the energy and financial sectors, working collaboratively with government-funded institutions⁴⁸ and outside providers,⁴⁹ are beginning to lead in this space by creating robust information sharing collaborations both internally to these sectors, as well as with the government.⁵⁰\n\nBeyond creating a common operational picture, governments can also assist industry more directly.⁵¹ They can do so by sharing cyber-threat information with the private sector in real time and at machine speed.⁵² In addition, governments could use their overseas intelligence-collection architectures to collect on threats to their private sector and pass on this information—even in its highly classified form—to home industry so that it may be used to defend the nation's economic base.⁵³\n\nFinally, governments and private industry ought to work together to develop interoperable capabilities that can be utilized in a crisis.⁵⁴ Such interoperable capabilities would allow governments to directly provide assistance to the private sector and utilize appropriate governmental authorities to respond to attacks in progress.⁵⁵ Moreover, exercising these capabilities in advance of an\n\n&gt; Governments and private industry ought to work together to develop interoperable capabilities that can be utilized in a crisis.\n\nactual threat would allow both governments and private industry to be prepared in actual cyber conflict scenario.⁵⁶\n\n## Investing Resources in Key Cyber Capabilities\n\nBoth the United States and China have made clear that they expect to invest significant resources in building cyber capabilities in the near term.⁵⁷ The same is true for many actors around the world, including edge competitors like Iran and North Korea. As a result, significant investment in key areas will be required for the United States and its allies to continue to maintain their collective lead in cyberspace and to ensure more comprehensive national defense across the board. Some of the key areas for such investment ought to include improving cyber intelligence collection, achieving better attribution capabilities, creating advanced offensive and defensive cyber capabilities, and expanding on game-changing capabilities, including artificial intelligence and cognitive computing.\n\nImproved intelligence collection overseas is a minimum first step for all nations seeking to address significant threats facing them in cyberspace. If a nation is able to understand the potential threats facing both its government as well as its private industry, it will be better placed to defend against such threats in the first instance and to take action to respond as needed. Such intelligence collection can also provide advance warning of a potential threat or may provide attribution of an attack in progress or when completed.\n\nWhile many of the nation-states operating against the United States and its allies in cyberspace have long sought to escape detection by concealing their activities through the use of non-attributable organizations and infrastructure, as well as the use\n\nFALL 2018, VOLUME XIX 55",
    "GEN. KEITH B. ALEXANDER, USA (RET.), AND JAMIL N. JAFFER\n\nof co-opted systems, $^{58}$ the United States and other nations have committed significant resources to addressing the attribution problem and have increased their ability to more reliably attribute attacks. $^{59}$ Indeed, recent authoritative attributions by the US government of certain major attacks to nation-state actors, from WannaCry to North Korea to NotPetya to Russia, as well as a number of others, highlight this newer trend. $^{60}$ At the same time, the reality for the United States and allied governments is that key actors, including Russia and China, are aggressively targeting non-governmental entities, particularly critical infrastructure providers, for which the government has limited access to data. Similarly, many of the hop points (computers used by attackers to obscure where the attacks originate) that are being used by attackers—whether nation-states or otherwise—reside on private sector networks. Governments like the United States often cannot directly access such hop points, whether for legal or operational reasons. As such, in order to truly extend its attribution capabilities, the US government and others must work closely with private industry in order to truly understand the nature and scope of attacks. Such collaboration will allow both industry and government to benefit from combining information about what is taking place inside the United States or other allied nations with the information collected overseas by their intelligence agencies to better attribute attacks and to prevent further incidents.\n\nDeveloping advanced offensive and defensive capabilities is likewise critical for further investment by the United States and its allies. Recent attacks have demonstrated that nation-states and non-nation-states alike have developed the ability to repurpose leaked foreign nation-state capabilities to their own ends as well as to develop significant new intelligence tools domestically.\n\nAs such, in order to truly extend its attribution capabilities, the US government and others must work closely with private industry in order to truly understand the nature and scope of attacks. Such collaboration will allow both industry and government to benefit from combining information about what is taking place inside the United States or other allied nations with the information collected overseas by their intelligence agencies to better attribute attacks and to prevent further incidents.\n\nBeing able to effectively defend against such nation-state-level capabilities is likely to be an important tool for cyber defenders going forward. At the same time, having the demonstrated capacity to use offensive cyber tools will likely be necessary to deter other states, including states that can't be deterred by other means like diplomatic pressure or sanctions.\n\nFinally, continuing to invest in and leverage game-changing capabilities, including cognitive computing and quantum systems, will be critical to maintaining the US and allied edge in cyberspace. The reality is that application of these capabilities has the ability to fundamentally and rapidly change the cyber battlespace. In particular, effective application of cognitive computing—which seeks to model human thought processes using computers—to large amounts of cyber-threat data can provide the ability to evaluate next steps that might be taken to defend against an evolving threat. Specifically, in a scenario in which a nation-state is able to attribute a particular pattern of behavior around a set of attacks, the application of cognitive computing may permit the defender to get ahead of future attacks\n\nGEORGETOWN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS",
    "or to identify them earlier in the kill chain. Similarly, the potential use of such capabilities to calculate a series of possible outcomes in a given threat scenario, such as the probability of adversary success, could also provide cyber defenders with hugely valuable information. In addition, the potential use of quantum capabilities—which apply certain aspects of quantum physics to allow computers to accomplish calculations much faster than is currently possible—to defeat encrypted malware could also provide cyber defenders with valuable information. This is so because aspects of today's most common encryption methodologies are based on the inability of current systems to rapidly conduct calculations against certain very large numbers (e.g. finding the prime factors of a very large number). Thus, if quantum computing allows much more rapid calculations against such numbers, key aspects of modern encryption—including that used to encrypt malware—may become significantly more vulnerable.61\n\n## Creating a Sustainable Cyber Deterrence Capability\n\nDeterrence in cyberspace also represents a key strategic area of focus for Chinese military scholars and war planners,62 as it does in the United States.63 The actual consequences of the application of traditional deterrence theory in cyberspace today remain somewhat opaque. While it is clear that nation-states with leading cyber capabilities like the United States, China, and Russia are not currently prepared to utilize their most robust capabilities against what they perceive as peer competitors because they do fear a potential response, it is also clear that other nations are willing to take specific limited actions that, in other contexts, might be seen as crossing the line against such major players. For example, the destructive nature of attacks undertaken in the continental United States against certain American private sector companies by Iran and North Korea64 represents a calculation (apparently correct—at least to date) by those nations that such action would not provoke a major response. Likewise, major nations appear to have taken the view that significant cyber activities against non-peer competitors, like Russia's attacks against Estonia and Ukraine,65 would likewise not provoke an effective response, whether by those nations or other nations with the ability to respond. At least in the latter scenario, the calculation that peer competitors would not risk a major confrontation over edge states or that such peer competitors remain concerned with their own cyber exposure to respond in that domain, appears also to have been correct. Lastly, at least in one instance, major nation-states have faced off in cyberspace, with Russia assessing that its manipulation of American public opinion through social media during the 2016 elections would not provoke a significant American response.66 In that case, we have seen a significant response in the form of public criticism, sanctions, expulsions of intelligence officers, and closure of diplomatic facilities, but we have yet to see the type of response that is likely to effectively limit such efforts in the future.\n\nIn order to effectively deter attacks in cyberspace, the United States and its allies must be willing to increasingly describe some measure of the nature and scope of their capabilities in the cyber domain and to set out specific criteria under which cyber-attacks may be responded to and the potential nature of such responses.67 Moreover, the government must be prepared to actually respond when such attacks take place. Today, little if any information is intentionally made public about the nature of the US's strategic and tactical capabilities in cyberspace. Indeed, what little is known",
    "GEN. KEITH B. ALEXANDER, USA (RET.), AND JAMIL N. JAFFER\n\nlargely comes from leaks related to alleged cyber operations. The same is largely true of American allies. And while it is without question that the United States and its allies reserve the right to respond to cyber operations conducted against them, refusing to provide insight into some of the nation's capabilities in this arena makes it nearly impossible to credibly leverage deterrence based on a potential cyber-based response.\n\nSimilarly, without an understanding or a declared policy of certain redlines with respect to cyber operations, potential threat actors are left to guess about what actions might trigger a response and what the nature of that response might be. While strategic ambiguity has its place in international relations, it is most effective when such ambiguity is on the edges of a fairly clear policy. At the present time, in the cyber domain, given that little is understood about when and how nations may respond, it is unsurprising that we see various nations testing the boundaries and engaging in operations that may otherwise be deterred if it were understood that a clear response would be forthcoming. If the United States and its allies are able to agree to a basic set of rules of the road, this framework could create the basis for a sustainable deterrence architecture. The basic elements of such a set of rules can be based on analogies to traditional military or intelligence activities—cyber-attacks causing significant loss of life, physical damage to infrastructure, or significant financial harm or loss would be actionable, whereas traditional forms of espionage, such as a theft of government defense or foreign policy information, would not be. The obvious challenge to such an effort would be the more equivocal cases, such as attempts to influence public opinion, theft of significant amounts of intellectual property, attacks that cause limited physical damage,\n\nSimilarly, without an understanding or a declared policy of certain redlines with respect to cyber operations, potential threat actors are left to guess about what actions might trigger a response and what the nature of that response might be. While strategic ambiguity has its place in international relations, it is most effective when such ambiguity is on the edges of a fairly clear policy.\n\nor efforts to penetrate infrastructure for long-term access versus immediate action, all of which may reasonably be analogized to traditional actions that may or may not provoke a response. The fact that these cases create a significant challenge, however, is not a reason to avoid making tough choices about how the United States and its allies ought to react to malicious cyber activities. To the contrary, the fact that there remains ambiguity in this area and that US and allied responses have been limited (at least in the public space) to date means that other nations are more likely to continue to probe our boundaries.\n\nFinally, as with all forms of deterrence, cyber deterrence will be effective only to the extent that nation-states are willing to stand by the redlines they set and actually enforce them. At the same time, long-term deterrence can be dramatically undermined where nation-states set unwise redlines or create redlines that they are not actually willing to enforce, as in the case of Syria's use of chemical weapons in 2012-13. As such, in cyberspace, significant attention must be given to establishing clear boundaries and setting out clear consequences only where governments are actually prepared and willing to take action.\n\nGEORGETOWN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS",
    "ENSURING US DOMINANCE IN CYBERSPACE\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe establishment of the SSF by China, which was informed by the creation of USCYBERCOM in the United States, highlights the importance of the United States and its allies undertaking a concerted effort to maintain their collective edge in the cyber domain. This will require a significant rethinking of the roles and responsibilities of the government and the private sector when it comes to cyber defense. It will demand significant investment in new, advanced capabilities and a new approach to deterrence in the cyber arena. All of these changes are within the realm of the possible, but significant barriers to success remain, including fundamental disconnects within the American political system and between the defense, intelligence, and homeland security communities in the government. Thus, if the United States is to maintain its relative dominance in cyberspace over the long term, it is likely to require a sustained commitment from the leadership of the executive branch and the commitment of a significant amount of political and financial resources in the near term.\n\n# Notes\n\n1.
