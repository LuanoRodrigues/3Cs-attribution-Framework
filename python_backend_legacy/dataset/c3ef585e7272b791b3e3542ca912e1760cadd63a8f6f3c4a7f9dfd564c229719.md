In the North, the affected websites included those of the main Communist Party newspaper and the official Korean Central News Agency. In the South, the website for the presidential office and another government agency were rendered temporarily inaccessible. Given the tenor of political relations on the Korean peninsula, speculation centred on the possibility of involvement by state actors or their proxies. However, determining who was responsible for these cyber intrusions was complicated by several facts. First, a number of individuals purporting to belong to the \"hacktivist\" network Anonymous had indicated on Twitter that they would undertake offensive cyber operations against the North on the war's anniversary. Second, Twitter users also \"claimed responsibility for the attacks in South Korea, saying they demanded that the South's government stop censoring Internet content\" (ibid.). Given the relative ease of compromising authentication for social media accounts and the difficulty of independently establishing the source of origin for data transmitted over the Internet, it is difficult to regard such claims of responsibility as dispositive.¹\n1. For more on the difficulties of attributing cyber attacks and on cyber strategy in general, see Nye (2011, 18-38).\n125\nMutual Security in the Asia-Pacific: Roles for Australia, Canada and South Korea\nProblems in attributing the cyber attacks related to the anniversary of the Korean War expose a deeper, and more nuanced problem. The challenge is that attributing cyber intrusions back to a government sponsor is not simply a factual or technical challenge. Rather, it is a multifaceted problem that has technical, legal and political dimensions, all of which must be satisfied for the attribution of a cyber attack to a particular state to be appropriate. The additional complexity here, as with most things cyber, is that the rules governing conduct in each of these categories are still evolving. However, the complexity of the task should not mask its importance. The increasing importance of the Internet to daily life can be expected over time to amplify the stakes involved in large-scale, persistent disruptions of access. Further, technology already allows the creation of kinetic effects by means of malicious code; such capabilities are highly likely to become more widely available in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, there is real potential for escalation from cyber attacks to more traditional forms of violent conflict. New rules, norms and institutional structures are needed that can ameliorate the possibility of misattribution and the attendant consequences that would flow from it, and that can act as circuit-breakers inhibiting escalatory spirals even where attribution is properly made.\nIn order to advance this broad claim, the paper will proceed in the following fashion. The first section will highlight the technical aspects of attributing a cyber intrusion to a particular actor or set of actors. The second section will discuss the legal rules governing state responsibility and the attribution of acts to state actors. The third section will discuss the international political dimensions involved in determining whether or not to publicly attribute a particular cyber act to a given state. Finally, the paper concludes by arguing clearer rules are needed to avert the possible negative consequences of misattribution and that an impartial international institutional cooperative mechanism is needed to facilitate the development of a meaningful rule-based framework for state conduct related to attribution for cyber attacks. As constructive powers, Canada, Australia and Korea are well positioned to play a leading role in the development of global norms for both the procedures and consequences of publicly attributing cyber attacks by enhancing capacity to respond to cyber attacks through the augmentation of Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) and by crafting norms of restraint that demonstrate the political, economic and cultural consequences of both hasty and non-attribution.\nRule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks 127\n# The Technical Dimension of Attribution\nTechnical attribution of cyber attacks is primarily a matter of employing computer forensics to determine the physical point(s) of origin for a particular computer network operation and to locate circumstantial evidence embedded in malicious code that provides information about the likely identity of its author(s), such as languages employed or particular cultural points of reference. For a small number of governments, these means can be augmented with additional intelligence sources and methods.\nThe expertise necessary for such attribution efforts is, again with the exception of a growing number of wealthy governments, in the hands of private companies. Large computer network operators, technology companies and computer security firms possess increasingly sophisticated technical means to attribute cyber attacks.2 The emergence of private actors with intelligence capabilities that to some extent rival and exceed those of states is a new development; while non-state actors are not new in international relations, it is novel for such actors to enjoy resource and expertise advantages in a core area of state policy intimately connected to the state's monopoly on the use of legitimate violence. The involvement of corporate actors in the attribution of cyber attacks is also likely to prove controversial. Specifically, it is not clear whether states will generally accept the judgment of such companies — in particular when the company is headquartered in the same state making the public attribution of the attack.\nLeaving problems of credibility aside, there are also clear limits to technical attribution, in particular when principals employ arms-length agents (potentially located in other states) and/or transnational botnets in the conduct of cyber attacks. Given the utility of such gambits in frustrating attempts at attribution and the low cost of employing them, these practices are likely to spread. Even when location of origin can be conclusively identified, this is not necessarily a dispositive indication of responsibility either under narrow legal standards or more expansive political ones.\n# The International Legal Dimension of Attribution\nAssuming that cyber attacks constitute internationally wrongful acts, and assuming that the technical/factual indications provide sufficient evidence that the attack in question has a state connection, then invariably the relevant\n2 For one recent example, see Mandiant “APT1: Exposing One of China’s Cyber Espionage Units.” http://intelreport.mandiant.com/.\nMutual Security in the Asia-Pacific: Roles for Australia, Canada and South Korea\ninternational legal rules to apply will be the ones governing state responsibility. In short, state responsibility is a fundamental rule governing international relations which holds that if a state commits an internationally wrongful act that is attributable to the state, and the act constitutes a breach of an international obligation, then that state will owe a duty to make reparations for the breach.³ The relevant question then becomes: what activities are attributable to a state? Unfortunately, the answer is not entirely clear.\nLegal attribution is straightforward when the act in question is committed by an organ of the state. In these cases, the law will presume that the act committed by the organ is the act of the state itself. Suppose for example that a cyber attack was directed by a division of the military or the state intelligence services; this would \"according to a well-established rule of international law [...] be regarded as an act of that state.\"⁴ Determining responsibility becomes more complex, however, when dealing with entities that are more loosely affiliated with the state. For example, non-state actors who launch cyber attacks or engage in hacktivist activities may have varying degrees of state connection. Some may act with no official connection to the state, such as the infamous hacktivist group Anonymous, which operates with neither \"the steady income nor the fiscal sponsorship\" to support its activities and which often adopts an antagonistic tone toward state authority (Coleman 2014, 70). Other cyber attacks by non-state actors, in contrast, might be tolerated or even sponsored by the state to act in their interests. Analysts believe this was the case in 2007, when Russian hackers were sponsored by the state to unleash a massive cyber attack against the Estonian government and financial institutions over the relocation of a statue in the Estonian capital (Traynor 2007). Similarly, a group of hackers calling itself the Syrian Electronic Army claims to act on behalf of the Assad government (Boothby et al., 2012).\nComplexity in attributing cyber attacks is also a function of competing and inconsistent legal rules. The Draft Articles of the International Law Commission, which potentially reflect customary law,⁵ state that the conduct of an entity will be considered an act of a State under international law if that entity \"is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control\n3 Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, 2001, at Article 2, http://untreaty.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/draft%20articles/9_6_2001.pdf; See also Chorzów Factory, PCIJ, Series A, No. 17, 1928, p. 29; Malcolm N. Shaw, International Law, 6th Ed., at 778 [hereafter Shaw].\n4 Difference Relating to Immunity from Legal Process of a Special Rapporteur, ICJ Reports 1999, 62, 87.\n5 See, e.g., Memorial of Germany (LaGrand Case) (September 16, 1999) at para. 6.15 (referring to the ILC draft articles on responsibility as \"the most authoritative statement of customary international law on the matter\").\nRule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks 129\nof, that State in carrying out the conduct.”⁶ Thus, under this standard if a state directed a citizen hacker team to carry out a cyber attack, then those acts would be legally attributable back to that state. However, two international courts have weighed in on what the applicable standard should be when considering the attribution of certain acts to states, and in so doing, they have muddied the analytical waters.\nIn the *Nicaragua* case, the International Court of Justice was asked to decide whether the acts of the Contras — a rebel group engaged in a conflict with the Nicaraguan government — were attributable to the Government of the United States. In determining whether the relationship between the two was sufficiently close to allow for attribution, the Court held that “to be legally responsible, it would have to be proved that that State had *effective control* of the operations in the course of which the alleged violations were committed.”⁷ Thus, in order to be found responsible for particular cyber intrusions, under the *Nicaragua* standard it must be shown that the state in question had direct control over that very intrusion. In other words, “general overall control would have been insufficient to ground responsibility.”⁸ Rather, according to the jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice a more exacting standard applies.⁹\nHowever, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia sees the status of international law on this issue quite differently. In the *Tadić* case, the Tribunal found that a demonstration of *overall control* could be sufficient for a finding of state responsibility. In this way, the Tribunal incorporated a less stringent test under the rules of international law, noting, “the degree of control might vary according to the circumstances and a high threshold might not always be required.”¹⁰ As a consequence, the international community is left with a somewhat fragmented set of legal rules to apply to cyber attacks, when trying to attribute those acts back to state actors. Does one need to show that the cyber attacker was acting on the instructions of the state or that the state had effective control of the impugned operation? Or, is it appropriate to apply some lower threshold for the attribution of acts in cyber space? Should states, for example, be required to take reasonable steps to prevent attacks that originate from their\n6 Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, 2001, at Article 8, http://un- treaty.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/draft%20articles/9_6_2001.pdf.\n7 Case Concerning the Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

And if they fail to do so, should that provide a sufficient basis for a finding of responsibility? Or, should there be a more exacting standard in which states are called to account only when there is dispositive proof that an organ of the state committed or directed the attack?\nUltimately, the applicable rules remain somewhat unclear. However, what is clear is that the increasing centrality of cyber operations in the conduct of international relations is going put pressure on the existing set of rules and those rules will — no doubt — evolve in relation to that pressure. Thus, what is required at this point is some forward looking policy making aimed at developing a set of rules that accounts not only for where the subject technology is now, but where it is going to be in the future.\n## Political Dimensions of Attribution\nTechnical and legal aspects of attributing cyber attacks are, respectively, questions of evidentiary sufficiency — whether it is possible to determine the source of the attack to a degree of confidence that can withstand appropriate scrutiny — and appropriate procedure. These dimensions of attribution intersect in a complex fashion with a third, political, dimension. The key characteristic of the political dimension of attribution is publicity; a politically attributed attack, for the purposes of this paper, entails a public accusation. One example of such an attribution is the American indictment of five members of the Chinese Peoples' Liberation Army on charges of stealing intellectual property from several American firms (Schmidt and Sanger 2014).\nThis political dimension of attribution engages calculations of interest both by state and (increasingly) non-state actors, as well as less understood dynamics of choice driven by emotion and by justice motives (see Welch 1993; Raymond and Welch 2013). As a result of these considerations, it is possible that attacks which can be reliably attributed from technical and legal perspectives will not be publicly (politically) attributed (i.e. dogs that don't bark). It is also possible that political pressures may lead to the public attribution of cyber attacks even when relevant technical and legal criteria are not clearly satisfied (i.e. potentially false positives). Both of these outcomes can create problematic impacts on international security.\nThe primary risk associated with false positives is the creation of escalatory spirals. Accusations, in particular when not accompanied by convincing technical data and when not made according to proper legal procedure, can damage diplomatic relations. The offense-dominant nature of the cyber domain (at least given the current state of technology) suggests strong potential for\nRule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks 131\nescalation in the event of a cyber attack; the perceived necessity of immediate reprisal also creates pressures militating toward hasty attribution (Nye 2011). If the attribution is accompanied by self-help measures, the risk of tit-for-tat escalation and the emergence of a crisis atmosphere are increased. In crises, domestic audience costs have a critical effect on the willingness of parties to back down (Fearon 1994). Ironically, the Internet's expansion of low-cost communication and its increasing integration with critical infrastructure and other essential aspects of everyday life may act to increase the size of the domestic audience and the stakes of significant cyber attack disruptions in the eyes of that audience, thus ratcheting up the audience costs associated with conceding in a dispute concerning a publicly attributed cyber attack and making such crises especially prone to escalatory spirals. Societies with a high degree of Internet penetration may be most prone to escalate in the aftermath of a publicly attributed cyber attack. As global rates of Internet penetration increase, there is thus also a greater risk of conflict spirals.\nTwo caveats are in order. First, our argument does not rest in a strong sense on the past track record of offense-defense theory in explaining cases to which it has been applied. This is primarily because our argument is forward-looking; we are seeking to identify and anticipate potential problems in what is still a relatively new area of international politics. Second, and related, we want to be clear that we are advancing an explicitly probabilistic argument. We do not claim that all crises will escalate. Rather, we claim that false positives in cyber attribution make escalation more likely. This is the case because false accusations are likely to aggrieve falsely-accused parties, who will perceive the attack as unjust and thus be likely to respond in kind (Welch 1993). It is also the case, as we have already argued, because of the domestic political difficulties leaders face in backing down once public accusations have been made. Other factors certainly also affect the propensity of particular crises to escalate; one of the most significant is the presence or absence of a past history of animosity between the parties.11 Nevertheless, our analytical focus here is on the dangers associated with factors related to patterns of cyber-attribution.\nWe have focused thus far on the dangers inherent both in the employment of cyber attacks (and conduct that may be mistaken for a cyber attack, such as some cybercrime and cyber espionage activities) and in the hasty attribution of cyber attacks. Less obviously, there is also a significant danger in widespread failure to attribute cyber attacks when technical and legal criteria have been satisfied. If cyber attacks are not criticized and no efforts are made to hold bad actors accountable, the establishment of permissive norms (and even\n11 We thank Simon Palamar for making this point.\nMutual Security in the Asia-Pacific: Roles for Australia, Canada and South Korea\npermissive customary international law) is likely. Given the escalatory potential of cyber attacks, the prevalence of permissive norms could pose a significant international security risk. This risk entails, at maximum, the employment of cyber attacks to create kinetic damage and widespread disruption to critical infrastructure, as well as the potential escalation to more traditional interstate military conflict. While such outcomes are unlikely, they carry high costs. More modestly, permissive norms could lead to higher incidence of increasingly sophisticated cyber attacks resulting in degradation of Internet services and a loss of trust in the Internet as a means of commerce, communication and delivery of government services. Even this more optimistic scenario involves significant economic opportunity costs. The key point is that, due to its ability to forestall the development of permissive norms, criticism of socially undesirable behaviour is important in itself, (at least partially) independent of the ability to effectively enforce international rules (see Johnston 2001).\n# Rule Making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks\nGiven that both attribution and non-attribution of cyber attacks create significant international security risks, what is the appropriate policy response when cyber attacks occur? We argue that thoughtful international efforts at rulemaking to govern state conduct in the attribution of cyber attacks have the potential to steer a middle course, mitigating the risks associated with both widespread non-attribution and with hasty attribution. Such rules must govern when and how states publicly attribute cyber attacks and the consequences of attribution. Furthermore, these rules need to accomplish two parallel tasks: minimizing the need for attribution; but also enhancing capacity to respond when necessary. While the ex-ante specification of such rules is impossible due to the unpredictable nature of international negotiations, it is possible to sketch out some general design features of promising rule sets. The final section of this chapter briefly elaborates these features and addresses additional policy options for cooperation pertaining to the attribution of cyber attacks. In keeping with the goals of this volume, these policy options are presented in terms of opportunities for Canada, Korea and Australia; however, at least in this case, we believe that the options we present would travel relatively well and could in principle be adopted by other constructive powers either at the global level or in other regions.\nWith respect to the procedural mechanics of attribution, several desirable design features can be identified. First, attribution should be done on the basis of technical best practices for determining the point of origin for Internet traffic. Second, state and non-state actors seeking to attribute cyber attacks\nRule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks 133\nshould bear in mind the ease of concealment either by technical means or by the employment of arms-length proxy agents. Accordingly, attribution should be made only after attempts to engage appropriate authorities in the apparent country of origin. Where such authorities react cooperatively and in good faith, this should be prominently noted when attribution is made. Ideally, in such situations, joint statements of attribution could be made.\nThe creation and application of attribution standards and practices will require responsible global leadership. Political scientists and international relations scholars suggest that global norms are actively built by agents who have strong notions about appropriate or desirable behaviour in their community (Finnemore and Sikkink 1998). Canada, Australia and Korea are well positioned to act cooperatively as global leaders developing norms for both the procedures and consequences of publicly attributing cyber attacks for the following reasons. All three countries can find common ground for the development of these norms through their shared dialogue on the importance of international trade for economic growth and domestic economic policies that reflect these views. Cyber attacks can have large impacts on a country's ability to fairly and effectively compete in global markets (for example, see Manyika et al. 2014; Centre for Strategic and International Studies 2013). Non-attribution of these kinds of cyber attacks could further encourage this behaviour, as states or other actors would face no consequences for their bad practices. However, hasty or aggressive public attribution could also affect a country's ability to gain from trade by affecting its ability to bargain in future trade negotiations. Accusations that are not supported by convincing technical data and not made according to proper legal procedure can damage diplomatic relations. Thus, states risk negative diplomatic consequences and losing gains from trade when both hasty public attribution and non-attribution are made. As advanced industrial democracies with digitally connected economies, Australia, Canada and Korea have particular interests in the health of the digital economy. They also share a basic commitment to the maintenance of a rules-based international order.\nIn deciding when and how to attribute cyber attacks, norms-guiding states, firms and other actors are of little use if the underlying technical and legal capacities for attribution remain weak. There is certainly much to be done in this area. However, there are good reasons to conclude that Canada, Australia and Korea can take the lead on enhancing the capacity to accurately attribute cyber attacks. All three countries possess digitally connected economies with significant pools of relevant human capital. Such steps complement and coincide with measures that can augment capacities to defend against (and repair damage resulting from) cyber attacks. We focus here on what we believe\nMutual Security in the Asia-Pacific: Roles for Australia, Canada and South Korea\nto be one of the most promising avenues for cooperation on capacity building: strengthening CERTs.¹²\nCERTs are independent networks of technical experts chartered to work with the Internet community in preventing, detecting and resolving computer security incidents. Currently, there are over 250 independent CERTs registered with the Forum for Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST) — an international network of CERTs that are committed to information exchange and cooperation on issues of mutual interest.¹³ Generally, the teams share a common organizational structure centred on facilitating communication among experts; acting as a point of contact for emergencies; maintaining research ties to improve security; and initiating proactive measures to increase awareness and understanding of computer security among a variety of stakeholders.¹⁴ However, the particular role of any given CERT is largely self-defined. For example, individual CERTs differ in their areas of focus (academic, private, national, regional or global), expertise (phishing, viruses, information security) and ability to effectively perform their mandates due to varying levels of funding and or technical expertise (Choucri, Madnick and Ferwerda 2013). To help gauge the diversity in CERTs operating around the world, Figure 1 (CERT Composition by Region) highlights the variety of CERTs operating under the authority of academic, technical, private and government institutions.¹⁵\nThere are a number of interesting insights that can be drawn from this figure. First, when comparing the total number of CERTs to the number of users within a given region, Europe, North America and Oceania have more CERTs available to users within the region. Africa, Asia, Latin America and to an extent Russia, all have similarly low levels of CERTs operating within the region compared to the number of users online. This shows that CERT creation and operation within particular regions is a non-linear function of income and that other factors, such as state function or institutions, play an important role. Secondly, the regional variance of the types of CERTs is interesting. Regions with a highly developed technical industry, such as Europe, the United States and Asia, generally have higher levels of private CERTs, whereas regions that have a limited technical industry tend to have less private CERTs and more government operated CERTs.\n¹² CERTs are also interchangeably referred to as Computer Incident Response Teams and Computer Security Incident Response Teams.\n¹³ A full list of CERTS registered with FIRST can be found at www.first.org/members/teams\n¹⁴ For more information on the overarching vision of CERTS, see the CERT Coordination Centre, www.cert.org\n¹⁵ This data was compiled from CERTs registered as members of FIRST.\nRule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks\nFigure 1: CERT Composition by Region\nSource: Data collected by Authors from the CERTs registered as members of FIRST.\nCERTs are established in an ad hoc manner and are often self-governed. Anyone can create a CERT, but to become a member of the global forum FIRST, CERTs must fill out a document called Request for Comment 2350, which outlines information such as the services a CERT will offer, who its constituents are and under what authority it operates. Private and academic CERTs often operate under the authority of its institution, such as business or university codes of conduct. In addition, CERTs must also adhere to national laws applicable in the jurisdictions where they operate. It is important to note that legal regimes can affect a CERTs ability to respond and resolve to particular cyber security incident. In Turkey, for example, which prohibits sending banking related information outside of its geographic boundaries, a CERT must operate within the constraints of its own technical knowledge and resources, leaving them unable to share information with third parties outside of the country's borders. As a result, Turkey's financial sector often receives a poor level of service (Best Practice Forum 2014).\nGiven that CERTs currently have varying degrees of ability, the three countries can support and facilitate shared learning and capacity building among CERTs in several ways. One possibility would involve a joint commitment to hosting and sponsoring FIRST annual conferences on a rotating basis, or to supporting FIRST global initiatives such as special interest groups and \"birds of a feather\"\nMutual Security in the Asia-Pacific: Roles for Australia, Canada and South Korea\nforums that exist to provide a forum where members can discuss topics of common interest to the community. This would improve CERT effectiveness and provide the CERT community with facilities that would create an environment for shared learning and cooperation. Given the importance of maintaining effective government computer networks to deliver key public goods, there is also a clear rationale for the provision of funding and technical assistance for these purposes to low-income countries. Such public goods include domestic services, but also encompass international goods such as effective law enforcement cooperation. There is also a case for project-based funding for CERTs in the non-profit sector and perhaps even in private industry. This funding could be provided on an opt-in basis as grant programs, allowing consideration to be given both to the quality of the applicant and its level of financial need. Such grant programs could start as small-scale pilots and could expand to involve public-private partnerships. Augmenting the number and capabilities of CERTs can improve the accuracy of attempts to attribute cyber attacks as well as the potential to quickly and effectively repair any resulting damage. Such capabilities would make hasty and inaccurate attributions less likely by providing more timely and more accurate information about the technical nature of cyber attacks, and would also reduce pressures to attribute cyber attacks by mitigating the costs they entail for victims (and thus the desire to retaliate).\nThere are also potential gains from enhanced coordination. CERTs have been created by a wide variety of actors (both public and private) and with different geographic scopes (domestic, regional, global). Many national CERTs coordinate with other CERTs in their respective regions. Regional CERTs could institutionalize the working relations of national and private sector teams. This could improve CERT-to-CERT cooperation, and as CERTs cooperate and build capacity within the region, the development of a coherent rule set for technical attribution beyond one nation's borders could be encouraged over time. In addition, the institutionalized working relationship between regional public and private CERTs could encourage cooperation across legal jurisdictions and state borders. This network could improve information sharing across a variety of regions and improve the digital forensic capabilities of governments and law enforcement agencies so that credible attribution can be made within a region.\nThe Asia Pacific Computer Emergency Response Team (APCERT) could play a leading role in helping CERTs in the Asia-Pacific cooperate and develop rules of best practice for attribution across the region. APCERT has 25 operational teams from 19 different states, including (but not limited to) Australia, India, China, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, New Zealand and Thailand.[16] APCERT already\n16 For a complete list of APCERT membership see www.apcert.org/about/structure/members.html\nRule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks 137\nplays an important role by creating and maintaining a mutually trusting network of computer security experts in the Asia-Pacific, which improves regional awareness of and competency in responding to computer incidents. However, only 19 regional countries are currently represented. APCERT’s membership could be expanded to include other Asia-Pacific economies, including Canada.\nGlobally, there is an opportunity for CERTs to contribute to rules of best practice for technical attribution. The Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST) is a global organization coordinating CERT responses to computer incidents. One such opportunity is the creation of ongoing dialogue around best practices, supported (financially and diplomatically) by engaged states such as Korea, Australia and Canada. Such efforts are distinct from general augmentation of CERT capacities in that they would focus specifically on engaging the CERT community in contributing to broader attempts to think creatively about best practices for attribution. States could also make especially valuable contributions to these efforts by arranging the participation of experts in the legal and political dimensions of attribution. While broadening dialogue can create problems arising from divergent preferences and from difficulties in coordinating large numbers of players, bringing together these distinct voices can ensure that attribution of cyber attacks is approached in a holistic fashion that includes actors with requisite legal and political expertise.\nCERT coordination could also be improved through policies and practices that promote the interoperability of laws around information sharing. Given that the disharmonization of national laws could limit or prevent CERTs from effectively resolving computer security incidents, when creating or updating national legislation policy makers should consider the effect a law can have on a CERT’s ability to cooperate internationally. It is important that policy makers consider legal interoperability as a matter of degree that can be achieved through a variety of means, such as harmonization, standardization, mutual recognition, reciprocity and cooperation (Weber 2014). CERTs and policymakers should work together and create a shared dialogue that explores ways in which national laws can be implemented and utilized to further encourage CERT-CERT cooperation across national borders.\nGiven their technical expertise, it might seem like a natural fit to give regional and global CERTs official roles in investigating and making attributions for particular cyber attacks. While we do not rule out the viability of this option at least in some situations, we emphasize that there are reasons to be cautious in adopting such policies in the short-term. Directly involving CERTs in making attributions of cyber attacks risks politicizing their work and undermining the willingness of states and other actors to work with CERTs, especially at the\nMutual Security in the Asia-Pacific: Roles for Australia, Canada and South Korea\nregional and global levels. This could have the perverse effect of reducing rather than increasing the quality of information available, as well as the additional perverse effect of inhibiting efforts to quickly and effectively mitigate the effect of cyber attacks. It might be more palatable instead to establish the expectation that states and other actors seek the input of relevant CERTs prior to making public attributions of cyber attacks. The role of CERTs in this respect would be restricted to the provision of publicly available information that could be verified by interested parties, and that therefore should be less susceptible to politicization. To further reduce this risk, it might also be desirable to establish the expectation that public attributions be made on the basis of concurring analysis from multiple CERTs, at least some of which do not have a real or apparent conflict of interest.¹⁷ While it may not be possible to eliminate incidents of political leaders shopping among CERTs for favourable analysis, establishing norms that expect multiple concurring analyses and that expect the underlying technical data to be made publicly available can increase the legitimacy costs associated with such behaviour.\nWhile there is a need for rule making both about the procedures and consequences of public attribution and for various kinds of capacity-building and coordination measures, there is also a need for a commitment to restraint when publicly attributing cyber attacks. The widespread consistent exercise of such restraint in the face of what are likely to be increasingly common and perhaps increasingly disruptive incidents will take political will and statesmanship. This is the final way in which we conclude that Canada, Korea and Australia can show leadership. They can do so with the goal of forging a shared vision of the need for restraint in attribution in light of recent events and emerging trends. Such a vision must be predicated on relevant norms from other areas of international law and the broader regime complex for cyber governance (Nye 2014). A constructive discussion of the issues should begin with a shared understanding of what we have identified as the central dilemma in attributing cyber attacks: that careless attribution can be counter-productive and destabilizing, damaging important political, cultural and economic relationships; and that, on the other hand, lack of attribution can create a permissive environment in which cyber attacks are seen as low-cost and perhaps even as acceptable behaviour.\nNorms on cyber security and conflict are a global matter. However, given that cyber security issues are relatively new, multilateral institutions and other forms of international cooperation within this policy domain have not yet matured. The literature on constructive powers can be used to explain and describe\n¹⁷ Such real or apparent conflicts of interest could arise from a CERT based in a state making the public attribution or having a financial relationship with the entity (state or otherwise) making the attribution.\nRule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks 139\nhow countries develop norms in these nascent policy spaces (Hampson and Heinbecker 2011). Constructive powers can act as norm entrepreneurs in the development of global norms on cyber attacks and attribution. As Simon Palamar discusses in his contribution to this volume, one characteristic of constructive powers is their ability to shape the world in ways that explicitly take the preferences and interests of others into account. The development of norms on public attribution aligns with the preferences of other states given the political, economic and social consequences of both hasty and non-attribution. As constructive powers, Canada, Australia and Korea are well positioned to begin a productive dialogue — both domestically and in concert with each other — and to frame this critical conversation from its earliest stages, creating conditions for ongoing conversation and institutional learning.\nSuch norm-building processes are typically slow and non-linear in nature. This is especially true under conditions of uncertainty, for example the uncertainty associated with assessing the political and strategic implications of a disruptive new technology. Kenneth Abbott and Duncan Snidal have argued that in situations of uncertainty, soft law instruments are often superior choices to traditional hard law instruments such as treaties (Abbott and Snidal 2000). Hard law is difficult to change once it is established: at the national level, governments must go through long processes to change or update domestic laws, and at the international level, difficulties reaching agreements are even more pronounced as diverse actors bargain to reach some form of consensus. Soft law, in contrast, facilitates learning about the implications of particular kinds of rules and governance arrangements over time, making it easier for countries to come to an agreement typically with lower sovereignty costs than the negotiation (and renegotiation) of hard law. A great deal of soft law is developed and implemented by transnational networks of legal and regulatory experts that perform “the hard work of international law.”¹⁸\nThis pattern of gradual norm-building via soft law instruments and transnational legal-regulatory networks is likely to hold with respect to the governance of attributing cyber attacks. Just as attempts to develop rules around the use of nuclear weapons was not a static process and required an extended period of learning (Freedman 1981; Tannenwald 2007), attempts to govern the cyber realm are likely to develop via various forms of soft law prior to hard, institutionalized and multilateral treaties. Joseph Nye draws this parallel and states that: “Governments learn slowly from knowledge, study and experience, and learning occurs internationally when new knowledge gradually redefines the content of national interests and leads to new policies. For example, the United\n¹⁸ On transnational regulatory networks, see Verdier (2009 113-172). The phrase “the hard work of international law” is taken from Brunnée and Toope (2010).\nMutual Security in the Asia-Pacific: Roles for Australia, Canada and South Korea\nStates and the Soviet Union took decades to learn how to adapt and respond to the prior revolution in military affairs — nuclear technology after 1945\" (Nye 2011, 19). There are reasons to expect that such learning and norm development will be even more difficult in the cyber case than it was in the nuclear era; for example, barriers to entry are far lower in the cyber case, and these capabilities have already proliferated far beyond the very small group of exclusively state actors that possess nuclear weapons. Creating shared knowledge among a much larger, and much more organizationally heterogeneous, number of players is likely to be extremely difficult.\nNotwithstanding these difficulties, a conscious effort to build and clarify norms for state behaviour in cyberspace is already underway. The United Nations Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) recently concluded that the current law of armed conflict applies online and that response to cyber attacks should be conducted within the framework of customary international law. The assessment of the GGE represents a start for international rule-making on cyber attacks rather than a conclusion, as agreeing on specific interpretations for applying general international legal rules to particular cases will require a great deal of work. However, it suggests that cyber attacks should be conducted only in self-defence or in accordance with authorization of collective action under the UN Charter. It further suggests that cyber attacks must distinguish between military and civilian targets and must accord with rules of proportionality. Finally, it suggests the importance of treating response to cyber attacks under the legal framework of state responsibility. Doing so establishes limits on justifiable self-help measures that states may take in response to an attributed cyber attack. Encouraging adherence to these limits can minimize the escalatory potential for cyber attacks.\nFurther developing the international legal and political frameworks governing response to cyber attacks will require sustained engagement with additional legal questions, prominent among which are questions of attribution. Indeed, determining whether a particular attack is attributable to a specific state (or states) is in many ways a logically prior question to assessing whether the attack was legally justifiable under international law and, if not, what countermeasures may be taken by which parties. The Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare provides a crucial legal resource for addressing these matters (see Schmitt 2013, 29-41). However, as we have argued, these are no more purely legal questions than they are purely technical ones.\nEnsuring the success of international efforts to build responsible norms for state conduct in cyberspace will require patient, careful work over a long period of time. Canada, Korea and Australia have the required resources (including positive\nRule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks 141\ninternational reputations) to play leading roles in this work both at the regional and global levels. As digitally connected economies, they also have clear interests in a positive outcome. In the nuclear era, such learning processes involved the creation of forums and study groups bringing together policy makers, military leaders and academics. Much of this activity took place at the national level, and it is likely that governments will engage on similar crash-course-learning programs as cyber issues become more prominent in contemporary international politics. However, given the greater reach and density of transnational networks among policy makers, there may be scope for international analogues to these processes. Transnational learning processes may (at least initially) take place at less official levels and involve more prominent roles for academics and other non-state actors, but may nevertheless play an important role in encouraging the improvement and dissemination of best practices for attributing cyber attacks and for ensuring responsible state conduct in cyberspace more generally. Providing resources to facilitate such processes is an inexpensive proposition with potentially large benefits and could be a priority for cooperation in both the short and long term.",
  "flat_text": "Samantha Bradshaw, Mark Raymond and Aaron Shull\n# Introduction\nIn June of 2014, on the sixty-third anniversary of the start of the Korean War, the New York Times reported that offensive cyber operations had been initiated against various websites in both Korean countries (Sang-Hung 2013). In the North, the affected websites included those of the main Communist Party newspaper and the official Korean Central News Agency. In the South, the website for the presidential office and another government agency were rendered temporarily inaccessible. Given the tenor of political relations on the Korean peninsula, speculation centred on the possibility of involvement by state actors or their proxies. However, determining who was responsible for these cyber intrusions was complicated by several facts. First, a number of individuals purporting to belong to the \"hacktivist\" network Anonymous had indicated on Twitter that they would undertake offensive cyber operations against the North on the war's anniversary. Second, Twitter users also \"claimed responsibility for the attacks in South Korea, saying they demanded that the South's government stop censoring Internet content\" (ibid.). Given the relative ease of compromising authentication for social media accounts and the difficulty of independently establishing the source of origin for data transmitted over the Internet, it is difficult to regard such claims of responsibility as dispositive.\n1. For more on the difficulties of attributing cyber attacks and on cyber strategy in general, see Nye (2011, 18-38).\n\nProblems in attributing the cyber attacks related to the anniversary of the Korean War expose a deeper, and more nuanced problem. The challenge is that attributing cyber intrusions back to a government sponsor is not simply a factual or technical challenge. Rather, it is a multifaceted problem that has technical, legal and political dimensions, all of which must be satisfied for the attribution of a cyber attack to a particular state to be appropriate. The additional complexity here, as with most things cyber, is that the rules governing conduct in each of these categories are still evolving. However, the complexity of the task should not mask its importance. The increasing importance of the Internet to daily life can be expected over time to amplify the stakes involved in large-scale, persistent disruptions of access. Further, technology already allows the creation of kinetic effects by means of malicious code; such capabilities are highly likely to become more widely available in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, there is real potential for escalation from cyber attacks to more traditional forms of violent conflict. New rules, norms and institutional structures are needed that can ameliorate the possibility of misattribution and the attendant consequences that would flow from it, and that can act as circuit-breakers inhibiting escalatory spirals even where attribution is properly made.\nIn order to advance this broad claim, the paper will proceed in the following fashion. The first section will highlight the technical aspects of attributing a cyber intrusion to a particular actor or set of actors. The second section will discuss the legal rules governing state responsibility and the attribution of acts to state actors. The third section will discuss the international political dimensions involved in determining whether or not to publicly attribute a particular cyber act to a given state. Finally, the paper concludes by arguing clearer rules are needed to avert the possible negative consequences of misattribution and that an impartial international institutional cooperative mechanism is needed to facilitate the development of a meaningful rule-based framework for state conduct related to attribution for cyber attacks. As constructive powers, Canada, Australia and Korea are well positioned to play a leading role in the development of global norms for both the procedures and consequences of publicly attributing cyber attacks by enhancing capacity to respond to cyber attacks through the augmentation of Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) and by crafting norms of restraint that demonstrate the political, economic and cultural consequences of both hasty and non-attribution.\nRule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks 127\n# The Technical Dimension of Attribution\nTechnical attribution of cyber attacks is primarily a matter of employing computer forensics to determine the physical point(s) of origin for a particular computer network operation and to locate circumstantial evidence embedded in malicious code that provides information about the likely identity of its author(s), such as languages employed or particular cultural points of reference. For a small number of governments, these means can be augmented with additional intelligence sources and methods.\nThe expertise necessary for such attribution efforts is, again with the exception of a growing number of wealthy governments, in the hands of private companies. Large computer network operators, technology companies and computer security firms possess increasingly sophisticated technical means to attribute cyber attacks.2 The emergence of private actors with intelligence capabilities that to some extent rival and exceed those of states is a new development; while non-state actors are not new in international relations, it is novel for such actors to enjoy resource and expertise advantages in a core area of state policy intimately connected to the state's monopoly on the use of legitimate violence. The involvement of corporate actors in the attribution of cyber attacks is also likely to prove controversial. Specifically, it is not clear whether states will generally accept the judgment of such companies — in particular when the company is headquartered in the same state making the public attribution of the attack.\nLeaving problems of credibility aside, there are also clear limits to technical attribution, in particular when principals employ arms-length agents (potentially located in other states) and/or transnational botnets in the conduct of cyber attacks. Given the utility of such gambits in frustrating attempts at attribution and the low cost of employing them, these practices are likely to spread. Even when location of origin can be conclusively identified, this is not necessarily a dispositive indication of responsibility either under narrow legal standards or more expansive political ones.\n# The International Legal Dimension of Attribution\nAssuming that cyber attacks constitute internationally wrongful acts, and assuming that the technical/factual indications provide sufficient evidence that the attack in question has a state connection, then invariably the relevant\n\nMutual Security in the Asia-Pacific: Roles for Australia, Canada and South Korea\ninternational legal rules to apply will be the ones governing state responsibility. In short, state responsibility is a fundamental rule governing international relations which holds that if a state commits an internationally wrongful act that is attributable to the state, and the act constitutes a breach of an international obligation, then that state will owe a duty to make reparations for the breach. The relevant question then becomes: what activities are attributable to a state? Unfortunately, the answer is not entirely clear.\nLegal attribution is straightforward when the act in question is committed by an organ of the state. In these cases, the law will presume that the act committed by the organ is the act of the state itself. Suppose for example that a cyber attack was directed by a division of the military or the state intelligence services; this would \"according to a well-established rule of international law [...] be regarded as an act of that state.\" Determining responsibility becomes more complex, however, when dealing with entities that are more loosely affiliated with the state. For example, non-state actors who launch cyber attacks or engage in hacktivist activities may have varying degrees of state connection. Some may act with no official connection to the state, such as the infamous hacktivist group Anonymous, which operates with neither \"the steady income nor the fiscal sponsorship\" to support its activities and which often adopts an antagonistic tone toward state authority (Coleman 2014, 70). Other cyber attacks by non-state actors, in contrast, might be tolerated or even sponsored by the state to act in their interests. Analysts believe this was the case in 2007, when Russian hackers were sponsored by the state to unleash a massive cyber attack against the Estonian government and financial institutions over the relocation of a statue in the Estonian capital (Traynor 2007). Similarly, a group of hackers calling itself the Syrian Electronic Army claims to act on behalf of the Assad government (Boothby et al., 2012).\nComplexity in attributing cyber attacks is also a function of competing and inconsistent legal rules. The Draft Articles of the International Law Commission, which potentially reflect customary law, state that the conduct of an entity will be considered an act of a State under international law if that entity \"is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control\n\nRule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks 129\nof, that State in carrying out the conduct.” Thus, under this standard if a state directed a citizen hacker team to carry out a cyber attack, then those acts would be legally attributable back to that state. However, two international courts have weighed in on what the applicable standard should be when considering the attribution of certain acts to states, and in so doing, they have muddied the analytical waters.\nIn the *Nicaragua* case, the International Court of Justice was asked to decide whether the acts of the Contras — a rebel group engaged in a conflict with the Nicaraguan government — were attributable to the Government of the United States. In determining whether the relationship between the two was sufficiently close to allow for attribution, the Court held that “to be legally responsible, it would have to be proved that that State had *effective control* of the operations in the course of which the alleged violations were committed.” Thus, in order to be found responsible for particular cyber intrusions, under the *Nicaragua* standard it must be shown that the state in question had direct control over that very intrusion. In other words, “general overall control would have been insufficient to ground responsibility.” Rather, according to the jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice a more exacting standard applies.\nHowever, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia sees the status of international law on this issue quite differently. In the *Tadić* case, the Tribunal found that a demonstration of *overall control* could be sufficient for a finding of state responsibility. In this way, the Tribunal incorporated a less stringent test under the rules of international law, noting, “the degree of control might vary according to the circumstances and a high threshold might not always be required.” As a consequence, the international community is left with a somewhat fragmented set of legal rules to apply to cyber attacks, when trying to attribute those acts back to state actors. Does one need to show that the cyber attacker was acting on the instructions of the state or that the state had effective control of the impugned operation? Or, is it appropriate to apply some lower threshold for the attribution of acts in cyber space? Should states, for example, be required to take reasonable steps to prevent attacks that originate from their\n\nMutual Security in the Asia-Pacific: Roles for Australia, Canada and South Korea\nterritory? And if they fail to do so, should that provide a sufficient basis for a finding of responsibility? Or, should there be a more exacting standard in which states are called to account only when there is dispositive proof that an organ of the state committed or directed the attack?\nUltimately, the applicable rules remain somewhat unclear. However, what is clear is that the increasing centrality of cyber operations in the conduct of international relations is going put pressure on the existing set of rules and those rules will — no doubt — evolve in relation to that pressure. Thus, what is required at this point is some forward looking policy making aimed at developing a set of rules that accounts not only for where the subject technology is now, but where it is going to be in the future.\n## Political Dimensions of Attribution\nTechnical and legal aspects of attributing cyber attacks are, respectively, questions of evidentiary sufficiency — whether it is possible to determine the source of the attack to a degree of confidence that can withstand appropriate scrutiny — and appropriate procedure. These dimensions of attribution intersect in a complex fashion with a third, political, dimension. The key characteristic of the political dimension of attribution is publicity; a politically attributed attack, for the purposes of this paper, entails a public accusation. One example of such an attribution is the American indictment of five members of the Chinese Peoples' Liberation Army on charges of stealing intellectual property from several American firms (Schmidt and Sanger 2014).\nThis political dimension of attribution engages calculations of interest both by state and (increasingly) non-state actors, as well as less understood dynamics of choice driven by emotion and by justice motives (see Welch 1993; Raymond and Welch 2013). As a result of these considerations, it is possible that attacks which can be reliably attributed from technical and legal perspectives will not be publicly (politically) attributed (i.e. dogs that don't bark). It is also possible that political pressures may lead to the public attribution of cyber attacks even when relevant technical and legal criteria are not clearly satisfied (i.e. potentially false positives). Both of these outcomes can create problematic impacts on international security.\nThe primary risk associated with false positives is the creation of escalatory spirals. Accusations, in particular when not accompanied by convincing technical data and when not made according to proper legal procedure, can damage diplomatic relations. The offense-dominant nature of the cyber domain (at least given the current state of technology) suggests strong potential for\nRule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks 131\nescalation in the event of a cyber attack; the perceived necessity of immediate reprisal also creates pressures militating toward hasty attribution (Nye 2011). If the attribution is accompanied by self-help measures, the risk of tit-for-tat escalation and the emergence of a crisis atmosphere are increased. In crises, domestic audience costs have a critical effect on the willingness of parties to back down (Fearon 1994). Ironically, the Internet's expansion of low-cost communication and its increasing integration with critical infrastructure and other essential aspects of everyday life may act to increase the size of the domestic audience and the stakes of significant cyber attack disruptions in the eyes of that audience, thus ratcheting up the audience costs associated with conceding in a dispute concerning a publicly attributed cyber attack and making such crises especially prone to escalatory spirals. Societies with a high degree of Internet penetration may be most prone to escalate in the aftermath of a publicly attributed cyber attack. As global rates of Internet penetration increase, there is thus also a greater risk of conflict spirals.\nTwo caveats are in order. First, our argument does not rest in a strong sense on the past track record of offense-defense theory in explaining cases to which it has been applied. This is primarily because our argument is forward-looking; we are seeking to identify and anticipate potential problems in what is still a relatively new area of international politics. Second, and related, we want to be clear that we are advancing an explicitly probabilistic argument. We do not claim that all crises will escalate. Rather, we claim that false positives in cyber attribution make escalation more likely. This is the case because false accusations are likely to aggrieve falsely-accused parties, who will perceive the attack as unjust and thus be likely to respond in kind (Welch 1993). It is also the case, as we have already argued, because of the domestic political difficulties leaders face in backing down once public accusations have been made. Other factors certainly also affect the propensity of particular crises to escalate; one of the most significant is the presence or absence of a past history of animosity between the parties.11 Nevertheless, our analytical focus here is on the dangers associated with factors related to patterns of cyber-attribution.\nWe have focused thus far on the dangers inherent both in the employment of cyber attacks (and conduct that may be mistaken for a cyber attack, such as some cybercrime and cyber espionage activities) and in the hasty attribution of cyber attacks. Less obviously, there is also a significant danger in widespread failure to attribute cyber attacks when technical and legal criteria have been satisfied. If cyber attacks are not criticized and no efforts are made to hold bad actors accountable, the establishment of permissive norms (and even\n\nMutual Security in the Asia-Pacific: Roles for Australia, Canada and South Korea\npermissive customary international law) is likely. Given the escalatory potential of cyber attacks, the prevalence of permissive norms could pose a significant international security risk. This risk entails, at maximum, the employment of cyber attacks to create kinetic damage and widespread disruption to critical infrastructure, as well as the potential escalation to more traditional interstate military conflict. While such outcomes are unlikely, they carry high costs. More modestly, permissive norms could lead to higher incidence of increasingly sophisticated cyber attacks resulting in degradation of Internet services and a loss of trust in the Internet as a means of commerce, communication and delivery of government services. Even this more optimistic scenario involves significant economic opportunity costs. The key point is that, due to its ability to forestall the development of permissive norms, criticism of socially undesirable behaviour is important in itself, (at least partially) independent of the ability to effectively enforce international rules (see Johnston 2001).\n# Rule Making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks\nGiven that both attribution and non-attribution of cyber attacks create significant international security risks, what is the appropriate policy response when cyber attacks occur? We argue that thoughtful international efforts at rulemaking to govern state conduct in the attribution of cyber attacks have the potential to steer a middle course, mitigating the risks associated with both widespread non-attribution and with hasty attribution. Such rules must govern when and how states publicly attribute cyber attacks and the consequences of attribution. Furthermore, these rules need to accomplish two parallel tasks: minimizing the need for attribution; but also enhancing capacity to respond when necessary. While the ex-ante specification of such rules is impossible due to the unpredictable nature of international negotiations, it is possible to sketch out some general design features of promising rule sets. The final section of this chapter briefly elaborates these features and addresses additional policy options for cooperation pertaining to the attribution of cyber attacks. In keeping with the goals of this volume, these policy options are presented in terms of opportunities for Canada, Korea and Australia; however, at least in this case, we believe that the options we present would travel relatively well and could in principle be adopted by other constructive powers either at the global level or in other regions.\nWith respect to the procedural mechanics of attribution, several desirable design features can be identified. First, attribution should be done on the basis of technical best practices for determining the point of origin for Internet traffic. Second, state and non-state actors seeking to attribute cyber attacks\nRule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks 133\nshould bear in mind the ease of concealment either by technical means or by the employment of arms-length proxy agents. Accordingly, attribution should be made only after attempts to engage appropriate authorities in the apparent country of origin. Where such authorities react cooperatively and in good faith, this should be prominently noted when attribution is made. Ideally, in such situations, joint statements of attribution could be made.\nThe creation and application of attribution standards and practices will require responsible global leadership. Political scientists and international relations scholars suggest that global norms are actively built by agents who have strong notions about appropriate or desirable behaviour in their community (Finnemore and Sikkink 1998). Canada, Australia and Korea are well positioned to act cooperatively as global leaders developing norms for both the procedures and consequences of publicly attributing cyber attacks for the following reasons. All three countries can find common ground for the development of these norms through their shared dialogue on the importance of international trade for economic growth and domestic economic policies that reflect these views. Cyber attacks can have large impacts on a country's ability to fairly and effectively compete in global markets (for example, see Manyika et al. 2014; Centre for Strategic and International Studies 2013). Non-attribution of these kinds of cyber attacks could further encourage this behaviour, as states or other actors would face no consequences for their bad practices. However, hasty or aggressive public attribution could also affect a country's ability to gain from trade by affecting its ability to bargain in future trade negotiations. Accusations that are not supported by convincing technical data and not made according to proper legal procedure can damage diplomatic relations. Thus, states risk negative diplomatic consequences and losing gains from trade when both hasty public attribution and non-attribution are made. As advanced industrial democracies with digitally connected economies, Australia, Canada and Korea have particular interests in the health of the digital economy. They also share a basic commitment to the maintenance of a rules-based international order.\nIn deciding when and how to attribute cyber attacks, norms-guiding states, firms and other actors are of little use if the underlying technical and legal capacities for attribution remain weak. There is certainly much to be done in this area. However, there are good reasons to conclude that Canada, Australia and Korea can take the lead on enhancing the capacity to accurately attribute cyber attacks. All three countries possess digitally connected economies with significant pools of relevant human capital. Such steps complement and coincide with measures that can augment capacities to defend against (and repair damage resulting from) cyber attacks. We focus here on what we believe\nMutual Security in the Asia-Pacific: Roles for Australia, Canada and South Korea\nto be one of the most promising avenues for cooperation on capacity building: strengthening CERTs.\nCERTs are independent networks of technical experts chartered to work with the Internet community in preventing, detecting and resolving computer security incidents. Currently, there are over 250 independent CERTs registered with the Forum for Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST) — an international network of CERTs that are committed to information exchange and cooperation on issues of mutual interest. Generally, the teams share a common organizational structure centred on facilitating communication among experts; acting as a point of contact for emergencies; maintaining research ties to improve security; and initiating proactive measures to increase awareness and understanding of computer security among a variety of stakeholders. However, the particular role of any given CERT is largely self-defined. For example, individual CERTs differ in their areas of focus (academic, private, national, regional or global), expertise (phishing, viruses, information security) and ability to effectively perform their mandates due to varying levels of funding and or technical expertise (Choucri, Madnick and Ferwerda 2013). To help gauge the diversity in CERTs operating around the world, Figure 1 (CERT Composition by Region) highlights the variety of CERTs operating under the authority of academic, technical, private and government institutions.\nThere are a number of interesting insights that can be drawn from this figure. First, when comparing the total number of CERTs to the number of users within a given region, Europe, North America and Oceania have more CERTs available to users within the region. Africa, Asia, Latin America and to an extent Russia, all have similarly low levels of CERTs operating within the region compared to the number of users online. This shows that CERT creation and operation within particular regions is a non-linear function of income and that other factors, such as state function or institutions, play an important role. Secondly, the regional variance of the types of CERTs is interesting. Regions with a highly developed technical industry, such as Europe, the United States and Asia, generally have higher levels of private CERTs, whereas regions that have a limited technical industry tend to have less private CERTs and more government operated CERTs.\n CERTs are also interchangeably referred to as Computer Incident Response Teams and Computer Security Incident Response Teams.\n A full list of CERTS registered with FIRST can be found at www.first.org/members/teams\n For more information on the overarching vision of CERTS, see the CERT Coordination Centre, www.cert.org\n This data was compiled from CERTs registered as members of FIRST.\nRule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks\nFigure 1: CERT Composition by Region\nSource: Data collected by Authors from the CERTs registered as members of FIRST.\nCERTs are established in an ad hoc manner and are often self-governed. Anyone can create a CERT, but to become a member of the global forum FIRST, CERTs must fill out a document called Request for Comment 2350, which outlines information such as the services a CERT will offer, who its constituents are and under what authority it operates. Private and academic CERTs often operate under the authority of its institution, such as business or university codes of conduct. In addition, CERTs must also adhere to national laws applicable in the jurisdictions where they operate. It is important to note that legal regimes can affect a CERTs ability to respond and resolve to particular cyber security incident. In Turkey, for example, which prohibits sending banking related information outside of its geographic boundaries, a CERT must operate within the constraints of its own technical knowledge and resources, leaving them unable to share information with third parties outside of the country's borders. As a result, Turkey's financial sector often receives a poor level of service (Best Practice Forum 2014).\nGiven that CERTs currently have varying degrees of ability, the three countries can support and facilitate shared learning and capacity building among CERTs in several ways. One possibility would involve a joint commitment to hosting and sponsoring FIRST annual conferences on a rotating basis, or to supporting FIRST global initiatives such as special interest groups and \"birds of a feather\"\nMutual Security in the Asia-Pacific: Roles for Australia, Canada and South Korea\nforums that exist to provide a forum where members can discuss topics of common interest to the community. This would improve CERT effectiveness and provide the CERT community with facilities that would create an environment for shared learning and cooperation. Given the importance of maintaining effective government computer networks to deliver key public goods, there is also a clear rationale for the provision of funding and technical assistance for these purposes to low-income countries. Such public goods include domestic services, but also encompass international goods such as effective law enforcement cooperation. There is also a case for project-based funding for CERTs in the non-profit sector and perhaps even in private industry. This funding could be provided on an opt-in basis as grant programs, allowing consideration to be given both to the quality of the applicant and its level of financial need. Such grant programs could start as small-scale pilots and could expand to involve public-private partnerships. Augmenting the number and capabilities of CERTs can improve the accuracy of attempts to attribute cyber attacks as well as the potential to quickly and effectively repair any resulting damage. Such capabilities would make hasty and inaccurate attributions less likely by providing more timely and more accurate information about the technical nature of cyber attacks, and would also reduce pressures to attribute cyber attacks by mitigating the costs they entail for victims (and thus the desire to retaliate).\nThere are also potential gains from enhanced coordination. CERTs have been created by a wide variety of actors (both public and private) and with different geographic scopes (domestic, regional, global). Many national CERTs coordinate with other CERTs in their respective regions. Regional CERTs could institutionalize the working relations of national and private sector teams. This could improve CERT-to-CERT cooperation, and as CERTs cooperate and build capacity within the region, the development of a coherent rule set for technical attribution beyond one nation's borders could be encouraged over time. In addition, the institutionalized working relationship between regional public and private CERTs could encourage cooperation across legal jurisdictions and state borders. This network could improve information sharing across a variety of regions and improve the digital forensic capabilities of governments and law enforcement agencies so that credible attribution can be made within a region.\nThe Asia Pacific Computer Emergency Response Team (APCERT) could play a leading role in helping CERTs in the Asia-Pacific cooperate and develop rules of best practice for attribution across the region. APCERT has 25 operational teams from 19 different states, including (but not limited to) Australia, India, China, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, New Zealand and Thailand.[16] APCERT already\n\nRule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks 137\nplays an important role by creating and maintaining a mutually trusting network of computer security experts in the Asia-Pacific, which improves regional awareness of and competency in responding to computer incidents. However, only 19 regional countries are currently represented. APCERT’s membership could be expanded to include other Asia-Pacific economies, including Canada.\nGlobally, there is an opportunity for CERTs to contribute to rules of best practice for technical attribution. The Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST) is a global organization coordinating CERT responses to computer incidents. One such opportunity is the creation of ongoing dialogue around best practices, supported (financially and diplomatically) by engaged states such as Korea, Australia and Canada. Such efforts are distinct from general augmentation of CERT capacities in that they would focus specifically on engaging the CERT community in contributing to broader attempts to think creatively about best practices for attribution. States could also make especially valuable contributions to these efforts by arranging the participation of experts in the legal and political dimensions of attribution. While broadening dialogue can create problems arising from divergent preferences and from difficulties in coordinating large numbers of players, bringing together these distinct voices can ensure that attribution of cyber attacks is approached in a holistic fashion that includes actors with requisite legal and political expertise.\nCERT coordination could also be improved through policies and practices that promote the interoperability of laws around information sharing. Given that the disharmonization of national laws could limit or prevent CERTs from effectively resolving computer security incidents, when creating or updating national legislation policy makers should consider the effect a law can have on a CERT’s ability to cooperate internationally. It is important that policy makers consider legal interoperability as a matter of degree that can be achieved through a variety of means, such as harmonization, standardization, mutual recognition, reciprocity and cooperation (Weber 2014). CERTs and policymakers should work together and create a shared dialogue that explores ways in which national laws can be implemented and utilized to further encourage CERT-CERT cooperation across national borders.\nGiven their technical expertise, it might seem like a natural fit to give regional and global CERTs official roles in investigating and making attributions for particular cyber attacks. While we do not rule out the viability of this option at least in some situations, we emphasize that there are reasons to be cautious in adopting such policies in the short-term. Directly involving CERTs in making attributions of cyber attacks risks politicizing their work and undermining the willingness of states and other actors to work with CERTs, especially at the\nMutual Security in the Asia-Pacific: Roles for Australia, Canada and South Korea\nregional and global levels. This could have the perverse effect of reducing rather than increasing the quality of information available, as well as the additional perverse effect of inhibiting efforts to quickly and effectively mitigate the effect of cyber attacks. It might be more palatable instead to establish the expectation that states and other actors seek the input of relevant CERTs prior to making public attributions of cyber attacks. The role of CERTs in this respect would be restricted to the provision of publicly available information that could be verified by interested parties, and that therefore should be less susceptible to politicization. To further reduce this risk, it might also be desirable to establish the expectation that public attributions be made on the basis of concurring analysis from multiple CERTs, at least some of which do not have a real or apparent conflict of interest. While it may not be possible to eliminate incidents of political leaders shopping among CERTs for favourable analysis, establishing norms that expect multiple concurring analyses and that expect the underlying technical data to be made publicly available can increase the legitimacy costs associated with such behaviour.\nWhile there is a need for rule making both about the procedures and consequences of public attribution and for various kinds of capacity-building and coordination measures, there is also a need for a commitment to restraint when publicly attributing cyber attacks. The widespread consistent exercise of such restraint in the face of what are likely to be increasingly common and perhaps increasingly disruptive incidents will take political will and statesmanship. This is the final way in which we conclude that Canada, Korea and Australia can show leadership. They can do so with the goal of forging a shared vision of the need for restraint in attribution in light of recent events and emerging trends. Such a vision must be predicated on relevant norms from other areas of international law and the broader regime complex for cyber governance (Nye 2014). A constructive discussion of the issues should begin with a shared understanding of what we have identified as the central dilemma in attributing cyber attacks: that careless attribution can be counter-productive and destabilizing, damaging important political, cultural and economic relationships; and that, on the other hand, lack of attribution can create a permissive environment in which cyber attacks are seen as low-cost and perhaps even as acceptable behaviour.\nNorms on cyber security and conflict are a global matter. However, given that cyber security issues are relatively new, multilateral institutions and other forms of international cooperation within this policy domain have not yet matured. The literature on constructive powers can be used to explain and describe\n Such real or apparent conflicts of interest could arise from a CERT based in a state making the public attribution or having a financial relationship with the entity (state or otherwise) making the attribution.\nRule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks 139\nhow countries develop norms in these nascent policy spaces (Hampson and Heinbecker 2011). Constructive powers can act as norm entrepreneurs in the development of global norms on cyber attacks and attribution. As Simon Palamar discusses in his contribution to this volume, one characteristic of constructive powers is their ability to shape the world in ways that explicitly take the preferences and interests of others into account. The development of norms on public attribution aligns with the preferences of other states given the political, economic and social consequences of both hasty and non-attribution. As constructive powers, Canada, Australia and Korea are well positioned to begin a productive dialogue — both domestically and in concert with each other — and to frame this critical conversation from its earliest stages, creating conditions for ongoing conversation and institutional learning.\nSuch norm-building processes are typically slow and non-linear in nature. This is especially true under conditions of uncertainty, for example the uncertainty associated with assessing the political and strategic implications of a disruptive new technology. Kenneth Abbott and Duncan Snidal have argued that in situations of uncertainty, soft law instruments are often superior choices to traditional hard law instruments such as treaties (Abbott and Snidal 2000). Hard law is difficult to change once it is established: at the national level, governments must go through long processes to change or update domestic laws, and at the international level, difficulties reaching agreements are even more pronounced as diverse actors bargain to reach some form of consensus. Soft law, in contrast, facilitates learning about the implications of particular kinds of rules and governance arrangements over time, making it easier for countries to come to an agreement typically with lower sovereignty costs than the negotiation (and renegotiation) of hard law. A great deal of soft law is developed and implemented by transnational networks of legal and regulatory experts that perform “the hard work of international law.”\nThis pattern of gradual norm-building via soft law instruments and transnational legal-regulatory networks is likely to hold with respect to the governance of attributing cyber attacks. Just as attempts to develop rules around the use of nuclear weapons was not a static process and required an extended period of learning (Freedman 1981; Tannenwald 2007), attempts to govern the cyber realm are likely to develop via various forms of soft law prior to hard, institutionalized and multilateral treaties. Joseph Nye draws this parallel and states that: “Governments learn slowly from knowledge, study and experience, and learning occurs internationally when new knowledge gradually redefines the content of national interests and leads to new policies. For example, the United\n On transnational regulatory networks, see Verdier (2009 113-172). The phrase “the hard work of international law” is taken from Brunnée and Toope (2010).\nMutual Security in the Asia-Pacific: Roles for Australia, Canada and South Korea\nStates and the Soviet Union took decades to learn how to adapt and respond to the prior revolution in military affairs — nuclear technology after 1945\" (Nye 2011, 19). There are reasons to expect that such learning and norm development will be even more difficult in the cyber case than it was in the nuclear era; for example, barriers to entry are far lower in the cyber case, and these capabilities have already proliferated far beyond the very small group of exclusively state actors that possess nuclear weapons. Creating shared knowledge among a much larger, and much more organizationally heterogeneous, number of players is likely to be extremely difficult.\nNotwithstanding these difficulties, a conscious effort to build and clarify norms for state behaviour in cyberspace is already underway. The United Nations Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) recently concluded that the current law of armed conflict applies online and that response to cyber attacks should be conducted within the framework of customary international law. The assessment of the GGE represents a start for international rule-making on cyber attacks rather than a conclusion, as agreeing on specific interpretations for applying general international legal rules to particular cases will require a great deal of work. However, it suggests that cyber attacks should be conducted only in self-defence or in accordance with authorization of collective action under the UN Charter. It further suggests that cyber attacks must distinguish between military and civilian targets and must accord with rules of proportionality. Finally, it suggests the importance of treating response to cyber attacks under the legal framework of state responsibility. Doing so establishes limits on justifiable self-help measures that states may take in response to an attributed cyber attack. Encouraging adherence to these limits can minimize the escalatory potential for cyber attacks.\nFurther developing the international legal and political frameworks governing response to cyber attacks will require sustained engagement with additional legal questions, prominent among which are questions of attribution. Indeed, determining whether a particular attack is attributable to a specific state (or states) is in many ways a logically prior question to assessing whether the attack was legally justifiable under international law and, if not, what countermeasures may be taken by which parties. The Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare provides a crucial legal resource for addressing these matters (see Schmitt 2013, 29-41). However, as we have argued, these are no more purely legal questions than they are purely technical ones.\nEnsuring the success of international efforts to build responsible norms for state conduct in cyberspace will require patient, careful work over a long period of time. Canada, Korea and Australia have the required resources (including positive\nRule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks 141\ninternational reputations) to play leading roles in this work both at the regional and global levels. As digitally connected economies, they also have clear interests in a positive outcome. In the nuclear era, such learning processes involved the creation of forums and study groups bringing together policy makers, military leaders and academics. Much of this activity took place at the national level, and it is likely that governments will engage on similar crash-course-learning programs as cyber issues become more prominent in contemporary international politics. However, given the greater reach and density of transnational networks among policy makers, there may be scope for international analogues to these processes. Transnational learning processes may (at least initially) take place at less official levels and involve more prominent roles for academics and other non-state actors, but may nevertheless play an important role in encouraging the improvement and dissemination of best practices for attributing cyber attacks and for ensuring responsible state conduct in cyberspace more generally. Providing resources to facilitate such processes is an inexpensive proposition with potentially large benefits and could be a priority for cooperation in both the short and long term.",

  "sections": {
    "__preamble__": "Samantha Bradshaw, Mark Raymond and Aaron Shull # Introduction In June of 2014, on the sixty-third anniversary of the start of the Korean War, the New York Times reported that offensive cyber operations had been initiated against various websites in both Korean countries. In the North, the affected websites included those of the main Communist Party newspaper and the official Korean Central News Agency. In the South, the website for the presidential office and another government agency were rendered temporarily inaccessible. Given the tenor of political relations on the Korean peninsula, speculation centred on the possibility of involvement by state actors or their proxies. However, determining who was responsible for these cyber intrusions was complicated by several facts. First, a number of individuals purporting to belong to the\"hacktivist\"network Anonymous had indicated on Twitter that they would undertake offensive cyber operations against the North on the war's anniversary. Second, Twitter users also\"claimed responsibility for the attacks in South Korea, saying they demanded that the South's government stop censoring Internet content\"(ibid.). Given the relative ease of compromising authentication for social media accounts and the difficulty of independently establishing the source of origin for data transmitted over the Internet, it is difficult to regard such claims of responsibility as dispositive.¹ Problems in attributing the cyber attacks related to the anniversary of the Korean War expose a deeper, and more nuanced problem. The challenge is that attributing cyber intrusions back to a government sponsor is not simply a factual or technical challenge. Rather, it is a multifaceted problem that has technical, legal and political dimensions, all of which must be satisfied for the attribution of a cyber attack to a particular state to be appropriate. The additional complexity here, as with most things cyber, is that the rules governing conduct in each of these categories are still evolving. However, the complexity of the task should not mask its importance. The increasing importance of the Internet to daily life can be expected over time to amplify the stakes involved in large-scale, persistent disruptions of access. Further, technology already allows the creation of kinetic effects by means of malicious code; such capabilities are highly likely to become more widely available in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, there is real potential for escalation from cyber attacks to more traditional forms of violent conflict. New rules, norms and institutional structures are needed that can ameliorate the possibility of misattribution and the attendant consequences that would flow from it, and that can act as circuit-breakers inhibiting escalatory spirals even where attribution is properly made.\nIn order to advance this broad claim, the paper will proceed in the following fashion. The first section will highlight the technical aspects of attributing a cyber intrusion to a particular actor or set of actors. The second section will discuss the legal rules governing state responsibility and the attribution of acts to state actors. The third section will discuss the international political dimensions involved in determining whether or not to publicly attribute a particular cyber act to a given state. Finally, the paper concludes by arguing clearer rules are needed to avert the possible negative consequences of misattribution and that an impartial international institutional cooperative mechanism is needed to facilitate the development of a meaningful rule-based framework for state conduct related to attribution for cyber attacks. As constructive powers, Canada, Australia and Korea are well positioned to play a leading role in the development of global norms for both the procedures and consequences of publicly attributing cyber attacks by enhancing capacity to respond to cyber attacks through the augmentation of Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) and by crafting norms of restraint that demonstrate the political, economic and cultural consequences of both hasty and non-attribution.\nRule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks 127 # The Technical Dimension of Attribution Technical attribution of cyber attacks is primarily a matter of employing computer forensics to determine the physical point(s) of origin for a particular computer network operation and to locate circumstantial evidence embedded in malicious code that provides information about the likely identity of its author(s), such as languages employed or particular cultural points of reference. For a small number of governments, these means can be augmented with additional intelligence sources and methods.\nThe expertise necessary for such attribution efforts is, again with the exception of a growing number of wealthy governments, in the hands of private companies. Large computer network operators, technology companies and computer security firms possess increasingly sophisticated technical means to attribute cyber attacks.2 The emergence of private actors with intelligence capabilities that to some extent rival and exceed those of states is a new development; while non-state actors are not new in international relations, it is novel for such actors to enjoy resource and expertise advantages in a core area of state policy intimately connected to the state's monopoly on the use of legitimate violence. The involvement of corporate actors in the attribution of cyber attacks is also likely to prove controversial. Specifically, it is not clear whether states will generally accept the judgment of such companies — in particular when the company is headquartered in the same state making the public attribution of the attack.\nLeaving problems of credibility aside, there are also clear limits to technical attribution, in particular when principals employ arms-length agents (potentially located in other states) and/or transnational botnets in the conduct of cyber attacks. Given the utility of such gambits in frustrating attempts at attribution and the low cost of employing them, these practices are likely to spread. Even when location of origin can be conclusively identified, this is not necessarily a dispositive indication of responsibility either under narrow legal standards or more expansive political ones.",
    "# The International Legal Dimension of Attribution Assuming that cyber attacks constitute internationally wrongful acts, and assuming that the technical/factual indications provide sufficient evidence that the attack in question has a state connection, then invariably the relevant Mutual Security in the Asia-Pacific: Roles for Australia, Canada and South Korea international legal rules to apply will be the ones governing state responsibility. In short, state responsibility is a fundamental rule governing international relations which holds that if a state commits an internationally wrongful act that is attributable to the state, and the act constitutes a breach of an international obligation, then that state will owe a duty to make reparations for the breach.³ The relevant question then becomes: what activities are attributable to a state? Unfortunately, the answer is not entirely clear.": "Legal attribution is straightforward when the act in question is committed by an organ of the state. In these cases, the law will presume that the act committed by the organ is the act of the state itself. Suppose for example that a cyber attack was directed by a division of the military or the state intelligence services; this would\"according to a well-established rule of international law [...] be regarded as an act of that state.\"⁴ Determining responsibility becomes more complex, however, when dealing with entities that are more loosely affiliated with the state. For example, non-state actors who launch cyber attacks or engage in hacktivist activities may have varying degrees of state connection. Some may act with no official connection to the state, such as the infamous hacktivist group Anonymous, which operates with neither\"the steady income nor the fiscal sponsorship\"to support its activities and which often adopts an antagonistic tone toward state authority. Other cyber attacks by non-state actors, in contrast, might be tolerated or even sponsored by the state to act in their interests. Analysts believe this was the case in 2007, when Russian hackers were sponsored by the state to unleash a massive cyber attack against the Estonian government and financial institutions over the relocation of a statue in the Estonian capital. Similarly, a group of hackers calling itself the Syrian Electronic Army claims to act on behalf of the Assad government.\nComplexity in attributing cyber attacks is also a function of competing and inconsistent legal rules. The Draft Articles of the International Law Commission, which potentially reflect customary law,⁵ state that the conduct of an entity will be considered an act of a State under international law if that entity\"is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control Rule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks 129 of, that State in carrying out the conduct.”⁶ Thus, under this standard if a state directed a citizen hacker team to carry out a cyber attack, then those acts would be legally attributable back to that state. However, two international courts have weighed in on what the applicable standard should be when considering the attribution of certain acts to states, and in so doing, they have muddied the analytical waters.\nIn the *Nicaragua* case, the International Court of Justice was asked to decide whether the acts of the Contras — a rebel group engaged in a conflict with the Nicaraguan government — were attributable to the Government of the United States. In determining whether the relationship between the two was sufficiently close to allow for attribution, the Court held that “to be legally responsible, it would have to be proved that that State had *effective control* of the operations in the course of which the alleged violations were committed.”⁷ Thus, in order to be found responsible for particular cyber intrusions, under the *Nicaragua* standard it must be shown that the state in question had direct control over that very intrusion. In other words, “general overall control would have been insufficient to ground responsibility.”⁸ Rather, according to the jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice a more exacting standard applies.⁹ However, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia sees the status of international law on this issue quite differently. In the *Tadić* case, the Tribunal found that a demonstration of *overall control* could be sufficient for a finding of state responsibility. In this way, the Tribunal incorporated a less stringent test under the rules of international law, noting, “the degree of control might vary according to the circumstances and a high threshold might not always be required.”¹⁰ As a consequence, the international community is left with a somewhat fragmented set of legal rules to apply to cyber attacks, when trying to attribute those acts back to state actors. Does one need to show that the cyber attacker was acting on the instructions of the state or that the state had effective control of the impugned operation? Or, is it appropriate to apply some lower threshold for the attribution of acts in cyber space? Should states, for example, be required to take reasonable steps to prevent attacks that originate from their Mutual Security in the Asia-Pacific: Roles for Australia, Canada and South Korea territory? And if they fail to do so, should that provide a sufficient basis for a finding of responsibility? Or, should there be a more exacting standard in which states are called to account only when there is dispositive proof that an organ of the state committed or directed the attack?\nUltimately, the applicable rules remain somewhat unclear. However, what is clear is that the increasing centrality of cyber operations in the conduct of international relations is going put pressure on the existing set of rules and those rules will — no doubt — evolve in relation to that pressure. Thus, what is required at this point is some forward looking policy making aimed at developing a set of rules that accounts not only for where the subject technology is now, but where it is going to be in the future.",
    "## Political Dimensions of Attribution Technical and legal aspects of attributing cyber attacks are, respectively, questions of evidentiary sufficiency — whether it is possible to determine the source of the attack to a degree of confidence that can withstand appropriate scrutiny — and appropriate procedure. These dimensions of attribution intersect in a complex fashion with a third, political, dimension. The key characteristic of the political dimension of attribution is publicity; a politically attributed attack, for the purposes of this paper, entails a public accusation. One example of such an attribution is the American indictment of five members of the Chinese Peoples' Liberation Army on charges of stealing intellectual property from several American firms.": "This political dimension of attribution engages calculations of interest both by state and (increasingly) non-state actors, as well as less understood dynamics of choice driven by emotion and by justice motives (see Welch 1993; Raymond and Welch 2013). As a result of these considerations, it is possible that attacks which can be reliably attributed from technical and legal perspectives will not be publicly (politically) attributed (i.e. dogs that don't bark). It is also possible that political pressures may lead to the public attribution of cyber attacks even when relevant technical and legal criteria are not clearly satisfied (i.e. potentially false positives). Both of these outcomes can create problematic impacts on international security.\nThe primary risk associated with false positives is the creation of escalatory spirals. Accusations, in particular when not accompanied by convincing technical data and when not made according to proper legal procedure, can damage diplomatic relations. The offense-dominant nature of the cyber domain (at least given the current state of technology) suggests strong potential for Rule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks 131 escalation in the event of a cyber attack; the perceived necessity of immediate reprisal also creates pressures militating toward hasty attribution. If the attribution is accompanied by self-help measures, the risk of tit-for-tat escalation and the emergence of a crisis atmosphere are increased. In crises, domestic audience costs have a critical effect on the willingness of parties to back down. Ironically, the Internet's expansion of low-cost communication and its increasing integration with critical infrastructure and other essential aspects of everyday life may act to increase the size of the domestic audience and the stakes of significant cyber attack disruptions in the eyes of that audience, thus ratcheting up the audience costs associated with conceding in a dispute concerning a publicly attributed cyber attack and making such crises especially prone to escalatory spirals. Societies with a high degree of Internet penetration may be most prone to escalate in the aftermath of a publicly attributed cyber attack. As global rates of Internet penetration increase, there is thus also a greater risk of conflict spirals.\nTwo caveats are in order. First, our argument does not rest in a strong sense on the past track record of offense-defense theory in explaining cases to which it has been applied. This is primarily because our argument is forward-looking; we are seeking to identify and anticipate potential problems in what is still a relatively new area of international politics. Second, and related, we want to be clear that we are advancing an explicitly probabilistic argument. We do not claim that all crises will escalate. Rather, we claim that false positives in cyber attribution make escalation more likely. This is the case because false accusations are likely to aggrieve falsely-accused parties, who will perceive the attack as unjust and thus be likely to respond in kind. It is also the case, as we have already argued, because of the domestic political difficulties leaders face in backing down once public accusations have been made. Other factors certainly also affect the propensity of particular crises to escalate; one of the most significant is the presence or absence of a past history of animosity between the parties.11 Nevertheless, our analytical focus here is on the dangers associated with factors related to patterns of cyber-attribution.\nWe have focused thus far on the dangers inherent both in the employment of cyber attacks (and conduct that may be mistaken for a cyber attack, such as some cybercrime and cyber espionage activities) and in the hasty attribution of cyber attacks. Less obviously, there is also a significant danger in widespread failure to attribute cyber attacks when technical and legal criteria have been satisfied. If cyber attacks are not criticized and no efforts are made to hold bad actors accountable, the establishment of permissive norms (and even\nMutual Security in the Asia-Pacific: Roles for Australia, Canada and South Korea\npermissive customary international law) is likely. Given the escalatory potential of cyber attacks, the prevalence of permissive norms could pose a significant international security risk. This risk entails, at maximum, the employment of cyber attacks to create kinetic damage and widespread disruption to critical infrastructure, as well as the potential escalation to more traditional interstate military conflict. While such outcomes are unlikely, they carry high costs. More modestly, permissive norms could lead to higher incidence of increasingly sophisticated cyber attacks resulting in degradation of Internet services and a loss of trust in the Internet as a means of commerce, communication and delivery of government services. Even this more optimistic scenario involves significant economic opportunity costs. The key point is that, due to its ability to forestall the development of permissive norms, criticism of socially undesirable behaviour is important in itself, (at least partially) independent of the ability to effectively enforce international rules (see Johnston 2001).",
    "# Rule Making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks": "Given that both attribution and non-attribution of cyber attacks create significant international security risks, what is the appropriate policy response when cyber attacks occur? We argue that thoughtful international efforts at rulemaking to govern state conduct in the attribution of cyber attacks have the potential to steer a middle course, mitigating the risks associated with both widespread non-attribution and with hasty attribution. Such rules must govern when and how states publicly attribute cyber attacks and the consequences of attribution. Furthermore, these rules need to accomplish two parallel tasks: minimizing the need for attribution; but also enhancing capacity to respond when necessary. While the ex-ante specification of such rules is impossible due to the unpredictable nature of international negotiations, it is possible to sketch out some general design features of promising rule sets. The final section of this chapter briefly elaborates these features and addresses additional policy options for cooperation pertaining to the attribution of cyber attacks. In keeping with the goals of this volume, these policy options are presented in terms of opportunities for Canada, Korea and Australia; however, at least in this case, we believe that the options we present would travel relatively well and could in principle be adopted by other constructive powers either at the global level or in other regions.\nWith respect to the procedural mechanics of attribution, several desirable design features can be identified. First, attribution should be done on the basis of technical best practices for determining the point of origin for Internet traffic. Second, state and non-state actors seeking to attribute cyber attacks\nRule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks 133\nshould bear in mind the ease of concealment either by technical means or by the employment of arms-length proxy agents. Accordingly, attribution should be made only after attempts to engage appropriate authorities in the apparent country of origin. Where such authorities react cooperatively and in good faith, this should be prominently noted when attribution is made. Ideally, in such situations, joint statements of attribution could be made.\nThe creation and application of attribution standards and practices will require responsible global leadership. Political scientists and international relations scholars suggest that global norms are actively built by agents who have strong notions about appropriate or desirable behaviour in their community . Canada, Australia and Korea are well positioned to act cooperatively as global leaders developing norms for both the procedures and consequences of publicly attributing cyber attacks for the following reasons. All three countries can find common ground for the development of these norms through their shared dialogue on the importance of international trade for economic growth and domestic economic policies that reflect these views. Cyber attacks can have large impacts on a country's ability to fairly and effectively compete in global markets (for example, see Manyika et al. 2014; Centre for Strategic and International Studies 2013). Non-attribution of these kinds of cyber attacks could further encourage this behaviour, as states or other actors would face no consequences for their bad practices. However, hasty or aggressive public attribution could also affect a country's ability to gain from trade by affecting its ability to bargain in future trade negotiations. Accusations that are not supported by convincing technical data and not made according to proper legal procedure can damage diplomatic relations. Thus, states risk negative diplomatic consequences and losing gains from trade when both hasty public attribution and non-attribution are made. As advanced industrial democracies with digitally connected economies, Australia, Canada and Korea have particular interests in the health of the digital economy. They also share a basic commitment to the maintenance of a rules-based international order.\nIn deciding when and how to attribute cyber attacks, norms-guiding states, firms and other actors are of little use if the underlying technical and legal capacities for attribution remain weak. There is certainly much to be done in this area. However, there are good reasons to conclude that Canada, Australia and Korea can take the lead on enhancing the capacity to accurately attribute cyber attacks. All three countries possess digitally connected economies with significant pools of relevant human capital. Such steps complement and coincide with measures that can augment capacities to defend against (and repair damage resulting from) cyber attacks. We focus here on what we believe\nMutual Security in the Asia-Pacific: Roles for Australia, Canada and South Korea\nto be one of the most promising avenues for cooperation on capacity building: strengthening CERTs.¹²\nCERTs are independent networks of technical experts chartered to work with the Internet community in preventing, detecting and resolving computer security incidents. Currently, there are over 250 independent CERTs registered with the Forum for Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST) — an international network of CERTs that are committed to information exchange and cooperation on issues of mutual interest.¹³ Generally, the teams share a common organizational structure centred on facilitating communication among experts; acting as a point of contact for emergencies; maintaining research ties to improve security; and initiating proactive measures to increase awareness and understanding of computer security among a variety of stakeholders.¹⁴ However, the particular role of any given CERT is largely self-defined. For example, individual CERTs differ in their areas of focus (academic, private, national, regional or global), expertise (phishing, viruses, information security) and ability to effectively perform their mandates due to varying levels of funding and or technical expertise (Choucri, Madnick and Ferwerda 2013). To help gauge the diversity in CERTs operating around the world, Figure 1 (CERT Composition by Region) highlights the variety of CERTs operating under the authority of academic, technical, private and government institutions.¹⁵\nThere are a number of interesting insights that can be drawn from this figure. First, when comparing the total number of CERTs to the number of users within a given region, Europe, North America and Oceania have more CERTs available to users within the region. Africa, Asia, Latin America and to an extent Russia, all have similarly low levels of CERTs operating within the region compared to the number of users online. This shows that CERT creation and operation within particular regions is a non-linear function of income and that other factors, such as state function or institutions, play an important role. Secondly, the regional variance of the types of CERTs is interesting. Regions with a highly developed technical industry, such as Europe, the United States and Asia, generally have higher levels of private CERTs, whereas regions that have a limited technical industry tend to have less private CERTs and more government operated CERTs.\n¹² CERTs are also interchangeably referred to as Computer Incident Response Teams and Computer Security Incident Response Teams.\n¹³ A full list of CERTS registered with FIRST can be found at www.first.org/members/teams\n¹⁴ For more information on the overarching vision of CERTS, see the CERT Coordination Centre, www.cert.org\n¹⁵ This data was compiled from CERTs registered as members of FIRST.\nRule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks\nFigure 1: CERT Composition by Region\nSource: Data collected by Authors from the CERTs registered as members of FIRST.\nCERTs are established in an ad hoc manner and are often self-governed. Anyone can create a CERT, but to become a member of the global forum FIRST, CERTs must fill out a document called Request for Comment 2350, which outlines information such as the services a CERT will offer, who its constituents are and under what authority it operates. Private and academic CERTs often operate under the authority of its institution, such as business or university codes of conduct. In addition, CERTs must also adhere to national laws applicable in the jurisdictions where they operate. It is important to note that legal regimes can affect a CERTs ability to respond and resolve to particular cyber security incident. In Turkey, for example, which prohibits sending banking related information outside of its geographic boundaries, a CERT must operate within the constraints of its own technical knowledge and resources, leaving them unable to share information with third parties outside of the country's borders. As a result, Turkey's financial sector often receives a poor level of service (Best Practice Forum 2014).\nGiven that CERTs currently have varying degrees of ability, the three countries can support and facilitate shared learning and capacity building among CERTs in several ways. One possibility would involve a joint commitment to hosting and sponsoring FIRST annual conferences on a rotating basis, or to supporting FIRST global initiatives such as special interest groups and \"birds of a feather\"\nMutual Security in the Asia-Pacific: Roles for Australia, Canada and South Korea\nforums that exist to provide a forum where members can discuss topics of common interest to the community. This would improve CERT effectiveness and provide the CERT community with facilities that would create an environment for shared learning and cooperation. Given the importance of maintaining effective government computer networks to deliver key public goods, there is also a clear rationale for the provision of funding and technical assistance for these purposes to low-income countries. Such public goods include domestic services, but also encompass international goods such as effective law enforcement cooperation. There is also a case for project-based funding for CERTs in the non-profit sector and perhaps even in private industry. This funding could be provided on an opt-in basis as grant programs, allowing consideration to be given both to the quality of the applicant and its level of financial need. Such grant programs could start as small-scale pilots and could expand to involve public-private partnerships. Augmenting the number and capabilities of CERTs can improve the accuracy of attempts to attribute cyber attacks as well as the potential to quickly and effectively repair any resulting damage. Such capabilities would make hasty and inaccurate attributions less likely by providing more timely and more accurate information about the technical nature of cyber attacks, and would also reduce pressures to attribute cyber attacks by mitigating the costs they entail for victims (and thus the desire to retaliate).\nThere are also potential gains from enhanced coordination. CERTs have been created by a wide variety of actors (both public and private) and with different geographic scopes (domestic, regional, global). Many national CERTs coordinate with other CERTs in their respective regions. Regional CERTs could institutionalize the working relations of national and private sector teams. This could improve CERT-to-CERT cooperation, and as CERTs cooperate and build capacity within the region, the development of a coherent rule set for technical attribution beyond one nation's borders could be encouraged over time. In addition, the institutionalized working relationship between regional public and private CERTs could encourage cooperation across legal jurisdictions and state borders. This network could improve information sharing across a variety of regions and improve the digital forensic capabilities of governments and law enforcement agencies so that credible attribution can be made within a region.\nThe Asia Pacific Computer Emergency Response Team (APCERT) could play a leading role in helping CERTs in the Asia-Pacific cooperate and develop rules of best practice for attribution across the region. APCERT has 25 operational teams from 19 different states, including (but not limited to) Australia, India, China, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, New Zealand and Thailand.[16] APCERT already\nRule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks 137 plays an important role by creating and maintaining a mutually trusting network of computer security experts in the Asia-Pacific, which improves regional awareness of and competency in responding to computer incidents. However, only 19 regional countries are currently represented. APCERT’s membership could be expanded to include other Asia-Pacific economies, including Canada.\nGlobally, there is an opportunity for CERTs to contribute to rules of best practice for technical attribution. The Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST) is a global organization coordinating CERT responses to computer incidents. One such opportunity is the creation of ongoing dialogue around best practices, supported (financially and diplomatically) by engaged states such as Korea, Australia and Canada. Such efforts are distinct from general augmentation of CERT capacities in that they would focus specifically on engaging the CERT community in contributing to broader attempts to think creatively about best practices for attribution. States could also make especially valuable contributions to these efforts by arranging the participation of experts in the legal and political dimensions of attribution. While broadening dialogue can create problems arising from divergent preferences and from difficulties in coordinating large numbers of players, bringing together these distinct voices can ensure that attribution of cyber attacks is approached in a holistic fashion that includes actors with requisite legal and political expertise.\nCERT coordination could also be improved through policies and practices that promote the interoperability of laws around information sharing. Given that the disharmonization of national laws could limit or prevent CERTs from effectively resolving computer security incidents, when creating or updating national legislation policy makers should consider the effect a law can have on a CERT’s ability to cooperate internationally. It is important that policy makers consider legal interoperability as a matter of degree that can be achieved through a variety of means, such as harmonization, standardization, mutual recognition, reciprocity and cooperation. CERTs and policymakers should work together and create a shared dialogue that explores ways in which national laws can be implemented and utilized to further encourage CERT-CERT cooperation across national borders.\nGiven their technical expertise, it might seem like a natural fit to give regional and global CERTs official roles in investigating and making attributions for particular cyber attacks. While we do not rule out the viability of this option at least in some situations, we emphasize that there are reasons to be cautious in adopting such policies in the short-term. Directly involving CERTs in making attributions of cyber attacks risks politicizing their work and undermining the willingness of states and other actors to work with CERTs, especially at the Mutual Security in the Asia-Pacific: Roles for Australia, Canada and South Korea regional and global levels. This could have the perverse effect of reducing rather than increasing the quality of information available, as well as the additional perverse effect of inhibiting efforts to quickly and effectively mitigate the effect of cyber attacks. It might be more palatable instead to establish the expectation that states and other actors seek the input of relevant CERTs prior to making public attributions of cyber attacks. The role of CERTs in this respect would be restricted to the provision of publicly available information that could be verified by interested parties, and that therefore should be less susceptible to politicization. To further reduce this risk, it might also be desirable to establish the expectation that public attributions be made on the basis of concurring analysis from multiple CERTs, at least some of which do not have a real or apparent conflict of interest.¹⁷ While it may not be possible to eliminate incidents of political leaders shopping among CERTs for favourable analysis, establishing norms that expect multiple concurring analyses and that expect the underlying technical data to be made publicly available can increase the legitimacy costs associated with such behaviour.\nWhile there is a need for rule making both about the procedures and consequences of public attribution and for various kinds of capacity-building and coordination measures, there is also a need for a commitment to restraint when publicly attributing cyber attacks. The widespread consistent exercise of such restraint in the face of what are likely to be increasingly common and perhaps increasingly disruptive incidents will take political will and statesmanship. This is the final way in which we conclude that Canada, Korea and Australia can show leadership. They can do so with the goal of forging a shared vision of the need for restraint in attribution in light of recent events and emerging trends. Such a vision must be predicated on relevant norms from other areas of international law and the broader regime complex for cyber governance. A constructive discussion of the issues should begin with a shared understanding of what we have identified as the central dilemma in attributing cyber attacks: that careless attribution can be counter-productive and destabilizing, damaging important political, cultural and economic relationships; and that, on the other hand, lack of attribution can create a permissive environment in which cyber attacks are seen as low-cost and perhaps even as acceptable behaviour.\nNorms on cyber security and conflict are a global matter. However, given that cyber security issues are relatively new, multilateral institutions and other forms of international cooperation within this policy domain have not yet matured. The literature on constructive powers can be used to explain and describe ¹⁷ Such real or apparent conflicts of interest could arise from a CERT based in a state making the public attribution or having a financial relationship with the entity (state or otherwise) making the attribution.\nRule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks 139 how countries develop norms in these nascent policy spaces. Constructive powers can act as norm entrepreneurs in the development of global norms on cyber attacks and attribution. As Simon Palamar discusses in his contribution to this volume, one characteristic of constructive powers is their ability to shape the world in ways that explicitly take the preferences and interests of others into account. The development of norms on public attribution aligns with the preferences of other states given the political, economic and social consequences of both hasty and non-attribution. As constructive powers, Canada, Australia and Korea are well positioned to begin a productive dialogue — both domestically and in concert with each other — and to frame this critical conversation from its earliest stages, creating conditions for ongoing conversation and institutional learning.\nSuch norm-building processes are typically slow and non-linear in nature. This is especially true under conditions of uncertainty, for example the uncertainty associated with assessing the political and strategic implications of a disruptive new technology. Kenneth Abbott and Duncan Snidal have argued that in situations of uncertainty, soft law instruments are often superior choices to traditional hard law instruments such as treaties. Hard law is difficult to change once it is established: at the national level, governments must go through long processes to change or update domestic laws, and at the international level, difficulties reaching agreements are even more pronounced as diverse actors bargain to reach some form of consensus. Soft law, in contrast, facilitates learning about the implications of particular kinds of rules and governance arrangements over time, making it easier for countries to come to an agreement typically with lower sovereignty costs than the negotiation (and renegotiation) of hard law. A great deal of soft law is developed and implemented by transnational networks of legal and regulatory experts that perform “the hard work of international law.”¹⁸ This pattern of gradual norm-building via soft law instruments and transnational legal-regulatory networks is likely to hold with respect to the governance of attributing cyber attacks. Just as attempts to develop rules around the use of nuclear weapons was not a static process and required an extended period of learning, attempts to govern the cyber realm are likely to develop via various forms of soft law prior to hard, institutionalized and multilateral treaties. Joseph Nye draws this parallel and states that: “Governments learn slowly from knowledge, study and experience, and learning occurs internationally when new knowledge gradually redefines the content of national interests and leads to new policies. For example, the United ¹⁸ On transnational regulatory networks, see Verdier (2009 113-172). The phrase “the hard work of international law” is taken from Brunnée and Toope (2010).\nMutual Security in the Asia-Pacific: Roles for Australia, Canada and South Korea States and the Soviet Union took decades to learn how to adapt and respond to the prior revolution in military affairs — nuclear technology after 1945\". There are reasons to expect that such learning and norm development will be even more difficult in the cyber case than it was in the nuclear era; for example, barriers to entry are far lower in the cyber case, and these capabilities have already proliferated far beyond the very small group of exclusively state actors that possess nuclear weapons. Creating shared knowledge among a much larger, and much more organizationally heterogeneous, number of players is likely to be extremely difficult.\nNotwithstanding these difficulties, a conscious effort to build and clarify norms for state behaviour in cyberspace is already underway. The United Nations Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) recently concluded that the current law of armed conflict applies online and that response to cyber attacks should be conducted within the framework of customary international law. The assessment of the GGE represents a start for international rule-making on cyber attacks rather than a conclusion, as agreeing on specific interpretations for applying general international legal rules to particular cases will require a great deal of work. However, it suggests that cyber attacks should be conducted only in self-defence or in accordance with authorization of collective action under the UN Charter. It further suggests that cyber attacks must distinguish between military and civilian targets and must accord with rules of proportionality. Finally, it suggests the importance of treating response to cyber attacks under the legal framework of state responsibility. Doing so establishes limits on justifiable self-help measures that states may take in response to an attributed cyber attack. Encouraging adherence to these limits can minimize the escalatory potential for cyber attacks.\nFurther developing the international legal and political frameworks governing response to cyber attacks will require sustained engagement with additional legal questions, prominent among which are questions of attribution. Indeed, determining whether a particular attack is attributable to a specific state (or states) is in many ways a logically prior question to assessing whether the attack was legally justifiable under international law and, if not, what countermeasures may be taken by which parties. The Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare provides a crucial legal resource for addressing these matters (see Schmitt 2013, 29-41). However, as we have argued, these are no more purely legal questions than they are purely technical ones.\nEnsuring the success of international efforts to build responsible norms for state conduct in cyberspace will require patient, careful work over a long period of time. Canada, Korea and Australia have the required resources (including positive Rule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks 141 international reputations) to play leading roles in this work both at the regional and global levels. As digitally connected economies, they also have clear interests in a positive outcome. In the nuclear era, such learning processes involved the creation of forums and study groups bringing together policy makers, military leaders and academics. Much of this activity took place at the national level, and it is likely that governments will engage on similar crash-course-learning programs as cyber issues become more prominent in contemporary international politics. However, given the greater reach and density of transnational networks among policy makers, there may be scope for international analogues to these processes. Transnational learning processes may (at least initially) take place at less official levels and involve more prominent roles for academics and other non-state actors, but may nevertheless play an important role in encouraging the improvement and dissemination of best practices for attributing cyber attacks and for ensuring responsible state conduct in cyberspace more generally. Providing resources to facilitate such processes is an inexpensive proposition with potentially large benefits and could be a priority for cooperation in both the short and long term."

In the North, the affected websites included those of the main Communist Party newspaper and the official Korean Central News Agency. In the South, the website for the presidential office and another government agency were rendered temporarily inaccessible. Given the tenor of political relations on the Korean peninsula, speculation centred on the possibility of involvement by state actors or their proxies. However, determining who was responsible for these cyber intrusions was complicated by several facts. First, a number of individuals purporting to belong to the \"hacktivist\" network Anonymous had indicated on Twitter that they would undertake offensive cyber operations against the North on the war's anniversary. Second, Twitter users also \"claimed responsibility for the attacks in South Korea, saying they demanded that the South's government stop censoring Internet content\" (ibid.). Given the relative ease of compromising authentication for social media accounts and the difficulty of independently establishing the source of origin for data transmitted over the Internet, it is difficult to regard such claims of responsibility as dispositive.\n1. For more on the difficulties of attributing cyber attacks and on cyber strategy in general, see Nye (2011, 18-38).\n\nProblems in attributing the cyber attacks related to the anniversary of the Korean War expose a deeper, and more nuanced problem. The challenge is that attributing cyber intrusions back to a government sponsor is not simply a factual or technical challenge. Rather, it is a multifaceted problem that has technical, legal and political dimensions, all of which must be satisfied for the attribution of a cyber attack to a particular state to be appropriate. The additional complexity here, as with most things cyber, is that the rules governing conduct in each of these categories are still evolving. However, the complexity of the task should not mask its importance. The increasing importance of the Internet to daily life can be expected over time to amplify the stakes involved in large-scale, persistent disruptions of access. Further, technology already allows the creation of kinetic effects by means of malicious code; such capabilities are highly likely to become more widely available in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, there is real potential for escalation from cyber attacks to more traditional forms of violent conflict. New rules, norms and institutional structures are needed that can ameliorate the possibility of misattribution and the attendant consequences that would flow from it, and that can act as circuit-breakers inhibiting escalatory spirals even where attribution is properly made.\nIn order to advance this broad claim, the paper will proceed in the following fashion. The first section will highlight the technical aspects of attributing a cyber intrusion to a particular actor or set of actors. The second section will discuss the legal rules governing state responsibility and the attribution of acts to state actors. The third section will discuss the international political dimensions involved in determining whether or not to publicly attribute a particular cyber act to a given state. Finally, the paper concludes by arguing clearer rules are needed to avert the possible negative consequences of misattribution and that an impartial international institutional cooperative mechanism is needed to facilitate the development of a meaningful rule-based framework for state conduct related to attribution for cyber attacks. As constructive powers, Canada, Australia and Korea are well positioned to play a leading role in the development of global norms for both the procedures and consequences of publicly attributing cyber attacks by enhancing capacity to respond to cyber attacks through the augmentation of Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) and by crafting norms of restraint that demonstrate the political, economic and cultural consequences of both hasty and non-attribution.\nRule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks 127\n# The Technical Dimension of Attribution\nTechnical attribution of cyber attacks is primarily a matter of employing computer forensics to determine the physical point(s) of origin for a particular computer network operation and to locate circumstantial evidence embedded in malicious code that provides information about the likely identity of its author(s), such as languages employed or particular cultural points of reference. For a small number of governments, these means can be augmented with additional intelligence sources and methods.\nThe expertise necessary for such attribution efforts is, again with the exception of a growing number of wealthy governments, in the hands of private companies. Large computer network operators, technology companies and computer security firms possess increasingly sophisticated technical means to attribute cyber attacks.2 The emergence of private actors with intelligence capabilities that to some extent rival and exceed those of states is a new development; while non-state actors are not new in international relations, it is novel for such actors to enjoy resource and expertise advantages in a core area of state policy intimately connected to the state's monopoly on the use of legitimate violence. The involvement of corporate actors in the attribution of cyber attacks is also likely to prove controversial. Specifically, it is not clear whether states will generally accept the judgment of such companies — in particular when the company is headquartered in the same state making the public attribution of the attack.\nLeaving problems of credibility aside, there are also clear limits to technical attribution, in particular when principals employ arms-length agents (potentially located in other states) and/or transnational botnets in the conduct of cyber attacks. Given the utility of such gambits in frustrating attempts at attribution and the low cost of employing them, these practices are likely to spread. Even when location of origin can be conclusively identified, this is not necessarily a dispositive indication of responsibility either under narrow legal standards or more expansive political ones.\n# The International Legal Dimension of Attribution\nAssuming that cyber attacks constitute internationally wrongful acts, and assuming that the technical/factual indications provide sufficient evidence that the attack in question has a state connection, then invariably the relevant\n\nMutual Security in the Asia-Pacific: Roles for Australia, Canada and South Korea\ninternational legal rules to apply will be the ones governing state responsibility. In short, state responsibility is a fundamental rule governing international relations which holds that if a state commits an internationally wrongful act that is attributable to the state, and the act constitutes a breach of an international obligation, then that state will owe a duty to make reparations for the breach. The relevant question then becomes: what activities are attributable to a state? Unfortunately, the answer is not entirely clear.\nLegal attribution is straightforward when the act in question is committed by an organ of the state. In these cases, the law will presume that the act committed by the organ is the act of the state itself. Suppose for example that a cyber attack was directed by a division of the military or the state intelligence services; this would \"according to a well-established rule of international law [...] be regarded as an act of that state.\" Determining responsibility becomes more complex, however, when dealing with entities that are more loosely affiliated with the state. For example, non-state actors who launch cyber attacks or engage in hacktivist activities may have varying degrees of state connection. Some may act with no official connection to the state, such as the infamous hacktivist group Anonymous, which operates with neither \"the steady income nor the fiscal sponsorship\" to support its activities and which often adopts an antagonistic tone toward state authority (Coleman 2014, 70). Other cyber attacks by non-state actors, in contrast, might be tolerated or even sponsored by the state to act in their interests. Analysts believe this was the case in 2007, when Russian hackers were sponsored by the state to unleash a massive cyber attack against the Estonian government and financial institutions over the relocation of a statue in the Estonian capital (Traynor 2007). Similarly, a group of hackers calling itself the Syrian Electronic Army claims to act on behalf of the Assad government (Boothby et al., 2012).\nComplexity in attributing cyber attacks is also a function of competing and inconsistent legal rules. The Draft Articles of the International Law Commission, which potentially reflect customary law, state that the conduct of an entity will be considered an act of a State under international law if that entity \"is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control\n\nRule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks 129\nof, that State in carrying out the conduct.” Thus, under this standard if a state directed a citizen hacker team to carry out a cyber attack, then those acts would be legally attributable back to that state. However, two international courts have weighed in on what the applicable standard should be when considering the attribution of certain acts to states, and in so doing, they have muddied the analytical waters.\nIn the *Nicaragua* case, the International Court of Justice was asked to decide whether the acts of the Contras — a rebel group engaged in a conflict with the Nicaraguan government — were attributable to the Government of the United States. In determining whether the relationship between the two was sufficiently close to allow for attribution, the Court held that “to be legally responsible, it would have to be proved that that State had *effective control* of the operations in the course of which the alleged violations were committed.” Thus, in order to be found responsible for particular cyber intrusions, under the *Nicaragua* standard it must be shown that the state in question had direct control over that very intrusion. In other words, “general overall control would have been insufficient to ground responsibility.” Rather, according to the jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice a more exacting standard applies.\nHowever, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia sees the status of international law on this issue quite differently. In the *Tadić* case, the Tribunal found that a demonstration of *overall control* could be sufficient for a finding of state responsibility. In this way, the Tribunal incorporated a less stringent test under the rules of international law, noting, “the degree of control might vary according to the circumstances and a high threshold might not always be required.” As a consequence, the international community is left with a somewhat fragmented set of legal rules to apply to cyber attacks, when trying to attribute those acts back to state actors. Does one need to show that the cyber attacker was acting on the instructions of the state or that the state had effective control of the impugned operation? Or, is it appropriate to apply some lower threshold for the attribution of acts in cyber space? Should states, for example, be required to take reasonable steps to prevent attacks that originate from their\n\nMutual Security in the Asia-Pacific: Roles for Australia, Canada and South Korea\nterritory? And if they fail to do so, should that provide a sufficient basis for a finding of responsibility? Or, should there be a more exacting standard in which states are called to account only when there is dispositive proof that an organ of the state committed or directed the attack?\nUltimately, the applicable rules remain somewhat unclear. However, what is clear is that the increasing centrality of cyber operations in the conduct of international relations is going put pressure on the existing set of rules and those rules will — no doubt — evolve in relation to that pressure. Thus, what is required at this point is some forward looking policy making aimed at developing a set of rules that accounts not only for where the subject technology is now, but where it is going to be in the future.\n## Political Dimensions of Attribution\nTechnical and legal aspects of attributing cyber attacks are, respectively, questions of evidentiary sufficiency — whether it is possible to determine the source of the attack to a degree of confidence that can withstand appropriate scrutiny — and appropriate procedure. These dimensions of attribution intersect in a complex fashion with a third, political, dimension. The key characteristic of the political dimension of attribution is publicity; a politically attributed attack, for the purposes of this paper, entails a public accusation. One example of such an attribution is the American indictment of five members of the Chinese Peoples' Liberation Army on charges of stealing intellectual property from several American firms (Schmidt and Sanger 2014).\nThis political dimension of attribution engages calculations of interest both by state and (increasingly) non-state actors, as well as less understood dynamics of choice driven by emotion and by justice motives (see Welch 1993; Raymond and Welch 2013). As a result of these considerations, it is possible that attacks which can be reliably attributed from technical and legal perspectives will not be publicly (politically) attributed (i.e. dogs that don't bark). It is also possible that political pressures may lead to the public attribution of cyber attacks even when relevant technical and legal criteria are not clearly satisfied (i.e. potentially false positives). Both of these outcomes can create problematic impacts on international security.\nThe primary risk associated with false positives is the creation of escalatory spirals. Accusations, in particular when not accompanied by convincing technical data and when not made according to proper legal procedure, can damage diplomatic relations. The offense-dominant nature of the cyber domain (at least given the current state of technology) suggests strong potential for\nRule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks 131\nescalation in the event of a cyber attack; the perceived necessity of immediate reprisal also creates pressures militating toward hasty attribution (Nye 2011). If the attribution is accompanied by self-help measures, the risk of tit-for-tat escalation and the emergence of a crisis atmosphere are increased. In crises, domestic audience costs have a critical effect on the willingness of parties to back down (Fearon 1994). Ironically, the Internet's expansion of low-cost communication and its increasing integration with critical infrastructure and other essential aspects of everyday life may act to increase the size of the domestic audience and the stakes of significant cyber attack disruptions in the eyes of that audience, thus ratcheting up the audience costs associated with conceding in a dispute concerning a publicly attributed cyber attack and making such crises especially prone to escalatory spirals. Societies with a high degree of Internet penetration may be most prone to escalate in the aftermath of a publicly attributed cyber attack. As global rates of Internet penetration increase, there is thus also a greater risk of conflict spirals.\nTwo caveats are in order. First, our argument does not rest in a strong sense on the past track record of offense-defense theory in explaining cases to which it has been applied. This is primarily because our argument is forward-looking; we are seeking to identify and anticipate potential problems in what is still a relatively new area of international politics. Second, and related, we want to be clear that we are advancing an explicitly probabilistic argument. We do not claim that all crises will escalate. Rather, we claim that false positives in cyber attribution make escalation more likely. This is the case because false accusations are likely to aggrieve falsely-accused parties, who will perceive the attack as unjust and thus be likely to respond in kind (Welch 1993). It is also the case, as we have already argued, because of the domestic political difficulties leaders face in backing down once public accusations have been made. Other factors certainly also affect the propensity of particular crises to escalate; one of the most significant is the presence or absence of a past history of animosity between the parties.11 Nevertheless, our analytical focus here is on the dangers associated with factors related to patterns of cyber-attribution.\nWe have focused thus far on the dangers inherent both in the employment of cyber attacks (and conduct that may be mistaken for a cyber attack, such as some cybercrime and cyber espionage activities) and in the hasty attribution of cyber attacks. Less obviously, there is also a significant danger in widespread failure to attribute cyber attacks when technical and legal criteria have been satisfied. If cyber attacks are not criticized and no efforts are made to hold bad actors accountable, the establishment of permissive norms (and even\n\nMutual Security in the Asia-Pacific: Roles for Australia, Canada and South Korea\npermissive customary international law) is likely. Given the escalatory potential of cyber attacks, the prevalence of permissive norms could pose a significant international security risk. This risk entails, at maximum, the employment of cyber attacks to create kinetic damage and widespread disruption to critical infrastructure, as well as the potential escalation to more traditional interstate military conflict. While such outcomes are unlikely, they carry high costs. More modestly, permissive norms could lead to higher incidence of increasingly sophisticated cyber attacks resulting in degradation of Internet services and a loss of trust in the Internet as a means of commerce, communication and delivery of government services. Even this more optimistic scenario involves significant economic opportunity costs. The key point is that, due to its ability to forestall the development of permissive norms, criticism of socially undesirable behaviour is important in itself, (at least partially) independent of the ability to effectively enforce international rules (see Johnston 2001).\n# Rule Making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks\nGiven that both attribution and non-attribution of cyber attacks create significant international security risks, what is the appropriate policy response when cyber attacks occur? We argue that thoughtful international efforts at rulemaking to govern state conduct in the attribution of cyber attacks have the potential to steer a middle course, mitigating the risks associated with both widespread non-attribution and with hasty attribution. Such rules must govern when and how states publicly attribute cyber attacks and the consequences of attribution. Furthermore, these rules need to accomplish two parallel tasks: minimizing the need for attribution; but also enhancing capacity to respond when necessary. While the ex-ante specification of such rules is impossible due to the unpredictable nature of international negotiations, it is possible to sketch out some general design features of promising rule sets. The final section of this chapter briefly elaborates these features and addresses additional policy options for cooperation pertaining to the attribution of cyber attacks. In keeping with the goals of this volume, these policy options are presented in terms of opportunities for Canada, Korea and Australia; however, at least in this case, we believe that the options we present would travel relatively well and could in principle be adopted by other constructive powers either at the global level or in other regions.\nWith respect to the procedural mechanics of attribution, several desirable design features can be identified. First, attribution should be done on the basis of technical best practices for determining the point of origin for Internet traffic. Second, state and non-state actors seeking to attribute cyber attacks\nRule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks 133\nshould bear in mind the ease of concealment either by technical means or by the employment of arms-length proxy agents. Accordingly, attribution should be made only after attempts to engage appropriate authorities in the apparent country of origin. Where such authorities react cooperatively and in good faith, this should be prominently noted when attribution is made. Ideally, in such situations, joint statements of attribution could be made.\nThe creation and application of attribution standards and practices will require responsible global leadership. Political scientists and international relations scholars suggest that global norms are actively built by agents who have strong notions about appropriate or desirable behaviour in their community (Finnemore and Sikkink 1998). Canada, Australia and Korea are well positioned to act cooperatively as global leaders developing norms for both the procedures and consequences of publicly attributing cyber attacks for the following reasons. All three countries can find common ground for the development of these norms through their shared dialogue on the importance of international trade for economic growth and domestic economic policies that reflect these views. Cyber attacks can have large impacts on a country's ability to fairly and effectively compete in global markets (for example, see Manyika et al. 2014; Centre for Strategic and International Studies 2013). Non-attribution of these kinds of cyber attacks could further encourage this behaviour, as states or other actors would face no consequences for their bad practices. However, hasty or aggressive public attribution could also affect a country's ability to gain from trade by affecting its ability to bargain in future trade negotiations. Accusations that are not supported by convincing technical data and not made according to proper legal procedure can damage diplomatic relations. Thus, states risk negative diplomatic consequences and losing gains from trade when both hasty public attribution and non-attribution are made. As advanced industrial democracies with digitally connected economies, Australia, Canada and Korea have particular interests in the health of the digital economy. They also share a basic commitment to the maintenance of a rules-based international order.\nIn deciding when and how to attribute cyber attacks, norms-guiding states, firms and other actors are of little use if the underlying technical and legal capacities for attribution remain weak. There is certainly much to be done in this area. However, there are good reasons to conclude that Canada, Australia and Korea can take the lead on enhancing the capacity to accurately attribute cyber attacks. All three countries possess digitally connected economies with significant pools of relevant human capital. Such steps complement and coincide with measures that can augment capacities to defend against (and repair damage resulting from) cyber attacks. We focus here on what we believe\nMutual Security in the Asia-Pacific: Roles for Australia, Canada and South Korea\nto be one of the most promising avenues for cooperation on capacity building: strengthening CERTs.\nCERTs are independent networks of technical experts chartered to work with the Internet community in preventing, detecting and resolving computer security incidents. Currently, there are over 250 independent CERTs registered with the Forum for Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST) — an international network of CERTs that are committed to information exchange and cooperation on issues of mutual interest. Generally, the teams share a common organizational structure centred on facilitating communication among experts; acting as a point of contact for emergencies; maintaining research ties to improve security; and initiating proactive measures to increase awareness and understanding of computer security among a variety of stakeholders. However, the particular role of any given CERT is largely self-defined. For example, individual CERTs differ in their areas of focus (academic, private, national, regional or global), expertise (phishing, viruses, information security) and ability to effectively perform their mandates due to varying levels of funding and or technical expertise (Choucri, Madnick and Ferwerda 2013). To help gauge the diversity in CERTs operating around the world, Figure 1 (CERT Composition by Region) highlights the variety of CERTs operating under the authority of academic, technical, private and government institutions.\nThere are a number of interesting insights that can be drawn from this figure. First, when comparing the total number of CERTs to the number of users within a given region, Europe, North America and Oceania have more CERTs available to users within the region. Africa, Asia, Latin America and to an extent Russia, all have similarly low levels of CERTs operating within the region compared to the number of users online. This shows that CERT creation and operation within particular regions is a non-linear function of income and that other factors, such as state function or institutions, play an important role. Secondly, the regional variance of the types of CERTs is interesting. Regions with a highly developed technical industry, such as Europe, the United States and Asia, generally have higher levels of private CERTs, whereas regions that have a limited technical industry tend to have less private CERTs and more government operated CERTs.\n CERTs are also interchangeably referred to as Computer Incident Response Teams and Computer Security Incident Response Teams.\n A full list of CERTS registered with FIRST can be found at www.first.org/members/teams\n For more information on the overarching vision of CERTS, see the CERT Coordination Centre, www.cert.org\n This data was compiled from CERTs registered as members of FIRST.\nRule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks\nFigure 1: CERT Composition by Region\nSource: Data collected by Authors from the CERTs registered as members of FIRST.\nCERTs are established in an ad hoc manner and are often self-governed. Anyone can create a CERT, but to become a member of the global forum FIRST, CERTs must fill out a document called Request for Comment 2350, which outlines information such as the services a CERT will offer, who its constituents are and under what authority it operates. Private and academic CERTs often operate under the authority of its institution, such as business or university codes of conduct. In addition, CERTs must also adhere to national laws applicable in the jurisdictions where they operate. It is important to note that legal regimes can affect a CERTs ability to respond and resolve to particular cyber security incident. In Turkey, for example, which prohibits sending banking related information outside of its geographic boundaries, a CERT must operate within the constraints of its own technical knowledge and resources, leaving them unable to share information with third parties outside of the country's borders. As a result, Turkey's financial sector often receives a poor level of service (Best Practice Forum 2014).\nGiven that CERTs currently have varying degrees of ability, the three countries can support and facilitate shared learning and capacity building among CERTs in several ways. One possibility would involve a joint commitment to hosting and sponsoring FIRST annual conferences on a rotating basis, or to supporting FIRST global initiatives such as special interest groups and \"birds of a feather\"\nMutual Security in the Asia-Pacific: Roles for Australia, Canada and South Korea\nforums that exist to provide a forum where members can discuss topics of common interest to the community. This would improve CERT effectiveness and provide the CERT community with facilities that would create an environment for shared learning and cooperation. Given the importance of maintaining effective government computer networks to deliver key public goods, there is also a clear rationale for the provision of funding and technical assistance for these purposes to low-income countries. Such public goods include domestic services, but also encompass international goods such as effective law enforcement cooperation. There is also a case for project-based funding for CERTs in the non-profit sector and perhaps even in private industry. This funding could be provided on an opt-in basis as grant programs, allowing consideration to be given both to the quality of the applicant and its level of financial need. Such grant programs could start as small-scale pilots and could expand to involve public-private partnerships. Augmenting the number and capabilities of CERTs can improve the accuracy of attempts to attribute cyber attacks as well as the potential to quickly and effectively repair any resulting damage. Such capabilities would make hasty and inaccurate attributions less likely by providing more timely and more accurate information about the technical nature of cyber attacks, and would also reduce pressures to attribute cyber attacks by mitigating the costs they entail for victims (and thus the desire to retaliate).\nThere are also potential gains from enhanced coordination. CERTs have been created by a wide variety of actors (both public and private) and with different geographic scopes (domestic, regional, global). Many national CERTs coordinate with other CERTs in their respective regions. Regional CERTs could institutionalize the working relations of national and private sector teams. This could improve CERT-to-CERT cooperation, and as CERTs cooperate and build capacity within the region, the development of a coherent rule set for technical attribution beyond one nation's borders could be encouraged over time. In addition, the institutionalized working relationship between regional public and private CERTs could encourage cooperation across legal jurisdictions and state borders. This network could improve information sharing across a variety of regions and improve the digital forensic capabilities of governments and law enforcement agencies so that credible attribution can be made within a region.\nThe Asia Pacific Computer Emergency Response Team (APCERT) could play a leading role in helping CERTs in the Asia-Pacific cooperate and develop rules of best practice for attribution across the region. APCERT has 25 operational teams from 19 different states, including (but not limited to) Australia, India, China, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, New Zealand and Thailand.[16] APCERT already\n\nRule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks 137\nplays an important role by creating and maintaining a mutually trusting network of computer security experts in the Asia-Pacific, which improves regional awareness of and competency in responding to computer incidents. However, only 19 regional countries are currently represented. APCERT’s membership could be expanded to include other Asia-Pacific economies, including Canada.\nGlobally, there is an opportunity for CERTs to contribute to rules of best practice for technical attribution. The Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST) is a global organization coordinating CERT responses to computer incidents. One such opportunity is the creation of ongoing dialogue around best practices, supported (financially and diplomatically) by engaged states such as Korea, Australia and Canada. Such efforts are distinct from general augmentation of CERT capacities in that they would focus specifically on engaging the CERT community in contributing to broader attempts to think creatively about best practices for attribution. States could also make especially valuable contributions to these efforts by arranging the participation of experts in the legal and political dimensions of attribution. While broadening dialogue can create problems arising from divergent preferences and from difficulties in coordinating large numbers of players, bringing together these distinct voices can ensure that attribution of cyber attacks is approached in a holistic fashion that includes actors with requisite legal and political expertise.\nCERT coordination could also be improved through policies and practices that promote the interoperability of laws around information sharing. Given that the disharmonization of national laws could limit or prevent CERTs from effectively resolving computer security incidents, when creating or updating national legislation policy makers should consider the effect a law can have on a CERT’s ability to cooperate internationally. It is important that policy makers consider legal interoperability as a matter of degree that can be achieved through a variety of means, such as harmonization, standardization, mutual recognition, reciprocity and cooperation (Weber 2014). CERTs and policymakers should work together and create a shared dialogue that explores ways in which national laws can be implemented and utilized to further encourage CERT-CERT cooperation across national borders.\nGiven their technical expertise, it might seem like a natural fit to give regional and global CERTs official roles in investigating and making attributions for particular cyber attacks. While we do not rule out the viability of this option at least in some situations, we emphasize that there are reasons to be cautious in adopting such policies in the short-term. Directly involving CERTs in making attributions of cyber attacks risks politicizing their work and undermining the willingness of states and other actors to work with CERTs, especially at the\nMutual Security in the Asia-Pacific: Roles for Australia, Canada and South Korea\nregional and global levels. This could have the perverse effect of reducing rather than increasing the quality of information available, as well as the additional perverse effect of inhibiting efforts to quickly and effectively mitigate the effect of cyber attacks. It might be more palatable instead to establish the expectation that states and other actors seek the input of relevant CERTs prior to making public attributions of cyber attacks. The role of CERTs in this respect would be restricted to the provision of publicly available information that could be verified by interested parties, and that therefore should be less susceptible to politicization. To further reduce this risk, it might also be desirable to establish the expectation that public attributions be made on the basis of concurring analysis from multiple CERTs, at least some of which do not have a real or apparent conflict of interest. While it may not be possible to eliminate incidents of political leaders shopping among CERTs for favourable analysis, establishing norms that expect multiple concurring analyses and that expect the underlying technical data to be made publicly available can increase the legitimacy costs associated with such behaviour.\nWhile there is a need for rule making both about the procedures and consequences of public attribution and for various kinds of capacity-building and coordination measures, there is also a need for a commitment to restraint when publicly attributing cyber attacks. The widespread consistent exercise of such restraint in the face of what are likely to be increasingly common and perhaps increasingly disruptive incidents will take political will and statesmanship. This is the final way in which we conclude that Canada, Korea and Australia can show leadership. They can do so with the goal of forging a shared vision of the need for restraint in attribution in light of recent events and emerging trends. Such a vision must be predicated on relevant norms from other areas of international law and the broader regime complex for cyber governance (Nye 2014). A constructive discussion of the issues should begin with a shared understanding of what we have identified as the central dilemma in attributing cyber attacks: that careless attribution can be counter-productive and destabilizing, damaging important political, cultural and economic relationships; and that, on the other hand, lack of attribution can create a permissive environment in which cyber attacks are seen as low-cost and perhaps even as acceptable behaviour.\nNorms on cyber security and conflict are a global matter. However, given that cyber security issues are relatively new, multilateral institutions and other forms of international cooperation within this policy domain have not yet matured. The literature on constructive powers can be used to explain and describe\n Such real or apparent conflicts of interest could arise from a CERT based in a state making the public attribution or having a financial relationship with the entity (state or otherwise) making the attribution.\nRule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks 139\nhow countries develop norms in these nascent policy spaces (Hampson and Heinbecker 2011). Constructive powers can act as norm entrepreneurs in the development of global norms on cyber attacks and attribution. As Simon Palamar discusses in his contribution to this volume, one characteristic of constructive powers is their ability to shape the world in ways that explicitly take the preferences and interests of others into account. The development of norms on public attribution aligns with the preferences of other states given the political, economic and social consequences of both hasty and non-attribution. As constructive powers, Canada, Australia and Korea are well positioned to begin a productive dialogue — both domestically and in concert with each other — and to frame this critical conversation from its earliest stages, creating conditions for ongoing conversation and institutional learning.\nSuch norm-building processes are typically slow and non-linear in nature. This is especially true under conditions of uncertainty, for example the uncertainty associated with assessing the political and strategic implications of a disruptive new technology. Kenneth Abbott and Duncan Snidal have argued that in situations of uncertainty, soft law instruments are often superior choices to traditional hard law instruments such as treaties (Abbott and Snidal 2000). Hard law is difficult to change once it is established: at the national level, governments must go through long processes to change or update domestic laws, and at the international level, difficulties reaching agreements are even more pronounced as diverse actors bargain to reach some form of consensus. Soft law, in contrast, facilitates learning about the implications of particular kinds of rules and governance arrangements over time, making it easier for countries to come to an agreement typically with lower sovereignty costs than the negotiation (and renegotiation) of hard law. A great deal of soft law is developed and implemented by transnational networks of legal and regulatory experts that perform “the hard work of international law.”\nThis pattern of gradual norm-building via soft law instruments and transnational legal-regulatory networks is likely to hold with respect to the governance of attributing cyber attacks. Just as attempts to develop rules around the use of nuclear weapons was not a static process and required an extended period of learning (Freedman 1981; Tannenwald 2007), attempts to govern the cyber realm are likely to develop via various forms of soft law prior to hard, institutionalized and multilateral treaties. Joseph Nye draws this parallel and states that: “Governments learn slowly from knowledge, study and experience, and learning occurs internationally when new knowledge gradually redefines the content of national interests and leads to new policies. For example, the United\n On transnational regulatory networks, see Verdier (2009 113-172). The phrase “the hard work of international law” is taken from Brunnée and Toope (2010).\nMutual Security in the Asia-Pacific: Roles for Australia, Canada and South Korea\nStates and the Soviet Union took decades to learn how to adapt and respond to the prior revolution in military affairs — nuclear technology after 1945\" (Nye 2011, 19). There are reasons to expect that such learning and norm development will be even more difficult in the cyber case than it was in the nuclear era; for example, barriers to entry are far lower in the cyber case, and these capabilities have already proliferated far beyond the very small group of exclusively state actors that possess nuclear weapons. Creating shared knowledge among a much larger, and much more organizationally heterogeneous, number of players is likely to be extremely difficult.\nNotwithstanding these difficulties, a conscious effort to build and clarify norms for state behaviour in cyberspace is already underway. The United Nations Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) recently concluded that the current law of armed conflict applies online and that response to cyber attacks should be conducted within the framework of customary international law. The assessment of the GGE represents a start for international rule-making on cyber attacks rather than a conclusion, as agreeing on specific interpretations for applying general international legal rules to particular cases will require a great deal of work. However, it suggests that cyber attacks should be conducted only in self-defence or in accordance with authorization of collective action under the UN Charter. It further suggests that cyber attacks must distinguish between military and civilian targets and must accord with rules of proportionality. Finally, it suggests the importance of treating response to cyber attacks under the legal framework of state responsibility. Doing so establishes limits on justifiable self-help measures that states may take in response to an attributed cyber attack. Encouraging adherence to these limits can minimize the escalatory potential for cyber attacks.\nFurther developing the international legal and political frameworks governing response to cyber attacks will require sustained engagement with additional legal questions, prominent among which are questions of attribution. Indeed, determining whether a particular attack is attributable to a specific state (or states) is in many ways a logically prior question to assessing whether the attack was legally justifiable under international law and, if not, what countermeasures may be taken by which parties. The Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare provides a crucial legal resource for addressing these matters (see Schmitt 2013, 29-41). However, as we have argued, these are no more purely legal questions than they are purely technical ones.\nEnsuring the success of international efforts to build responsible norms for state conduct in cyberspace will require patient, careful work over a long period of time. Canada, Korea and Australia have the required resources (including positive\nRule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks 141\ninternational reputations) to play leading roles in this work both at the regional and global levels. As digitally connected economies, they also have clear interests in a positive outcome. In the nuclear era, such learning processes involved the creation of forums and study groups bringing together policy makers, military leaders and academics. Much of this activity took place at the national level, and it is likely that governments will engage on similar crash-course-learning programs as cyber issues become more prominent in contemporary international politics. However, given the greater reach and density of transnational networks among policy makers, there may be scope for international analogues to these processes. Transnational learning processes may (at least initially) take place at less official levels and involve more prominent roles for academics and other non-state actors, but may nevertheless play an important role in encouraging the improvement and dissemination of best practices for attributing cyber attacks and for ensuring responsible state conduct in cyberspace more generally. Providing resources to facilitate such processes is an inexpensive proposition with potentially large benefits and could be a priority for cooperation in both the short and long term.",

In the North, the affected websites included those of the main Communist Party newspaper and the official Korean Central News Agency. In the South, the website for the presidential office and another government agency were rendered temporarily inaccessible. Given the tenor of political relations on the Korean peninsula, speculation centred on the possibility of involvement by state actors or their proxies. However, determining who was responsible for these cyber intrusions was complicated by several facts. First, a number of individuals purporting to belong to the \"hacktivist\" network Anonymous had indicated on Twitter that they would undertake offensive cyber operations against the North on the war's anniversary. Second, Twitter users also \"claimed responsibility for the attacks in South Korea, saying they demanded that the South's government stop censoring Internet content\" (ibid.). Given the relative ease of compromising authentication for social media accounts and the difficulty of independently establishing the source of origin for data transmitted over the Internet, it is difficult to regard such claims of responsibility as dispositive.\n1. For more on the difficulties of attributing cyber attacks and on cyber strategy in general, see Nye (2011, 18-38).\n\nProblems in attributing the cyber attacks related to the anniversary of the Korean War expose a deeper, and more nuanced problem. The challenge is that attributing cyber intrusions back to a government sponsor is not simply a factual or technical challenge. Rather, it is a multifaceted problem that has technical, legal and political dimensions, all of which must be satisfied for the attribution of a cyber attack to a particular state to be appropriate. The additional complexity here, as with most things cyber, is that the rules governing conduct in each of these categories are still evolving. However, the complexity of the task should not mask its importance. The increasing importance of the Internet to daily life can be expected over time to amplify the stakes involved in large-scale, persistent disruptions of access. Further, technology already allows the creation of kinetic effects by means of malicious code; such capabilities are highly likely to become more widely available in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, there is real potential for escalation from cyber attacks to more traditional forms of violent conflict. New rules, norms and institutional structures are needed that can ameliorate the possibility of misattribution and the attendant consequences that would flow from it, and that can act as circuit-breakers inhibiting escalatory spirals even where attribution is properly made.\nIn order to advance this broad claim, the paper will proceed in the following fashion. The first section will highlight the technical aspects of attributing a cyber intrusion to a particular actor or set of actors. The second section will discuss the legal rules governing state responsibility and the attribution of acts to state actors. The third section will discuss the international political dimensions involved in determining whether or not to publicly attribute a particular cyber act to a given state. Finally, the paper concludes by arguing clearer rules are needed to avert the possible negative consequences of misattribution and that an impartial international institutional cooperative mechanism is needed to facilitate the development of a meaningful rule-based framework for state conduct related to attribution for cyber attacks. As constructive powers, Canada, Australia and Korea are well positioned to play a leading role in the development of global norms for both the procedures and consequences of publicly attributing cyber attacks by enhancing capacity to respond to cyber attacks through the augmentation of Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) and by crafting norms of restraint that demonstrate the political, economic and cultural consequences of both hasty and non-attribution.\nRule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks 127\n# The Technical Dimension of Attribution\nTechnical attribution of cyber attacks is primarily a matter of employing computer forensics to determine the physical point(s) of origin for a particular computer network operation and to locate circumstantial evidence embedded in malicious code that provides information about the likely identity of its author(s), such as languages employed or particular cultural points of reference. For a small number of governments, these means can be augmented with additional intelligence sources and methods.\nThe expertise necessary for such attribution efforts is, again with the exception of a growing number of wealthy governments, in the hands of private companies. Large computer network operators, technology companies and computer security firms possess increasingly sophisticated technical means to attribute cyber attacks.2 The emergence of private actors with intelligence capabilities that to some extent rival and exceed those of states is a new development; while non-state actors are not new in international relations, it is novel for such actors to enjoy resource and expertise advantages in a core area of state policy intimately connected to the state's monopoly on the use of legitimate violence. The involvement of corporate actors in the attribution of cyber attacks is also likely to prove controversial. Specifically, it is not clear whether states will generally accept the judgment of such companies — in particular when the company is headquartered in the same state making the public attribution of the attack.\nLeaving problems of credibility aside, there are also clear limits to technical attribution, in particular when principals employ arms-length agents (potentially located in other states) and/or transnational botnets in the conduct of cyber attacks. Given the utility of such gambits in frustrating attempts at attribution and the low cost of employing them, these practices are likely to spread. Even when location of origin can be conclusively identified, this is not necessarily a dispositive indication of responsibility either under narrow legal standards or more expansive political ones.\n# The International Legal Dimension of Attribution\nAssuming that cyber attacks constitute internationally wrongful acts, and assuming that the technical/factual indications provide sufficient evidence that the attack in question has a state connection, then invariably the relevant\n\nMutual Security in the Asia-Pacific: Roles for Australia, Canada and South Korea\ninternational legal rules to apply will be the ones governing state responsibility. In short, state responsibility is a fundamental rule governing international relations which holds that if a state commits an internationally wrongful act that is attributable to the state, and the act constitutes a breach of an international obligation, then that state will owe a duty to make reparations for the breach. The relevant question then becomes: what activities are attributable to a state? Unfortunately, the answer is not entirely clear.\nLegal attribution is straightforward when the act in question is committed by an organ of the state. In these cases, the law will presume that the act committed by the organ is the act of the state itself. Suppose for example that a cyber attack was directed by a division of the military or the state intelligence services; this would \"according to a well-established rule of international law [...] be regarded as an act of that state.\" Determining responsibility becomes more complex, however, when dealing with entities that are more loosely affiliated with the state. For example, non-state actors who launch cyber attacks or engage in hacktivist activities may have varying degrees of state connection. Some may act with no official connection to the state, such as the infamous hacktivist group Anonymous, which operates with neither \"the steady income nor the fiscal sponsorship\" to support its activities and which often adopts an antagonistic tone toward state authority (Coleman 2014, 70). Other cyber attacks by non-state actors, in contrast, might be tolerated or even sponsored by the state to act in their interests. Analysts believe this was the case in 2007, when Russian hackers were sponsored by the state to unleash a massive cyber attack against the Estonian government and financial institutions over the relocation of a statue in the Estonian capital (Traynor 2007). Similarly, a group of hackers calling itself the Syrian Electronic Army claims to act on behalf of the Assad government (Boothby et al., 2012).\nComplexity in attributing cyber attacks is also a function of competing and inconsistent legal rules. The Draft Articles of the International Law Commission, which potentially reflect customary law, state that the conduct of an entity will be considered an act of a State under international law if that entity \"is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control\n\nRule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks 129\nof, that State in carrying out the conduct.” Thus, under this standard if a state directed a citizen hacker team to carry out a cyber attack, then those acts would be legally attributable back to that state. However, two international courts have weighed in on what the applicable standard should be when considering the attribution of certain acts to states, and in so doing, they have muddied the analytical waters.\nIn the *Nicaragua* case, the International Court of Justice was asked to decide whether the acts of the Contras — a rebel group engaged in a conflict with the Nicaraguan government — were attributable to the Government of the United States. In determining whether the relationship between the two was sufficiently close to allow for attribution, the Court held that “to be legally responsible, it would have to be proved that that State had *effective control* of the operations in the course of which the alleged violations were committed.” Thus, in order to be found responsible for particular cyber intrusions, under the *Nicaragua* standard it must be shown that the state in question had direct control over that very intrusion. In other words, “general overall control would have been insufficient to ground responsibility.” Rather, according to the jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice a more exacting standard applies.\nHowever, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia sees the status of international law on this issue quite differently. In the *Tadić* case, the Tribunal found that a demonstration of *overall control* could be sufficient for a finding of state responsibility. In this way, the Tribunal incorporated a less stringent test under the rules of international law, noting, “the degree of control might vary according to the circumstances and a high threshold might not always be required.” As a consequence, the international community is left with a somewhat fragmented set of legal rules to apply to cyber attacks, when trying to attribute those acts back to state actors. Does one need to show that the cyber attacker was acting on the instructions of the state or that the state had effective control of the impugned operation? Or, is it appropriate to apply some lower threshold for the attribution of acts in cyber space? Should states, for example, be required to take reasonable steps to prevent attacks that originate from their\n\nMutual Security in the Asia-Pacific: Roles for Australia, Canada and South Korea\nterritory? And if they fail to do so, should that provide a sufficient basis for a finding of responsibility? Or, should there be a more exacting standard in which states are called to account only when there is dispositive proof that an organ of the state committed or directed the attack?\nUltimately, the applicable rules remain somewhat unclear. However, what is clear is that the increasing centrality of cyber operations in the conduct of international relations is going put pressure on the existing set of rules and those rules will — no doubt — evolve in relation to that pressure. Thus, what is required at this point is some forward looking policy making aimed at developing a set of rules that accounts not only for where the subject technology is now, but where it is going to be in the future.\n## Political Dimensions of Attribution\nTechnical and legal aspects of attributing cyber attacks are, respectively, questions of evidentiary sufficiency — whether it is possible to determine the source of the attack to a degree of confidence that can withstand appropriate scrutiny — and appropriate procedure. These dimensions of attribution intersect in a complex fashion with a third, political, dimension. The key characteristic of the political dimension of attribution is publicity; a politically attributed attack, for the purposes of this paper, entails a public accusation. One example of such an attribution is the American indictment of five members of the Chinese Peoples' Liberation Army on charges of stealing intellectual property from several American firms (Schmidt and Sanger 2014).\nThis political dimension of attribution engages calculations of interest both by state and (increasingly) non-state actors, as well as less understood dynamics of choice driven by emotion and by justice motives (see Welch 1993; Raymond and Welch 2013). As a result of these considerations, it is possible that attacks which can be reliably attributed from technical and legal perspectives will not be publicly (politically) attributed (i.e. dogs that don't bark). It is also possible that political pressures may lead to the public attribution of cyber attacks even when relevant technical and legal criteria are not clearly satisfied (i.e. potentially false positives). Both of these outcomes can create problematic impacts on international security.\nThe primary risk associated with false positives is the creation of escalatory spirals. Accusations, in particular when not accompanied by convincing technical data and when not made according to proper legal procedure, can damage diplomatic relations. The offense-dominant nature of the cyber domain (at least given the current state of technology) suggests strong potential for\nRule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks 131\nescalation in the event of a cyber attack; the perceived necessity of immediate reprisal also creates pressures militating toward hasty attribution (Nye 2011). If the attribution is accompanied by self-help measures, the risk of tit-for-tat escalation and the emergence of a crisis atmosphere are increased. In crises, domestic audience costs have a critical effect on the willingness of parties to back down (Fearon 1994). Ironically, the Internet's expansion of low-cost communication and its increasing integration with critical infrastructure and other essential aspects of everyday life may act to increase the size of the domestic audience and the stakes of significant cyber attack disruptions in the eyes of that audience, thus ratcheting up the audience costs associated with conceding in a dispute concerning a publicly attributed cyber attack and making such crises especially prone to escalatory spirals. Societies with a high degree of Internet penetration may be most prone to escalate in the aftermath of a publicly attributed cyber attack. As global rates of Internet penetration increase, there is thus also a greater risk of conflict spirals.\nTwo caveats are in order. First, our argument does not rest in a strong sense on the past track record of offense-defense theory in explaining cases to which it has been applied. This is primarily because our argument is forward-looking; we are seeking to identify and anticipate potential problems in what is still a relatively new area of international politics. Second, and related, we want to be clear that we are advancing an explicitly probabilistic argument. We do not claim that all crises will escalate. Rather, we claim that false positives in cyber attribution make escalation more likely. This is the case because false accusations are likely to aggrieve falsely-accused parties, who will perceive the attack as unjust and thus be likely to respond in kind (Welch 1993). It is also the case, as we have already argued, because of the domestic political difficulties leaders face in backing down once public accusations have been made. Other factors certainly also affect the propensity of particular crises to escalate; one of the most significant is the presence or absence of a past history of animosity between the parties.11 Nevertheless, our analytical focus here is on the dangers associated with factors related to patterns of cyber-attribution.\nWe have focused thus far on the dangers inherent both in the employment of cyber attacks (and conduct that may be mistaken for a cyber attack, such as some cybercrime and cyber espionage activities) and in the hasty attribution of cyber attacks. Less obviously, there is also a significant danger in widespread failure to attribute cyber attacks when technical and legal criteria have been satisfied. If cyber attacks are not criticized and no efforts are made to hold bad actors accountable, the establishment of permissive norms (and even\n\nMutual Security in the Asia-Pacific: Roles for Australia, Canada and South Korea\npermissive customary international law) is likely. Given the escalatory potential of cyber attacks, the prevalence of permissive norms could pose a significant international security risk. This risk entails, at maximum, the employment of cyber attacks to create kinetic damage and widespread disruption to critical infrastructure, as well as the potential escalation to more traditional interstate military conflict. While such outcomes are unlikely, they carry high costs. More modestly, permissive norms could lead to higher incidence of increasingly sophisticated cyber attacks resulting in degradation of Internet services and a loss of trust in the Internet as a means of commerce, communication and delivery of government services. Even this more optimistic scenario involves significant economic opportunity costs. The key point is that, due to its ability to forestall the development of permissive norms, criticism of socially undesirable behaviour is important in itself, (at least partially) independent of the ability to effectively enforce international rules (see Johnston 2001).\n# Rule Making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks\nGiven that both attribution and non-attribution of cyber attacks create significant international security risks, what is the appropriate policy response when cyber attacks occur? We argue that thoughtful international efforts at rulemaking to govern state conduct in the attribution of cyber attacks have the potential to steer a middle course, mitigating the risks associated with both widespread non-attribution and with hasty attribution. Such rules must govern when and how states publicly attribute cyber attacks and the consequences of attribution. Furthermore, these rules need to accomplish two parallel tasks: minimizing the need for attribution; but also enhancing capacity to respond when necessary. While the ex-ante specification of such rules is impossible due to the unpredictable nature of international negotiations, it is possible to sketch out some general design features of promising rule sets. The final section of this chapter briefly elaborates these features and addresses additional policy options for cooperation pertaining to the attribution of cyber attacks. In keeping with the goals of this volume, these policy options are presented in terms of opportunities for Canada, Korea and Australia; however, at least in this case, we believe that the options we present would travel relatively well and could in principle be adopted by other constructive powers either at the global level or in other regions.\nWith respect to the procedural mechanics of attribution, several desirable design features can be identified. First, attribution should be done on the basis of technical best practices for determining the point of origin for Internet traffic. Second, state and non-state actors seeking to attribute cyber attacks\nRule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks 133\nshould bear in mind the ease of concealment either by technical means or by the employment of arms-length proxy agents. Accordingly, attribution should be made only after attempts to engage appropriate authorities in the apparent country of origin. Where such authorities react cooperatively and in good faith, this should be prominently noted when attribution is made. Ideally, in such situations, joint statements of attribution could be made.\nThe creation and application of attribution standards and practices will require responsible global leadership. Political scientists and international relations scholars suggest that global norms are actively built by agents who have strong notions about appropriate or desirable behaviour in their community (Finnemore and Sikkink 1998). Canada, Australia and Korea are well positioned to act cooperatively as global leaders developing norms for both the procedures and consequences of publicly attributing cyber attacks for the following reasons. All three countries can find common ground for the development of these norms through their shared dialogue on the importance of international trade for economic growth and domestic economic policies that reflect these views. Cyber attacks can have large impacts on a country's ability to fairly and effectively compete in global markets (for example, see Manyika et al. 2014; Centre for Strategic and International Studies 2013). Non-attribution of these kinds of cyber attacks could further encourage this behaviour, as states or other actors would face no consequences for their bad practices. However, hasty or aggressive public attribution could also affect a country's ability to gain from trade by affecting its ability to bargain in future trade negotiations. Accusations that are not supported by convincing technical data and not made according to proper legal procedure can damage diplomatic relations. Thus, states risk negative diplomatic consequences and losing gains from trade when both hasty public attribution and non-attribution are made. As advanced industrial democracies with digitally connected economies, Australia, Canada and Korea have particular interests in the health of the digital economy. They also share a basic commitment to the maintenance of a rules-based international order.\nIn deciding when and how to attribute cyber attacks, norms-guiding states, firms and other actors are of little use if the underlying technical and legal capacities for attribution remain weak. There is certainly much to be done in this area. However, there are good reasons to conclude that Canada, Australia and Korea can take the lead on enhancing the capacity to accurately attribute cyber attacks. All three countries possess digitally connected economies with significant pools of relevant human capital. Such steps complement and coincide with measures that can augment capacities to defend against (and repair damage resulting from) cyber attacks. We focus here on what we believe\nMutual Security in the Asia-Pacific: Roles for Australia, Canada and South Korea\nto be one of the most promising avenues for cooperation on capacity building: strengthening CERTs.\nCERTs are independent networks of technical experts chartered to work with the Internet community in preventing, detecting and resolving computer security incidents. Currently, there are over 250 independent CERTs registered with the Forum for Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST) — an international network of CERTs that are committed to information exchange and cooperation on issues of mutual interest. Generally, the teams share a common organizational structure centred on facilitating communication among experts; acting as a point of contact for emergencies; maintaining research ties to improve security; and initiating proactive measures to increase awareness and understanding of computer security among a variety of stakeholders. However, the particular role of any given CERT is largely self-defined. For example, individual CERTs differ in their areas of focus (academic, private, national, regional or global), expertise (phishing, viruses, information security) and ability to effectively perform their mandates due to varying levels of funding and or technical expertise (Choucri, Madnick and Ferwerda 2013). To help gauge the diversity in CERTs operating around the world, Figure 1 (CERT Composition by Region) highlights the variety of CERTs operating under the authority of academic, technical, private and government institutions.\nThere are a number of interesting insights that can be drawn from this figure. First, when comparing the total number of CERTs to the number of users within a given region, Europe, North America and Oceania have more CERTs available to users within the region. Africa, Asia, Latin America and to an extent Russia, all have similarly low levels of CERTs operating within the region compared to the number of users online. This shows that CERT creation and operation within particular regions is a non-linear function of income and that other factors, such as state function or institutions, play an important role. Secondly, the regional variance of the types of CERTs is interesting. Regions with a highly developed technical industry, such as Europe, the United States and Asia, generally have higher levels of private CERTs, whereas regions that have a limited technical industry tend to have less private CERTs and more government operated CERTs.\n CERTs are also interchangeably referred to as Computer Incident Response Teams and Computer Security Incident Response Teams.\n A full list of CERTS registered with FIRST can be found at www.first.org/members/teams\n For more information on the overarching vision of CERTS, see the CERT Coordination Centre, www.cert.org\n This data was compiled from CERTs registered as members of FIRST.\nRule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks\nFigure 1: CERT Composition by Region\nSource: Data collected by Authors from the CERTs registered as members of FIRST.\nCERTs are established in an ad hoc manner and are often self-governed. Anyone can create a CERT, but to become a member of the global forum FIRST, CERTs must fill out a document called Request for Comment 2350, which outlines information such as the services a CERT will offer, who its constituents are and under what authority it operates. Private and academic CERTs often operate under the authority of its institution, such as business or university codes of conduct. In addition, CERTs must also adhere to national laws applicable in the jurisdictions where they operate. It is important to note that legal regimes can affect a CERTs ability to respond and resolve to particular cyber security incident. In Turkey, for example, which prohibits sending banking related information outside of its geographic boundaries, a CERT must operate within the constraints of its own technical knowledge and resources, leaving them unable to share information with third parties outside of the country's borders. As a result, Turkey's financial sector often receives a poor level of service (Best Practice Forum 2014).\nGiven that CERTs currently have varying degrees of ability, the three countries can support and facilitate shared learning and capacity building among CERTs in several ways. One possibility would involve a joint commitment to hosting and sponsoring FIRST annual conferences on a rotating basis, or to supporting FIRST global initiatives such as special interest groups and \"birds of a feather\"\nMutual Security in the Asia-Pacific: Roles for Australia, Canada and South Korea\nforums that exist to provide a forum where members can discuss topics of common interest to the community. This would improve CERT effectiveness and provide the CERT community with facilities that would create an environment for shared learning and cooperation. Given the importance of maintaining effective government computer networks to deliver key public goods, there is also a clear rationale for the provision of funding and technical assistance for these purposes to low-income countries. Such public goods include domestic services, but also encompass international goods such as effective law enforcement cooperation. There is also a case for project-based funding for CERTs in the non-profit sector and perhaps even in private industry. This funding could be provided on an opt-in basis as grant programs, allowing consideration to be given both to the quality of the applicant and its level of financial need. Such grant programs could start as small-scale pilots and could expand to involve public-private partnerships. Augmenting the number and capabilities of CERTs can improve the accuracy of attempts to attribute cyber attacks as well as the potential to quickly and effectively repair any resulting damage. Such capabilities would make hasty and inaccurate attributions less likely by providing more timely and more accurate information about the technical nature of cyber attacks, and would also reduce pressures to attribute cyber attacks by mitigating the costs they entail for victims (and thus the desire to retaliate).\nThere are also potential gains from enhanced coordination. CERTs have been created by a wide variety of actors (both public and private) and with different geographic scopes (domestic, regional, global). Many national CERTs coordinate with other CERTs in their respective regions. Regional CERTs could institutionalize the working relations of national and private sector teams. This could improve CERT-to-CERT cooperation, and as CERTs cooperate and build capacity within the region, the development of a coherent rule set for technical attribution beyond one nation's borders could be encouraged over time. In addition, the institutionalized working relationship between regional public and private CERTs could encourage cooperation across legal jurisdictions and state borders. This network could improve information sharing across a variety of regions and improve the digital forensic capabilities of governments and law enforcement agencies so that credible attribution can be made within a region.\nThe Asia Pacific Computer Emergency Response Team (APCERT) could play a leading role in helping CERTs in the Asia-Pacific cooperate and develop rules of best practice for attribution across the region. APCERT has 25 operational teams from 19 different states, including (but not limited to) Australia, India, China, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, New Zealand and Thailand.[16] APCERT already\n\nRule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks 137\nplays an important role by creating and maintaining a mutually trusting network of computer security experts in the Asia-Pacific, which improves regional awareness of and competency in responding to computer incidents. However, only 19 regional countries are currently represented. APCERT’s membership could be expanded to include other Asia-Pacific economies, including Canada.\nGlobally, there is an opportunity for CERTs to contribute to rules of best practice for technical attribution. The Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST) is a global organization coordinating CERT responses to computer incidents. One such opportunity is the creation of ongoing dialogue around best practices, supported (financially and diplomatically) by engaged states such as Korea, Australia and Canada. Such efforts are distinct from general augmentation of CERT capacities in that they would focus specifically on engaging the CERT community in contributing to broader attempts to think creatively about best practices for attribution. States could also make especially valuable contributions to these efforts by arranging the participation of experts in the legal and political dimensions of attribution. While broadening dialogue can create problems arising from divergent preferences and from difficulties in coordinating large numbers of players, bringing together these distinct voices can ensure that attribution of cyber attacks is approached in a holistic fashion that includes actors with requisite legal and political expertise.\nCERT coordination could also be improved through policies and practices that promote the interoperability of laws around information sharing. Given that the disharmonization of national laws could limit or prevent CERTs from effectively resolving computer security incidents, when creating or updating national legislation policy makers should consider the effect a law can have on a CERT’s ability to cooperate internationally. It is important that policy makers consider legal interoperability as a matter of degree that can be achieved through a variety of means, such as harmonization, standardization, mutual recognition, reciprocity and cooperation (Weber 2014). CERTs and policymakers should work together and create a shared dialogue that explores ways in which national laws can be implemented and utilized to further encourage CERT-CERT cooperation across national borders.\nGiven their technical expertise, it might seem like a natural fit to give regional and global CERTs official roles in investigating and making attributions for particular cyber attacks. While we do not rule out the viability of this option at least in some situations, we emphasize that there are reasons to be cautious in adopting such policies in the short-term. Directly involving CERTs in making attributions of cyber attacks risks politicizing their work and undermining the willingness of states and other actors to work with CERTs, especially at the\nMutual Security in the Asia-Pacific: Roles for Australia, Canada and South Korea\nregional and global levels. This could have the perverse effect of reducing rather than increasing the quality of information available, as well as the additional perverse effect of inhibiting efforts to quickly and effectively mitigate the effect of cyber attacks. It might be more palatable instead to establish the expectation that states and other actors seek the input of relevant CERTs prior to making public attributions of cyber attacks. The role of CERTs in this respect would be restricted to the provision of publicly available information that could be verified by interested parties, and that therefore should be less susceptible to politicization. To further reduce this risk, it might also be desirable to establish the expectation that public attributions be made on the basis of concurring analysis from multiple CERTs, at least some of which do not have a real or apparent conflict of interest. While it may not be possible to eliminate incidents of political leaders shopping among CERTs for favourable analysis, establishing norms that expect multiple concurring analyses and that expect the underlying technical data to be made publicly available can increase the legitimacy costs associated with such behaviour.\nWhile there is a need for rule making both about the procedures and consequences of public attribution and for various kinds of capacity-building and coordination measures, there is also a need for a commitment to restraint when publicly attributing cyber attacks. The widespread consistent exercise of such restraint in the face of what are likely to be increasingly common and perhaps increasingly disruptive incidents will take political will and statesmanship. This is the final way in which we conclude that Canada, Korea and Australia can show leadership. They can do so with the goal of forging a shared vision of the need for restraint in attribution in light of recent events and emerging trends. Such a vision must be predicated on relevant norms from other areas of international law and the broader regime complex for cyber governance (Nye 2014). A constructive discussion of the issues should begin with a shared understanding of what we have identified as the central dilemma in attributing cyber attacks: that careless attribution can be counter-productive and destabilizing, damaging important political, cultural and economic relationships; and that, on the other hand, lack of attribution can create a permissive environment in which cyber attacks are seen as low-cost and perhaps even as acceptable behaviour.\nNorms on cyber security and conflict are a global matter. However, given that cyber security issues are relatively new, multilateral institutions and other forms of international cooperation within this policy domain have not yet matured. The literature on constructive powers can be used to explain and describe\n Such real or apparent conflicts of interest could arise from a CERT based in a state making the public attribution or having a financial relationship with the entity (state or otherwise) making the attribution.\nRule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks 139\nhow countries develop norms in these nascent policy spaces (Hampson and Heinbecker 2011). Constructive powers can act as norm entrepreneurs in the development of global norms on cyber attacks and attribution. As Simon Palamar discusses in his contribution to this volume, one characteristic of constructive powers is their ability to shape the world in ways that explicitly take the preferences and interests of others into account. The development of norms on public attribution aligns with the preferences of other states given the political, economic and social consequences of both hasty and non-attribution. As constructive powers, Canada, Australia and Korea are well positioned to begin a productive dialogue — both domestically and in concert with each other — and to frame this critical conversation from its earliest stages, creating conditions for ongoing conversation and institutional learning.\nSuch norm-building processes are typically slow and non-linear in nature. This is especially true under conditions of uncertainty, for example the uncertainty associated with assessing the political and strategic implications of a disruptive new technology. Kenneth Abbott and Duncan Snidal have argued that in situations of uncertainty, soft law instruments are often superior choices to traditional hard law instruments such as treaties (Abbott and Snidal 2000). Hard law is difficult to change once it is established: at the national level, governments must go through long processes to change or update domestic laws, and at the international level, difficulties reaching agreements are even more pronounced as diverse actors bargain to reach some form of consensus. Soft law, in contrast, facilitates learning about the implications of particular kinds of rules and governance arrangements over time, making it easier for countries to come to an agreement typically with lower sovereignty costs than the negotiation (and renegotiation) of hard law. A great deal of soft law is developed and implemented by transnational networks of legal and regulatory experts that perform “the hard work of international law.”\nThis pattern of gradual norm-building via soft law instruments and transnational legal-regulatory networks is likely to hold with respect to the governance of attributing cyber attacks. Just as attempts to develop rules around the use of nuclear weapons was not a static process and required an extended period of learning (Freedman 1981; Tannenwald 2007), attempts to govern the cyber realm are likely to develop via various forms of soft law prior to hard, institutionalized and multilateral treaties. Joseph Nye draws this parallel and states that: “Governments learn slowly from knowledge, study and experience, and learning occurs internationally when new knowledge gradually redefines the content of national interests and leads to new policies. For example, the United\n On transnational regulatory networks, see Verdier (2009 113-172). The phrase “the hard work of international law” is taken from Brunnée and Toope (2010).\nMutual Security in the Asia-Pacific: Roles for Australia, Canada and South Korea\nStates and the Soviet Union took decades to learn how to adapt and respond to the prior revolution in military affairs — nuclear technology after 1945\" (Nye 2011, 19). There are reasons to expect that such learning and norm development will be even more difficult in the cyber case than it was in the nuclear era; for example, barriers to entry are far lower in the cyber case, and these capabilities have already proliferated far beyond the very small group of exclusively state actors that possess nuclear weapons. Creating shared knowledge among a much larger, and much more organizationally heterogeneous, number of players is likely to be extremely difficult.\nNotwithstanding these difficulties, a conscious effort to build and clarify norms for state behaviour in cyberspace is already underway. The United Nations Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) recently concluded that the current law of armed conflict applies online and that response to cyber attacks should be conducted within the framework of customary international law. The assessment of the GGE represents a start for international rule-making on cyber attacks rather than a conclusion, as agreeing on specific interpretations for applying general international legal rules to particular cases will require a great deal of work. However, it suggests that cyber attacks should be conducted only in self-defence or in accordance with authorization of collective action under the UN Charter. It further suggests that cyber attacks must distinguish between military and civilian targets and must accord with rules of proportionality. Finally, it suggests the importance of treating response to cyber attacks under the legal framework of state responsibility. Doing so establishes limits on justifiable self-help measures that states may take in response to an attributed cyber attack. Encouraging adherence to these limits can minimize the escalatory potential for cyber attacks.\nFurther developing the international legal and political frameworks governing response to cyber attacks will require sustained engagement with additional legal questions, prominent among which are questions of attribution. Indeed, determining whether a particular attack is attributable to a specific state (or states) is in many ways a logically prior question to assessing whether the attack was legally justifiable under international law and, if not, what countermeasures may be taken by which parties. The Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare provides a crucial legal resource for addressing these matters (see Schmitt 2013, 29-41). However, as we have argued, these are no more purely legal questions than they are purely technical ones.\nEnsuring the success of international efforts to build responsible norms for state conduct in cyberspace will require patient, careful work over a long period of time. Canada, Korea and Australia have the required resources (including positive\nRule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks 141\ninternational reputations) to play leading roles in this work both at the regional and global levels. As digitally connected economies, they also have clear interests in a positive outcome. In the nuclear era, such learning processes involved the creation of forums and study groups bringing together policy makers, military leaders and academics. Much of this activity took place at the national level, and it is likely that governments will engage on similar crash-course-learning programs as cyber issues become more prominent in contemporary international politics. However, given the greater reach and density of transnational networks among policy makers, there may be scope for international analogues to these processes. Transnational learning processes may (at least initially) take place at less official levels and involve more prominent roles for academics and other non-state actors, but may nevertheless play an important role in encouraging the improvement and dissemination of best practices for attributing cyber attacks and for ensuring responsible state conduct in cyberspace more generally. Providing resources to facilitate such processes is an inexpensive proposition with potentially large benefits and could be a priority for cooperation in both the short and long term."

In the North, the affected websites included those of the main Communist Party newspaper and the official Korean Central News Agency. In the South, the website for the presidential office and another government agency were rendered temporarily inaccessible. Given the tenor of political relations on the Korean peninsula, speculation centred on the possibility of involvement by state actors or their proxies. However, determining who was responsible for these cyber intrusions was complicated by several facts. First, a number of individuals purporting to belong to the \"hacktivist\" network Anonymous had indicated on Twitter that they would undertake offensive cyber operations against the North on the war's anniversary. Second, Twitter users also \"claimed responsibility for the attacks in South Korea, saying they demanded that the South's government stop censoring Internet content\" (ibid.). Given the relative ease of compromising authentication for social media accounts and the difficulty of independently establishing the source of origin for data transmitted over the Internet, it is difficult to regard such claims of responsibility as dispositive.¹\n1. For more on the difficulties of attributing cyber attacks and on cyber strategy in general, see Nye (2011, 18-38).\n125\nMutual Security in the Asia-Pacific: Roles for Australia, Canada and South Korea\nProblems in attributing the cyber attacks related to the anniversary of the Korean War expose a deeper, and more nuanced problem. The challenge is that attributing cyber intrusions back to a government sponsor is not simply a factual or technical challenge. Rather, it is a multifaceted problem that has technical, legal and political dimensions, all of which must be satisfied for the attribution of a cyber attack to a particular state to be appropriate. The additional complexity here, as with most things cyber, is that the rules governing conduct in each of these categories are still evolving. However, the complexity of the task should not mask its importance. The increasing importance of the Internet to daily life can be expected over time to amplify the stakes involved in large-scale, persistent disruptions of access. Further, technology already allows the creation of kinetic effects by means of malicious code; such capabilities are highly likely to become more widely available in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, there is real potential for escalation from cyber attacks to more traditional forms of violent conflict. New rules, norms and institutional structures are needed that can ameliorate the possibility of misattribution and the attendant consequences that would flow from it, and that can act as circuit-breakers inhibiting escalatory spirals even where attribution is properly made.\nIn order to advance this broad claim, the paper will proceed in the following fashion. The first section will highlight the technical aspects of attributing a cyber intrusion to a particular actor or set of actors. The second section will discuss the legal rules governing state responsibility and the attribution of acts to state actors. The third section will discuss the international political dimensions involved in determining whether or not to publicly attribute a particular cyber act to a given state. Finally, the paper concludes by arguing clearer rules are needed to avert the possible negative consequences of misattribution and that an impartial international institutional cooperative mechanism is needed to facilitate the development of a meaningful rule-based framework for state conduct related to attribution for cyber attacks. As constructive powers, Canada, Australia and Korea are well positioned to play a leading role in the development of global norms for both the procedures and consequences of publicly attributing cyber attacks by enhancing capacity to respond to cyber attacks through the augmentation of Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) and by crafting norms of restraint that demonstrate the political, economic and cultural consequences of both hasty and non-attribution.\nRule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks 127\n# The Technical Dimension of Attribution\nTechnical attribution of cyber attacks is primarily a matter of employing computer forensics to determine the physical point(s) of origin for a particular computer network operation and to locate circumstantial evidence embedded in malicious code that provides information about the likely identity of its author(s), such as languages employed or particular cultural points of reference. For a small number of governments, these means can be augmented with additional intelligence sources and methods.\nThe expertise necessary for such attribution efforts is, again with the exception of a growing number of wealthy governments, in the hands of private companies. Large computer network operators, technology companies and computer security firms possess increasingly sophisticated technical means to attribute cyber attacks.2 The emergence of private actors with intelligence capabilities that to some extent rival and exceed those of states is a new development; while non-state actors are not new in international relations, it is novel for such actors to enjoy resource and expertise advantages in a core area of state policy intimately connected to the state's monopoly on the use of legitimate violence. The involvement of corporate actors in the attribution of cyber attacks is also likely to prove controversial. Specifically, it is not clear whether states will generally accept the judgment of such companies — in particular when the company is headquartered in the same state making the public attribution of the attack.\nLeaving problems of credibility aside, there are also clear limits to technical attribution, in particular when principals employ arms-length agents (potentially located in other states) and/or transnational botnets in the conduct of cyber attacks. Given the utility of such gambits in frustrating attempts at attribution and the low cost of employing them, these practices are likely to spread. Even when location of origin can be conclusively identified, this is not necessarily a dispositive indication of responsibility either under narrow legal standards or more expansive political ones.\n# The International Legal Dimension of Attribution\nAssuming that cyber attacks constitute internationally wrongful acts, and assuming that the technical/factual indications provide sufficient evidence that the attack in question has a state connection, then invariably the relevant\n2 For one recent example, see Mandiant “APT1: Exposing One of China’s Cyber Espionage Units.” http://intelreport.mandiant.com/.\nMutual Security in the Asia-Pacific: Roles for Australia, Canada and South Korea\ninternational legal rules to apply will be the ones governing state responsibility. In short, state responsibility is a fundamental rule governing international relations which holds that if a state commits an internationally wrongful act that is attributable to the state, and the act constitutes a breach of an international obligation, then that state will owe a duty to make reparations for the breach.³ The relevant question then becomes: what activities are attributable to a state? Unfortunately, the answer is not entirely clear.\nLegal attribution is straightforward when the act in question is committed by an organ of the state. In these cases, the law will presume that the act committed by the organ is the act of the state itself. Suppose for example that a cyber attack was directed by a division of the military or the state intelligence services; this would \"according to a well-established rule of international law [...] be regarded as an act of that state.\"⁴ Determining responsibility becomes more complex, however, when dealing with entities that are more loosely affiliated with the state. For example, non-state actors who launch cyber attacks or engage in hacktivist activities may have varying degrees of state connection. Some may act with no official connection to the state, such as the infamous hacktivist group Anonymous, which operates with neither \"the steady income nor the fiscal sponsorship\" to support its activities and which often adopts an antagonistic tone toward state authority (Coleman 2014, 70). Other cyber attacks by non-state actors, in contrast, might be tolerated or even sponsored by the state to act in their interests. Analysts believe this was the case in 2007, when Russian hackers were sponsored by the state to unleash a massive cyber attack against the Estonian government and financial institutions over the relocation of a statue in the Estonian capital (Traynor 2007). Similarly, a group of hackers calling itself the Syrian Electronic Army claims to act on behalf of the Assad government (Boothby et al., 2012).\nComplexity in attributing cyber attacks is also a function of competing and inconsistent legal rules. The Draft Articles of the International Law Commission, which potentially reflect customary law,⁵ state that the conduct of an entity will be considered an act of a State under international law if that entity \"is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control\n3 Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, 2001, at Article 2, http://untreaty.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/draft%20articles/9_6_2001.pdf; See also Chorzów Factory, PCIJ, Series A, No. 17, 1928, p. 29; Malcolm N. Shaw, International Law, 6th Ed., at 778 [hereafter Shaw].\n4 Difference Relating to Immunity from Legal Process of a Special Rapporteur, ICJ Reports 1999, 62, 87.\n5 See, e.g., Memorial of Germany (LaGrand Case) (September 16, 1999) at para. 6.15 (referring to the ILC draft articles on responsibility as \"the most authoritative statement of customary international law on the matter\").\nRule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks 129\nof, that State in carrying out the conduct.”⁶ Thus, under this standard if a state directed a citizen hacker team to carry out a cyber attack, then those acts would be legally attributable back to that state. However, two international courts have weighed in on what the applicable standard should be when considering the attribution of certain acts to states, and in so doing, they have muddied the analytical waters.\nIn the *Nicaragua* case, the International Court of Justice was asked to decide whether the acts of the Contras — a rebel group engaged in a conflict with the Nicaraguan government — were attributable to the Government of the United States. In determining whether the relationship between the two was sufficiently close to allow for attribution, the Court held that “to be legally responsible, it would have to be proved that that State had *effective control* of the operations in the course of which the alleged violations were committed.”⁷ Thus, in order to be found responsible for particular cyber intrusions, under the *Nicaragua* standard it must be shown that the state in question had direct control over that very intrusion. In other words, “general overall control would have been insufficient to ground responsibility.”⁸ Rather, according to the jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice a more exacting standard applies.⁹\nHowever, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia sees the status of international law on this issue quite differently. In the *Tadić* case, the Tribunal found that a demonstration of *overall control* could be sufficient for a finding of state responsibility. In this way, the Tribunal incorporated a less stringent test under the rules of international law, noting, “the degree of control might vary according to the circumstances and a high threshold might not always be required.”¹⁰ As a consequence, the international community is left with a somewhat fragmented set of legal rules to apply to cyber attacks, when trying to attribute those acts back to state actors. Does one need to show that the cyber attacker was acting on the instructions of the state or that the state had effective control of the impugned operation? Or, is it appropriate to apply some lower threshold for the attribution of acts in cyber space? Should states, for example, be required to take reasonable steps to prevent attacks that originate from their\n6 Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, 2001, at Article 8, http://un- treaty.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/draft%20articles/9_6_2001.pdf.\n7 Case Concerning the Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

And if they fail to do so, should that provide a sufficient basis for a finding of responsibility? Or, should there be a more exacting standard in which states are called to account only when there is dispositive proof that an organ of the state committed or directed the attack?\nUltimately, the applicable rules remain somewhat unclear. However, what is clear is that the increasing centrality of cyber operations in the conduct of international relations is going put pressure on the existing set of rules and those rules will — no doubt — evolve in relation to that pressure. Thus, what is required at this point is some forward looking policy making aimed at developing a set of rules that accounts not only for where the subject technology is now, but where it is going to be in the future.\n## Political Dimensions of Attribution\nTechnical and legal aspects of attributing cyber attacks are, respectively, questions of evidentiary sufficiency — whether it is possible to determine the source of the attack to a degree of confidence that can withstand appropriate scrutiny — and appropriate procedure. These dimensions of attribution intersect in a complex fashion with a third, political, dimension. The key characteristic of the political dimension of attribution is publicity; a politically attributed attack, for the purposes of this paper, entails a public accusation. One example of such an attribution is the American indictment of five members of the Chinese Peoples' Liberation Army on charges of stealing intellectual property from several American firms (Schmidt and Sanger 2014).\nThis political dimension of attribution engages calculations of interest both by state and (increasingly) non-state actors, as well as less understood dynamics of choice driven by emotion and by justice motives (see Welch 1993; Raymond and Welch 2013). As a result of these considerations, it is possible that attacks which can be reliably attributed from technical and legal perspectives will not be publicly (politically) attributed (i.e. dogs that don't bark). It is also possible that political pressures may lead to the public attribution of cyber attacks even when relevant technical and legal criteria are not clearly satisfied (i.e. potentially false positives). Both of these outcomes can create problematic impacts on international security.\nThe primary risk associated with false positives is the creation of escalatory spirals. Accusations, in particular when not accompanied by convincing technical data and when not made according to proper legal procedure, can damage diplomatic relations. The offense-dominant nature of the cyber domain (at least given the current state of technology) suggests strong potential for\nRule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks 131\nescalation in the event of a cyber attack; the perceived necessity of immediate reprisal also creates pressures militating toward hasty attribution (Nye 2011). If the attribution is accompanied by self-help measures, the risk of tit-for-tat escalation and the emergence of a crisis atmosphere are increased. In crises, domestic audience costs have a critical effect on the willingness of parties to back down (Fearon 1994). Ironically, the Internet's expansion of low-cost communication and its increasing integration with critical infrastructure and other essential aspects of everyday life may act to increase the size of the domestic audience and the stakes of significant cyber attack disruptions in the eyes of that audience, thus ratcheting up the audience costs associated with conceding in a dispute concerning a publicly attributed cyber attack and making such crises especially prone to escalatory spirals. Societies with a high degree of Internet penetration may be most prone to escalate in the aftermath of a publicly attributed cyber attack. As global rates of Internet penetration increase, there is thus also a greater risk of conflict spirals.\nTwo caveats are in order. First, our argument does not rest in a strong sense on the past track record of offense-defense theory in explaining cases to which it has been applied. This is primarily because our argument is forward-looking; we are seeking to identify and anticipate potential problems in what is still a relatively new area of international politics. Second, and related, we want to be clear that we are advancing an explicitly probabilistic argument. We do not claim that all crises will escalate. Rather, we claim that false positives in cyber attribution make escalation more likely. This is the case because false accusations are likely to aggrieve falsely-accused parties, who will perceive the attack as unjust and thus be likely to respond in kind (Welch 1993). It is also the case, as we have already argued, because of the domestic political difficulties leaders face in backing down once public accusations have been made. Other factors certainly also affect the propensity of particular crises to escalate; one of the most significant is the presence or absence of a past history of animosity between the parties.11 Nevertheless, our analytical focus here is on the dangers associated with factors related to patterns of cyber-attribution.\nWe have focused thus far on the dangers inherent both in the employment of cyber attacks (and conduct that may be mistaken for a cyber attack, such as some cybercrime and cyber espionage activities) and in the hasty attribution of cyber attacks. Less obviously, there is also a significant danger in widespread failure to attribute cyber attacks when technical and legal criteria have been satisfied. If cyber attacks are not criticized and no efforts are made to hold bad actors accountable, the establishment of permissive norms (and even\n11 We thank Simon Palamar for making this point.\nMutual Security in the Asia-Pacific: Roles for Australia, Canada and South Korea\npermissive customary international law) is likely. Given the escalatory potential of cyber attacks, the prevalence of permissive norms could pose a significant international security risk. This risk entails, at maximum, the employment of cyber attacks to create kinetic damage and widespread disruption to critical infrastructure, as well as the potential escalation to more traditional interstate military conflict. While such outcomes are unlikely, they carry high costs. More modestly, permissive norms could lead to higher incidence of increasingly sophisticated cyber attacks resulting in degradation of Internet services and a loss of trust in the Internet as a means of commerce, communication and delivery of government services. Even this more optimistic scenario involves significant economic opportunity costs. The key point is that, due to its ability to forestall the development of permissive norms, criticism of socially undesirable behaviour is important in itself, (at least partially) independent of the ability to effectively enforce international rules (see Johnston 2001).\n# Rule Making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks\nGiven that both attribution and non-attribution of cyber attacks create significant international security risks, what is the appropriate policy response when cyber attacks occur? We argue that thoughtful international efforts at rulemaking to govern state conduct in the attribution of cyber attacks have the potential to steer a middle course, mitigating the risks associated with both widespread non-attribution and with hasty attribution. Such rules must govern when and how states publicly attribute cyber attacks and the consequences of attribution. Furthermore, these rules need to accomplish two parallel tasks: minimizing the need for attribution; but also enhancing capacity to respond when necessary. While the ex-ante specification of such rules is impossible due to the unpredictable nature of international negotiations, it is possible to sketch out some general design features of promising rule sets. The final section of this chapter briefly elaborates these features and addresses additional policy options for cooperation pertaining to the attribution of cyber attacks. In keeping with the goals of this volume, these policy options are presented in terms of opportunities for Canada, Korea and Australia; however, at least in this case, we believe that the options we present would travel relatively well and could in principle be adopted by other constructive powers either at the global level or in other regions.\nWith respect to the procedural mechanics of attribution, several desirable design features can be identified. First, attribution should be done on the basis of technical best practices for determining the point of origin for Internet traffic. Second, state and non-state actors seeking to attribute cyber attacks\nRule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks 133\nshould bear in mind the ease of concealment either by technical means or by the employment of arms-length proxy agents. Accordingly, attribution should be made only after attempts to engage appropriate authorities in the apparent country of origin. Where such authorities react cooperatively and in good faith, this should be prominently noted when attribution is made. Ideally, in such situations, joint statements of attribution could be made.\nThe creation and application of attribution standards and practices will require responsible global leadership. Political scientists and international relations scholars suggest that global norms are actively built by agents who have strong notions about appropriate or desirable behaviour in their community (Finnemore and Sikkink 1998). Canada, Australia and Korea are well positioned to act cooperatively as global leaders developing norms for both the procedures and consequences of publicly attributing cyber attacks for the following reasons. All three countries can find common ground for the development of these norms through their shared dialogue on the importance of international trade for economic growth and domestic economic policies that reflect these views. Cyber attacks can have large impacts on a country's ability to fairly and effectively compete in global markets (for example, see Manyika et al. 2014; Centre for Strategic and International Studies 2013). Non-attribution of these kinds of cyber attacks could further encourage this behaviour, as states or other actors would face no consequences for their bad practices. However, hasty or aggressive public attribution could also affect a country's ability to gain from trade by affecting its ability to bargain in future trade negotiations. Accusations that are not supported by convincing technical data and not made according to proper legal procedure can damage diplomatic relations. Thus, states risk negative diplomatic consequences and losing gains from trade when both hasty public attribution and non-attribution are made. As advanced industrial democracies with digitally connected economies, Australia, Canada and Korea have particular interests in the health of the digital economy. They also share a basic commitment to the maintenance of a rules-based international order.\nIn deciding when and how to attribute cyber attacks, norms-guiding states, firms and other actors are of little use if the underlying technical and legal capacities for attribution remain weak. There is certainly much to be done in this area. However, there are good reasons to conclude that Canada, Australia and Korea can take the lead on enhancing the capacity to accurately attribute cyber attacks. All three countries possess digitally connected economies with significant pools of relevant human capital. Such steps complement and coincide with measures that can augment capacities to defend against (and repair damage resulting from) cyber attacks. We focus here on what we believe\nMutual Security in the Asia-Pacific: Roles for Australia, Canada and South Korea\nto be one of the most promising avenues for cooperation on capacity building: strengthening CERTs.¹²\nCERTs are independent networks of technical experts chartered to work with the Internet community in preventing, detecting and resolving computer security incidents. Currently, there are over 250 independent CERTs registered with the Forum for Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST) — an international network of CERTs that are committed to information exchange and cooperation on issues of mutual interest.¹³ Generally, the teams share a common organizational structure centred on facilitating communication among experts; acting as a point of contact for emergencies; maintaining research ties to improve security; and initiating proactive measures to increase awareness and understanding of computer security among a variety of stakeholders.¹⁴ However, the particular role of any given CERT is largely self-defined. For example, individual CERTs differ in their areas of focus (academic, private, national, regional or global), expertise (phishing, viruses, information security) and ability to effectively perform their mandates due to varying levels of funding and or technical expertise (Choucri, Madnick and Ferwerda 2013). To help gauge the diversity in CERTs operating around the world, Figure 1 (CERT Composition by Region) highlights the variety of CERTs operating under the authority of academic, technical, private and government institutions.¹⁵\nThere are a number of interesting insights that can be drawn from this figure. First, when comparing the total number of CERTs to the number of users within a given region, Europe, North America and Oceania have more CERTs available to users within the region. Africa, Asia, Latin America and to an extent Russia, all have similarly low levels of CERTs operating within the region compared to the number of users online. This shows that CERT creation and operation within particular regions is a non-linear function of income and that other factors, such as state function or institutions, play an important role. Secondly, the regional variance of the types of CERTs is interesting. Regions with a highly developed technical industry, such as Europe, the United States and Asia, generally have higher levels of private CERTs, whereas regions that have a limited technical industry tend to have less private CERTs and more government operated CERTs.\n¹² CERTs are also interchangeably referred to as Computer Incident Response Teams and Computer Security Incident Response Teams.\n¹³ A full list of CERTS registered with FIRST can be found at www.first.org/members/teams\n¹⁴ For more information on the overarching vision of CERTS, see the CERT Coordination Centre, www.cert.org\n¹⁵ This data was compiled from CERTs registered as members of FIRST.\nRule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks\nFigure 1: CERT Composition by Region\nSource: Data collected by Authors from the CERTs registered as members of FIRST.\nCERTs are established in an ad hoc manner and are often self-governed. Anyone can create a CERT, but to become a member of the global forum FIRST, CERTs must fill out a document called Request for Comment 2350, which outlines information such as the services a CERT will offer, who its constituents are and under what authority it operates. Private and academic CERTs often operate under the authority of its institution, such as business or university codes of conduct. In addition, CERTs must also adhere to national laws applicable in the jurisdictions where they operate. It is important to note that legal regimes can affect a CERTs ability to respond and resolve to particular cyber security incident. In Turkey, for example, which prohibits sending banking related information outside of its geographic boundaries, a CERT must operate within the constraints of its own technical knowledge and resources, leaving them unable to share information with third parties outside of the country's borders. As a result, Turkey's financial sector often receives a poor level of service (Best Practice Forum 2014).\nGiven that CERTs currently have varying degrees of ability, the three countries can support and facilitate shared learning and capacity building among CERTs in several ways. One possibility would involve a joint commitment to hosting and sponsoring FIRST annual conferences on a rotating basis, or to supporting FIRST global initiatives such as special interest groups and \"birds of a feather\"\nMutual Security in the Asia-Pacific: Roles for Australia, Canada and South Korea\nforums that exist to provide a forum where members can discuss topics of common interest to the community. This would improve CERT effectiveness and provide the CERT community with facilities that would create an environment for shared learning and cooperation. Given the importance of maintaining effective government computer networks to deliver key public goods, there is also a clear rationale for the provision of funding and technical assistance for these purposes to low-income countries. Such public goods include domestic services, but also encompass international goods such as effective law enforcement cooperation. There is also a case for project-based funding for CERTs in the non-profit sector and perhaps even in private industry. This funding could be provided on an opt-in basis as grant programs, allowing consideration to be given both to the quality of the applicant and its level of financial need. Such grant programs could start as small-scale pilots and could expand to involve public-private partnerships. Augmenting the number and capabilities of CERTs can improve the accuracy of attempts to attribute cyber attacks as well as the potential to quickly and effectively repair any resulting damage. Such capabilities would make hasty and inaccurate attributions less likely by providing more timely and more accurate information about the technical nature of cyber attacks, and would also reduce pressures to attribute cyber attacks by mitigating the costs they entail for victims (and thus the desire to retaliate).\nThere are also potential gains from enhanced coordination. CERTs have been created by a wide variety of actors (both public and private) and with different geographic scopes (domestic, regional, global). Many national CERTs coordinate with other CERTs in their respective regions. Regional CERTs could institutionalize the working relations of national and private sector teams. This could improve CERT-to-CERT cooperation, and as CERTs cooperate and build capacity within the region, the development of a coherent rule set for technical attribution beyond one nation's borders could be encouraged over time. In addition, the institutionalized working relationship between regional public and private CERTs could encourage cooperation across legal jurisdictions and state borders. This network could improve information sharing across a variety of regions and improve the digital forensic capabilities of governments and law enforcement agencies so that credible attribution can be made within a region.\nThe Asia Pacific Computer Emergency Response Team (APCERT) could play a leading role in helping CERTs in the Asia-Pacific cooperate and develop rules of best practice for attribution across the region. APCERT has 25 operational teams from 19 different states, including (but not limited to) Australia, India, China, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, New Zealand and Thailand. APCERT already\n16 For a complete list of APCERT membership see www.apcert.org/about/structure/members.html\nRule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks 137\nplays an important role by creating and maintaining a mutually trusting network of computer security experts in the Asia-Pacific, which improves regional awareness of and competency in responding to computer incidents. However, only 19 regional countries are currently represented. APCERT’s membership could be expanded to include other Asia-Pacific economies, including Canada.\nGlobally, there is an opportunity for CERTs to contribute to rules of best practice for technical attribution. The Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST) is a global organization coordinating CERT responses to computer incidents. One such opportunity is the creation of ongoing dialogue around best practices, supported (financially and diplomatically) by engaged states such as Korea, Australia and Canada. Such efforts are distinct from general augmentation of CERT capacities in that they would focus specifically on engaging the CERT community in contributing to broader attempts to think creatively about best practices for attribution. States could also make especially valuable contributions to these efforts by arranging the participation of experts in the legal and political dimensions of attribution. While broadening dialogue can create problems arising from divergent preferences and from difficulties in coordinating large numbers of players, bringing together these distinct voices can ensure that attribution of cyber attacks is approached in a holistic fashion that includes actors with requisite legal and political expertise.\nCERT coordination could also be improved through policies and practices that promote the interoperability of laws around information sharing. Given that the disharmonization of national laws could limit or prevent CERTs from effectively resolving computer security incidents, when creating or updating national legislation policy makers should consider the effect a law can have on a CERT’s ability to cooperate internationally. It is important that policy makers consider legal interoperability as a matter of degree that can be achieved through a variety of means, such as harmonization, standardization, mutual recognition, reciprocity and cooperation (Weber 2014). CERTs and policymakers should work together and create a shared dialogue that explores ways in which national laws can be implemented and utilized to further encourage CERT-CERT cooperation across national borders.\nGiven their technical expertise, it might seem like a natural fit to give regional and global CERTs official roles in investigating and making attributions for particular cyber attacks. While we do not rule out the viability of this option at least in some situations, we emphasize that there are reasons to be cautious in adopting such policies in the short-term. Directly involving CERTs in making attributions of cyber attacks risks politicizing their work and undermining the willingness of states and other actors to work with CERTs, especially at the\nMutual Security in the Asia-Pacific: Roles for Australia, Canada and South Korea\nregional and global levels. This could have the perverse effect of reducing rather than increasing the quality of information available, as well as the additional perverse effect of inhibiting efforts to quickly and effectively mitigate the effect of cyber attacks. It might be more palatable instead to establish the expectation that states and other actors seek the input of relevant CERTs prior to making public attributions of cyber attacks. The role of CERTs in this respect would be restricted to the provision of publicly available information that could be verified by interested parties, and that therefore should be less susceptible to politicization. To further reduce this risk, it might also be desirable to establish the expectation that public attributions be made on the basis of concurring analysis from multiple CERTs, at least some of which do not have a real or apparent conflict of interest.¹⁷ While it may not be possible to eliminate incidents of political leaders shopping among CERTs for favourable analysis, establishing norms that expect multiple concurring analyses and that expect the underlying technical data to be made publicly available can increase the legitimacy costs associated with such behaviour.\nWhile there is a need for rule making both about the procedures and consequences of public attribution and for various kinds of capacity-building and coordination measures, there is also a need for a commitment to restraint when publicly attributing cyber attacks. The widespread consistent exercise of such restraint in the face of what are likely to be increasingly common and perhaps increasingly disruptive incidents will take political will and statesmanship. This is the final way in which we conclude that Canada, Korea and Australia can show leadership. They can do so with the goal of forging a shared vision of the need for restraint in attribution in light of recent events and emerging trends. Such a vision must be predicated on relevant norms from other areas of international law and the broader regime complex for cyber governance (Nye 2014). A constructive discussion of the issues should begin with a shared understanding of what we have identified as the central dilemma in attributing cyber attacks: that careless attribution can be counter-productive and destabilizing, damaging important political, cultural and economic relationships; and that, on the other hand, lack of attribution can create a permissive environment in which cyber attacks are seen as low-cost and perhaps even as acceptable behaviour.\nNorms on cyber security and conflict are a global matter. However, given that cyber security issues are relatively new, multilateral institutions and other forms of international cooperation within this policy domain have not yet matured. The literature on constructive powers can be used to explain and describe\n¹⁷ Such real or apparent conflicts of interest could arise from a CERT based in a state making the public attribution or having a financial relationship with the entity (state or otherwise) making the attribution.\nRule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks 139\nhow countries develop norms in these nascent policy spaces (Hampson and Heinbecker 2011). Constructive powers can act as norm entrepreneurs in the development of global norms on cyber attacks and attribution. As Simon Palamar discusses in his contribution to this volume, one characteristic of constructive powers is their ability to shape the world in ways that explicitly take the preferences and interests of others into account. The development of norms on public attribution aligns with the preferences of other states given the political, economic and social consequences of both hasty and non-attribution. As constructive powers, Canada, Australia and Korea are well positioned to begin a productive dialogue — both domestically and in concert with each other — and to frame this critical conversation from its earliest stages, creating conditions for ongoing conversation and institutional learning.\nSuch norm-building processes are typically slow and non-linear in nature. This is especially true under conditions of uncertainty, for example the uncertainty associated with assessing the political and strategic implications of a disruptive new technology. Kenneth Abbott and Duncan Snidal have argued that in situations of uncertainty, soft law instruments are often superior choices to traditional hard law instruments such as treaties (Abbott and Snidal 2000). Hard law is difficult to change once it is established: at the national level, governments must go through long processes to change or update domestic laws, and at the international level, difficulties reaching agreements are even more pronounced as diverse actors bargain to reach some form of consensus. Soft law, in contrast, facilitates learning about the implications of particular kinds of rules and governance arrangements over time, making it easier for countries to come to an agreement typically with lower sovereignty costs than the negotiation (and renegotiation) of hard law. A great deal of soft law is developed and implemented by transnational networks of legal and regulatory experts that perform “the hard work of international law.”¹⁸\nThis pattern of gradual norm-building via soft law instruments and transnational legal-regulatory networks is likely to hold with respect to the governance of attributing cyber attacks. Just as attempts to develop rules around the use of nuclear weapons was not a static process and required an extended period of learning (Freedman 1981; Tannenwald 2007), attempts to govern the cyber realm are likely to develop via various forms of soft law prior to hard, institutionalized and multilateral treaties. Joseph Nye draws this parallel and states that: “Governments learn slowly from knowledge, study and experience, and learning occurs internationally when new knowledge gradually redefines the content of national interests and leads to new policies. For example, the United\n¹⁸ On transnational regulatory networks, see Verdier (2009 113-172). The phrase “the hard work of international law” is taken from Brunnée and Toope (2010).\nMutual Security in the Asia-Pacific: Roles for Australia, Canada and South Korea\nStates and the Soviet Union took decades to learn how to adapt and respond to the prior revolution in military affairs — nuclear technology after 1945\" (Nye 2011, 19). There are reasons to expect that such learning and norm development will be even more difficult in the cyber case than it was in the nuclear era; for example, barriers to entry are far lower in the cyber case, and these capabilities have already proliferated far beyond the very small group of exclusively state actors that possess nuclear weapons. Creating shared knowledge among a much larger, and much more organizationally heterogeneous, number of players is likely to be extremely difficult.\nNotwithstanding these difficulties, a conscious effort to build and clarify norms for state behaviour in cyberspace is already underway. The United Nations Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) recently concluded that the current law of armed conflict applies online and that response to cyber attacks should be conducted within the framework of customary international law. The assessment of the GGE represents a start for international rule-making on cyber attacks rather than a conclusion, as agreeing on specific interpretations for applying general international legal rules to particular cases will require a great deal of work. However, it suggests that cyber attacks should be conducted only in self-defence or in accordance with authorization of collective action under the UN Charter. It further suggests that cyber attacks must distinguish between military and civilian targets and must accord with rules of proportionality. Finally, it suggests the importance of treating response to cyber attacks under the legal framework of state responsibility. Doing so establishes limits on justifiable self-help measures that states may take in response to an attributed cyber attack. Encouraging adherence to these limits can minimize the escalatory potential for cyber attacks.\nFurther developing the international legal and political frameworks governing response to cyber attacks will require sustained engagement with additional legal questions, prominent among which are questions of attribution. Indeed, determining whether a particular attack is attributable to a specific state (or states) is in many ways a logically prior question to assessing whether the attack was legally justifiable under international law and, if not, what countermeasures may be taken by which parties. The Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare provides a crucial legal resource for addressing these matters (see Schmitt 2013, 29-41). However, as we have argued, these are no more purely legal questions than they are purely technical ones.\nEnsuring the success of international efforts to build responsible norms for state conduct in cyberspace will require patient, careful work over a long period of time. Canada, Korea and Australia have the required resources (including positive\nRule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks 141\ninternational reputations) to play leading roles in this work both at the regional and global levels. As digitally connected economies, they also have clear interests in a positive outcome. In the nuclear era, such learning processes involved the creation of forums and study groups bringing together policy makers, military leaders and academics. Much of this activity took place at the national level, and it is likely that governments will engage on similar crash-course-learning programs as cyber issues become more prominent in contemporary international politics. However, given the greater reach and density of transnational networks among policy makers, there may be scope for international analogues to these processes. Transnational learning processes may (at least initially) take place at less official levels and involve more prominent roles for academics and other non-state actors, but may nevertheless play an important role in encouraging the improvement and dissemination of best practices for attributing cyber attacks and for ensuring responsible state conduct in cyberspace more generally. Providing resources to facilitate such processes is an inexpensive proposition with potentially large benefits and could be a priority for cooperation in both the short and long term."

      "flat_text": "Samantha Bradshaw, Mark Raymond and Aaron Shull # Introduction In June of 2014, on the sixty-third anniversary of the start of the Korean War, the New York Times reported that offensive cyber operations had been initiated against various websites in both Korean countries. In the North, the affected websites included those of the main Communist Party newspaper and the official Korean Central News Agency. In the South, the website for the presidential office and another government agency were rendered temporarily inaccessible. Given the tenor of political relations on the Korean peninsula, speculation centred on the possibility of involvement by state actors or their proxies. However, determining who was responsible for these cyber intrusions was complicated by several facts. First, a number of individuals purporting to belong to the\"hacktivist\"network Anonymous had indicated on Twitter that they would undertake offensive cyber operations against the North on the war's anniversary. Second, Twitter users also\"claimed responsibility for the attacks in South Korea, saying they demanded that the South's government stop censoring Internet content\"(ibid.). Given the relative ease of compromising authentication for social media accounts and the difficulty of independently establishing the source of origin for data transmitted over the Internet, it is difficult to regard such claims of responsibility as dispositive.¹ Problems in attributing the cyber attacks related to the anniversary of the Korean War expose a deeper, and more nuanced problem. The challenge is that attributing cyber intrusions back to a government sponsor is not simply a factual or technical challenge. Rather, it is a multifaceted problem that has technical, legal and political dimensions, all of which must be satisfied for the attribution of a cyber attack to a particular state to be appropriate. The additional complexity here, as with most things cyber, is that the rules governing conduct in each of these categories are still evolving. However, the complexity of the task should not mask its importance. The increasing importance of the Internet to daily life can be expected over time to amplify the stakes involved in large-scale, persistent disruptions of access. Further, technology already allows the creation of kinetic effects by means of malicious code; such capabilities are highly likely to become more widely available in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, there is real potential for escalation from cyber attacks to more traditional forms of violent conflict. New rules, norms and institutional structures are needed that can ameliorate the possibility of misattribution and the attendant consequences that would flow from it, and that can act as circuit-breakers inhibiting escalatory spirals even where attribution is properly made.\nIn order to advance this broad claim, the paper will proceed in the following fashion. The first section will highlight the technical aspects of attributing a cyber intrusion to a particular actor or set of actors. The second section will discuss the legal rules governing state responsibility and the attribution of acts to state actors. The third section will discuss the international political dimensions involved in determining whether or not to publicly attribute a particular cyber act to a given state. Finally, the paper concludes by arguing clearer rules are needed to avert the possible negative consequences of misattribution and that an impartial international institutional cooperative mechanism is needed to facilitate the development of a meaningful rule-based framework for state conduct related to attribution for cyber attacks. As constructive powers, Canada, Australia and Korea are well positioned to play a leading role in the development of global norms for both the procedures and consequences of publicly attributing cyber attacks by enhancing capacity to respond to cyber attacks through the augmentation of Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) and by crafting norms of restraint that demonstrate the political, economic and cultural consequences of both hasty and non-attribution.\nRule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks 127 # The Technical Dimension of Attribution Technical attribution of cyber attacks is primarily a matter of employing computer forensics to determine the physical point(s) of origin for a particular computer network operation and to locate circumstantial evidence embedded in malicious code that provides information about the likely identity of its author(s), such as languages employed or particular cultural points of reference. For a small number of governments, these means can be augmented with additional intelligence sources and methods.\nThe expertise necessary for such attribution efforts is, again with the exception of a growing number of wealthy governments, in the hands of private companies. Large computer network operators, technology companies and computer security firms possess increasingly sophisticated technical means to attribute cyber attacks.2 The emergence of private actors with intelligence capabilities that to some extent rival and exceed those of states is a new development; while non-state actors are not new in international relations, it is novel for such actors to enjoy resource and expertise advantages in a core area of state policy intimately connected to the state's monopoly on the use of legitimate violence. The involvement of corporate actors in the attribution of cyber attacks is also likely to prove controversial. Specifically, it is not clear whether states will generally accept the judgment of such companies — in particular when the company is headquartered in the same state making the public attribution of the attack.\nLeaving problems of credibility aside, there are also clear limits to technical attribution, in particular when principals employ arms-length agents (potentially located in other states) and/or transnational botnets in the conduct of cyber attacks. Given the utility of such gambits in frustrating attempts at attribution and the low cost of employing them, these practices are likely to spread. Even when location of origin can be conclusively identified, this is not necessarily a dispositive indication of responsibility either under narrow legal standards or more expansive political ones.\n# The International Legal Dimension of Attribution Assuming that cyber attacks constitute internationally wrongful acts, and assuming that the technical/factual indications provide sufficient evidence that the attack in question has a state connection, then invariably the relevant Mutual Security in the Asia-Pacific: Roles for Australia, Canada and South Korea international legal rules to apply will be the ones governing state responsibility. In short, state responsibility is a fundamental rule governing international relations which holds that if a state commits an internationally wrongful act that is attributable to the state, and the act constitutes a breach of an international obligation, then that state will owe a duty to make reparations for the breach.³ The relevant question then becomes: what activities are attributable to a state? Unfortunately, the answer is not entirely clear.\nLegal attribution is straightforward when the act in question is committed by an organ of the state. In these cases, the law will presume that the act committed by the organ is the act of the state itself. Suppose for example that a cyber attack was directed by a division of the military or the state intelligence services; this would\"according to a well-established rule of international law [...] be regarded as an act of that state.\"⁴ Determining responsibility becomes more complex, however, when dealing with entities that are more loosely affiliated with the state. For example, non-state actors who launch cyber attacks or engage in hacktivist activities may have varying degrees of state connection. Some may act with no official connection to the state, such as the infamous hacktivist group Anonymous, which operates with neither\"the steady income nor the fiscal sponsorship\"to support its activities and which often adopts an antagonistic tone toward state authority. Other cyber attacks by non-state actors, in contrast, might be tolerated or even sponsored by the state to act in their interests. Analysts believe this was the case in 2007, when Russian hackers were sponsored by the state to unleash a massive cyber attack against the Estonian government and financial institutions over the relocation of a statue in the Estonian capital. Similarly, a group of hackers calling itself the Syrian Electronic Army claims to act on behalf of the Assad government.\nComplexity in attributing cyber attacks is also a function of competing and inconsistent legal rules. The Draft Articles of the International Law Commission, which potentially reflect customary law,⁵ state that the conduct of an entity will be considered an act of a State under international law if that entity\"is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control Rule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks 129 of, that State in carrying out the conduct.”⁶ Thus, under this standard if a state directed a citizen hacker team to carry out a cyber attack, then those acts would be legally attributable back to that state. However, two international courts have weighed in on what the applicable standard should be when considering the attribution of certain acts to states, and in so doing, they have muddied the analytical waters.\nIn the *Nicaragua* case, the International Court of Justice was asked to decide whether the acts of the Contras — a rebel group engaged in a conflict with the Nicaraguan government — were attributable to the Government of the United States. In determining whether the relationship between the two was sufficiently close to allow for attribution, the Court held that “to be legally responsible, it would have to be proved that that State had *effective control* of the operations in the course of which the alleged violations were committed.”⁷ Thus, in order to be found responsible for particular cyber intrusions, under the *Nicaragua* standard it must be shown that the state in question had direct control over that very intrusion. In other words, “general overall control would have been insufficient to ground responsibility.”⁸ Rather, according to the jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice a more exacting standard applies.⁹ However, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia sees the status of international law on this issue quite differently. In the *Tadić* case, the Tribunal found that a demonstration of *overall control* could be sufficient for a finding of state responsibility. In this way, the Tribunal incorporated a less stringent test under the rules of international law, noting, “the degree of control might vary according to the circumstances and a high threshold might not always be required.”¹⁰ As a consequence, the international community is left with a somewhat fragmented set of legal rules to apply to cyber attacks, when trying to attribute those acts back to state actors. Does one need to show that the cyber attacker was acting on the instructions of the state or that the state had effective control of the impugned operation? Or, is it appropriate to apply some lower threshold for the attribution of acts in cyber space? Should states, for example, be required to take reasonable steps to prevent attacks that originate from their Mutual Security in the Asia-Pacific: Roles for Australia, Canada and South Korea territory? And if they fail to do so, should that provide a sufficient basis for a finding of responsibility? Or, should there be a more exacting standard in which states are called to account only when there is dispositive proof that an organ of the state committed or directed the attack?\nUltimately, the applicable rules remain somewhat unclear. However, what is clear is that the increasing centrality of cyber operations in the conduct of international relations is going put pressure on the existing set of rules and those rules will — no doubt — evolve in relation to that pressure. Thus, what is required at this point is some forward looking policy making aimed at developing a set of rules that accounts not only for where the subject technology is now, but where it is going to be in the future.\n## Political Dimensions of Attribution Technical and legal aspects of attributing cyber attacks are, respectively, questions of evidentiary sufficiency — whether it is possible to determine the source of the attack to a degree of confidence that can withstand appropriate scrutiny — and appropriate procedure. These dimensions of attribution intersect in a complex fashion with a third, political, dimension. The key characteristic of the political dimension of attribution is publicity; a politically attributed attack, for the purposes of this paper, entails a public accusation. One example of such an attribution is the American indictment of five members of the Chinese Peoples' Liberation Army on charges of stealing intellectual property from several American firms.\nThis political dimension of attribution engages calculations of interest both by state and (increasingly) non-state actors, as well as less understood dynamics of choice driven by emotion and by justice motives (see Welch 1993; Raymond and Welch 2013). As a result of these considerations, it is possible that attacks which can be reliably attributed from technical and legal perspectives will not be publicly (politically) attributed (i.e. dogs that don't bark). It is also possible that political pressures may lead to the public attribution of cyber attacks even when relevant technical and legal criteria are not clearly satisfied (i.e. potentially false positives). Both of these outcomes can create problematic impacts on international security.\nThe primary risk associated with false positives is the creation of escalatory spirals. Accusations, in particular when not accompanied by convincing technical data and when not made according to proper legal procedure, can damage diplomatic relations. The offense-dominant nature of the cyber domain (at least given the current state of technology) suggests strong potential for Rule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks 131 escalation in the event of a cyber attack; the perceived necessity of immediate reprisal also creates pressures militating toward hasty attribution. If the attribution is accompanied by self-help measures, the risk of tit-for-tat escalation and the emergence of a crisis atmosphere are increased. In crises, domestic audience costs have a critical effect on the willingness of parties to back down. Ironically, the Internet's expansion of low-cost communication and its increasing integration with critical infrastructure and other essential aspects of everyday life may act to increase the size of the domestic audience and the stakes of significant cyber attack disruptions in the eyes of that audience, thus ratcheting up the audience costs associated with conceding in a dispute concerning a publicly attributed cyber attack and making such crises especially prone to escalatory spirals. Societies with a high degree of Internet penetration may be most prone to escalate in the aftermath of a publicly attributed cyber attack. As global rates of Internet penetration increase, there is thus also a greater risk of conflict spirals.\nTwo caveats are in order. First, our argument does not rest in a strong sense on the past track record of offense-defense theory in explaining cases to which it has been applied. This is primarily because our argument is forward-looking; we are seeking to identify and anticipate potential problems in what is still a relatively new area of international politics. Second, and related, we want to be clear that we are advancing an explicitly probabilistic argument. We do not claim that all crises will escalate. Rather, we claim that false positives in cyber attribution make escalation more likely. This is the case because false accusations are likely to aggrieve falsely-accused parties, who will perceive the attack as unjust and thus be likely to respond in kind. It is also the case, as we have already argued, because of the domestic political difficulties leaders face in backing down once public accusations have been made. Other factors certainly also affect the propensity of particular crises to escalate; one of the most significant is the presence or absence of a past history of animosity between the parties.11 Nevertheless, our analytical focus here is on the dangers associated with factors related to patterns of cyber-attribution.\nWe have focused thus far on the dangers inherent both in the employment of cyber attacks (and conduct that may be mistaken for a cyber attack, such as some cybercrime and cyber espionage activities) and in the hasty attribution of cyber attacks. Less obviously, there is also a significant danger in widespread failure to attribute cyber attacks when technical and legal criteria have been satisfied. If cyber attacks are not criticized and no efforts are made to hold bad actors accountable, the establishment of permissive norms (and even\n\nMutual Security in the Asia-Pacific: Roles for Australia, Canada and South Korea\npermissive customary international law) is likely. Given the escalatory potential of cyber attacks, the prevalence of permissive norms could pose a significant international security risk. This risk entails, at maximum, the employment of cyber attacks to create kinetic damage and widespread disruption to critical infrastructure, as well as the potential escalation to more traditional interstate military conflict. While such outcomes are unlikely, they carry high costs. More modestly, permissive norms could lead to higher incidence of increasingly sophisticated cyber attacks resulting in degradation of Internet services and a loss of trust in the Internet as a means of commerce, communication and delivery of government services. Even this more optimistic scenario involves significant economic opportunity costs. The key point is that, due to its ability to forestall the development of permissive norms, criticism of socially undesirable behaviour is important in itself, (at least partially) independent of the ability to effectively enforce international rules (see Johnston 2001).\n# Rule Making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks\nGiven that both attribution and non-attribution of cyber attacks create significant international security risks, what is the appropriate policy response when cyber attacks occur? We argue that thoughtful international efforts at rulemaking to govern state conduct in the attribution of cyber attacks have the potential to steer a middle course, mitigating the risks associated with both widespread non-attribution and with hasty attribution. Such rules must govern when and how states publicly attribute cyber attacks and the consequences of attribution. Furthermore, these rules need to accomplish two parallel tasks: minimizing the need for attribution; but also enhancing capacity to respond when necessary. While the ex-ante specification of such rules is impossible due to the unpredictable nature of international negotiations, it is possible to sketch out some general design features of promising rule sets. The final section of this chapter briefly elaborates these features and addresses additional policy options for cooperation pertaining to the attribution of cyber attacks. In keeping with the goals of this volume, these policy options are presented in terms of opportunities for Canada, Korea and Australia; however, at least in this case, we believe that the options we present would travel relatively well and could in principle be adopted by other constructive powers either at the global level or in other regions.\nWith respect to the procedural mechanics of attribution, several desirable design features can be identified. First, attribution should be done on the basis of technical best practices for determining the point of origin for Internet traffic. Second, state and non-state actors seeking to attribute cyber attacks\nRule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks 133\nshould bear in mind the ease of concealment either by technical means or by the employment of arms-length proxy agents. Accordingly, attribution should be made only after attempts to engage appropriate authorities in the apparent country of origin. Where such authorities react cooperatively and in good faith, this should be prominently noted when attribution is made. Ideally, in such situations, joint statements of attribution could be made.\nThe creation and application of attribution standards and practices will require responsible global leadership. Political scientists and international relations scholars suggest that global norms are actively built by agents who have strong notions about appropriate or desirable behaviour in their community . Canada, Australia and Korea are well positioned to act cooperatively as global leaders developing norms for both the procedures and consequences of publicly attributing cyber attacks for the following reasons. All three countries can find common ground for the development of these norms through their shared dialogue on the importance of international trade for economic growth and domestic economic policies that reflect these views. Cyber attacks can have large impacts on a country's ability to fairly and effectively compete in global markets (for example, see Manyika et al. 2014; Centre for Strategic and International Studies 2013). Non-attribution of these kinds of cyber attacks could further encourage this behaviour, as states or other actors would face no consequences for their bad practices. However, hasty or aggressive public attribution could also affect a country's ability to gain from trade by affecting its ability to bargain in future trade negotiations. Accusations that are not supported by convincing technical data and not made according to proper legal procedure can damage diplomatic relations. Thus, states risk negative diplomatic consequences and losing gains from trade when both hasty public attribution and non-attribution are made. As advanced industrial democracies with digitally connected economies, Australia, Canada and Korea have particular interests in the health of the digital economy. They also share a basic commitment to the maintenance of a rules-based international order.\nIn deciding when and how to attribute cyber attacks, norms-guiding states, firms and other actors are of little use if the underlying technical and legal capacities for attribution remain weak. There is certainly much to be done in this area. However, there are good reasons to conclude that Canada, Australia and Korea can take the lead on enhancing the capacity to accurately attribute cyber attacks. All three countries possess digitally connected economies with significant pools of relevant human capital. Such steps complement and coincide with measures that can augment capacities to defend against (and repair damage resulting from) cyber attacks. We focus here on what we believe\nMutual Security in the Asia-Pacific: Roles for Australia, Canada and South Korea\nto be one of the most promising avenues for cooperation on capacity building: strengthening CERTs.¹²\nCERTs are independent networks of technical experts chartered to work with the Internet community in preventing, detecting and resolving computer security incidents. Currently, there are over 250 independent CERTs registered with the Forum for Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST) — an international network of CERTs that are committed to information exchange and cooperation on issues of mutual interest.¹³ Generally, the teams share a common organizational structure centred on facilitating communication among experts; acting as a point of contact for emergencies; maintaining research ties to improve security; and initiating proactive measures to increase awareness and understanding of computer security among a variety of stakeholders.¹⁴ However, the particular role of any given CERT is largely self-defined. For example, individual CERTs differ in their areas of focus (academic, private, national, regional or global), expertise (phishing, viruses, information security) and ability to effectively perform their mandates due to varying levels of funding and or technical expertise (Choucri, Madnick and Ferwerda 2013). To help gauge the diversity in CERTs operating around the world, Figure 1 (CERT Composition by Region) highlights the variety of CERTs operating under the authority of academic, technical, private and government institutions.¹⁵\nThere are a number of interesting insights that can be drawn from this figure. First, when comparing the total number of CERTs to the number of users within a given region, Europe, North America and Oceania have more CERTs available to users within the region. Africa, Asia, Latin America and to an extent Russia, all have similarly low levels of CERTs operating within the region compared to the number of users online. This shows that CERT creation and operation within particular regions is a non-linear function of income and that other factors, such as state function or institutions, play an important role. Secondly, the regional variance of the types of CERTs is interesting. Regions with a highly developed technical industry, such as Europe, the United States and Asia, generally have higher levels of private CERTs, whereas regions that have a limited technical industry tend to have less private CERTs and more government operated CERTs.\n¹² CERTs are also interchangeably referred to as Computer Incident Response Teams and Computer Security Incident Response Teams.\n¹³ A full list of CERTS registered with FIRST can be found at www.first.org/members/teams\n¹⁴ For more information on the overarching vision of CERTS, see the CERT Coordination Centre, www.cert.org\n¹⁵ This data was compiled from CERTs registered as members of FIRST.\nRule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks\nFigure 1: CERT Composition by Region\nSource: Data collected by Authors from the CERTs registered as members of FIRST.\nCERTs are established in an ad hoc manner and are often self-governed. Anyone can create a CERT, but to become a member of the global forum FIRST, CERTs must fill out a document called Request for Comment 2350, which outlines information such as the services a CERT will offer, who its constituents are and under what authority it operates. Private and academic CERTs often operate under the authority of its institution, such as business or university codes of conduct. In addition, CERTs must also adhere to national laws applicable in the jurisdictions where they operate. It is important to note that legal regimes can affect a CERTs ability to respond and resolve to particular cyber security incident. In Turkey, for example, which prohibits sending banking related information outside of its geographic boundaries, a CERT must operate within the constraints of its own technical knowledge and resources, leaving them unable to share information with third parties outside of the country's borders. As a result, Turkey's financial sector often receives a poor level of service (Best Practice Forum 2014).\nGiven that CERTs currently have varying degrees of ability, the three countries can support and facilitate shared learning and capacity building among CERTs in several ways. One possibility would involve a joint commitment to hosting and sponsoring FIRST annual conferences on a rotating basis, or to supporting FIRST global initiatives such as special interest groups and \"birds of a feather\"\nMutual Security in the Asia-Pacific: Roles for Australia, Canada and South Korea\nforums that exist to provide a forum where members can discuss topics of common interest to the community. This would improve CERT effectiveness and provide the CERT community with facilities that would create an environment for shared learning and cooperation. Given the importance of maintaining effective government computer networks to deliver key public goods, there is also a clear rationale for the provision of funding and technical assistance for these purposes to low-income countries. Such public goods include domestic services, but also encompass international goods such as effective law enforcement cooperation. There is also a case for project-based funding for CERTs in the non-profit sector and perhaps even in private industry. This funding could be provided on an opt-in basis as grant programs, allowing consideration to be given both to the quality of the applicant and its level of financial need. Such grant programs could start as small-scale pilots and could expand to involve public-private partnerships. Augmenting the number and capabilities of CERTs can improve the accuracy of attempts to attribute cyber attacks as well as the potential to quickly and effectively repair any resulting damage. Such capabilities would make hasty and inaccurate attributions less likely by providing more timely and more accurate information about the technical nature of cyber attacks, and would also reduce pressures to attribute cyber attacks by mitigating the costs they entail for victims (and thus the desire to retaliate).\nThere are also potential gains from enhanced coordination. CERTs have been created by a wide variety of actors (both public and private) and with different geographic scopes (domestic, regional, global). Many national CERTs coordinate with other CERTs in their respective regions. Regional CERTs could institutionalize the working relations of national and private sector teams. This could improve CERT-to-CERT cooperation, and as CERTs cooperate and build capacity within the region, the development of a coherent rule set for technical attribution beyond one nation's borders could be encouraged over time. In addition, the institutionalized working relationship between regional public and private CERTs could encourage cooperation across legal jurisdictions and state borders. This network could improve information sharing across a variety of regions and improve the digital forensic capabilities of governments and law enforcement agencies so that credible attribution can be made within a region.\nThe Asia Pacific Computer Emergency Response Team (APCERT) could play a leading role in helping CERTs in the Asia-Pacific cooperate and develop rules of best practice for attribution across the region. APCERT has 25 operational teams from 19 different states, including (but not limited to) Australia, India, China, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, New Zealand and Thailand.[16] APCERT already\n\nRule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks 137 plays an important role by creating and maintaining a mutually trusting network of computer security experts in the Asia-Pacific, which improves regional awareness of and competency in responding to computer incidents. However, only 19 regional countries are currently represented. APCERT’s membership could be expanded to include other Asia-Pacific economies, including Canada.\nGlobally, there is an opportunity for CERTs to contribute to rules of best practice for technical attribution. The Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST) is a global organization coordinating CERT responses to computer incidents. One such opportunity is the creation of ongoing dialogue around best practices, supported (financially and diplomatically) by engaged states such as Korea, Australia and Canada. Such efforts are distinct from general augmentation of CERT capacities in that they would focus specifically on engaging the CERT community in contributing to broader attempts to think creatively about best practices for attribution. States could also make especially valuable contributions to these efforts by arranging the participation of experts in the legal and political dimensions of attribution. While broadening dialogue can create problems arising from divergent preferences and from difficulties in coordinating large numbers of players, bringing together these distinct voices can ensure that attribution of cyber attacks is approached in a holistic fashion that includes actors with requisite legal and political expertise.\nCERT coordination could also be improved through policies and practices that promote the interoperability of laws around information sharing. Given that the disharmonization of national laws could limit or prevent CERTs from effectively resolving computer security incidents, when creating or updating national legislation policy makers should consider the effect a law can have on a CERT’s ability to cooperate internationally. It is important that policy makers consider legal interoperability as a matter of degree that can be achieved through a variety of means, such as harmonization, standardization, mutual recognition, reciprocity and cooperation. CERTs and policymakers should work together and create a shared dialogue that explores ways in which national laws can be implemented and utilized to further encourage CERT-CERT cooperation across national borders.\nGiven their technical expertise, it might seem like a natural fit to give regional and global CERTs official roles in investigating and making attributions for particular cyber attacks. While we do not rule out the viability of this option at least in some situations, we emphasize that there are reasons to be cautious in adopting such policies in the short-term. Directly involving CERTs in making attributions of cyber attacks risks politicizing their work and undermining the willingness of states and other actors to work with CERTs, especially at the Mutual Security in the Asia-Pacific: Roles for Australia, Canada and South Korea regional and global levels. This could have the perverse effect of reducing rather than increasing the quality of information available, as well as the additional perverse effect of inhibiting efforts to quickly and effectively mitigate the effect of cyber attacks. It might be more palatable instead to establish the expectation that states and other actors seek the input of relevant CERTs prior to making public attributions of cyber attacks. The role of CERTs in this respect would be restricted to the provision of publicly available information that could be verified by interested parties, and that therefore should be less susceptible to politicization. To further reduce this risk, it might also be desirable to establish the expectation that public attributions be made on the basis of concurring analysis from multiple CERTs, at least some of which do not have a real or apparent conflict of interest.¹⁷ While it may not be possible to eliminate incidents of political leaders shopping among CERTs for favourable analysis, establishing norms that expect multiple concurring analyses and that expect the underlying technical data to be made publicly available can increase the legitimacy costs associated with such behaviour.\nWhile there is a need for rule making both about the procedures and consequences of public attribution and for various kinds of capacity-building and coordination measures, there is also a need for a commitment to restraint when publicly attributing cyber attacks. The widespread consistent exercise of such restraint in the face of what are likely to be increasingly common and perhaps increasingly disruptive incidents will take political will and statesmanship. This is the final way in which we conclude that Canada, Korea and Australia can show leadership. They can do so with the goal of forging a shared vision of the need for restraint in attribution in light of recent events and emerging trends. Such a vision must be predicated on relevant norms from other areas of international law and the broader regime complex for cyber governance. A constructive discussion of the issues should begin with a shared understanding of what we have identified as the central dilemma in attributing cyber attacks: that careless attribution can be counter-productive and destabilizing, damaging important political, cultural and economic relationships; and that, on the other hand, lack of attribution can create a permissive environment in which cyber attacks are seen as low-cost and perhaps even as acceptable behaviour.\nNorms on cyber security and conflict are a global matter. However, given that cyber security issues are relatively new, multilateral institutions and other forms of international cooperation within this policy domain have not yet matured. The literature on constructive powers can be used to explain and describe ¹⁷ Such real or apparent conflicts of interest could arise from a CERT based in a state making the public attribution or having a financial relationship with the entity (state or otherwise) making the attribution.\nRule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks 139 how countries develop norms in these nascent policy spaces. Constructive powers can act as norm entrepreneurs in the development of global norms on cyber attacks and attribution. As Simon Palamar discusses in his contribution to this volume, one characteristic of constructive powers is their ability to shape the world in ways that explicitly take the preferences and interests of others into account. The development of norms on public attribution aligns with the preferences of other states given the political, economic and social consequences of both hasty and non-attribution. As constructive powers, Canada, Australia and Korea are well positioned to begin a productive dialogue — both domestically and in concert with each other — and to frame this critical conversation from its earliest stages, creating conditions for ongoing conversation and institutional learning.\nSuch norm-building processes are typically slow and non-linear in nature. This is especially true under conditions of uncertainty, for example the uncertainty associated with assessing the political and strategic implications of a disruptive new technology. Kenneth Abbott and Duncan Snidal have argued that in situations of uncertainty, soft law instruments are often superior choices to traditional hard law instruments such as treaties. Hard law is difficult to change once it is established: at the national level, governments must go through long processes to change or update domestic laws, and at the international level, difficulties reaching agreements are even more pronounced as diverse actors bargain to reach some form of consensus. Soft law, in contrast, facilitates learning about the implications of particular kinds of rules and governance arrangements over time, making it easier for countries to come to an agreement typically with lower sovereignty costs than the negotiation (and renegotiation) of hard law. A great deal of soft law is developed and implemented by transnational networks of legal and regulatory experts that perform “the hard work of international law.”¹⁸ This pattern of gradual norm-building via soft law instruments and transnational legal-regulatory networks is likely to hold with respect to the governance of attributing cyber attacks. Just as attempts to develop rules around the use of nuclear weapons was not a static process and required an extended period of learning, attempts to govern the cyber realm are likely to develop via various forms of soft law prior to hard, institutionalized and multilateral treaties. Joseph Nye draws this parallel and states that: “Governments learn slowly from knowledge, study and experience, and learning occurs internationally when new knowledge gradually redefines the content of national interests and leads to new policies. For example, the United ¹⁸ On transnational regulatory networks, see Verdier (2009 113-172). The phrase “the hard work of international law” is taken from Brunnée and Toope (2010).\nMutual Security in the Asia-Pacific: Roles for Australia, Canada and South Korea States and the Soviet Union took decades to learn how to adapt and respond to the prior revolution in military affairs — nuclear technology after 1945\". There are reasons to expect that such learning and norm development will be even more difficult in the cyber case than it was in the nuclear era; for example, barriers to entry are far lower in the cyber case, and these capabilities have already proliferated far beyond the very small group of exclusively state actors that possess nuclear weapons. Creating shared knowledge among a much larger, and much more organizationally heterogeneous, number of players is likely to be extremely difficult.\nNotwithstanding these difficulties, a conscious effort to build and clarify norms for state behaviour in cyberspace is already underway. The United Nations Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) recently concluded that the current law of armed conflict applies online and that response to cyber attacks should be conducted within the framework of customary international law. The assessment of the GGE represents a start for international rule-making on cyber attacks rather than a conclusion, as agreeing on specific interpretations for applying general international legal rules to particular cases will require a great deal of work. However, it suggests that cyber attacks should be conducted only in self-defence or in accordance with authorization of collective action under the UN Charter. It further suggests that cyber attacks must distinguish between military and civilian targets and must accord with rules of proportionality. Finally, it suggests the importance of treating response to cyber attacks under the legal framework of state responsibility. Doing so establishes limits on justifiable self-help measures that states may take in response to an attributed cyber attack. Encouraging adherence to these limits can minimize the escalatory potential for cyber attacks.\nFurther developing the international legal and political frameworks governing response to cyber attacks will require sustained engagement with additional legal questions, prominent among which are questions of attribution. Indeed, determining whether a particular attack is attributable to a specific state (or states) is in many ways a logically prior question to assessing whether the attack was legally justifiable under international law and, if not, what countermeasures may be taken by which parties. The Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare provides a crucial legal resource for addressing these matters (see Schmitt 2013, 29-41). However, as we have argued, these are no more purely legal questions than they are purely technical ones.\nEnsuring the success of international efforts to build responsible norms for state conduct in cyberspace will require patient, careful work over a long period of time. Canada, Korea and Australia have the required resources (including positive Rule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks 141 international reputations) to play leading roles in this work both at the regional and global levels. As digitally connected economies, they also have clear interests in a positive outcome. In the nuclear era, such learning processes involved the creation of forums and study groups bringing together policy makers, military leaders and academics. Much of this activity took place at the national level, and it is likely that governments will engage on similar crash-course-learning programs as cyber issues become more prominent in contemporary international politics. However, given the greater reach and density of transnational networks among policy makers, there may be scope for international analogues to these processes. Transnational learning processes may (at least initially) take place at less official levels and involve more prominent roles for academics and other non-state actors, but may nevertheless play an important role in encouraging the improvement and dissemination of best practices for attributing cyber attacks and for ensuring responsible state conduct in cyberspace more generally. Providing resources to facilitate such processes is an inexpensive proposition with potentially large benefits and could be a priority for cooperation in both the short and long term."

In the North, the affected websites included those of the main Communist Party newspaper and the official Korean Central News Agency. In the South, the website for the presidential office and another government agency were rendered temporarily inaccessible. Given the tenor of political relations on the Korean peninsula, speculation centred on the possibility of involvement by state actors or their proxies. However, determining who was responsible for these cyber intrusions was complicated by several facts. First, a number of individuals purporting to belong to the\"hacktivist\"network Anonymous had indicated on Twitter that they would undertake offensive cyber operations against the North on the war's anniversary. Second, Twitter users also\"claimed responsibility for the attacks in South Korea, saying they demanded that the South's government stop censoring Internet content\"(ibid.). Given the relative ease of compromising authentication for social media accounts and the difficulty of independently establishing the source of origin for data transmitted over the Internet, it is difficult to regard such claims of responsibility as dispositive.¹ Problems in attributing the cyber attacks related to the anniversary of the Korean War expose a deeper, and more nuanced problem. The challenge is that attributing cyber intrusions back to a government sponsor is not simply a factual or technical challenge. Rather, it is a multifaceted problem that has technical, legal and political dimensions, all of which must be satisfied for the attribution of a cyber attack to a particular state to be appropriate. The additional complexity here, as with most things cyber, is that the rules governing conduct in each of these categories are still evolving. However, the complexity of the task should not mask its importance. The increasing importance of the Internet to daily life can be expected over time to amplify the stakes involved in large-scale, persistent disruptions of access. Further, technology already allows the creation of kinetic effects by means of malicious code; such capabilities are highly likely to become more widely available in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, there is real potential for escalation from cyber attacks to more traditional forms of violent conflict. New rules, norms and institutional structures are needed that can ameliorate the possibility of misattribution and the attendant consequences that would flow from it, and that can act as circuit-breakers inhibiting escalatory spirals even where attribution is properly made.\nIn order to advance this broad claim, the paper will proceed in the following fashion. The first section will highlight the technical aspects of attributing a cyber intrusion to a particular actor or set of actors. The second section will discuss the legal rules governing state responsibility and the attribution of acts to state actors. The third section will discuss the international political dimensions involved in determining whether or not to publicly attribute a particular cyber act to a given state. Finally, the paper concludes by arguing clearer rules are needed to avert the possible negative consequences of misattribution and that an impartial international institutional cooperative mechanism is needed to facilitate the development of a meaningful rule-based framework for state conduct related to attribution for cyber attacks. As constructive powers, Canada, Australia and Korea are well positioned to play a leading role in the development of global norms for both the procedures and consequences of publicly attributing cyber attacks by enhancing capacity to respond to cyber attacks through the augmentation of Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) and by crafting norms of restraint that demonstrate the political, economic and cultural consequences of both hasty and non-attribution.\nRule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks 127 # The Technical Dimension of Attribution Technical attribution of cyber attacks is primarily a matter of employing computer forensics to determine the physical point(s) of origin for a particular computer network operation and to locate circumstantial evidence embedded in malicious code that provides information about the likely identity of its author(s), such as languages employed or particular cultural points of reference. For a small number of governments, these means can be augmented with additional intelligence sources and methods.\nThe expertise necessary for such attribution efforts is, again with the exception of a growing number of wealthy governments, in the hands of private companies. Large computer network operators, technology companies and computer security firms possess increasingly sophisticated technical means to attribute cyber attacks.2 The emergence of private actors with intelligence capabilities that to some extent rival and exceed those of states is a new development; while non-state actors are not new in international relations, it is novel for such actors to enjoy resource and expertise advantages in a core area of state policy intimately connected to the state's monopoly on the use of legitimate violence. The involvement of corporate actors in the attribution of cyber attacks is also likely to prove controversial. Specifically, it is not clear whether states will generally accept the judgment of such companies — in particular when the company is headquartered in the same state making the public attribution of the attack.\nLeaving problems of credibility aside, there are also clear limits to technical attribution, in particular when principals employ arms-length agents (potentially located in other states) and/or transnational botnets in the conduct of cyber attacks. Given the utility of such gambits in frustrating attempts at attribution and the low cost of employing them, these practices are likely to spread. Even when location of origin can be conclusively identified, this is not necessarily a dispositive indication of responsibility either under narrow legal standards or more expansive political ones.\n\n---\n\n## # Rule Making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks\n\nGiven that both attribution and non-attribution of cyber attacks create significant international security risks, what is the appropriate policy response when cyber attacks occur? We argue that thoughtful international efforts at rulemaking to govern state conduct in the attribution of cyber attacks have the potential to steer a middle course, mitigating the risks associated with both widespread non-attribution and with hasty attribution. Such rules must govern when and how states publicly attribute cyber attacks and the consequences of attribution. Furthermore, these rules need to accomplish two parallel tasks: minimizing the need for attribution; but also enhancing capacity to respond when necessary. While the ex-ante specification of such rules is impossible due to the unpredictable nature of international negotiations, it is possible to sketch out some general design features of promising rule sets. The final section of this chapter briefly elaborates these features and addresses additional policy options for cooperation pertaining to the attribution of cyber attacks. In keeping with the goals of this volume, these policy options are presented in terms of opportunities for Canada, Korea and Australia; however, at least in this case, we believe that the options we present would travel relatively well and could in principle be adopted by other constructive powers either at the global level or in other regions.\nWith respect to the procedural mechanics of attribution, several desirable design features can be identified. First, attribution should be done on the basis of technical best practices for determining the point of origin for Internet traffic. Second, state and non-state actors seeking to attribute cyber attacks\nRule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks 133\nshould bear in mind the ease of concealment either by technical means or by the employment of arms-length proxy agents. Accordingly, attribution should be made only after attempts to engage appropriate authorities in the apparent country of origin. Where such authorities react cooperatively and in good faith, this should be prominently noted when attribution is made. Ideally, in such situations, joint statements of attribution could be made.\nThe creation and application of attribution standards and practices will require responsible global leadership. Political scientists and international relations scholars suggest that global norms are actively built by agents who have strong notions about appropriate or desirable behaviour in their community .

They also share a basic commitment to the maintenance of a rules-based international order.\nIn deciding when and how to attribute cyber attacks, norms-guiding states, firms and other actors are of little use if the underlying technical and legal capacities for attribution remain weak.

All three countries possess digitally connected economies with significant pools of relevant human capital. Such steps complement and coincide with measures that can augment capacities to defend against (and repair damage resulting from) cyber attacks. We focus here on what we believe\nMutual Security in the Asia-Pacific: Roles for Australia, Canada and South Korea\nto be one of the most promising avenues for cooperation on capacity building: strengthening CERTs.¹²\nCERTs are independent networks of technical experts chartered to work with the Internet community in preventing, detecting and resolving computer security incidents. Currently, there are over 250 independent CERTs registered with the Forum for Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST) — an international network of CERTs that are committed to information exchange and cooperation on issues of mutual interest.¹³ Generally, the teams share a common organizational structure centred on facilitating communication among experts; acting as a point of contact for emergencies; maintaining research ties to improve security; and initiating proactive measures to increase awareness and understanding of computer security among a variety of stakeholders.¹⁴ However, the particular role of any given CERT is largely self-defined. For example, individual CERTs differ in their areas of focus (academic, private, national, regional or global), expertise (phishing, viruses, information security) and ability to effectively perform their mandates due to varying levels of funding and or technical expertise (Choucri, Madnick and Ferwerda 2013). To help gauge the diversity in CERTs operating around the world, Figure 1 (CERT Composition by Region) highlights the variety of CERTs operating under the authority of academic, technical, private and government institutions.¹⁵\nThere are a number of interesting insights that can be drawn from this figure. First, when comparing the total number of CERTs to the number of users within a given region, Europe, North America and Oceania have more CERTs available to users within the region.

As a result, Turkey's financial sector often receives a poor level of service (Best Practice Forum 2014).\nGiven that CERTs currently have varying degrees of ability, the three countries can support and facilitate shared learning and capacity building among CERTs in several ways. One possibility would involve a joint commitment to hosting and sponsoring FIRST annual conferences on a rotating basis, or to supporting FIRST global initiatives such as special interest groups and \"birds of a feather\"\nMutual Security in the Asia-Pacific: Roles for Australia, Canada and South Korea\nforums that exist to provide a forum where members can discuss topics of common interest to the community. This would improve CERT effectiveness and provide the CERT community with facilities that would create an environment for shared learning and cooperation. Given the importance of maintaining effective government computer networks to deliver key public goods, there is also a clear rationale for the provision of funding and technical assistance for these purposes to low-income countries. Such public goods include domestic services, but also encompass international goods such as effective law enforcement cooperation. There is also a case for project-based funding for CERTs in the non-profit sector and perhaps even in private industry. This funding could be provided on an opt-in basis as grant programs, allowing consideration to be given both to the quality of the applicant and its level of financial need. Such grant programs could start as small-scale pilots and could expand to involve public-private partnerships. Augmenting the number and capabilities of CERTs can improve the accuracy of attempts to attribute cyber attacks as well as the potential to quickly and effectively repair any resulting damage. Such capabilities would make hasty and inaccurate attributions less likely by providing more timely and more accurate information about the technical nature of cyber attacks, and would also reduce pressures to attribute cyber attacks by mitigating the costs they entail for victims (and thus the desire to retaliate).\nThere are also potential gains from enhanced coordination. CERTs have been created by a wide variety of actors (both public and private) and with different geographic scopes (domestic, regional, global). Many national CERTs coordinate with other CERTs in their respective regions. Regional CERTs could institutionalize the working relations of national and private sector teams. This could improve CERT-to-CERT cooperation, and as CERTs cooperate and build capacity within the region, the development of a coherent rule set for technical attribution beyond one nation's borders could be encouraged over time. In addition, the institutionalized working relationship between regional public and private CERTs could encourage cooperation across legal jurisdictions and state borders. This network could improve information sharing across a variety of regions and improve the digital forensic capabilities of governments and law enforcement agencies so that credible attribution can be made within a region.\nThe Asia Pacific Computer Emergency Response Team (APCERT) could play a leading role in helping CERTs in the Asia-Pacific cooperate and develop rules of best practice for attribution across the region. APCERT has 25 operational teams from 19 different states, including (but not limited to) Australia, India, China, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, New Zealand and Thailand.[16] APCERT already\nRule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks 137 plays an important role by creating and maintaining a mutually trusting network of computer security experts in the Asia-Pacific, which improves regional awareness of and competency in responding to computer incidents. However, only 19 regional countries are currently represented. APCERT’s membership could be expanded to include other Asia-Pacific economies, including Canada.\nGlobally, there is an opportunity for CERTs to contribute to rules of best practice for technical attribution. The Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST) is a global organization coordinating CERT responses to computer incidents. One such opportunity is the creation of ongoing dialogue around best practices, supported (financially and diplomatically) by engaged states such as Korea, Australia and Canada. Such efforts are distinct from general augmentation of CERT capacities in that they would focus specifically on engaging the CERT community in contributing to broader attempts to think creatively about best practices for attribution. States could also make especially valuable contributions to these efforts by arranging the participation of experts in the legal and political dimensions of attribution. While broadening dialogue can create problems arising from divergent preferences and from difficulties in coordinating large numbers of players, bringing together these distinct voices can ensure that attribution of cyber attacks is approached in a holistic fashion that includes actors with requisite legal and political expertise.\nCERT coordination could also be improved through policies and practices that promote the interoperability of laws around information sharing. Given that the disharmonization of national laws could limit or prevent CERTs from effectively resolving computer security incidents, when creating or updating national legislation policy makers should consider the effect a law can have on a CERT’s ability to cooperate internationally. It is important that policy makers consider legal interoperability as a matter of degree that can be achieved through a variety of means, such as harmonization, standardization, mutual recognition, reciprocity and cooperation. CERTs and policymakers should work together and create a shared dialogue that explores ways in which national laws can be implemented and utilized to further encourage CERT-CERT cooperation across national borders.\nGiven their technical expertise, it might seem like a natural fit to give regional and global CERTs official roles in investigating and making attributions for particular cyber attacks. While we do not rule out the viability of this option at least in some situations, we emphasize that there are reasons to be cautious in adopting such policies in the short-term. Directly involving CERTs in making attributions of cyber attacks risks politicizing their work and undermining the willingness of states and other actors to work with CERTs, especially at the Mutual Security in the Asia-Pacific: Roles for Australia, Canada and South Korea regional and global levels. This could have the perverse effect of reducing rather than increasing the quality of information available, as well as the additional perverse effect of inhibiting efforts to quickly and effectively mitigate the effect of cyber attacks. It might be more palatable instead to establish the expectation that states and other actors seek the input of relevant CERTs prior to making public attributions of cyber attacks. The role of CERTs in this respect would be restricted to the provision of publicly available information that could be verified by interested parties, and that therefore should be less susceptible to politicization. To further reduce this risk, it might also be desirable to establish the expectation that public attributions be made on the basis of concurring analysis from multiple CERTs, at least some of which do not have a real or apparent conflict of interest.¹⁷ While it may not be possible to eliminate incidents of political leaders shopping among CERTs for favourable analysis, establishing norms that expect multiple concurring analyses and that expect the underlying technical data to be made publicly available can increase the legitimacy costs associated with such behaviour.\nWhile there is a need for rule making both about the procedures and consequences of public attribution and for various kinds of capacity-building and coordination measures, there is also a need for a commitment to restraint when publicly attributing cyber attacks. The widespread consistent exercise of such restraint in the face of what are likely to be increasingly common and perhaps increasingly disruptive incidents will take political will and statesmanship. This is the final way in which we conclude that Canada, Korea and Australia can show leadership. They can do so with the goal of forging a shared vision of the need for restraint in attribution in light of recent events and emerging trends. Such a vision must be predicated on relevant norms from other areas of international law and the broader regime complex for cyber governance. A constructive discussion of the issues should begin with a shared understanding of what we have identified as the central dilemma in attributing cyber attacks: that careless attribution can be counter-productive and destabilizing, damaging important political, cultural and economic relationships; and that, on the other hand, lack of attribution can create a permissive environment in which cyber attacks are seen as low-cost and perhaps even as acceptable behaviour.\nNorms on cyber security and conflict are a global matter. However, given that cyber security issues are relatively new, multilateral institutions and other forms of international cooperation within this policy domain have not yet matured. The literature on constructive powers can be used to explain and describe ¹⁷ Such real or apparent conflicts of interest could arise from a CERT based in a state making the public attribution or having a financial relationship with the entity (state or otherwise) making the attribution.\nRule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks 139 how countries develop norms in these nascent policy spaces. Constructive powers can act as norm entrepreneurs in the development of global norms on cyber attacks and attribution. As Simon Palamar discusses in his contribution to this volume, one characteristic of constructive powers is their ability to shape the world in ways that explicitly take the preferences and interests of others into account. The development of norms on public attribution aligns with the preferences of other states given the political, economic and social consequences of both hasty and non-attribution. As constructive powers, Canada, Australia and Korea are well positioned to begin a productive dialogue — both domestically and in concert with each other — and to frame this critical conversation from its earliest stages, creating conditions for ongoing conversation and institutional learning.\nSuch norm-building processes are typically slow and non-linear in nature. This is especially true under conditions of uncertainty, for example the uncertainty associated with assessing the political and strategic implications of a disruptive new technology. Kenneth Abbott and Duncan Snidal have argued that in situations of uncertainty, soft law instruments are often superior choices to traditional hard law instruments such as treaties. Hard law is difficult to change once it is established: at the national level, governments must go through long processes to change or update domestic laws, and at the international level, difficulties reaching agreements are even more pronounced as diverse actors bargain to reach some form of consensus. Soft law, in contrast, facilitates learning about the implications of particular kinds of rules and governance arrangements over time, making it easier for countries to come to an agreement typically with lower sovereignty costs than the negotiation (and renegotiation) of hard law. A great deal of soft law is developed and implemented by transnational networks of legal and regulatory experts that perform “the hard work of international law.”¹⁸ This pattern of gradual norm-building via soft law instruments and transnational legal-regulatory networks is likely to hold with respect to the governance of attributing cyber attacks. Just as attempts to develop rules around the use of nuclear weapons was not a static process and required an extended period of learning, attempts to govern the cyber realm are likely to develop via various forms of soft law prior to hard, institutionalized and multilateral treaties. Joseph Nye draws this parallel and states that: “Governments learn slowly from knowledge, study and experience, and learning occurs internationally when new knowledge gradually redefines the content of national interests and leads to new policies. For example, the United ¹⁸ On transnational regulatory networks, see Verdier (2009 113-172). The phrase “the hard work of international law” is taken from Brunnée and Toope (2010).\nMutual Security in the Asia-Pacific: Roles for Australia, Canada and South Korea States and the Soviet Union took decades to learn how to adapt and respond to the prior revolution in military affairs — nuclear technology after 1945\". There are reasons to expect that such learning and norm development will be even more difficult in the cyber case than it was in the nuclear era; for example, barriers to entry are far lower in the cyber case, and these capabilities have already proliferated far beyond the very small group of exclusively state actors that possess nuclear weapons. Creating shared knowledge among a much larger, and much more organizationally heterogeneous, number of players is likely to be extremely difficult.\nNotwithstanding these difficulties, a conscious effort to build and clarify norms for state behaviour in cyberspace is already underway. The United Nations Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) recently concluded that the current law of armed conflict applies online and that response to cyber attacks should be conducted within the framework of customary international law. The assessment of the GGE represents a start for international rule-making on cyber attacks rather than a conclusion, as agreeing on specific interpretations for applying general international legal rules to particular cases will require a great deal of work. However, it suggests that cyber attacks should be conducted only in self-defence or in accordance with authorization of collective action under the UN Charter. It further suggests that cyber attacks must distinguish between military and civilian targets and must accord with rules of proportionality. Finally, it suggests the importance of treating response to cyber attacks under the legal framework of state responsibility. Doing so establishes limits on justifiable self-help measures that states may take in response to an attributed cyber attack. Encouraging adherence to these limits can minimize the escalatory potential for cyber attacks.\nFurther developing the international legal and political frameworks governing response to cyber attacks will require sustained engagement with additional legal questions, prominent among which are questions of attribution. Indeed, determining whether a particular attack is attributable to a specific state (or states) is in many ways a logically prior question to assessing whether the attack was legally justifiable under international law and, if not, what countermeasures may be taken by which parties. The Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare provides a crucial legal resource for addressing these matters (see Schmitt 2013, 29-41). However, as we have argued, these are no more purely legal questions than they are purely technical ones.\nEnsuring the success of international efforts to build responsible norms for state conduct in cyberspace will require patient, careful work over a long period of time. Canada, Korea and Australia have the required resources (including positive Rule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks 141 international reputations) to play leading roles in this work both at the regional and global levels. As digitally connected economies, they also have clear interests in a positive outcome. In the nuclear era, such learning processes involved the creation of forums and study groups bringing together policy makers, military leaders and academics. Much of this activity took place at the national level, and it is likely that governments will engage on similar crash-course-learning programs as cyber issues become more prominent in contemporary international politics. However, given the greater reach and density of transnational networks among policy makers, there may be scope for international analogues to these processes. Transnational learning processes may (at least initially) take place at less official levels and involve more prominent roles for academics and other non-state actors, but may nevertheless play an important role in encouraging the improvement and dissemination of best practices for attributing cyber attacks and for ensuring responsible state conduct in cyberspace more generally. Providing resources to facilitate such processes is an inexpensive proposition with potentially large benefits and could be a priority for cooperation in both the short and long term.",

    "7\n\n# Rule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks\n\nSamantha Bradshaw, Mark Raymond and Aaron Shull\n\n# Introduction\n\nIn June of 2014, on the sixty-third anniversary of the start of the Korean War, the New York Times reported that offensive cyber operations had been initiated against various websites in both Korean countries (Sang-Hung 2013). In the North, the affected websites included those of the main Communist Party newspaper and the official Korean Central News Agency. In the South, the website for the presidential office and another government agency were rendered temporarily inaccessible. Given the tenor of political relations on the Korean peninsula, speculation centred on the possibility of involvement by state actors or their proxies. However, determining who was responsible for these cyber intrusions was complicated by several facts. First, a number of individuals purporting to belong to the \"hacktivist\" network Anonymous had indicated on Twitter that they would undertake offensive cyber operations against the North on the war's anniversary. Second, Twitter users also \"claimed responsibility for the attacks in South Korea, saying they demanded that the South's government stop censoring Internet content\" (ibid.). Given the relative ease of compromising authentication for social media accounts and the difficulty of independently establishing the source of origin for data transmitted over the Internet, it is difficult to regard such claims of responsibility as dispositive.¹\n\n1. For more on the difficulties of attributing cyber attacks and on cyber strategy in general, see Nye (2011, 18-38).\n\n125",
    "Mutual Security in the Asia-Pacific: Roles for Australia, Canada and South Korea\n\nProblems in attributing the cyber attacks related to the anniversary of the Korean War expose a deeper, and more nuanced problem. The challenge is that attributing cyber intrusions back to a government sponsor is not simply a factual or technical challenge. Rather, it is a multifaceted problem that has technical, legal and political dimensions, all of which must be satisfied for the attribution of a cyber attack to a particular state to be appropriate. The additional complexity here, as with most things cyber, is that the rules governing conduct in each of these categories are still evolving. However, the complexity of the task should not mask its importance. The increasing importance of the Internet to daily life can be expected over time to amplify the stakes involved in large-scale, persistent disruptions of access. Further, technology already allows the creation of kinetic effects by means of malicious code; such capabilities are highly likely to become more widely available in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, there is real potential for escalation from cyber attacks to more traditional forms of violent conflict. New rules, norms and institutional structures are needed that can ameliorate the possibility of misattribution and the attendant consequences that would flow from it, and that can act as circuit-breakers inhibiting escalatory spirals even where attribution is properly made.\n\nIn order to advance this broad claim, the paper will proceed in the following fashion. The first section will highlight the technical aspects of attributing a cyber intrusion to a particular actor or set of actors. The second section will discuss the legal rules governing state responsibility and the attribution of acts to state actors. The third section will discuss the international political dimensions involved in determining whether or not to publicly attribute a particular cyber act to a given state. Finally, the paper concludes by arguing clearer rules are needed to avert the possible negative consequences of misattribution and that an impartial international institutional cooperative mechanism is needed to facilitate the development of a meaningful rule-based framework for state conduct related to attribution for cyber attacks. As constructive powers, Canada, Australia and Korea are well positioned to play a leading role in the development of global norms for both the procedures and consequences of publicly attributing cyber attacks by enhancing capacity to respond to cyber attacks through the augmentation of Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) and by crafting norms of restraint that demonstrate the political, economic and cultural consequences of both hasty and non-attribution.",
    "Rule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks 127\n\n# The Technical Dimension of Attribution\n\nTechnical attribution of cyber attacks is primarily a matter of employing computer forensics to determine the physical point(s) of origin for a particular computer network operation and to locate circumstantial evidence embedded in malicious code that provides information about the likely identity of its author(s), such as languages employed or particular cultural points of reference. For a small number of governments, these means can be augmented with additional intelligence sources and methods.\n\nThe expertise necessary for such attribution efforts is, again with the exception of a growing number of wealthy governments, in the hands of private companies. Large computer network operators, technology companies and computer security firms possess increasingly sophisticated technical means to attribute cyber attacks.2 The emergence of private actors with intelligence capabilities that to some extent rival and exceed those of states is a new development; while non-state actors are not new in international relations, it is novel for such actors to enjoy resource and expertise advantages in a core area of state policy intimately connected to the state's monopoly on the use of legitimate violence. The involvement of corporate actors in the attribution of cyber attacks is also likely to prove controversial. Specifically, it is not clear whether states will generally accept the judgment of such companies — in particular when the company is headquartered in the same state making the public attribution of the attack.\n\nLeaving problems of credibility aside, there are also clear limits to technical attribution, in particular when principals employ arms-length agents (potentially located in other states) and/or transnational botnets in the conduct of cyber attacks. Given the utility of such gambits in frustrating attempts at attribution and the low cost of employing them, these practices are likely to spread. Even when location of origin can be conclusively identified, this is not necessarily a dispositive indication of responsibility either under narrow legal standards or more expansive political ones.\n\n# The International Legal Dimension of Attribution\n\nAssuming that cyber attacks constitute internationally wrongful acts, and assuming that the technical/factual indications provide sufficient evidence that the attack in question has a state connection, then invariably the relevant\n\n2 For one recent example, see Mandiant “APT1: Exposing One of China’s Cyber Espionage Units.” http://intelreport.mandiant.com/.",
    "Mutual Security in the Asia-Pacific: Roles for Australia, Canada and South Korea\n\ninternational legal rules to apply will be the ones governing state responsibility. In short, state responsibility is a fundamental rule governing international relations which holds that if a state commits an internationally wrongful act that is attributable to the state, and the act constitutes a breach of an international obligation, then that state will owe a duty to make reparations for the breach.³ The relevant question then becomes: what activities are attributable to a state? Unfortunately, the answer is not entirely clear.\n\nLegal attribution is straightforward when the act in question is committed by an organ of the state. In these cases, the law will presume that the act committed by the organ is the act of the state itself. Suppose for example that a cyber attack was directed by a division of the military or the state intelligence services; this would \"according to a well-established rule of international law [...] be regarded as an act of that state.\"⁴ Determining responsibility becomes more complex, however, when dealing with entities that are more loosely affiliated with the state. For example, non-state actors who launch cyber attacks or engage in hacktivist activities may have varying degrees of state connection. Some may act with no official connection to the state, such as the infamous hacktivist group Anonymous, which operates with neither \"the steady income nor the fiscal sponsorship\" to support its activities and which often adopts an antagonistic tone toward state authority (Coleman 2014, 70). Other cyber attacks by non-state actors, in contrast, might be tolerated or even sponsored by the state to act in their interests. Analysts believe this was the case in 2007, when Russian hackers were sponsored by the state to unleash a massive cyber attack against the Estonian government and financial institutions over the relocation of a statue in the Estonian capital (Traynor 2007). Similarly, a group of hackers calling itself the Syrian Electronic Army claims to act on behalf of the Assad government (Boothby et al., 2012).\n\nComplexity in attributing cyber attacks is also a function of competing and inconsistent legal rules. The Draft Articles of the International Law Commission, which potentially reflect customary law,⁵ state that the conduct of an entity will be considered an act of a State under international law if that entity \"is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control\n\n3 Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, 2001, at Article 2, http://untreaty.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/draft%20articles/9_6_2001.pdf; See also Chorzów Factory, PCIJ, Series A, No. 17, 1928, p. 29; Malcolm N.

    "Rule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks 129\n\nof, that State in carrying out the conduct.”⁶ Thus, under this standard if a state directed a citizen hacker team to carry out a cyber attack, then those acts would be legally attributable back to that state. However, two international courts have weighed in on what the applicable standard should be when considering the attribution of certain acts to states, and in so doing, they have muddied the analytical waters.\n\nIn the *Nicaragua* case, the International Court of Justice was asked to decide whether the acts of the Contras — a rebel group engaged in a conflict with the Nicaraguan government — were attributable to the Government of the United States. In determining whether the relationship between the two was sufficiently close to allow for attribution, the Court held that “to be legally responsible, it would have to be proved that that State had *effective control* of the operations in the course of which the alleged violations were committed.”⁷ Thus, in order to be found responsible for particular cyber intrusions, under the *Nicaragua* standard it must be shown that the state in question had direct control over that very intrusion. In other words, “general overall control would have been insufficient to ground responsibility.”⁸ Rather, according to the jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice a more exacting standard applies.⁹\n\nHowever, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia sees the status of international law on this issue quite differently. In the *Tadić* case, the Tribunal found that a demonstration of *overall control* could be sufficient for a finding of state responsibility. In this way, the Tribunal incorporated a less stringent test under the rules of international law, noting, “the degree of control might vary according to the circumstances and a high threshold might not always be required.”¹⁰ As a consequence, the international community is left with a somewhat fragmented set of legal rules to apply to cyber attacks, when trying to attribute those acts back to state actors. Does one need to show that the cyber attacker was acting on the instructions of the state or that the state had effective control of the impugned operation? Or, is it appropriate to apply some lower threshold for the attribution of acts in cyber space? Should states, for example, be required to take reasonable steps to prevent attacks that originate from their\n\n6 Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, 2001, at Article 8, http://un- treaty.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/draft%20articles/9_6_2001.pdf.\n\n7 Case Concerning the Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

    "Mutual Security in the Asia-Pacific: Roles for Australia, Canada and South Korea\n\nterritory? And if they fail to do so, should that provide a sufficient basis for a finding of responsibility? Or, should there be a more exacting standard in which states are called to account only when there is dispositive proof that an organ of the state committed or directed the attack?\n\nUltimately, the applicable rules remain somewhat unclear. However, what is clear is that the increasing centrality of cyber operations in the conduct of international relations is going put pressure on the existing set of rules and those rules will — no doubt — evolve in relation to that pressure. Thus, what is required at this point is some forward looking policy making aimed at developing a set of rules that accounts not only for where the subject technology is now, but where it is going to be in the future.\n\n## Political Dimensions of Attribution\n\nTechnical and legal aspects of attributing cyber attacks are, respectively, questions of evidentiary sufficiency — whether it is possible to determine the source of the attack to a degree of confidence that can withstand appropriate scrutiny — and appropriate procedure. These dimensions of attribution intersect in a complex fashion with a third, political, dimension. The key characteristic of the political dimension of attribution is publicity; a politically attributed attack, for the purposes of this paper, entails a public accusation. One example of such an attribution is the American indictment of five members of the Chinese Peoples' Liberation Army on charges of stealing intellectual property from several American firms (Schmidt and Sanger 2014).\n\nThis political dimension of attribution engages calculations of interest both by state and (increasingly) non-state actors, as well as less understood dynamics of choice driven by emotion and by justice motives (see Welch 1993; Raymond and Welch 2013). As a result of these considerations, it is possible that attacks which can be reliably attributed from technical and legal perspectives will not be publicly (politically) attributed (i.e. dogs that don't bark). It is also possible that political pressures may lead to the public attribution of cyber attacks even when relevant technical and legal criteria are not clearly satisfied (i.e. potentially false positives). Both of these outcomes can create problematic impacts on international security.\n\nThe primary risk associated with false positives is the creation of escalatory spirals. Accusations, in particular when not accompanied by convincing technical data and when not made according to proper legal procedure, can damage diplomatic relations. The offense-dominant nature of the cyber domain (at least given the current state of technology) suggests strong potential for",
    "Rule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks 131\n\nescalation in the event of a cyber attack; the perceived necessity of immediate reprisal also creates pressures militating toward hasty attribution (Nye 2011). If the attribution is accompanied by self-help measures, the risk of tit-for-tat escalation and the emergence of a crisis atmosphere are increased. In crises, domestic audience costs have a critical effect on the willingness of parties to back down (Fearon 1994). Ironically, the Internet's expansion of low-cost communication and its increasing integration with critical infrastructure and other essential aspects of everyday life may act to increase the size of the domestic audience and the stakes of significant cyber attack disruptions in the eyes of that audience, thus ratcheting up the audience costs associated with conceding in a dispute concerning a publicly attributed cyber attack and making such crises especially prone to escalatory spirals. Societies with a high degree of Internet penetration may be most prone to escalate in the aftermath of a publicly attributed cyber attack. As global rates of Internet penetration increase, there is thus also a greater risk of conflict spirals.\n\nTwo caveats are in order. First, our argument does not rest in a strong sense on the past track record of offense-defense theory in explaining cases to which it has been applied. This is primarily because our argument is forward-looking; we are seeking to identify and anticipate potential problems in what is still a relatively new area of international politics. Second, and related, we want to be clear that we are advancing an explicitly probabilistic argument. We do not claim that all crises will escalate. Rather, we claim that false positives in cyber attribution make escalation more likely. This is the case because false accusations are likely to aggrieve falsely-accused parties, who will perceive the attack as unjust and thus be likely to respond in kind (Welch 1993). It is also the case, as we have already argued, because of the domestic political difficulties leaders face in backing down once public accusations have been made. Other factors certainly also affect the propensity of particular crises to escalate; one of the most significant is the presence or absence of a past history of animosity between the parties.11 Nevertheless, our analytical focus here is on the dangers associated with factors related to patterns of cyber-attribution.\n\nWe have focused thus far on the dangers inherent both in the employment of cyber attacks (and conduct that may be mistaken for a cyber attack, such as some cybercrime and cyber espionage activities) and in the hasty attribution of cyber attacks. Less obviously, there is also a significant danger in widespread failure to attribute cyber attacks when technical and legal criteria have been satisfied. If cyber attacks are not criticized and no efforts are made to hold bad actors accountable, the establishment of permissive norms (and even\n\n11 We thank Simon Palamar for making this point.",
    "Mutual Security in the Asia-Pacific: Roles for Australia, Canada and South Korea\n\npermissive customary international law) is likely. Given the escalatory potential of cyber attacks, the prevalence of permissive norms could pose a significant international security risk. This risk entails, at maximum, the employment of cyber attacks to create kinetic damage and widespread disruption to critical infrastructure, as well as the potential escalation to more traditional interstate military conflict. While such outcomes are unlikely, they carry high costs. More modestly, permissive norms could lead to higher incidence of increasingly sophisticated cyber attacks resulting in degradation of Internet services and a loss of trust in the Internet as a means of commerce, communication and delivery of government services. Even this more optimistic scenario involves significant economic opportunity costs. The key point is that, due to its ability to forestall the development of permissive norms, criticism of socially undesirable behaviour is important in itself, (at least partially) independent of the ability to effectively enforce international rules (see Johnston 2001).\n\n# Rule Making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks\n\nGiven that both attribution and non-attribution of cyber attacks create significant international security risks, what is the appropriate policy response when cyber attacks occur? We argue that thoughtful international efforts at rulemaking to govern state conduct in the attribution of cyber attacks have the potential to steer a middle course, mitigating the risks associated with both widespread non-attribution and with hasty attribution. Such rules must govern when and how states publicly attribute cyber attacks and the consequences of attribution. Furthermore, these rules need to accomplish two parallel tasks: minimizing the need for attribution; but also enhancing capacity to respond when necessary. While the ex-ante specification of such rules is impossible due to the unpredictable nature of international negotiations, it is possible to sketch out some general design features of promising rule sets. The final section of this chapter briefly elaborates these features and addresses additional policy options for cooperation pertaining to the attribution of cyber attacks. In keeping with the goals of this volume, these policy options are presented in terms of opportunities for Canada, Korea and Australia; however, at least in this case, we believe that the options we present would travel relatively well and could in principle be adopted by other constructive powers either at the global level or in other regions.\n\nWith respect to the procedural mechanics of attribution, several desirable design features can be identified. First, attribution should be done on the basis of technical best practices for determining the point of origin for Internet traffic. Second, state and non-state actors seeking to attribute cyber attacks",
    "Rule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks 133\n\nshould bear in mind the ease of concealment either by technical means or by the employment of arms-length proxy agents. Accordingly, attribution should be made only after attempts to engage appropriate authorities in the apparent country of origin. Where such authorities react cooperatively and in good faith, this should be prominently noted when attribution is made. Ideally, in such situations, joint statements of attribution could be made.\n\nThe creation and application of attribution standards and practices will require responsible global leadership. Political scientists and international relations scholars suggest that global norms are actively built by agents who have strong notions about appropriate or desirable behaviour in their community (Finnemore and Sikkink 1998). Canada, Australia and Korea are well positioned to act cooperatively as global leaders developing norms for both the procedures and consequences of publicly attributing cyber attacks for the following reasons. All three countries can find common ground for the development of these norms through their shared dialogue on the importance of international trade for economic growth and domestic economic policies that reflect these views. Cyber attacks can have large impacts on a country's ability to fairly and effectively compete in global markets (for example, see Manyika et al. 2014; Centre for Strategic and International Studies 2013). Non-attribution of these kinds of cyber attacks could further encourage this behaviour, as states or other actors would face no consequences for their bad practices. However, hasty or aggressive public attribution could also affect a country's ability to gain from trade by affecting its ability to bargain in future trade negotiations. Accusations that are not supported by convincing technical data and not made according to proper legal procedure can damage diplomatic relations. Thus, states risk negative diplomatic consequences and losing gains from trade when both hasty public attribution and non-attribution are made. As advanced industrial democracies with digitally connected economies, Australia, Canada and Korea have particular interests in the health of the digital economy. They also share a basic commitment to the maintenance of a rules-based international order.\n\nIn deciding when and how to attribute cyber attacks, norms-guiding states, firms and other actors are of little use if the underlying technical and legal capacities for attribution remain weak. There is certainly much to be done in this area. However, there are good reasons to conclude that Canada, Australia and Korea can take the lead on enhancing the capacity to accurately attribute cyber attacks. All three countries possess digitally connected economies with significant pools of relevant human capital. Such steps complement and coincide with measures that can augment capacities to defend against (and repair damage resulting from) cyber attacks. We focus here on what we believe",
    "Mutual Security in the Asia-Pacific: Roles for Australia, Canada and South Korea\n\nto be one of the most promising avenues for cooperation on capacity building: strengthening CERTs.¹²\n\nCERTs are independent networks of technical experts chartered to work with the Internet community in preventing, detecting and resolving computer security incidents. Currently, there are over 250 independent CERTs registered with the Forum for Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST) — an international network of CERTs that are committed to information exchange and cooperation on issues of mutual interest.¹³ Generally, the teams share a common organizational structure centred on facilitating communication among experts; acting as a point of contact for emergencies; maintaining research ties to improve security; and initiating proactive measures to increase awareness and understanding of computer security among a variety of stakeholders.¹⁴ However, the particular role of any given CERT is largely self-defined. For example, individual CERTs differ in their areas of focus (academic, private, national, regional or global), expertise (phishing, viruses, information security) and ability to effectively perform their mandates due to varying levels of funding and or technical expertise (Choucri, Madnick and Ferwerda 2013). To help gauge the diversity in CERTs operating around the world, Figure 1 (CERT Composition by Region) highlights the variety of CERTs operating under the authority of academic, technical, private and government institutions.¹⁵\n\nThere are a number of interesting insights that can be drawn from this figure. First, when comparing the total number of CERTs to the number of users within a given region, Europe, North America and Oceania have more CERTs available to users within the region. Africa, Asia, Latin America and to an extent Russia, all have similarly low levels of CERTs operating within the region compared to the number of users online. This shows that CERT creation and operation within particular regions is a non-linear function of income and that other factors, such as state function or institutions, play an important role. Secondly, the regional variance of the types of CERTs is interesting. Regions with a highly developed technical industry, such as Europe, the United States and Asia, generally have higher levels of private CERTs, whereas regions that have a limited technical industry tend to have less private CERTs and more government operated CERTs.\n\n¹² CERTs are also interchangeably referred to as Computer Incident Response Teams and Computer Security Incident Response Teams.\n\n¹³ A full list of CERTS registered with FIRST can be found at www.first.org/members/teams\n\n¹⁴ For more information on the overarching vision of CERTS, see the CERT Coordination Centre, www.cert.org\n\n¹⁵ This data was compiled from CERTs registered as members of FIRST.",
    "Rule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks\n\nFigure 1: CERT Composition by Region\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\nSource: Data collected by Authors from the CERTs registered as members of FIRST.\n\nCERTs are established in an ad hoc manner and are often self-governed. Anyone can create a CERT, but to become a member of the global forum FIRST, CERTs must fill out a document called Request for Comment 2350, which outlines information such as the services a CERT will offer, who its constituents are and under what authority it operates. Private and academic CERTs often operate under the authority of its institution, such as business or university codes of conduct. In addition, CERTs must also adhere to national laws applicable in the jurisdictions where they operate. It is important to note that legal regimes can affect a CERTs ability to respond and resolve to particular cyber security incident. In Turkey, for example, which prohibits sending banking related information outside of its geographic boundaries, a CERT must operate within the constraints of its own technical knowledge and resources, leaving them unable to share information with third parties outside of the country's borders. As a result, Turkey's financial sector often receives a poor level of service (Best Practice Forum 2014).\n\nGiven that CERTs currently have varying degrees of ability, the three countries can support and facilitate shared learning and capacity building among CERTs in several ways. One possibility would involve a joint commitment to hosting and sponsoring FIRST annual conferences on a rotating basis, or to supporting FIRST global initiatives such as special interest groups and \"birds of a feather\"",
    "Mutual Security in the Asia-Pacific: Roles for Australia, Canada and South Korea\n\nforums that exist to provide a forum where members can discuss topics of common interest to the community. This would improve CERT effectiveness and provide the CERT community with facilities that would create an environment for shared learning and cooperation. Given the importance of maintaining effective government computer networks to deliver key public goods, there is also a clear rationale for the provision of funding and technical assistance for these purposes to low-income countries. Such public goods include domestic services, but also encompass international goods such as effective law enforcement cooperation. There is also a case for project-based funding for CERTs in the non-profit sector and perhaps even in private industry. This funding could be provided on an opt-in basis as grant programs, allowing consideration to be given both to the quality of the applicant and its level of financial need. Such grant programs could start as small-scale pilots and could expand to involve public-private partnerships. Augmenting the number and capabilities of CERTs can improve the accuracy of attempts to attribute cyber attacks as well as the potential to quickly and effectively repair any resulting damage. Such capabilities would make hasty and inaccurate attributions less likely by providing more timely and more accurate information about the technical nature of cyber attacks, and would also reduce pressures to attribute cyber attacks by mitigating the costs they entail for victims (and thus the desire to retaliate).\n\nThere are also potential gains from enhanced coordination. CERTs have been created by a wide variety of actors (both public and private) and with different geographic scopes (domestic, regional, global). Many national CERTs coordinate with other CERTs in their respective regions. Regional CERTs could institutionalize the working relations of national and private sector teams. This could improve CERT-to-CERT cooperation, and as CERTs cooperate and build capacity within the region, the development of a coherent rule set for technical attribution beyond one nation's borders could be encouraged over time. In addition, the institutionalized working relationship between regional public and private CERTs could encourage cooperation across legal jurisdictions and state borders. This network could improve information sharing across a variety of regions and improve the digital forensic capabilities of governments and law enforcement agencies so that credible attribution can be made within a region.\n\nThe Asia Pacific Computer Emergency Response Team (APCERT) could play a leading role in helping CERTs in the Asia-Pacific cooperate and develop rules of best practice for attribution across the region. APCERT has 25 operational teams from 19 different states, including (but not limited to) Australia, India, China, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, New Zealand and Thailand.[16] APCERT already\n\n16 For a complete list of APCERT membership see www.apcert.org/about/structure/members.html",
    "Rule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks 137\n\nplays an important role by creating and maintaining a mutually trusting network of computer security experts in the Asia-Pacific, which improves regional awareness of and competency in responding to computer incidents. However, only 19 regional countries are currently represented. APCERT’s membership could be expanded to include other Asia-Pacific economies, including Canada.\n\nGlobally, there is an opportunity for CERTs to contribute to rules of best practice for technical attribution. The Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST) is a global organization coordinating CERT responses to computer incidents. One such opportunity is the creation of ongoing dialogue around best practices, supported (financially and diplomatically) by engaged states such as Korea, Australia and Canada. Such efforts are distinct from general augmentation of CERT capacities in that they would focus specifically on engaging the CERT community in contributing to broader attempts to think creatively about best practices for attribution. States could also make especially valuable contributions to these efforts by arranging the participation of experts in the legal and political dimensions of attribution. While broadening dialogue can create problems arising from divergent preferences and from difficulties in coordinating large numbers of players, bringing together these distinct voices can ensure that attribution of cyber attacks is approached in a holistic fashion that includes actors with requisite legal and political expertise.\n\nCERT coordination could also be improved through policies and practices that promote the interoperability of laws around information sharing. Given that the disharmonization of national laws could limit or prevent CERTs from effectively resolving computer security incidents, when creating or updating national legislation policy makers should consider the effect a law can have on a CERT’s ability to cooperate internationally. It is important that policy makers consider legal interoperability as a matter of degree that can be achieved through a variety of means, such as harmonization, standardization, mutual recognition, reciprocity and cooperation (Weber 2014). CERTs and policymakers should work together and create a shared dialogue that explores ways in which national laws can be implemented and utilized to further encourage CERT-CERT cooperation across national borders.\n\nGiven their technical expertise, it might seem like a natural fit to give regional and global CERTs official roles in investigating and making attributions for particular cyber attacks. While we do not rule out the viability of this option at least in some situations, we emphasize that there are reasons to be cautious in adopting such policies in the short-term. Directly involving CERTs in making attributions of cyber attacks risks politicizing their work and undermining the willingness of states and other actors to work with CERTs, especially at the",
    "Mutual Security in the Asia-Pacific: Roles for Australia, Canada and South Korea\n\nregional and global levels. This could have the perverse effect of reducing rather than increasing the quality of information available, as well as the additional perverse effect of inhibiting efforts to quickly and effectively mitigate the effect of cyber attacks. It might be more palatable instead to establish the expectation that states and other actors seek the input of relevant CERTs prior to making public attributions of cyber attacks. The role of CERTs in this respect would be restricted to the provision of publicly available information that could be verified by interested parties, and that therefore should be less susceptible to politicization. To further reduce this risk, it might also be desirable to establish the expectation that public attributions be made on the basis of concurring analysis from multiple CERTs, at least some of which do not have a real or apparent conflict of interest.¹⁷ While it may not be possible to eliminate incidents of political leaders shopping among CERTs for favourable analysis, establishing norms that expect multiple concurring analyses and that expect the underlying technical data to be made publicly available can increase the legitimacy costs associated with such behaviour.\n\nWhile there is a need for rule making both about the procedures and consequences of public attribution and for various kinds of capacity-building and coordination measures, there is also a need for a commitment to restraint when publicly attributing cyber attacks. The widespread consistent exercise of such restraint in the face of what are likely to be increasingly common and perhaps increasingly disruptive incidents will take political will and statesmanship. This is the final way in which we conclude that Canada, Korea and Australia can show leadership. They can do so with the goal of forging a shared vision of the need for restraint in attribution in light of recent events and emerging trends. Such a vision must be predicated on relevant norms from other areas of international law and the broader regime complex for cyber governance (Nye 2014). A constructive discussion of the issues should begin with a shared understanding of what we have identified as the central dilemma in attributing cyber attacks: that careless attribution can be counter-productive and destabilizing, damaging important political, cultural and economic relationships; and that, on the other hand, lack of attribution can create a permissive environment in which cyber attacks are seen as low-cost and perhaps even as acceptable behaviour.\n\nNorms on cyber security and conflict are a global matter. However, given that cyber security issues are relatively new, multilateral institutions and other forms of international cooperation within this policy domain have not yet matured. The literature on constructive powers can be used to explain and describe\n\n¹⁷ Such real or apparent conflicts of interest could arise from a CERT based in a state making the public attribution or having a financial relationship with the entity (state or otherwise) making the attribution.",
    "Rule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks 139\n\nhow countries develop norms in these nascent policy spaces (Hampson and Heinbecker 2011). Constructive powers can act as norm entrepreneurs in the development of global norms on cyber attacks and attribution. As Simon Palamar discusses in his contribution to this volume, one characteristic of constructive powers is their ability to shape the world in ways that explicitly take the preferences and interests of others into account. The development of norms on public attribution aligns with the preferences of other states given the political, economic and social consequences of both hasty and non-attribution. As constructive powers, Canada, Australia and Korea are well positioned to begin a productive dialogue — both domestically and in concert with each other — and to frame this critical conversation from its earliest stages, creating conditions for ongoing conversation and institutional learning.\n\nSuch norm-building processes are typically slow and non-linear in nature. This is especially true under conditions of uncertainty, for example the uncertainty associated with assessing the political and strategic implications of a disruptive new technology. Kenneth Abbott and Duncan Snidal have argued that in situations of uncertainty, soft law instruments are often superior choices to traditional hard law instruments such as treaties (Abbott and Snidal 2000). Hard law is difficult to change once it is established: at the national level, governments must go through long processes to change or update domestic laws, and at the international level, difficulties reaching agreements are even more pronounced as diverse actors bargain to reach some form of consensus. Soft law, in contrast, facilitates learning about the implications of particular kinds of rules and governance arrangements over time, making it easier for countries to come to an agreement typically with lower sovereignty costs than the negotiation (and renegotiation) of hard law. A great deal of soft law is developed and implemented by transnational networks of legal and regulatory experts that perform “the hard work of international law.”¹⁸\n\nThis pattern of gradual norm-building via soft law instruments and transnational legal-regulatory networks is likely to hold with respect to the governance of attributing cyber attacks. Just as attempts to develop rules around the use of nuclear weapons was not a static process and required an extended period of learning (Freedman 1981; Tannenwald 2007), attempts to govern the cyber realm are likely to develop via various forms of soft law prior to hard, institutionalized and multilateral treaties. Joseph Nye draws this parallel and states that: “Governments learn slowly from knowledge, study and experience, and learning occurs internationally when new knowledge gradually redefines the content of national interests and leads to new policies. For example, the United\n\n¹⁸ On transnational regulatory networks, see Verdier (2009 113-172). The phrase “the hard work of international law” is taken from Brunnée and Toope (2010).",
    "Mutual Security in the Asia-Pacific: Roles for Australia, Canada and South Korea\n\nStates and the Soviet Union took decades to learn how to adapt and respond to the prior revolution in military affairs — nuclear technology after 1945\" (Nye 2011, 19). There are reasons to expect that such learning and norm development will be even more difficult in the cyber case than it was in the nuclear era; for example, barriers to entry are far lower in the cyber case, and these capabilities have already proliferated far beyond the very small group of exclusively state actors that possess nuclear weapons. Creating shared knowledge among a much larger, and much more organizationally heterogeneous, number of players is likely to be extremely difficult.\n\nNotwithstanding these difficulties, a conscious effort to build and clarify norms for state behaviour in cyberspace is already underway. The United Nations Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) recently concluded that the current law of armed conflict applies online and that response to cyber attacks should be conducted within the framework of customary international law. The assessment of the GGE represents a start for international rule-making on cyber attacks rather than a conclusion, as agreeing on specific interpretations for applying general international legal rules to particular cases will require a great deal of work. However, it suggests that cyber attacks should be conducted only in self-defence or in accordance with authorization of collective action under the UN Charter. It further suggests that cyber attacks must distinguish between military and civilian targets and must accord with rules of proportionality. Finally, it suggests the importance of treating response to cyber attacks under the legal framework of state responsibility. Doing so establishes limits on justifiable self-help measures that states may take in response to an attributed cyber attack. Encouraging adherence to these limits can minimize the escalatory potential for cyber attacks.\n\nFurther developing the international legal and political frameworks governing response to cyber attacks will require sustained engagement with additional legal questions, prominent among which are questions of attribution. Indeed, determining whether a particular attack is attributable to a specific state (or states) is in many ways a logically prior question to assessing whether the attack was legally justifiable under international law and, if not, what countermeasures may be taken by which parties. The Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare provides a crucial legal resource for addressing these matters (see Schmitt 2013, 29-41). However, as we have argued, these are no more purely legal questions than they are purely technical ones.\n\nEnsuring the success of international efforts to build responsible norms for state conduct in cyberspace will require patient, careful work over a long period of time. Canada, Korea and Australia have the required resources (including positive",
    "Rule-making for State Conduct in the Attribution of Cyber Attacks 141\n\ninternational reputations) to play leading roles in this work both at the regional and global levels. As digitally connected economies, they also have clear interests in a positive outcome. In the nuclear era, such learning processes involved the creation of forums and study groups bringing together policy makers, military leaders and academics. Much of this activity took place at the national level, and it is likely that governments will engage on similar crash-course-learning programs as cyber issues become more prominent in contemporary international politics. However, given the greater reach and density of transnational networks among policy makers, there may be scope for international analogues to these processes. Transnational learning processes may (at least initially) take place at less official levels and involve more prominent roles for academics and other non-state actors, but may nevertheless play an important role in encouraging the improvement and dissemination of best practices for attributing cyber attacks and for ensuring responsible state conduct in cyberspace more generally. Providing resources to facilitate such processes is an inexpensive proposition with potentially large benefits and could be a priority for cooperation in both the short and long term.\n\n## Works Cited\n\nAbbott, Kenneth and Duncan Snidal. 2000. \"Hard and Soft Law in International Governance.\" International Organization 54 (3): 421–56.\n\nBest Practice Forum. 2014.
