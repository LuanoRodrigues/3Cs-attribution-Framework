They represent domains the use of which is indispensable to the entire or at least a substantial part of the global population. At the same time, as this author understands it, they are not identical in meaning as a matter of computer science terminology. The Internet is a ‘global network connecting millions of computers’; it is ‘decentralized by design’, subject to ownership or control (unlike ‘online services’) by no single (or a plurality of) person or entity.¹ The Internet has a physical dimension because of the interconnection of different computer systems, their accessibility and the transmission of information to and from such systems by using the standard Internet Protocol (IP).² Cyberspace, however, is a more abstract term; it is a non-physical domain created by computer systems that allows people to communicate with each other, to exchange or to gather information. Moreover, it refers to the ‘notional environment in which digitized information is communicated over computer networks’.³ Be this as it may, it appears that there exists a tendency to treat these two terms as synonyms and use them interchangeably. To give an example, the US Government Cyber Policy Review 2009 defines cyberspace as ‘the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, and includes the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers in critical industries. Common usage of the term also refers to the virtual environment of information and interactions between people’.⁴ It appears therefore, that apart from identity in terms, these two concepts have a dual role: they refer to the domain as well as to the medium of conducting certain activities. Furthermore, it would be an understatement to say that the Internet is important to private individuals, corporations and States: the US Government has stated that cyberspace / the Internet underlines every aspect of modern society and it is both the\n¹ Vangie Beal, ‘Internet’ (Webopedia) <http: Internet.html=\"\" term=\"\" www.webopedia.com=\"\"> accessed on 1 November 2013.\n² Bill Young, ‘Navigating Cyberspace: Introduction to Cyberspace’ (9 January 2013) University of Texas <http: cs329e=\"\" slides1-introduction.pdf=\"\" www.cs.utexas.edu=\"\" ~byoung=\"\"> accessed on 4 November 2013.\n³ US Department of Defense, ‘Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms’ JP 1–02 (12 April 2001, as amended through 31 August 2005) 139.\n⁴ The White House, ‘Cyberspace Policy Review: Assuring a trusted and resilient information and communications infrastructure’ (2009) <http: assets=\"\" documents=\"\" cyberspace_policy_review_final.pdf=\"\" www.whitehouse.gov=\"\"> 1, accessed on 4 November 2013.\nNicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389\nDownloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM\nvia University of Tasmania</http:></http:></http:>\nResearch handbook on international law and cyberspace\ndomain where and the medium by which economic, public safety, civil society and national security activities are pursued.⁵\nWhile the usefulness of the Internet is universally acknowledged, the same is the case with regard to its misuse or hostile use, in the form of cyber-crime and espionage.⁶ In particular, as nowadays private business and governments conduct most of their functions and activities in cyberspace, safety and resilience are matters to be preserved. In the words of the US Cyber Policy Review 2009 ‘to realize the full benefits of digital revolution, users must have confidence that sensitive information is secure, commerce is not compromised and the infrastructure is not infiltrated. Nation-states also need confidence that the networks that support their national security and economic prosperity are safe and resilient. ...’⁷ It is, therefore, not inconceivable that the Internet may be used in such a way as to cause harm to States or as to compel them to act in a particular manner. There have been three episodes in State practice that have revealed how the hostile use of the Internet may affect the orderly function of basic services in a State or threaten its security. In 2007 Estonia was the object of massive and coordinated computer hacking attacks that paralyzed its economy and the functioning of government services for weeks. In 2008 Georgia was the target of similar attacks during the conflict with the Russian Federation with respect to South Ossetia. Also, in 2009 a computer virus by the name of Stuxnet caused the progress of the nuclear program of Iran to suffer significant delay.⁸ In this context the question arises whether such use of the Internet may give rise to State responsibility. The answer must be in the affirmative provided that a specific use of the Internet amounts to an ‘internationally wrongful act’.⁹ As the Internet is an international domain, then States must conduct themselves over this domain in accordance with international law¹⁰ and therefore the use of cyberspace is subject to international law. As Harold Koh, the former Legal Advisor of the US State Department has remarked ‘international law principles do apply in cyberspace. ...’¹¹ However, there are substantive challenges facing the law on international responsibility as it exists in contemporary international law by the particularities of cyberspace since this body of rules is premised heavily on attribution of acts of individuals to a State. Be as it may, the present author submits, that the application of this area of international law to cyberspace is not impossible, mainly as a result of establishing responsibility on the basis of the breach of the obligation of due diligence on the part of States, which dispenses with the difficulty of attributing acts of individuals to a State, while even attribution may in certain cases be established.

AN OUTLINE OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF STATE RESPONSIBILITY\nState responsibility appears to have emerged as a branch of international law by way of private law analogy.¹³ As the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ) ruled in Factory at Chorzów (Indemnities) ‘it is a principle of international law, and even a general conception of law, that any breach of an engagement involves an obligation to make reparation’.¹⁴ However, subsequent judicial pronouncements and the work of the International Law Commission (ILC) form a departure from legal analogies with the domestic law of tort in favour of reconstructing the responsibility as a matter of international public law arising when, an act: (1) is attributable to a State; and (2) constitutes a breach of an international obligation. In US Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran the International Court (ICJ) stated that it had to ‘determine how far, legally, the acts in question may be regarded as imputable to the Iranian State’ and whether they were compatible or not ‘with the obligations of Iran under treaties in force or under any other rules of international law that may be applicable’.¹⁵ Moreover, in Bosnian Genocide the ICJ ruled with regard to the breach of the Genocide Convention that ‘the obligations in question … and the responsibilities of States that would arise from breach of such obligations are obligations and responsibilities under international law. They are not of a criminal nature’.¹⁶\nThe contemporary law of State responsibility has as its principal source of reference the Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARS)\n¹² Ibid.

However, since 2001 it has been so extensively cited by international courts and tribunals, as well as in State practice, that it is considered as an authoritative statement of the customary international law on State responsibility.¹⁸ The legal regime introduced by ARS is premised on the distinction introduced by ILC Rapporteur Roberto Ago between ‘primary obligations’ and ‘secondary rules’. The very first paragraph of the Introduction of the Commentaries to ARS states that:\nThe emphasis is on the secondary rules of State responsibility, that is to say, the general conditions under international law for the State to be considered responsible for wrongful actions or omissions, and the legal consequences which flow therefrom. The articles do not attempt to define the content of the international obligations breach of which gives rise to responsibility.¹⁹\nA second basic feature of ARS is that it views responsibility of States not as an exclusive pattern of bilateral relations between the wrongdoing and injured State. By contrast, State responsibility is given a public order dimension by laying emphasis on the existence of an internationally wrongful act²⁰ and not upon the damage or injury caused and the existence of a causal link between the damage and the breach of obligation. Thus, the Commentary to Article 1 ARS states that:\n[T]he term ‘international responsibility’ ... covers the relations which arise under international law from the internationally wrongful act of a State, whether such relations are limited to the wrongdoing State and one injured State or whether they extend also to other States or indeed to other subjects of international law, and whether they are centred on obligations of restitution or compensation or also give the injured State the possibility of responding by way of counter-measures.²¹\nMoreover, this dimension of State responsibility is further supported by Articles 40 and 48 ARS dealing, respectively, with serious breaches of obligations arising under a peremptory norm of international law and the invocation of the responsibility of a State by States other than the injured party.\nAs the emphasis in ARS lies in the wrongful act, central position is given to its requirements, namely, attribution to a State and breach of an international obligation (Art. 2 ARS). Attribution means ‘the operation of attaching a given act or omission to a State’²² and to this end the ARS relies on the identity of natural persons and their\n¹⁷ [2001] Yearbook of the ILC, vol.

As the Commentary to Article 2 ARS makes absolutely clear the fact is that States act through human beings or groups; therefore, the issue of attribution is reduced to identifying the persons or groups that should be considered to act on behalf of the State.²³ This finding appears to rest on a dual basis that is disjunctively applied: either the identity of a person or group as such or the control exercised by a State over the activities of a person or a group. In a nutshell, the ARS, for the purposes of attribution, are centred on the individual. Thus, the responsibility of a State is engaged for acts or omissions by the following categories of individuals:\n(a) De jure State agents or organs, irrespective of their hierarchical position in the apparatus of the State or the constitutional structure or organization of the State (namely, whether it is a unitary or federal State) (Art.4 ARS);\n(b) De facto State organs, namely, non-State actors or entities that have been 'elevated' to de facto State agents or organs because they are under the absolute dependence and control of a State. In Bosnian Genocide the issue before the ICJ was whether the atrocities perpetrated by the Bosnian Serbs in Srebrenica in July 1995, which as the Court ruled amounted to commission of genocide under the 1948 Genocide Convention, could be attributed to Serbia. The Court ruled that:\n[t]his question has in fact two aspects, which the Court must consider separately. First, it should be ascertained whether the acts committed in Srebrenica were perpetrated by organs of the Respondent [namely, Serbia], i.e., by persons or entities whose conduct is necessarily attributable to it, because they are in fact instruments of its action. Next, if the preceding question is answered in the negative, it should be ascertained whether the acts in question were committed by persons who, while not organs of the Respondent, did nevertheless act on the instruments of, or under the direction or control of, the Respondent.²⁴\nThe Court then proceeded to identify de facto States organs as;\npersons, groups of persons or entities [that], may for purposes of international responsibility, be equated with State organs even if that status does not follow from internal law, provided that in fact the persons, groups or entities act in 'complete dependence' on the State of which they are ultimately the instrument ...²⁵;\n(c) Delegation of Government Authority. In this contingency the conduct of a non-State actor (i.e. 'a person or entity which is not the organ of the State') is to be considered as an act of the State if the non-State actor 'is empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of governmental authority' and it 'is acting in that capacity in the particular instance' (Art. 5 ARS);\n(d) The situation where an organ of a State is placed at the disposal of another State. The acts or omissions of this organ in the exercise of government authority on behalf of the State at the disposal of which it has been placed give rise to this State's responsibility (Art. 6 ARS);\n²³ Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (n 19) 35.\n²⁴ Case Concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (n 16) (Merits) 201.\n²⁵ Ibid. 205 [emphasis added].\nNicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389\nDownloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM\nvia University of Tasmania\nResearch handbook on international law and cyberspace\n(e) Ultra Vires Acts. A State organ or entity gives rise to the responsibility of the State even when acting in this capacity it exceeds its authority or against instructions (Art.7 ARS);\n(f) Instructions, Direction and Control of a State over acts of private persons. In the jurisprudence of the ICJ this control must be ‘effective control’ in order to give rise to the responsibility of the State. The Court reached this finding in Nicaragua where it ruled that the US assistance to the contras and its general control over them were not sufficient in default of further evidence to attribute their acts violating human rights and humanitarian law to the US government. By contrast ‘[f]or this conduct to give rise to legal responsibility of the United States, it would in principle have to be proved that that State had effective control of the military and paramilitary operations in the course of which the alleged violations were committed.’ 26 Moreover, in Bosnian Genocide the Court, having found that the Bosnian Serbs did not constitute a de facto organ of Serbia, proceeded to determine whether Serbia exercised effective control over them. The Court explained that the:\ntest thus formulated differs in two respects from the test ... to determine whether a person or entity may be equated with a State organ even if not having that status under internal law. First, in this context it is not necessary to show that the persons who performed the acts alleged to have violated international law were in general in a relationship of ‘complete dependence’ on the respondent State; it has to be proved that they acted in accordance with the State’s instructions or under its ‘effective control’. It must however be shown that this ‘effective control’ was exercised, or that the State’s instructions were given, in respect of each operation in which the alleged violations occurred, not generally in respect of the overall actions taken by the persons or groups of persons having committed the violations.27\nIn this respect, the Court declined to uphold the ruling of the ICTY Appeals Chamber in the Tadić case where the ad hoc Tribunal applied the test of ‘overall control’ that dispenses with the need to evaluate control of a State over each specific operation of a non-State actor;28 the Court took the view that the determination of State responsibility on the part of Serbia did not constitute an indispensable finding to determine individual criminal responsibility by an international criminal tribunal29 (Art. 8 ARS);\n(g) Exercise of elements of government authority in the absence of or inadequate function of State authorities and in circumstances that warrant the exercise of this authority.

The Tribunal reasoned that even though these functions were not authorized by the Iranian government they objectively consisted in the exercise of elements of governmental authority in the absence of official authorities of the State ‘in operations of which the new Government must have had knowledge and to which it did not specifically object.’³⁰ (Art. 9 ARS);\n(h) The ARS provides in particular that acts or omissions by an insurrectional or other movement are attributed to a State in the event the insurrection is successful and the movement become the government of the State (Art. 10 ARS);\n(i) Approval and Adoption by a State of acts of private persons or entities. In US Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran the Court ruled that the act of overrunning of the US Embassy in Tehran by demonstrators and the seizure as hostages of the US diplomatic staff could not be as such attributed to the Iranian Government because the demonstrators were neither State organs nor did they carry out a specific government act on behalf of the State³¹. However, the responsibility of Iran for the acts of the demonstrators was established at a later stage when the Iranian government approved of and adopted the occupation of the Embassy premises and the captivity of the US diplomatic staff as its own³² (Art.11 ARS).\nThe second requirement of State responsibility, namely a breach of an international obligation, may consist in a physical act or omission and may emanate from a rule of either customary law or treaty (Art. 12 ARS) that introduces an obligation in force for the particular State (Art.13 ARS). Moreover, the responsibility of a State may arise whether the act is or is not of a continuing character (Arts 14 and 15 ARS) or it constitutes part of a composite activity. Furthermore, State responsibility arises with respect to acts of other States. This is not to say that acts of other States are attributed to another State for, as the ILC has made clear, the ARS is premised on the principle that ‘each State is responsible for its own wrongful conduct … attributable to it … which is in breach of an international obligation of that State …’ and that ‘responsibility is specific to the State concerned’.³³ Even though in this respect the ILC identifies contingencies of ‘collaborative conduct’³⁴ it does not appear to introduce a particular legal framework of ‘shared responsibility’ for the collaborative element appears to be viewed simply as a factual rather than a normative parameter.³⁵ This is further corroborated by Article 47(1) ARS on the invocation of State responsibility for an\n³⁰ [1987] 17 Iran–US Claims Tribunal Rep.

Having said this, the responsibility of a State for the acts of another State arises on the basis of conduct of the former State in relation to the latter that consists in aid or assistance, direction and control and coercion (of the latter State). In each of these contingencies there must be two requirements cumulatively: first, the conduct must be internationally wrongful if it was committed by the other State and, secondly, the aiding/controlling/coercing State must have knowledge of the circumstances of the internationally wrongful act (Arts 16–18 ARS). Finally, the ILC ARS provide for grounds precluding the wrongfulness of an act that *prima facie* constitutes a breach of an international obligation; these are: consent (Art. 20); self-defence (Art. 21); countermeasures (Arts 22, 49–54); *force majeure* (Art. 23); distress (Art. 24); and necessity (Art. 25).\n# 3. ATTRIBUTION IN CYBERSPACE\nCyberspace as a domain and the use of electronic devices as a medium of State conduct raises difficulties with respect to ascribing particular acts to States. There is no reason sweepingly to deny as a matter of principle the application of the rules of attribution provided in ARS to conduct in cyberspace. However, the identification of individuals or entities that use the Internet is characterized by considerable difficulty, for the Internet guarantees, if not actually absolute, certainly a large measure of anonymity or deniability. Thus, it is almost impossible to identify directly and with certainty the person or entity operating a personal computer. Identification of persons, and by consequence, attribution is only possible via the identification of a computer by way of its IP that identifies its precise location.\nTherefore, an internationally wrongful act in cyberspace appears to be ascribed to a particular computer whereas the identity of the person operating it may only be established either by way of presumption or on the basis of inside information disclosed by government agents of the State perpetrating the internationally wrongful acts in cyberspace.³⁶ Thus, if a computer is identified by way of its location (in the premises of a government department or a diplomatic mission) as a government computer then the transmission of malware or denial of service interference may in principle be attributed to a particular State. This appears to be established either on the identity of the operator who is presumed to be a government agent or on the mere location of the computer as this falls under the exclusive and complete control of a State. Thus, in October and November 2013 the German Government launched strong diplomatic protests with the US and UK Governments for allegations of electronic surveillance of German governmental departments, including the German Chancellor’s\n³⁶ Viz. the information disclosed by the former US National Security Agency (NSA) Edward Snowden on the NSA surveillance of many foreign government agencies; see Joshua Eaton, ‘Timeline of Edward Snowden’s revelations’, *Al Jazeera America* <http: articles=\"\" multimedia=\"\" timeline–edward–snowden–revelations.html=\"\" www.dailymotion.com=\"\"> accessed on 26 November 2013.\nNicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389\nDownloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM\nvia University of Tasmania</http:>\nState responsibility in cyberspace 63\nOffice, from the US and UK embassies in Berlin. In particular, the German Government warned the UK ambassador that the interception of German Government information by intelligence services from a diplomatic mission constituted a breach of international law.³⁷\nAt the same time, the Tallinn Manual adopts a rather cautious approach to attribution with respect to cyber wrongful acts by stating that the fact that a cyber operation has its source in government cyber infrastructure is not sufficient to attribute these acts to a State; it merely constitutes an indication that a particular State is associated with the cyber operation. The Manual explains this approach by reference to the particular features of cyber context and especially the likelihood that a government cyber infrastructure may be ‘hijacked’ by non-State actors.³⁸ Moreover, the former Legal Advisor of the US Department of State has acknowledged the problem of attribution in that cyberspace ‘significantly increases an actor’s ability to engage in attacks with “plausible deniability”, by acting through proxies’ and suggested that this challenge is ‘as much [a question] of a technical and policy nature rather than exclusively or predominantly’ a question of law.³⁹ But attribution is predominantly a question of law and it is not determined ‘on the mere recognition of a link of factual causality’.⁴⁰ Furthermore, neither the Tallinn Manual nor the US Government propose an alternative cogent framework of attribution but leave the whole issue surrounded in ambiguity which suggests a wide margin of discretion on the part of an injured State to decide the matter of attribution on the basis of extra-legal factors, such as the general political climate between it and another State.⁴¹ In the absence of an alternative proposition it appears that this position casts aside the current legal framework of attribution by replacing it with a laissez faire approach by an injured State on a case-by-case basis.\nAttribution of an injurious act to a State is a matter of evidence. As injurious acts in cyberspace emanate from computers located in the territory of one or more States the territorial location of computers may serve as a starting-point. State sovereignty entails the expectation that every State exercises control over cyber infrastructure and activities within its territory.⁴² However, as the ICJ ruled in Corfu Channel the mere fact of existence of objects constituting a source of injurious acts (in this case computers engaged in injurious cyber acts) within its territory is not sufficient to impute knowledge of these acts to the State. At the same time, the victim State is permitted ‘a more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence’.⁴³ This lower\n³⁷ Nigel Morris et. al., ‘Germany calls in Britain’s ambassador to demand explanation over “secret Berlin listening post”’ (6 November 2013) The Independent <http: news=\"\" uk=\"\" politics=\"\" germany--calls--in--britains--ambassador--to--demand--explanation--over--secret--berlin--listening--post--8923082.html=\"\" www.independent.co.uk=\"\"> accessed 13 August 2014.\n³⁸ Michael N.

In the cyber context the establishment of the exact and actual source of the injurious act is extremely difficult to locate, let alone establish the identity of the perpetrator.⁴⁴ Thus, it appears that a very liberal approach to evidence is called for by the very nature of cyberspace that would combine expert technical knowledge, press reports⁴⁵ (where available) revelation by defector public officials of a State (the US NSA surveillance activities were divulged by former NSA official Edward Snowden) even though the fact of defection may diminish its probative value as evidence contrary to the interests of his own State.⁴⁶ The inherent difficulty in identifying a single State as the source of an injurious cyber act⁴⁷ appears to leave the victim State two possible avenues: either the identification of the perpetrating State on the basis of the existing political climate between it and the victim State or cooperation with other States whether in the context of international organizations or not. The first avenue may entail a degree of arbitrariness and ultimately it does not, and cannot by itself, establish responsibility in the absence of more objective evidence. By contrast, the second avenue offers a better potential of identifying the alleged wrong-doing State. The fact, however, remains that such identification defies to a large extent the established legal framework of attribution.\nOn the basis of the assumption that injurious cyber activity can be traced to the territory of a single State it is submitted that the best approach in the cyber context is to attribute hostile cyber acts to this State on the basis of a presumption of responsibility which may be rebutted by the State on the basis of evidence. In other words, attribution may rest on a presumption that introduces a reversal of the burden of proof. This submission departs from the ruling of the ICJ in Corfu Channel but unlike sea-mines, computers are ubiquitous and by their nature not injurious. Thus, all that has to be established is their location in the territory of a particular State and the latter's alertness by the victim to the fact that injurious cyber acts emanate therefrom. Once this takes place knowledge of the injurious activity is established. It is true that the State from the territory of which the injurious acts emanate may not constitute their actual source, as the computers on its territory may have been hijacked. But this is no reason to deny the right of the victim to alert this State and demand measures on its part for the cessation of the injurious activities. Such measures may entail, depending on the circumstances, a degree of denial of Internet services throughout the territory of that State, and it is a question of balancing the interests of both the victim State and the State from the territory of which the particular cyber activity emanates on whether or not this is feasible.⁴⁸ However, this cannot be prima facie excluded as a possibility in\n⁴⁴ Tsagourias (n 41) 233–5.\n⁴⁵ Cf.

Having said this, there appears to be only one situation in which injurious cyber acts may not be imputed to the territorial State, namely, where the acts emanate from a location that is under the exclusive jurisdiction of another State, such as the premises of a diplomatic mission or the installation of a military base. In the context of the US NSA electronic surveillance practices it was reported that special units located on the rooftops of a number of US embassies in Europe and Asia (such as the US embassies in Athens and Baku) collected data.⁴⁹ In these cases these acts would not be attributed to the host States (respectively, Greece and Azerbaijan) but to the USA.\n## 4. BREACH OF AN INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATION IN CYBERSPACE\nThere is no difficulty with the proposition that activities in cyberspace may constitute breach of international obligations giving rise to State responsibility. Thus, certain acts may violate the sovereignty of another State or other States, in the sense of interfering in areas of competence that are exclusively reserved to every State. This contingency may be relative to incidents of electronic surveillance of, or espionage against, government departments and personnel of another State.⁵⁰ However, there is no consensus on this issue: according to a school of thought that relies on the famous (or infamous?) Lotus principle,⁵¹ espionage is not prohibited or regulated by international law; therefore, its practice does not as such constitute a breach of the sovereignty of another State, unless perhaps some additional damage is caused.⁵² On the other hand, it is argued that if an act is not expressly prohibited by international law this does not lead necessarily and automatically to its permissibility;⁵³ espionage, in particular, is practiced extensively by States but no government has ever asserted that it constitutes a lawful enterprise.⁵⁴ Moreover, cyber acts may constitute instances of unlawful intervention in the internal or external affairs of another State, provided the element of ‘coercion’ exists,⁵⁵ or use of force.⁵⁶\n⁴⁹ Morris (n 37).\n⁵⁰ On cyber espionage and international law see Buchan (Ch 8 of this book).\n⁵¹ The Case of the ‘S.S.

The considerable difficulty of attribution of an act perpetrated in cyberspace on the basis of the identity or the link of a person or of an entity operating computers to a State, points at the other, in most cases the only, ground for establishing responsibility: the violation of the duty of due diligence arising from the principle that no State may knowingly allow its territory to be used for, or be the source of, acts injurious to other States.57 The proof of attribution in this contingency is made redundant because it concerns an omission to act in accordance with a primary obligation and it may be established by the fact that a State possesses the requisite infrastructure operated by its agents or de facto agents or private parties to which government authority was delegated, to prevent such injurious acts. Thus, due diligence is the primary obligation the breach of which (failure to act or omission) ensures the observance of other primary obligations (either based on treaty or customary law). The precise content and extent of due diligence varies in conjunction with specific obligations. The ILC has deliberately refrained from including due diligence in the Articles on State Responsibility because this would entail examination of the content of primary rules; nevertheless, it did point out that there is a presumption that any primary rule contains a qualification of due diligence.58\nIn the context of trans-boundary harm from hazardous activities the ILC has adopted the view that the duty of due diligence involved does not extend to guaranteeing that significant harm is to be totally prevented if it is impossible to do so. Furthermore the ILC stated that the standard of due diligence to assess the conduct of a State would be that which would be deemed 'appropriate and proportional to the degree of risk of trans-boundary harm in the particular instance'.59 Moreover, the Sea Bed Disputes Chamber of the International Tribunal of the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) ruled in its Advisory Opinion in the Responsibilities and Obligations of States with respect to Activities in the Area ruled that due diligence is a 'variable concept' and the standard it may set may change as a result of scientific and technological developments as well as the risks involved in a particular activity.60\nIn the human rights field the duty of due diligence has been upheld in Velasquez-Rodriguez in which the Inter-American Court of Human Rights interpreted the obligation introduced in Article 1(1) of the Inter-American Convention of Human Rights to respect and ensure the exercise of the rights enshrined in the Convention. The Court ruled that the obligation to 'ensure' the exercise of these rights gave rise to the duty of contracting States to organize the governmental infrastructure in such a way so as to ensure 'free and full enjoyment' of the rights and prevent, investigate and punish\n57 Corfu Channel Case (n 43) 22.\n58 Report of the International Law Commission on the work of its 51st session (Supplement No 10, 3 May–23 July 1999) GAOR, A/54/10, 86; Jan A Hessbruegge, ‘The historical development of the doctrines of attribution and due diligence in international law’ (2004) N.Y.U.

In *Corfu Channel* the Court ruled at the outset that the mere existence of the source of an injurious act (in this case the mines) in the territory of Albania was not sufficient to attribute this act to the State, for the control exercised by a State over its territory as a result of sovereignty does not establish *prima facie* knowledge of every activity taking place therein.⁶² After establishing knowledge by Albania of the laying of mines in its territorial sea,⁶³ the Court ruled that the responsibility of Albania lay in her failure to notify the existence of a minefield in its territorial sea to third-State shipping. In the opinion of the Court, this obligation rested on three general principles, namely, elementary considerations of humanity, the freedom of maritime communication and ‘every State’s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States’.⁶⁴ But the Court also took account of the particular factual circumstances of the case in order to confirm its legal finding: it acknowledged that if the mines had been laid at the last possible moment, namely, less than 24 hours before the UK warships struck them it would have been difficult or even impossible to issue a general notification to third-State shipping. But, as the incident took place at a time by which the Albanian authorities could have had knowledge of the existence of the mines as a result of their close surveillance of the *Corfu Strait*, Albania did not observe its duty of due diligence.⁶⁵ In *US Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran* the Court ruled that the acts of the demonstrators who took over the premises of the US embassy and held its staff hostage could not be imputed *per se* to the government of Iran. However, Iran bore responsibility because of its failure to observe its obligation under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (1961) to protect the inviolability of the persons and premises of another State’s diplomatic mission.⁶⁶\nIn *Congo v. Uganda* the Court dealt in the context of the first counterclaim of Uganda with the allegation that the Congo had violated its obligation of due diligence (or duty of vigilance) by failing to prevent the action of dissident armed bands against Uganda from its territory. The Court ruled that the existence and toleration of armed groups on Congolese territory could not be assimilated with active support to these groups; in addition, the Court took into account the inimical geographical terrain where the groups operated and the material inability of the Congolese (as well as the former Zairian) Government to effectively control that part of the territory of the State. Thus,\n⁶¹ Velasquez–Rodriguez v. Honduras (Judgment of 29 July 1988) [1988] Inter–Am. Ct.

It stated at the outset that this duty was an obligation of conduct and not of result; hence, a State did not have the obligation to succeed in preventing genocide ‘whatever the circumstances’ but was under the obligation to ‘employ all means reasonably available’ to it to prevent the commission of the crime.⁷⁰ Thus, failure to achieve the desired result does not give rise to responsibility; by contrast, responsibility arises in case of manifest failure to take all steps within its power that would contribute to preventing genocide because ‘in this area the notion of “due diligence”, which calls for an assessment in concreto, is of critical importance. Various parameters operate when assessing whether a State has duly discharged the obligation concerned’.⁷¹ The Court proceeded to identify those parameters in relation to the specific obligation to prevent genocide and found of particular importance the capacity to influence (within the limits of the law) the perpetrators on the basis of: (a) the geographical distance between the State concerned and the scene of the crime: and (b) the strength of political or other links between the State and the perpetrators.⁷² The essence of due diligence lies, therefore, in the application of all means at the disposal of the State even though such application may be proved on the basis of evidence to be futile; in other words a State must not be inert even in the knowledge that its measures will in all probability be ineffective to prevent the injurious act.⁷³ Even though the Court found that the duty to prevent genocide would give rise to responsibility only when the crime was actually committed (viz. Article 14(3) ARS) it recognized that a State was not absolved from responsibility if it remains inactive until commission of the crime commences where there is a serious risk of its commission; in such a contingency the State is under the obligation to employ the means available to it to prevent the crime, otherwise the substance of the obligation would be negated.⁷⁴\n⁶⁷ Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (Democratic Republic of the Congo v.

The latter contingency would require further evidence that the ultimate outcome was the direct result of acts or omissions amounting to the breach of this other primary rule and not simply the failure to adopt preventative measures that even they might not guarantee beyond all doubt that the end result would not occur.\nOn the basis of the preceding analysis it is submitted that the responsibility of a State for internationally wrongful acts in cyberspace may be established in customary law on the duty of due diligence in observing the obligation of not knowingly allowing its territory to be the source of acts violating the rights of other States. The content of the due diligence must be assessed by taking into account, first, that the use of the Internet is not unlawful *per se*; secondly, that transmission from a computer or a host of computers may or may not be the actual source of the injurious activity and; finally, that the existence of thousands of computers on the territory of a State does not by and of itself constitute knowledge of such injurious activity. Moreover, due diligence being an obligation of conduct and not of result does not entail as a necessary outcome the obligation to take steps to protect the rights of other States as this appears to go beyond the requirement to employ all means that a State reasonably possesses to prevent an unlawful act.76 Furthermore, knowledge of the cyber injurious act could be established only upon the notification by the victim State that has the discretion to select the States (they may be many) from the territories of which injurious transmissions occur.\nThe criteria for selection for notification are a matter of political decision, but once notification takes place ‘knowledge’ exists and the State or States notified are under an obligation to employ measures reasonably at their disposal to prevent the wrongful cyber activity. Such measures appear to be commensurate with the possession of technological capabilities to deny temporarily Internet service either to particular users or throughout the State, even though the latter may disproportionately affect the function of the governmental and economic infrastructure of the State. Thus, it appears to be a matter of balancing the cost of Internet denial to the State of origin against the effect of the injurious acts to the victim State and this is to be assessed in the particular circumstances of each case. However, total denial of service may not, in principle, be regarded as a reasonable response to injurious cyber acts; but it may not be excluded, either in particular circumstances or even more so when States appear prepared to resort to it to silence political opponents or contain internal unrest. What is important is that a State that is established to have knowledge of injurious cyber acts emanating from its territory is under a duty to act in a preventative manner irrespective of the fact\n75 *Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay (Argentina v. Uruguay)* [2010] ICJ Rep. 14, 77.\n76 Cf. Tallinn Manual (n 38) 33.\nNicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389\nDownloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM\nvia University of Tasmania\n70 Research handbook on international law and cyberspace\nthat the said cyber activity also originates from the territories of other States. To say that the failure to employ measures within that State’s capability is of no consequence because the wrongful cyber activity also emanates from computers located in a plurality of States does not absolve the former from responsibility under due diligence. The ICJ ruled in *Bosnian Genocide* that such an assertion is irrelevant to the breach of an obligation of conduct warranted by the duty of due diligence, especially when there is a possibility of cooperation through concerted action in a situation where the perpetrator of an injurious cyber act takes over a large number of computers situated in a plurality of States.⁷⁷ Indeed, it is because of this contingency, so frequent in practice, that cooperation and concerted action is essential either on an *ad hoc* basis to counter specific wrongful cyber activities or on a more permanent basis through institutionalized mechanisms or a pre-existing framework of good practices in cyber-space.⁷⁸ Thus, the NATO initiatives on information security are in principle steps in the right direction⁷⁹ as well as the initiative of China and the Russian Federation for the introduction of an International Code of Conduct for Information Security.⁸⁰\n# 5. CONCLUSION\nCyberspace raises many challenges to the law on State responsibility as it has evolved through State practice, judicial decisions and the work of the ILC culminating in the 2001 ARS. Cyberspace as a domain has international dimensions; therefore it is in principle amenable to regulation by international law and the rules on State responsibility, in particular, may be applied. While a breach of an international obligation may be established without much difficulty in relation to certain types of cyber activity, it is attribution of it to a specific State that raises difficulties that in practice appear insurmountable and seem to defy the rules on attribution established in the ILC ARS.\nThese rules on attribution are centred on acts of persons and their imputation to a particular State. Moreover, the process of attribution is a juridical one. However, the nature of cyberspace as a domain, the freedom and the prima facie lawfulness of its use, the transmission of information through computers and the anonymity of the users of those computers leave very little scope for establishing with a relative degree of certainty both the identity of the user and his/her link to a specific State. The only fact that can be established with certainty is the location of a particular computer or computers in the territory of one or more States. This gives rise to the presumption that the State from the territory of which cyber injurious acts emanate could be the one that may incur responsibility. However, this does not dispense with the specific rules of\n⁷⁷ Case Concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (n 16) 221.\n⁷⁸ O’Connell (n 6) 206–9.\n⁷⁹ NATO, ‘NATO and Cyber Defence’ (7 August 2014) <http: en=\"\" esp=\"\" natolive=\"\" topics_78170.htm?=\"\" www.nato.int=\"\"> accessed 13 August 2014.\n⁸⁰ Letter dated 12 September 2011 from the Permanent Representatives of China, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary–General, Annex, A/66/359.\nNicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389\nDownloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM\nvia University of Tasmania</http:>\nState responsibility in cyberspace 71\nattribution and the fact that computers situated in the territory of a one or more States are the actual source of wrongful cyber acts as they may have been ‘hijacked’ by the real perpetrator. Hence there have been suggestions of overcoming this difficulty by addressing attribution more flexibly or even by going beyond its existing legal framework and establishing it on existing political relations between the States concerned. Whereas political relations may constitute a factor for a victim State of selecting another State or other States as the likely source of wrongful cyber activity, it should not constitute a substitute for the existing rules on attribution and should not dispense with the burden of proof of the grounds of attribution. This enterprise requires evidence and as this is not possible to collect on the territory of a State from which cyber activity occurs, circumstantial evidence may be admissible (for instance, the revelation in the press by former government agents that a State has engaged in wrongful cyber acts) as well as the reversal of the burden of proof upon the State allegedly perpetrating injurious cyber acts.\nThe difficulty in applying the existing rules on attribution could be overcome by focusing on the primary rule breached (namely, the specific international obligation) in conjunction with the duty of due diligence either by reference to the substantive content of the primary obligation or the general principle of international law that no State must knowingly allow its territory to be used for injurious acts against other States. In this manner, responsibility may be established on the fact that certain wrongful cyber acts have their source in computers located in the territory of a State or a plurality of States and it occurs with knowledge of the latter. This knowledge would be established on the basis of alerting the territorial State (or States) to the fact of wrongful cyber activity from its territory and its failure to act by employing measures within its capabilities to curb that activity. The best course of action to achieve cessation of injurious cyber acts appears to be through the adoption of good Internet practices and international cooperation.\nNicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389\nDownloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM via University of Tasmania",
  "flat_text": "# 3. State responsibility in cyberspace\nConstantine Antonopoulos\n## 1. INTRODUCTION\nThe terms Internet and Cyberspace are household words. They represent domains the use of which is indispensable to the entire or at least a substantial part of the global population. At the same time, as this author understands it, they are not identical in meaning as a matter of computer science terminology. The Internet is a ‘global network connecting millions of computers’; it is ‘decentralized by design’, subject to ownership or control (unlike ‘online services’) by no single (or a plurality of) person or entity. The Internet has a physical dimension because of the interconnection of different computer systems, their accessibility and the transmission of information to and from such systems by using the standard Internet Protocol (IP). Cyberspace, however, is a more abstract term; it is a non-physical domain created by computer systems that allows people to communicate with each other, to exchange or to gather information. Moreover, it refers to the ‘notional environment in which digitized information is communicated over computer networks’. Be this as it may, it appears that there exists a tendency to treat these two terms as synonyms and use them interchangeably. To give an example, the US Government Cyber Policy Review 2009 defines cyberspace as ‘the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, and includes the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers in critical industries. Common usage of the term also refers to the virtual environment of information and interactions between people’. It appears therefore, that apart from identity in terms, these two concepts have a dual role: they refer to the domain as well as to the medium of conducting certain activities. Furthermore, it would be an understatement to say that the Internet is important to private individuals, corporations and States: the US Government has stated that cyberspace / the Internet underlines every aspect of modern society and it is both the\n Vangie Beal, ‘Internet’ (Webopedia) <http: Internet.html=\"\" term=\"\" www.webopedia.com=\"\"> accessed on 1 November 2013.\n Bill Young, ‘Navigating Cyberspace: Introduction to Cyberspace’ (9 January 2013) University of Texas <http: cs329e=\"\" slides1-introduction.pdf=\"\" www.cs.utexas.edu=\"\" ~byoung=\"\"> accessed on 4 November 2013.\n US Department of Defense, ‘Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms’ JP 1–02 (12 April 2001, as amended through 31 August 2005) 139.\n The White House, ‘Cyberspace Policy Review: Assuring a trusted and resilient information and communications infrastructure’ (2009) <http: assets=\"\" documents=\"\" cyberspace_policy_review_final.pdf=\"\" www.whitehouse.gov=\"\"> 1, accessed on 4 November 2013.\nNicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389\nDownloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM\nvia University of Tasmania</http:></http:></http:>\nResearch handbook on international law and cyberspace\ndomain where and the medium by which economic, public safety, civil society and national security activities are pursued.\nWhile the usefulness of the Internet is universally acknowledged, the same is the case with regard to its misuse or hostile use, in the form of cyber-crime and espionage. In particular, as nowadays private business and governments conduct most of their functions and activities in cyberspace, safety and resilience are matters to be preserved. In the words of the US Cyber Policy Review 2009 ‘to realize the full benefits of digital revolution, users must have confidence that sensitive information is secure, commerce is not compromised and the infrastructure is not infiltrated. Nation-states also need confidence that the networks that support their national security and economic prosperity are safe and resilient. ...’ It is, therefore, not inconceivable that the Internet may be used in such a way as to cause harm to States or as to compel them to act in a particular manner. There have been three episodes in State practice that have revealed how the hostile use of the Internet may affect the orderly function of basic services in a State or threaten its security. In 2007 Estonia was the object of massive and coordinated computer hacking attacks that paralyzed its economy and the functioning of government services for weeks. In 2008 Georgia was the target of similar attacks during the conflict with the Russian Federation with respect to South Ossetia. Also, in 2009 a computer virus by the name of Stuxnet caused the progress of the nuclear program of Iran to suffer significant delay. In this context the question arises whether such use of the Internet may give rise to State responsibility. The answer must be in the affirmative provided that a specific use of the Internet amounts to an ‘internationally wrongful act’. As the Internet is an international domain, then States must conduct themselves over this domain in accordance with international law and therefore the use of cyberspace is subject to international law. As Harold Koh, the former Legal Advisor of the US State Department has remarked ‘international law principles do apply in cyberspace. ...’ However, there are substantive challenges facing the law on international responsibility as it exists in contemporary international law by the particularities of cyberspace since this body of rules is premised heavily on attribution of acts of individuals to a State. Be as it may, the present author submits, that the application of this area of international law to cyberspace is not impossible, mainly as a result of establishing responsibility on the basis of the breach of the obligation of due diligence on the part of States, which dispenses with the difficulty of attributing acts of individuals to a State, while even attribution may in certain cases be established.

AN OUTLINE OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF STATE RESPONSIBILITY\nState responsibility appears to have emerged as a branch of international law by way of private law analogy. As the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ) ruled in Factory at Chorzów (Indemnities) ‘it is a principle of international law, and even a general conception of law, that any breach of an engagement involves an obligation to make reparation’. However, subsequent judicial pronouncements and the work of the International Law Commission (ILC) form a departure from legal analogies with the domestic law of tort in favour of reconstructing the responsibility as a matter of international public law arising when, an act: (1) is attributable to a State; and (2) constitutes a breach of an international obligation. In US Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran the International Court (ICJ) stated that it had to ‘determine how far, legally, the acts in question may be regarded as imputable to the Iranian State’ and whether they were compatible or not ‘with the obligations of Iran under treaties in force or under any other rules of international law that may be applicable’. Moreover, in Bosnian Genocide the ICJ ruled with regard to the breach of the Genocide Convention that ‘the obligations in question … and the responsibilities of States that would arise from breach of such obligations are obligations and responsibilities under international law. They are not of a criminal nature’.\nThe contemporary law of State responsibility has as its principal source of reference the Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARS)\n Ibid.

However, since 2001 it has been so extensively cited by international courts and tribunals, as well as in State practice, that it is considered as an authoritative statement of the customary international law on State responsibility. The legal regime introduced by ARS is premised on the distinction introduced by ILC Rapporteur Roberto Ago between ‘primary obligations’ and ‘secondary rules’. The very first paragraph of the Introduction of the Commentaries to ARS states that:\nThe emphasis is on the secondary rules of State responsibility, that is to say, the general conditions under international law for the State to be considered responsible for wrongful actions or omissions, and the legal consequences which flow therefrom. The articles do not attempt to define the content of the international obligations breach of which gives rise to responsibility.\nA second basic feature of ARS is that it views responsibility of States not as an exclusive pattern of bilateral relations between the wrongdoing and injured State. By contrast, State responsibility is given a public order dimension by laying emphasis on the existence of an internationally wrongful act and not upon the damage or injury caused and the existence of a causal link between the damage and the breach of obligation. Thus, the Commentary to Article 1 ARS states that:\n[T]he term ‘international responsibility’ ... covers the relations which arise under international law from the internationally wrongful act of a State, whether such relations are limited to the wrongdoing State and one injured State or whether they extend also to other States or indeed to other subjects of international law, and whether they are centred on obligations of restitution or compensation or also give the injured State the possibility of responding by way of counter-measures.\nMoreover, this dimension of State responsibility is further supported by Articles 40 and 48 ARS dealing, respectively, with serious breaches of obligations arising under a peremptory norm of international law and the invocation of the responsibility of a State by States other than the injured party.\nAs the emphasis in ARS lies in the wrongful act, central position is given to its requirements, namely, attribution to a State and breach of an international obligation (Art. 2 ARS). Attribution means ‘the operation of attaching a given act or omission to a State’ and to this end the ARS relies on the identity of natural persons and their\n [2001] Yearbook of the ILC, vol.

As the Commentary to Article 2 ARS makes absolutely clear the fact is that States act through human beings or groups; therefore, the issue of attribution is reduced to identifying the persons or groups that should be considered to act on behalf of the State. This finding appears to rest on a dual basis that is disjunctively applied: either the identity of a person or group as such or the control exercised by a State over the activities of a person or a group. In a nutshell, the ARS, for the purposes of attribution, are centred on the individual. Thus, the responsibility of a State is engaged for acts or omissions by the following categories of individuals:\n(a) De jure State agents or organs, irrespective of their hierarchical position in the apparatus of the State or the constitutional structure or organization of the State (namely, whether it is a unitary or federal State) (Art.4 ARS);\n(b) De facto State organs, namely, non-State actors or entities that have been 'elevated' to de facto State agents or organs because they are under the absolute dependence and control of a State. In Bosnian Genocide the issue before the ICJ was whether the atrocities perpetrated by the Bosnian Serbs in Srebrenica in July 1995, which as the Court ruled amounted to commission of genocide under the 1948 Genocide Convention, could be attributed to Serbia. The Court ruled that:\n[t]his question has in fact two aspects, which the Court must consider separately. First, it should be ascertained whether the acts committed in Srebrenica were perpetrated by organs of the Respondent [namely, Serbia], i.e., by persons or entities whose conduct is necessarily attributable to it, because they are in fact instruments of its action. Next, if the preceding question is answered in the negative, it should be ascertained whether the acts in question were committed by persons who, while not organs of the Respondent, did nevertheless act on the instruments of, or under the direction or control of, the Respondent.\nThe Court then proceeded to identify de facto States organs as;\npersons, groups of persons or entities [that], may for purposes of international responsibility, be equated with State organs even if that status does not follow from internal law, provided that in fact the persons, groups or entities act in 'complete dependence' on the State of which they are ultimately the instrument ...;\n(c) Delegation of Government Authority. In this contingency the conduct of a non-State actor (i.e. 'a person or entity which is not the organ of the State') is to be considered as an act of the State if the non-State actor 'is empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of governmental authority' and it 'is acting in that capacity in the particular instance' (Art. 5 ARS);\n(d) The situation where an organ of a State is placed at the disposal of another State. The acts or omissions of this organ in the exercise of government authority on behalf of the State at the disposal of which it has been placed give rise to this State's responsibility (Art. 6 ARS);\n Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (n 19) 35.\n Case Concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (n 16) (Merits) 201.\n Ibid. 205 [emphasis added].\nNicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389\nDownloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM\nvia University of Tasmania\nResearch handbook on international law and cyberspace\n(e) Ultra Vires Acts. A State organ or entity gives rise to the responsibility of the State even when acting in this capacity it exceeds its authority or against instructions (Art.7 ARS);\n(f) Instructions, Direction and Control of a State over acts of private persons. In the jurisprudence of the ICJ this control must be ‘effective control’ in order to give rise to the responsibility of the State. The Court reached this finding in Nicaragua where it ruled that the US assistance to the contras and its general control over them were not sufficient in default of further evidence to attribute their acts violating human rights and humanitarian law to the US government. By contrast ‘[f]or this conduct to give rise to legal responsibility of the United States, it would in principle have to be proved that that State had effective control of the military and paramilitary operations in the course of which the alleged violations were committed.’ 26 Moreover, in Bosnian Genocide the Court, having found that the Bosnian Serbs did not constitute a de facto organ of Serbia, proceeded to determine whether Serbia exercised effective control over them. The Court explained that the:\ntest thus formulated differs in two respects from the test ... to determine whether a person or entity may be equated with a State organ even if not having that status under internal law. First, in this context it is not necessary to show that the persons who performed the acts alleged to have violated international law were in general in a relationship of ‘complete dependence’ on the respondent State; it has to be proved that they acted in accordance with the State’s instructions or under its ‘effective control’. It must however be shown that this ‘effective control’ was exercised, or that the State’s instructions were given, in respect of each operation in which the alleged violations occurred, not generally in respect of the overall actions taken by the persons or groups of persons having committed the violations.27\nIn this respect, the Court declined to uphold the ruling of the ICTY Appeals Chamber in the Tadić case where the ad hoc Tribunal applied the test of ‘overall control’ that dispenses with the need to evaluate control of a State over each specific operation of a non-State actor;28 the Court took the view that the determination of State responsibility on the part of Serbia did not constitute an indispensable finding to determine individual criminal responsibility by an international criminal tribunal29 (Art. 8 ARS);\n(g) Exercise of elements of government authority in the absence of or inadequate function of State authorities and in circumstances that warrant the exercise of this authority. In Yeager v. Islamic Republic of Iran the Iran-US Claims Tribunal ruled\n\nNicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389\nDownloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM\nvia University of Tasmania\nState responsibility in cyberspace 61\nthat the immigration, customs and other similar acts that had been carried out by the Revolutionary Guards at the Tehran airport in the immediate aftermath of the Islamic revolution were attributable to Iran. The Tribunal reasoned that even though these functions were not authorized by the Iranian government they objectively consisted in the exercise of elements of governmental authority in the absence of official authorities of the State ‘in operations of which the new Government must have had knowledge and to which it did not specifically object.’ (Art. 9 ARS);\n(h) The ARS provides in particular that acts or omissions by an insurrectional or other movement are attributed to a State in the event the insurrection is successful and the movement become the government of the State (Art. 10 ARS);\n(i) Approval and Adoption by a State of acts of private persons or entities. In US Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran the Court ruled that the act of overrunning of the US Embassy in Tehran by demonstrators and the seizure as hostages of the US diplomatic staff could not be as such attributed to the Iranian Government because the demonstrators were neither State organs nor did they carry out a specific government act on behalf of the State. However, the responsibility of Iran for the acts of the demonstrators was established at a later stage when the Iranian government approved of and adopted the occupation of the Embassy premises and the captivity of the US diplomatic staff as its own (Art.11 ARS).\nThe second requirement of State responsibility, namely a breach of an international obligation, may consist in a physical act or omission and may emanate from a rule of either customary law or treaty (Art. 12 ARS) that introduces an obligation in force for the particular State (Art.13 ARS). Moreover, the responsibility of a State may arise whether the act is or is not of a continuing character (Arts 14 and 15 ARS) or it constitutes part of a composite activity. Furthermore, State responsibility arises with respect to acts of other States. This is not to say that acts of other States are attributed to another State for, as the ILC has made clear, the ARS is premised on the principle that ‘each State is responsible for its own wrongful conduct … attributable to it … which is in breach of an international obligation of that State …’ and that ‘responsibility is specific to the State concerned’. Even though in this respect the ILC identifies contingencies of ‘collaborative conduct’ it does not appear to introduce a particular legal framework of ‘shared responsibility’ for the collaborative element appears to be viewed simply as a factual rather than a normative parameter. This is further corroborated by Article 47(1) ARS on the invocation of State responsibility for an\n [1987] 17 Iran–US Claims Tribunal Rep.

Having said this, the responsibility of a State for the acts of another State arises on the basis of conduct of the former State in relation to the latter that consists in aid or assistance, direction and control and coercion (of the latter State). In each of these contingencies there must be two requirements cumulatively: first, the conduct must be internationally wrongful if it was committed by the other State and, secondly, the aiding/controlling/coercing State must have knowledge of the circumstances of the internationally wrongful act (Arts 16–18 ARS). Finally, the ILC ARS provide for grounds precluding the wrongfulness of an act that *prima facie* constitutes a breach of an international obligation; these are: consent (Art. 20); self-defence (Art. 21); countermeasures (Arts 22, 49–54); *force majeure* (Art. 23); distress (Art. 24); and necessity (Art. 25).\n# 3. ATTRIBUTION IN CYBERSPACE\nCyberspace as a domain and the use of electronic devices as a medium of State conduct raises difficulties with respect to ascribing particular acts to States. There is no reason sweepingly to deny as a matter of principle the application of the rules of attribution provided in ARS to conduct in cyberspace. However, the identification of individuals or entities that use the Internet is characterized by considerable difficulty, for the Internet guarantees, if not actually absolute, certainly a large measure of anonymity or deniability. Thus, it is almost impossible to identify directly and with certainty the person or entity operating a personal computer. Identification of persons, and by consequence, attribution is only possible via the identification of a computer by way of its IP that identifies its precise location.\nTherefore, an internationally wrongful act in cyberspace appears to be ascribed to a particular computer whereas the identity of the person operating it may only be established either by way of presumption or on the basis of inside information disclosed by government agents of the State perpetrating the internationally wrongful acts in cyberspace. Thus, if a computer is identified by way of its location (in the premises of a government department or a diplomatic mission) as a government computer then the transmission of malware or denial of service interference may in principle be attributed to a particular State. This appears to be established either on the identity of the operator who is presumed to be a government agent or on the mere location of the computer as this falls under the exclusive and complete control of a State. Thus, in October and November 2013 the German Government launched strong diplomatic protests with the US and UK Governments for allegations of electronic surveillance of German governmental departments, including the German Chancellor’s\n Viz. the information disclosed by the former US National Security Agency (NSA) Edward Snowden on the NSA surveillance of many foreign government agencies; see Joshua Eaton, ‘Timeline of Edward Snowden’s revelations’, *Al Jazeera America* <http: articles=\"\" multimedia=\"\" timeline–edward–snowden–revelations.html=\"\" www.dailymotion.com=\"\"> accessed on 26 November 2013.\nNicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389\nDownloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM\nvia University of Tasmania</http:>\nState responsibility in cyberspace 63\nOffice, from the US and UK embassies in Berlin. In particular, the German Government warned the UK ambassador that the interception of German Government information by intelligence services from a diplomatic mission constituted a breach of international law.\nAt the same time, the Tallinn Manual adopts a rather cautious approach to attribution with respect to cyber wrongful acts by stating that the fact that a cyber operation has its source in government cyber infrastructure is not sufficient to attribute these acts to a State; it merely constitutes an indication that a particular State is associated with the cyber operation. The Manual explains this approach by reference to the particular features of cyber context and especially the likelihood that a government cyber infrastructure may be ‘hijacked’ by non-State actors. Moreover, the former Legal Advisor of the US Department of State has acknowledged the problem of attribution in that cyberspace ‘significantly increases an actor’s ability to engage in attacks with “plausible deniability”, by acting through proxies’ and suggested that this challenge is ‘as much [a question] of a technical and policy nature rather than exclusively or predominantly’ a question of law. But attribution is predominantly a question of law and it is not determined ‘on the mere recognition of a link of factual causality’. Furthermore, neither the Tallinn Manual nor the US Government propose an alternative cogent framework of attribution but leave the whole issue surrounded in ambiguity which suggests a wide margin of discretion on the part of an injured State to decide the matter of attribution on the basis of extra-legal factors, such as the general political climate between it and another State. In the absence of an alternative proposition it appears that this position casts aside the current legal framework of attribution by replacing it with a laissez faire approach by an injured State on a case-by-case basis.\nAttribution of an injurious act to a State is a matter of evidence. As injurious acts in cyberspace emanate from computers located in the territory of one or more States the territorial location of computers may serve as a starting-point. State sovereignty entails the expectation that every State exercises control over cyber infrastructure and activities within its territory. However, as the ICJ ruled in Corfu Channel the mere fact of existence of objects constituting a source of injurious acts (in this case computers engaged in injurious cyber acts) within its territory is not sufficient to impute knowledge of these acts to the State. At the same time, the victim State is permitted ‘a more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence’.

In the cyber context the establishment of the exact and actual source of the injurious act is extremely difficult to locate, let alone establish the identity of the perpetrator. Thus, it appears that a very liberal approach to evidence is called for by the very nature of cyberspace that would combine expert technical knowledge, press reports (where available) revelation by defector public officials of a State (the US NSA surveillance activities were divulged by former NSA official Edward Snowden) even though the fact of defection may diminish its probative value as evidence contrary to the interests of his own State. The inherent difficulty in identifying a single State as the source of an injurious cyber act appears to leave the victim State two possible avenues: either the identification of the perpetrating State on the basis of the existing political climate between it and the victim State or cooperation with other States whether in the context of international organizations or not. The first avenue may entail a degree of arbitrariness and ultimately it does not, and cannot by itself, establish responsibility in the absence of more objective evidence. By contrast, the second avenue offers a better potential of identifying the alleged wrong-doing State. The fact, however, remains that such identification defies to a large extent the established legal framework of attribution.\nOn the basis of the assumption that injurious cyber activity can be traced to the territory of a single State it is submitted that the best approach in the cyber context is to attribute hostile cyber acts to this State on the basis of a presumption of responsibility which may be rebutted by the State on the basis of evidence. In other words, attribution may rest on a presumption that introduces a reversal of the burden of proof. This submission departs from the ruling of the ICJ in Corfu Channel but unlike sea-mines, computers are ubiquitous and by their nature not injurious. Thus, all that has to be established is their location in the territory of a particular State and the latter's alertness by the victim to the fact that injurious cyber acts emanate therefrom. Once this takes place knowledge of the injurious activity is established. It is true that the State from the territory of which the injurious acts emanate may not constitute their actual source, as the computers on its territory may have been hijacked. But this is no reason to deny the right of the victim to alert this State and demand measures on its part for the cessation of the injurious activities. Such measures may entail, depending on the circumstances, a degree of denial of Internet services throughout the territory of that State, and it is a question of balancing the interests of both the victim State and the State from the territory of which the particular cyber activity emanates on whether or not this is feasible. However, this cannot be prima facie excluded as a possibility in\n Tsagourias (n 41) 233–5.\n Cf. Nicaragua Case (n 26) 40–41.\n Ibid. 43.\n Tsagourias mentions that the cyber attack on Estonia in 2007 ‘involved a large botnet of approximately 85,000 hijacked computers from around 178 countries’: see: (n 41) 233.\n Tallinn Manual (n 38) 33.\nNicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389\nDownloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM\nvia University of Tasmania\nState responsibility in cyberspace 65\nview of the fact that States in other circumstances (for instance, when facing unrest by dissident political groups) are all too prepared to adopt sweeping measures of Internet service-denial even throughout their territories. Having said this, there appears to be only one situation in which injurious cyber acts may not be imputed to the territorial State, namely, where the acts emanate from a location that is under the exclusive jurisdiction of another State, such as the premises of a diplomatic mission or the installation of a military base. In the context of the US NSA electronic surveillance practices it was reported that special units located on the rooftops of a number of US embassies in Europe and Asia (such as the US embassies in Athens and Baku) collected data. In these cases these acts would not be attributed to the host States (respectively, Greece and Azerbaijan) but to the USA.\n## 4. BREACH OF AN INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATION IN CYBERSPACE\nThere is no difficulty with the proposition that activities in cyberspace may constitute breach of international obligations giving rise to State responsibility. Thus, certain acts may violate the sovereignty of another State or other States, in the sense of interfering in areas of competence that are exclusively reserved to every State. This contingency may be relative to incidents of electronic surveillance of, or espionage against, government departments and personnel of another State. However, there is no consensus on this issue: according to a school of thought that relies on the famous (or infamous?) Lotus principle, espionage is not prohibited or regulated by international law; therefore, its practice does not as such constitute a breach of the sovereignty of another State, unless perhaps some additional damage is caused. On the other hand, it is argued that if an act is not expressly prohibited by international law this does not lead necessarily and automatically to its permissibility; espionage, in particular, is practiced extensively by States but no government has ever asserted that it constitutes a lawful enterprise. Moreover, cyber acts may constitute instances of unlawful intervention in the internal or external affairs of another State, provided the element of ‘coercion’ exists, or use of force.\n Morris (n 37).\n On cyber espionage and international law see Buchan (Ch 8 of this book).\n The Case of the ‘S.S.

The considerable difficulty of attribution of an act perpetrated in cyberspace on the basis of the identity or the link of a person or of an entity operating computers to a State, points at the other, in most cases the only, ground for establishing responsibility: the violation of the duty of due diligence arising from the principle that no State may knowingly allow its territory to be used for, or be the source of, acts injurious to other States.57 The proof of attribution in this contingency is made redundant because it concerns an omission to act in accordance with a primary obligation and it may be established by the fact that a State possesses the requisite infrastructure operated by its agents or de facto agents or private parties to which government authority was delegated, to prevent such injurious acts. Thus, due diligence is the primary obligation the breach of which (failure to act or omission) ensures the observance of other primary obligations (either based on treaty or customary law). The precise content and extent of due diligence varies in conjunction with specific obligations. The ILC has deliberately refrained from including due diligence in the Articles on State Responsibility because this would entail examination of the content of primary rules; nevertheless, it did point out that there is a presumption that any primary rule contains a qualification of due diligence.58\nIn the context of trans-boundary harm from hazardous activities the ILC has adopted the view that the duty of due diligence involved does not extend to guaranteeing that significant harm is to be totally prevented if it is impossible to do so. Furthermore the ILC stated that the standard of due diligence to assess the conduct of a State would be that which would be deemed 'appropriate and proportional to the degree of risk of trans-boundary harm in the particular instance'.59 Moreover, the Sea Bed Disputes Chamber of the International Tribunal of the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) ruled in its Advisory Opinion in the Responsibilities and Obligations of States with respect to Activities in the Area ruled that due diligence is a 'variable concept' and the standard it may set may change as a result of scientific and technological developments as well as the risks involved in a particular activity.60\nIn the human rights field the duty of due diligence has been upheld in Velasquez-Rodriguez in which the Inter-American Court of Human Rights interpreted the obligation introduced in Article 1(1) of the Inter-American Convention of Human Rights to respect and ensure the exercise of the rights enshrined in the Convention. The Court ruled that the obligation to 'ensure' the exercise of these rights gave rise to the duty of contracting States to organize the governmental infrastructure in such a way so as to ensure 'free and full enjoyment' of the rights and prevent, investigate and punish\n\nNicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389\nDownloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM\nvia University of Tasmania\nState responsibility in cyberspace 67\ntheir violation; this obligation to ‘ensure’ is not fulfilled solely by the existence of ‘a legal system designed to make it possible to comply with this obligation – it also requires the government to conduct itself so as to effectively ensure the free and full exercise of human rights’.\nThe ICJ has dealt with the duty of diligence in a number of disputes involving alleged breaches of international obligations in a variety of contexts. In *Corfu Channel* the Court ruled at the outset that the mere existence of the source of an injurious act (in this case the mines) in the territory of Albania was not sufficient to attribute this act to the State, for the control exercised by a State over its territory as a result of sovereignty does not establish *prima facie* knowledge of every activity taking place therein. After establishing knowledge by Albania of the laying of mines in its territorial sea, the Court ruled that the responsibility of Albania lay in her failure to notify the existence of a minefield in its territorial sea to third-State shipping. In the opinion of the Court, this obligation rested on three general principles, namely, elementary considerations of humanity, the freedom of maritime communication and ‘every State’s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States’. But the Court also took account of the particular factual circumstances of the case in order to confirm its legal finding: it acknowledged that if the mines had been laid at the last possible moment, namely, less than 24 hours before the UK warships struck them it would have been difficult or even impossible to issue a general notification to third-State shipping. But, as the incident took place at a time by which the Albanian authorities could have had knowledge of the existence of the mines as a result of their close surveillance of the *Corfu Strait*, Albania did not observe its duty of due diligence. In *US Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran* the Court ruled that the acts of the demonstrators who took over the premises of the US embassy and held its staff hostage could not be imputed *per se* to the government of Iran. However, Iran bore responsibility because of its failure to observe its obligation under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (1961) to protect the inviolability of the persons and premises of another State’s diplomatic mission.\nIn *Congo v. Uganda* the Court dealt in the context of the first counterclaim of Uganda with the allegation that the Congo had violated its obligation of due diligence (or duty of vigilance) by failing to prevent the action of dissident armed bands against Uganda from its territory. The Court ruled that the existence and toleration of armed groups on Congolese territory could not be assimilated with active support to these groups; in addition, the Court took into account the inimical geographical terrain where the groups operated and the material inability of the Congolese (as well as the former Zairian) Government to effectively control that part of the territory of the State.

In the course of its reasoning the Court made some statements of principle regarding the duty to prevent (due diligence) even though it made it clear that it did not intend to introduce a general framework of universal application on the duty of due diligence; it observed that ‘the content of duty to prevent varies from one instrument to another, according to the wording of the relevant provisions, and depending on the nature of the acts to be prevented’. Then the Court analysed the content of the duty to prevent in relation to the crime of genocide. It stated at the outset that this duty was an obligation of conduct and not of result; hence, a State did not have the obligation to succeed in preventing genocide ‘whatever the circumstances’ but was under the obligation to ‘employ all means reasonably available’ to it to prevent the commission of the crime. Thus, failure to achieve the desired result does not give rise to responsibility; by contrast, responsibility arises in case of manifest failure to take all steps within its power that would contribute to preventing genocide because ‘in this area the notion of “due diligence”, which calls for an assessment in concreto, is of critical importance. Various parameters operate when assessing whether a State has duly discharged the obligation concerned’. The Court proceeded to identify those parameters in relation to the specific obligation to prevent genocide and found of particular importance the capacity to influence (within the limits of the law) the perpetrators on the basis of: (a) the geographical distance between the State concerned and the scene of the crime: and (b) the strength of political or other links between the State and the perpetrators. The essence of due diligence lies, therefore, in the application of all means at the disposal of the State even though such application may be proved on the basis of evidence to be futile; in other words a State must not be inert even in the knowledge that its measures will in all probability be ineffective to prevent the injurious act. Even though the Court found that the duty to prevent genocide would give rise to responsibility only when the crime was actually committed (viz. Article 14(3) ARS) it recognized that a State was not absolved from responsibility if it remains inactive until commission of the crime commences where there is a serious risk of its commission; in such a contingency the State is under the obligation to employ the means available to it to prevent the crime, otherwise the substance of the obligation would be negated.\n Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (Democratic Republic of the Congo v.

The latter contingency would require further evidence that the ultimate outcome was the direct result of acts or omissions amounting to the breach of this other primary rule and not simply the failure to adopt preventative measures that even they might not guarantee beyond all doubt that the end result would not occur.\nOn the basis of the preceding analysis it is submitted that the responsibility of a State for internationally wrongful acts in cyberspace may be established in customary law on the duty of due diligence in observing the obligation of not knowingly allowing its territory to be the source of acts violating the rights of other States. The content of the due diligence must be assessed by taking into account, first, that the use of the Internet is not unlawful *per se*; secondly, that transmission from a computer or a host of computers may or may not be the actual source of the injurious activity and; finally, that the existence of thousands of computers on the territory of a State does not by and of itself constitute knowledge of such injurious activity. Moreover, due diligence being an obligation of conduct and not of result does not entail as a necessary outcome the obligation to take steps to protect the rights of other States as this appears to go beyond the requirement to employ all means that a State reasonably possesses to prevent an unlawful act.76 Furthermore, knowledge of the cyber injurious act could be established only upon the notification by the victim State that has the discretion to select the States (they may be many) from the territories of which injurious transmissions occur.\nThe criteria for selection for notification are a matter of political decision, but once notification takes place ‘knowledge’ exists and the State or States notified are under an obligation to employ measures reasonably at their disposal to prevent the wrongful cyber activity. Such measures appear to be commensurate with the possession of technological capabilities to deny temporarily Internet service either to particular users or throughout the State, even though the latter may disproportionately affect the function of the governmental and economic infrastructure of the State. Thus, it appears to be a matter of balancing the cost of Internet denial to the State of origin against the effect of the injurious acts to the victim State and this is to be assessed in the particular circumstances of each case. However, total denial of service may not, in principle, be regarded as a reasonable response to injurious cyber acts; but it may not be excluded, either in particular circumstances or even more so when States appear prepared to resort to it to silence political opponents or contain internal unrest. What is important is that a State that is established to have knowledge of injurious cyber acts emanating from its territory is under a duty to act in a preventative manner irrespective of the fact\n\nNicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389\nDownloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM\nvia University of Tasmania\n\nthat the said cyber activity also originates from the territories of other States. To say that the failure to employ measures within that State’s capability is of no consequence because the wrongful cyber activity also emanates from computers located in a plurality of States does not absolve the former from responsibility under due diligence. The ICJ ruled in *Bosnian Genocide* that such an assertion is irrelevant to the breach of an obligation of conduct warranted by the duty of due diligence, especially when there is a possibility of cooperation through concerted action in a situation where the perpetrator of an injurious cyber act takes over a large number of computers situated in a plurality of States. Indeed, it is because of this contingency, so frequent in practice, that cooperation and concerted action is essential either on an *ad hoc* basis to counter specific wrongful cyber activities or on a more permanent basis through institutionalized mechanisms or a pre-existing framework of good practices in cyber-space. Thus, the NATO initiatives on information security are in principle steps in the right direction as well as the initiative of China and the Russian Federation for the introduction of an International Code of Conduct for Information Security.\n# 5. CONCLUSION\nCyberspace raises many challenges to the law on State responsibility as it has evolved through State practice, judicial decisions and the work of the ILC culminating in the 2001 ARS. Cyberspace as a domain has international dimensions; therefore it is in principle amenable to regulation by international law and the rules on State responsibility, in particular, may be applied. While a breach of an international obligation may be established without much difficulty in relation to certain types of cyber activity, it is attribution of it to a specific State that raises difficulties that in practice appear insurmountable and seem to defy the rules on attribution established in the ILC ARS.\nThese rules on attribution are centred on acts of persons and their imputation to a particular State. Moreover, the process of attribution is a juridical one. However, the nature of cyberspace as a domain, the freedom and the prima facie lawfulness of its use, the transmission of information through computers and the anonymity of the users of those computers leave very little scope for establishing with a relative degree of certainty both the identity of the user and his/her link to a specific State. The only fact that can be established with certainty is the location of a particular computer or computers in the territory of one or more States. This gives rise to the presumption that the State from the territory of which cyber injurious acts emanate could be the one that may incur responsibility. However, this does not dispense with the specific rules of\n Case Concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (n 16) 221.\n O’Connell (n 6) 206–9.\n NATO, ‘NATO and Cyber Defence’ (7 August 2014) <http: en=\"\" esp=\"\" natolive=\"\" topics_78170.htm?=\"\" www.nato.int=\"\"> accessed 13 August 2014.\n Letter dated 12 September 2011 from the Permanent Representatives of China, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary–General, Annex, A/66/359.\nNicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389\nDownloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM\nvia University of Tasmania</http:>\nState responsibility in cyberspace 71\nattribution and the fact that computers situated in the territory of a one or more States are the actual source of wrongful cyber acts as they may have been ‘hijacked’ by the real perpetrator. Hence there have been suggestions of overcoming this difficulty by addressing attribution more flexibly or even by going beyond its existing legal framework and establishing it on existing political relations between the States concerned. Whereas political relations may constitute a factor for a victim State of selecting another State or other States as the likely source of wrongful cyber activity, it should not constitute a substitute for the existing rules on attribution and should not dispense with the burden of proof of the grounds of attribution. This enterprise requires evidence and as this is not possible to collect on the territory of a State from which cyber activity occurs, circumstantial evidence may be admissible (for instance, the revelation in the press by former government agents that a State has engaged in wrongful cyber acts) as well as the reversal of the burden of proof upon the State allegedly perpetrating injurious cyber acts.\nThe difficulty in applying the existing rules on attribution could be overcome by focusing on the primary rule breached (namely, the specific international obligation) in conjunction with the duty of due diligence either by reference to the substantive content of the primary obligation or the general principle of international law that no State must knowingly allow its territory to be used for injurious acts against other States. In this manner, responsibility may be established on the fact that certain wrongful cyber acts have their source in computers located in the territory of a State or a plurality of States and it occurs with knowledge of the latter. This knowledge would be established on the basis of alerting the territorial State (or States) to the fact of wrongful cyber activity from its territory and its failure to act by employing measures within its capabilities to curb that activity. The best course of action to achieve cessation of injurious cyber acts appears to be through the adoption of good Internet practices and international cooperation.\nNicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389\nDownloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM via University of Tasmania",

    "## 1. INTRODUCTION": "The terms Internet and Cyberspace are household words. They represent domains the use of which is indispensable to the entire or at least a substantial part of the global population. At the same time, as this author understands it, they are not identical in meaning as a matter of computer science terminology. The Internet is a ‘global network connecting millions of computers’; it is ‘decentralized by design’, subject to ownership or control (unlike ‘online services’) by no single (or a plurality of) person or entity.¹ The Internet has a physical dimension because of the interconnection of different computer systems, their accessibility and the transmission of information to and from such systems by using the standard Internet Protocol (IP).² Cyberspace, however, is a more abstract term; it is a non-physical domain created by computer systems that allows people to communicate with each other, to exchange or to gather information. Moreover, it refers to the ‘notional environment in which digitized information is communicated over computer networks’.³ Be this as it may, it appears that there exists a tendency to treat these two terms as synonyms and use them interchangeably. To give an example, the US Government Cyber Policy Review 2009 defines cyberspace as ‘the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, and includes the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers in critical industries. Common usage of the term also refers to the virtual environment of information and interactions between people’.⁴ It appears therefore, that apart from identity in terms, these two concepts have a dual role: they refer to the domain as well as to the medium of conducting certain activities. Furthermore, it would be an understatement to say that the Internet is important to private individuals, corporations and States: the US Government has stated that cyberspace / the Internet underlines every aspect of modern society and it is both the\n¹ Vangie Beal, ‘Internet’ (Webopedia) <http: Internet.html=\"\" term=\"\" www.webopedia.com=\"\"> accessed on 1 November 2013.\n² Bill Young, ‘Navigating Cyberspace: Introduction to Cyberspace’ (9 January 2013) University of Texas <http: cs329e=\"\" slides1-introduction.pdf=\"\" www.cs.utexas.edu=\"\" ~byoung=\"\"> accessed on 4 November 2013.\n³ US Department of Defense, ‘Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms’ JP 1–02 (12 April 2001, as amended through 31 August 2005) 139.\n⁴ The White House, ‘Cyberspace Policy Review: Assuring a trusted and resilient information and communications infrastructure’ (2009) <http: assets=\"\" documents=\"\" cyberspace_policy_review_final.pdf=\"\" www.whitehouse.gov=\"\"> 1, accessed on 4 November 2013.\nNicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389\nDownloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM\nvia University of Tasmania</http:></http:></http:>\nResearch handbook on international law and cyberspace\ndomain where and the medium by which economic, public safety, civil society and national security activities are pursued.⁵\nWhile the usefulness of the Internet is universally acknowledged, the same is the case with regard to its misuse or hostile use, in the form of cyber-crime and espionage.⁶ In particular, as nowadays private business and governments conduct most of their functions and activities in cyberspace, safety and resilience are matters to be preserved. In the words of the US Cyber Policy Review 2009 ‘to realize the full benefits of digital revolution, users must have confidence that sensitive information is secure, commerce is not compromised and the infrastructure is not infiltrated. Nation-states also need confidence that the networks that support their national security and economic prosperity are safe and resilient. ...’⁷ It is, therefore, not inconceivable that the Internet may be used in such a way as to cause harm to States or as to compel them to act in a particular manner. There have been three episodes in State practice that have revealed how the hostile use of the Internet may affect the orderly function of basic services in a State or threaten its security. In 2007 Estonia was the object of massive and coordinated computer hacking attacks that paralyzed its economy and the functioning of government services for weeks. In 2008 Georgia was the target of similar attacks during the conflict with the Russian Federation with respect to South Ossetia. Also, in 2009 a computer virus by the name of Stuxnet caused the progress of the nuclear program of Iran to suffer significant delay.⁸ In this context the question arises whether such use of the Internet may give rise to State responsibility. The answer must be in the affirmative provided that a specific use of the Internet amounts to an ‘internationally wrongful act’.⁹ As the Internet is an international domain, then States must conduct themselves over this domain in accordance with international law¹⁰ and therefore the use of cyberspace is subject to international law. As Harold Koh, the former Legal Advisor of the US State Department has remarked ‘international law principles do apply in cyberspace. ...’¹¹ However, there are substantive challenges facing the law on international responsibility as it exists in contemporary international law by the particularities of cyberspace since this body of rules is premised heavily on attribution of acts of individuals to a State. Be as it may, the present author submits, that the application of this area of international law to cyberspace is not impossible, mainly as a result of establishing responsibility on the basis of the breach of the obligation of due diligence on the part of States, which dispenses with the difficulty of attributing acts of individuals to a State, while even attribution may in certain cases be established.

    "## 2. AN OUTLINE OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF STATE RESPONSIBILITY": "State responsibility appears to have emerged as a branch of international law by way of private law analogy.¹³ As the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ) ruled in Factory at Chorzów (Indemnities) ‘it is a principle of international law, and even a general conception of law, that any breach of an engagement involves an obligation to make reparation’.¹⁴ However, subsequent judicial pronouncements and the work of the International Law Commission (ILC) form a departure from legal analogies with the domestic law of tort in favour of reconstructing the responsibility as a matter of international public law arising when, an act: (1) is attributable to a State; and (2) constitutes a breach of an international obligation. In US Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran the International Court (ICJ) stated that it had to ‘determine how far, legally, the acts in question may be regarded as imputable to the Iranian State’ and whether they were compatible or not ‘with the obligations of Iran under treaties in force or under any other rules of international law that may be applicable’.¹⁵ Moreover, in Bosnian Genocide the ICJ ruled with regard to the breach of the Genocide Convention that ‘the obligations in question … and the responsibilities of States that would arise from breach of such obligations are obligations and responsibilities under international law. They are not of a criminal nature’.¹⁶\nThe contemporary law of State responsibility has as its principal source of reference the Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARS)\n¹² Ibid.

However, since 2001 it has been so extensively cited by international courts and tribunals, as well as in State practice, that it is considered as an authoritative statement of the customary international law on State responsibility.¹⁸ The legal regime introduced by ARS is premised on the distinction introduced by ILC Rapporteur Roberto Ago between ‘primary obligations’ and ‘secondary rules’. The very first paragraph of the Introduction of the Commentaries to ARS states that:\nThe emphasis is on the secondary rules of State responsibility, that is to say, the general conditions under international law for the State to be considered responsible for wrongful actions or omissions, and the legal consequences which flow therefrom. The articles do not attempt to define the content of the international obligations breach of which gives rise to responsibility.¹⁹\nA second basic feature of ARS is that it views responsibility of States not as an exclusive pattern of bilateral relations between the wrongdoing and injured State. By contrast, State responsibility is given a public order dimension by laying emphasis on the existence of an internationally wrongful act²⁰ and not upon the damage or injury caused and the existence of a causal link between the damage and the breach of obligation. Thus, the Commentary to Article 1 ARS states that:\n[T]he term ‘international responsibility’ ... covers the relations which arise under international law from the internationally wrongful act of a State, whether such relations are limited to the wrongdoing State and one injured State or whether they extend also to other States or indeed to other subjects of international law, and whether they are centred on obligations of restitution or compensation or also give the injured State the possibility of responding by way of counter-measures.²¹\nMoreover, this dimension of State responsibility is further supported by Articles 40 and 48 ARS dealing, respectively, with serious breaches of obligations arising under a peremptory norm of international law and the invocation of the responsibility of a State by States other than the injured party.\nAs the emphasis in ARS lies in the wrongful act, central position is given to its requirements, namely, attribution to a State and breach of an international obligation (Art. 2 ARS). Attribution means ‘the operation of attaching a given act or omission to a State’²² and to this end the ARS relies on the identity of natural persons and their\n¹⁷  Yearbook of the ILC, vol.

As the Commentary to Article 2 ARS makes absolutely clear the fact is that States act through human beings or groups; therefore, the issue of attribution is reduced to identifying the persons or groups that should be considered to act on behalf of the State.²³ This finding appears to rest on a dual basis that is disjunctively applied: either the identity of a person or group as such or the control exercised by a State over the activities of a person or a group. In a nutshell, the ARS, for the purposes of attribution, are centred on the individual. Thus, the responsibility of a State is engaged for acts or omissions by the following categories of individuals:\n(a) De jure State agents or organs, irrespective of their hierarchical position in the apparatus of the State or the constitutional structure or organization of the State (namely, whether it is a unitary or federal State) (Art.4 ARS);\n(b) De facto State organs, namely, non-State actors or entities that have been 'elevated' to de facto State agents or organs because they are under the absolute dependence and control of a State. In Bosnian Genocide the issue before the ICJ was whether the atrocities perpetrated by the Bosnian Serbs in Srebrenica in July 1995, which as the Court ruled amounted to commission of genocide under the 1948 Genocide Convention, could be attributed to Serbia. The Court ruled that:\n[t]his question has in fact two aspects, which the Court must consider separately. First, it should be ascertained whether the acts committed in Srebrenica were perpetrated by organs of the Respondent [namely, Serbia], i.e., by persons or entities whose conduct is necessarily attributable to it, because they are in fact instruments of its action. Next, if the preceding question is answered in the negative, it should be ascertained whether the acts in question were committed by persons who, while not organs of the Respondent, did nevertheless act on the instruments of, or under the direction or control of, the Respondent.²⁴\nThe Court then proceeded to identify de facto States organs as;\npersons, groups of persons or entities [that], may for purposes of international responsibility, be equated with State organs even if that status does not follow from internal law, provided that in fact the persons, groups or entities act in 'complete dependence' on the State of which they are ultimately the instrument ...²⁵;\n(c) Delegation of Government Authority. In this contingency the conduct of a non-State actor (i.e. 'a person or entity which is not the organ of the State') is to be considered as an act of the State if the non-State actor 'is empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of governmental authority' and it 'is acting in that capacity in the particular instance' (Art. 5 ARS);\n(d) The situation where an organ of a State is placed at the disposal of another State. The acts or omissions of this organ in the exercise of government authority on behalf of the State at the disposal of which it has been placed give rise to this State's responsibility (Art. 6 ARS);\n²³ Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (n 19) 35.\n²⁴ Case Concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (n 16) (Merits) 201.\n²⁵ Ibid. 205 [emphasis added].\nNicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389\nDownloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM\nvia University of Tasmania\nResearch handbook on international law and cyberspace\n(e) Ultra Vires Acts. A State organ or entity gives rise to the responsibility of the State even when acting in this capacity it exceeds its authority or against instructions (Art.7 ARS);\n(f) Instructions, Direction and Control of a State over acts of private persons. In the jurisprudence of the ICJ this control must be ‘effective control’ in order to give rise to the responsibility of the State. The Court reached this finding in Nicaragua where it ruled that the US assistance to the contras and its general control over them were not sufficient in default of further evidence to attribute their acts violating human rights and humanitarian law to the US government. By contrast ‘[f]or this conduct to give rise to legal responsibility of the United States, it would in principle have to be proved that that State had effective control of the military and paramilitary operations in the course of which the alleged violations were committed.’ 26 Moreover, in Bosnian Genocide the Court, having found that the Bosnian Serbs did not constitute a de facto organ of Serbia, proceeded to determine whether Serbia exercised effective control over them. The Court explained that the:\ntest thus formulated differs in two respects from the test ... to determine whether a person or entity may be equated with a State organ even if not having that status under internal law. First, in this context it is not necessary to show that the persons who performed the acts alleged to have violated international law were in general in a relationship of ‘complete dependence’ on the respondent State; it has to be proved that they acted in accordance with the State’s instructions or under its ‘effective control’. It must however be shown that this ‘effective control’ was exercised, or that the State’s instructions were given, in respect of each operation in which the alleged violations occurred, not generally in respect of the overall actions taken by the persons or groups of persons having committed the violations.27\nIn this respect, the Court declined to uphold the ruling of the ICTY Appeals Chamber in the Tadić case where the ad hoc Tribunal applied the test of ‘overall control’ that dispenses with the need to evaluate control of a State over each specific operation of a non-State actor;28 the Court took the view that the determination of State responsibility on the part of Serbia did not constitute an indispensable finding to determine individual criminal responsibility by an international criminal tribunal29 (Art. 8 ARS);\n(g) Exercise of elements of government authority in the absence of or inadequate function of State authorities and in circumstances that warrant the exercise of this authority. In Yeager v. Islamic Republic of Iran the Iran-US Claims Tribunal ruled\n26 Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

Tadić,  ICTY Appeals Chamber Judgment, IT–94–1–A, para. 145; but cf. ibid. paras 118–122, where the Tribunal has drawn a distinction between acts performed by private individuals to which the effective control test applies (as articulated in Nicaragua Case) and organized military groups to which the overall control test applies.\n29 Case Concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (n 16) 209–10.\nNicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389\nDownloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM\nvia University of Tasmania\nState responsibility in cyberspace 61\nthat the immigration, customs and other similar acts that had been carried out by the Revolutionary Guards at the Tehran airport in the immediate aftermath of the Islamic revolution were attributable to Iran. The Tribunal reasoned that even though these functions were not authorized by the Iranian government they objectively consisted in the exercise of elements of governmental authority in the absence of official authorities of the State ‘in operations of which the new Government must have had knowledge and to which it did not specifically object.’³⁰ (Art. 9 ARS);\n(h) The ARS provides in particular that acts or omissions by an insurrectional or other movement are attributed to a State in the event the insurrection is successful and the movement become the government of the State (Art. 10 ARS);\n(i) Approval and Adoption by a State of acts of private persons or entities. In US Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran the Court ruled that the act of overrunning of the US Embassy in Tehran by demonstrators and the seizure as hostages of the US diplomatic staff could not be as such attributed to the Iranian Government because the demonstrators were neither State organs nor did they carry out a specific government act on behalf of the State³¹. However, the responsibility of Iran for the acts of the demonstrators was established at a later stage when the Iranian government approved of and adopted the occupation of the Embassy premises and the captivity of the US diplomatic staff as its own³² (Art.11 ARS).\nThe second requirement of State responsibility, namely a breach of an international obligation, may consist in a physical act or omission and may emanate from a rule of either customary law or treaty (Art. 12 ARS) that introduces an obligation in force for the particular State (Art.13 ARS). Moreover, the responsibility of a State may arise whether the act is or is not of a continuing character (Arts 14 and 15 ARS) or it constitutes part of a composite activity. Furthermore, State responsibility arises with respect to acts of other States. This is not to say that acts of other States are attributed to another State for, as the ILC has made clear, the ARS is premised on the principle that ‘each State is responsible for its own wrongful conduct … attributable to it … which is in breach of an international obligation of that State …’ and that ‘responsibility is specific to the State concerned’.³³ Even though in this respect the ILC identifies contingencies of ‘collaborative conduct’³⁴ it does not appear to introduce a particular legal framework of ‘shared responsibility’ for the collaborative element appears to be viewed simply as a factual rather than a normative parameter.³⁵ This is further corroborated by Article 47(1) ARS on the invocation of State responsibility for an\n³⁰  17 Iran–US Claims Tribunal Rep.

Having said this, the responsibility of a State for the acts of another State arises on the basis of conduct of the former State in relation to the latter that consists in aid or assistance, direction and control and coercion (of the latter State). In each of these contingencies there must be two requirements cumulatively: first, the conduct must be internationally wrongful if it was committed by the other State and, secondly, the aiding/controlling/coercing State must have knowledge of the circumstances of the internationally wrongful act (Arts 16–18 ARS). Finally, the ILC ARS provide for grounds precluding the wrongfulness of an act that *prima facie* constitutes a breach of an international obligation; these are: consent (Art. 20); self-defence (Art. 21); countermeasures (Arts 22, 49–54); *force majeure* (Art. 23); distress (Art. 24); and necessity (Art. 25).",
    "# 3. ATTRIBUTION IN CYBERSPACE": "Cyberspace as a domain and the use of electronic devices as a medium of State conduct raises difficulties with respect to ascribing particular acts to States. There is no reason sweepingly to deny as a matter of principle the application of the rules of attribution provided in ARS to conduct in cyberspace. However, the identification of individuals or entities that use the Internet is characterized by considerable difficulty, for the Internet guarantees, if not actually absolute, certainly a large measure of anonymity or deniability. Thus, it is almost impossible to identify directly and with certainty the person or entity operating a personal computer. Identification of persons, and by consequence, attribution is only possible via the identification of a computer by way of its IP that identifies its precise location.\nTherefore, an internationally wrongful act in cyberspace appears to be ascribed to a particular computer whereas the identity of the person operating it may only be established either by way of presumption or on the basis of inside information disclosed by government agents of the State perpetrating the internationally wrongful acts in cyberspace.³⁶ Thus, if a computer is identified by way of its location (in the premises of a government department or a diplomatic mission) as a government computer then the transmission of malware or denial of service interference may in principle be attributed to a particular State. This appears to be established either on the identity of the operator who is presumed to be a government agent or on the mere location of the computer as this falls under the exclusive and complete control of a State. Thus, in October and November 2013 the German Government launched strong diplomatic protests with the US and UK Governments for allegations of electronic surveillance of German governmental departments, including the German Chancellor’s\n³⁶ Viz. the information disclosed by the former US National Security Agency (NSA) Edward Snowden on the NSA surveillance of many foreign government agencies; see Joshua Eaton, ‘Timeline of Edward Snowden’s revelations’, *Al Jazeera America* <http: articles=\"\" multimedia=\"\" timeline–edward–snowden–revelations.html=\"\" www.dailymotion.com=\"\"> accessed on 26 November 2013.\nNicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389\nDownloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM\nvia University of Tasmania</http:>\nState responsibility in cyberspace 63\nOffice, from the US and UK embassies in Berlin. In particular, the German Government warned the UK ambassador that the interception of German Government information by intelligence services from a diplomatic mission constituted a breach of international law.³⁷\nAt the same time, the Tallinn Manual adopts a rather cautious approach to attribution with respect to cyber wrongful acts by stating that the fact that a cyber operation has its source in government cyber infrastructure is not sufficient to attribute these acts to a State; it merely constitutes an indication that a particular State is associated with the cyber operation. The Manual explains this approach by reference to the particular features of cyber context and especially the likelihood that a government cyber infrastructure may be ‘hijacked’ by non-State actors.³⁸ Moreover, the former Legal Advisor of the US Department of State has acknowledged the problem of attribution in that cyberspace ‘significantly increases an actor’s ability to engage in attacks with “plausible deniability”, by acting through proxies’ and suggested that this challenge is ‘as much [a question] of a technical and policy nature rather than exclusively or predominantly’ a question of law.³⁹ But attribution is predominantly a question of law and it is not determined ‘on the mere recognition of a link of factual causality’.⁴⁰ Furthermore, neither the Tallinn Manual nor the US Government propose an alternative cogent framework of attribution but leave the whole issue surrounded in ambiguity which suggests a wide margin of discretion on the part of an injured State to decide the matter of attribution on the basis of extra-legal factors, such as the general political climate between it and another State.⁴¹ In the absence of an alternative proposition it appears that this position casts aside the current legal framework of attribution by replacing it with a laissez faire approach by an injured State on a case-by-case basis.\nAttribution of an injurious act to a State is a matter of evidence. As injurious acts in cyberspace emanate from computers located in the territory of one or more States the territorial location of computers may serve as a starting-point. State sovereignty entails the expectation that every State exercises control over cyber infrastructure and activities within its territory.⁴² However, as the ICJ ruled in Corfu Channel the mere fact of existence of objects constituting a source of injurious acts (in this case computers engaged in injurious cyber acts) within its territory is not sufficient to impute knowledge of these acts to the State. At the same time, the victim State is permitted ‘a more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence’.⁴³ This lower\n³⁷ Nigel Morris et. al., ‘Germany calls in Britain’s ambassador to demand explanation over “secret Berlin listening post”’ (6 November 2013) The Independent <http: news=\"\" uk=\"\" politics=\"\" germany--calls--in--britains--ambassador--to--demand--explanation--over--secret--berlin--listening--post--8923082.html=\"\" www.independent.co.uk=\"\"> accessed 13 August 2014.\n³⁸ Michael N.

In the cyber context the establishment of the exact and actual source of the injurious act is extremely difficult to locate, let alone establish the identity of the perpetrator.⁴⁴ Thus, it appears that a very liberal approach to evidence is called for by the very nature of cyberspace that would combine expert technical knowledge, press reports⁴⁵ (where available) revelation by defector public officials of a State (the US NSA surveillance activities were divulged by former NSA official Edward Snowden) even though the fact of defection may diminish its probative value as evidence contrary to the interests of his own State.⁴⁶ The inherent difficulty in identifying a single State as the source of an injurious cyber act⁴⁷ appears to leave the victim State two possible avenues: either the identification of the perpetrating State on the basis of the existing political climate between it and the victim State or cooperation with other States whether in the context of international organizations or not. The first avenue may entail a degree of arbitrariness and ultimately it does not, and cannot by itself, establish responsibility in the absence of more objective evidence. By contrast, the second avenue offers a better potential of identifying the alleged wrong-doing State. The fact, however, remains that such identification defies to a large extent the established legal framework of attribution.\nOn the basis of the assumption that injurious cyber activity can be traced to the territory of a single State it is submitted that the best approach in the cyber context is to attribute hostile cyber acts to this State on the basis of a presumption of responsibility which may be rebutted by the State on the basis of evidence. In other words, attribution may rest on a presumption that introduces a reversal of the burden of proof. This submission departs from the ruling of the ICJ in Corfu Channel but unlike sea-mines, computers are ubiquitous and by their nature not injurious. Thus, all that has to be established is their location in the territory of a particular State and the latter's alertness by the victim to the fact that injurious cyber acts emanate therefrom. Once this takes place knowledge of the injurious activity is established. It is true that the State from the territory of which the injurious acts emanate may not constitute their actual source, as the computers on its territory may have been hijacked. But this is no reason to deny the right of the victim to alert this State and demand measures on its part for the cessation of the injurious activities. Such measures may entail, depending on the circumstances, a degree of denial of Internet services throughout the territory of that State, and it is a question of balancing the interests of both the victim State and the State from the territory of which the particular cyber activity emanates on whether or not this is feasible.⁴⁸ However, this cannot be prima facie excluded as a possibility in\n⁴⁴ Tsagourias (n 41) 233–5.\n⁴⁵ Cf. Nicaragua Case (n 26) 40–41.\n⁴⁶ Ibid. 43.\n⁴⁷ Tsagourias mentions that the cyber attack on Estonia in 2007 ‘involved a large botnet of approximately 85,000 hijacked computers from around 178 countries’: see: (n 41) 233.\n⁴⁸ Tallinn Manual (n 38) 33.\nNicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389\nDownloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM\nvia University of Tasmania\nState responsibility in cyberspace 65\nview of the fact that States in other circumstances (for instance, when facing unrest by dissident political groups) are all too prepared to adopt sweeping measures of Internet service-denial even throughout their territories. Having said this, there appears to be only one situation in which injurious cyber acts may not be imputed to the territorial State, namely, where the acts emanate from a location that is under the exclusive jurisdiction of another State, such as the premises of a diplomatic mission or the installation of a military base. In the context of the US NSA electronic surveillance practices it was reported that special units located on the rooftops of a number of US embassies in Europe and Asia (such as the US embassies in Athens and Baku) collected data.⁴⁹ In these cases these acts would not be attributed to the host States (respectively, Greece and Azerbaijan) but to the USA.",
    "## 4. BREACH OF AN INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATION IN CYBERSPACE": "There is no difficulty with the proposition that activities in cyberspace may constitute breach of international obligations giving rise to State responsibility. Thus, certain acts may violate the sovereignty of another State or other States, in the sense of interfering in areas of competence that are exclusively reserved to every State. This contingency may be relative to incidents of electronic surveillance of, or espionage against, government departments and personnel of another State.⁵⁰ However, there is no consensus on this issue: according to a school of thought that relies on the famous (or infamous?) Lotus principle,⁵¹ espionage is not prohibited or regulated by international law; therefore, its practice does not as such constitute a breach of the sovereignty of another State, unless perhaps some additional damage is caused.⁵² On the other hand, it is argued that if an act is not expressly prohibited by international law this does not lead necessarily and automatically to its permissibility;⁵³ espionage, in particular, is practiced extensively by States but no government has ever asserted that it constitutes a lawful enterprise.⁵⁴ Moreover, cyber acts may constitute instances of unlawful intervention in the internal or external affairs of another State, provided the element of ‘coercion’ exists,⁵⁵ or use of force.⁵⁶\n⁴⁹ Morris (n 37).\n⁵⁰ On cyber espionage and international law see Buchan (Ch 8 of this book).\n⁵¹ The Case of the ‘S.S.

The considerable difficulty of attribution of an act perpetrated in cyberspace on the basis of the identity or the link of a person or of an entity operating computers to a State, points at the other, in most cases the only, ground for establishing responsibility: the violation of the duty of due diligence arising from the principle that no State may knowingly allow its territory to be used for, or be the source of, acts injurious to other States.57 The proof of attribution in this contingency is made redundant because it concerns an omission to act in accordance with a primary obligation and it may be established by the fact that a State possesses the requisite infrastructure operated by its agents or de facto agents or private parties to which government authority was delegated, to prevent such injurious acts. Thus, due diligence is the primary obligation the breach of which (failure to act or omission) ensures the observance of other primary obligations (either based on treaty or customary law). The precise content and extent of due diligence varies in conjunction with specific obligations. The ILC has deliberately refrained from including due diligence in the Articles on State Responsibility because this would entail examination of the content of primary rules; nevertheless, it did point out that there is a presumption that any primary rule contains a qualification of due diligence.58\nIn the context of trans-boundary harm from hazardous activities the ILC has adopted the view that the duty of due diligence involved does not extend to guaranteeing that significant harm is to be totally prevented if it is impossible to do so. Furthermore the ILC stated that the standard of due diligence to assess the conduct of a State would be that which would be deemed 'appropriate and proportional to the degree of risk of trans-boundary harm in the particular instance'.59 Moreover, the Sea Bed Disputes Chamber of the International Tribunal of the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) ruled in its Advisory Opinion in the Responsibilities and Obligations of States with respect to Activities in the Area ruled that due diligence is a 'variable concept' and the standard it may set may change as a result of scientific and technological developments as well as the risks involved in a particular activity.60\nIn the human rights field the duty of due diligence has been upheld in Velasquez-Rodriguez in which the Inter-American Court of Human Rights interpreted the obligation introduced in Article 1(1) of the Inter-American Convention of Human Rights to respect and ensure the exercise of the rights enshrined in the Convention. The Court ruled that the obligation to 'ensure' the exercise of these rights gave rise to the duty of contracting States to organize the governmental infrastructure in such a way so as to ensure 'free and full enjoyment' of the rights and prevent, investigate and punish\n57 Corfu Channel Case (n 43) 22.\n58 Report of the International Law Commission on the work of its 51st session (Supplement No 10, 3 May–23 July 1999) GAOR, A/54/10, 86; Jan A Hessbruegge, ‘The historical development of the doctrines of attribution and due diligence in international law’ (2004) N.Y.U.

In *Corfu Channel* the Court ruled at the outset that the mere existence of the source of an injurious act (in this case the mines) in the territory of Albania was not sufficient to attribute this act to the State, for the control exercised by a State over its territory as a result of sovereignty does not establish *prima facie* knowledge of every activity taking place therein.⁶² After establishing knowledge by Albania of the laying of mines in its territorial sea,⁶³ the Court ruled that the responsibility of Albania lay in her failure to notify the existence of a minefield in its territorial sea to third-State shipping. In the opinion of the Court, this obligation rested on three general principles, namely, elementary considerations of humanity, the freedom of maritime communication and ‘every State’s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States’.⁶⁴ But the Court also took account of the particular factual circumstances of the case in order to confirm its legal finding: it acknowledged that if the mines had been laid at the last possible moment, namely, less than 24 hours before the UK warships struck them it would have been difficult or even impossible to issue a general notification to third-State shipping. But, as the incident took place at a time by which the Albanian authorities could have had knowledge of the existence of the mines as a result of their close surveillance of the *Corfu Strait*, Albania did not observe its duty of due diligence.⁶⁵ In *US Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran* the Court ruled that the acts of the demonstrators who took over the premises of the US embassy and held its staff hostage could not be imputed *per se* to the government of Iran. However, Iran bore responsibility because of its failure to observe its obligation under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (1961) to protect the inviolability of the persons and premises of another State’s diplomatic mission.⁶⁶\nIn *Congo v. Uganda* the Court dealt in the context of the first counterclaim of Uganda with the allegation that the Congo had violated its obligation of due diligence (or duty of vigilance) by failing to prevent the action of dissident armed bands against Uganda from its territory. The Court ruled that the existence and toleration of armed groups on Congolese territory could not be assimilated with active support to these groups; in addition, the Court took into account the inimical geographical terrain where the groups operated and the material inability of the Congolese (as well as the former Zairian) Government to effectively control that part of the territory of the State. Thus,\n⁶¹ Velasquez–Rodriguez v. Honduras (Judgment of 29 July 1988)  Inter–Am. Ct.

It stated at the outset that this duty was an obligation of conduct and not of result; hence, a State did not have the obligation to succeed in preventing genocide ‘whatever the circumstances’ but was under the obligation to ‘employ all means reasonably available’ to it to prevent the commission of the crime.⁷⁰ Thus, failure to achieve the desired result does not give rise to responsibility; by contrast, responsibility arises in case of manifest failure to take all steps within its power that would contribute to preventing genocide because ‘in this area the notion of “due diligence”, which calls for an assessment in concreto, is of critical importance. Various parameters operate when assessing whether a State has duly discharged the obligation concerned’.⁷¹ The Court proceeded to identify those parameters in relation to the specific obligation to prevent genocide and found of particular importance the capacity to influence (within the limits of the law) the perpetrators on the basis of: (a) the geographical distance between the State concerned and the scene of the crime: and (b) the strength of political or other links between the State and the perpetrators.⁷² The essence of due diligence lies, therefore, in the application of all means at the disposal of the State even though such application may be proved on the basis of evidence to be futile; in other words a State must not be inert even in the knowledge that its measures will in all probability be ineffective to prevent the injurious act.⁷³ Even though the Court found that the duty to prevent genocide would give rise to responsibility only when the crime was actually committed (viz. Article 14(3) ARS) it recognized that a State was not absolved from responsibility if it remains inactive until commission of the crime commences where there is a serious risk of its commission; in such a contingency the State is under the obligation to employ the means available to it to prevent the crime, otherwise the substance of the obligation would be negated.⁷⁴\n⁶⁷ Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (Democratic Republic of the Congo v.

The latter contingency would require further evidence that the ultimate outcome was the direct result of acts or omissions amounting to the breach of this other primary rule and not simply the failure to adopt preventative measures that even they might not guarantee beyond all doubt that the end result would not occur.\nOn the basis of the preceding analysis it is submitted that the responsibility of a State for internationally wrongful acts in cyberspace may be established in customary law on the duty of due diligence in observing the obligation of not knowingly allowing its territory to be the source of acts violating the rights of other States. The content of the due diligence must be assessed by taking into account, first, that the use of the Internet is not unlawful *per se*; secondly, that transmission from a computer or a host of computers may or may not be the actual source of the injurious activity and; finally, that the existence of thousands of computers on the territory of a State does not by and of itself constitute knowledge of such injurious activity. Moreover, due diligence being an obligation of conduct and not of result does not entail as a necessary outcome the obligation to take steps to protect the rights of other States as this appears to go beyond the requirement to employ all means that a State reasonably possesses to prevent an unlawful act.76 Furthermore, knowledge of the cyber injurious act could be established only upon the notification by the victim State that has the discretion to select the States (they may be many) from the territories of which injurious transmissions occur.\nThe criteria for selection for notification are a matter of political decision, but once notification takes place ‘knowledge’ exists and the State or States notified are under an obligation to employ measures reasonably at their disposal to prevent the wrongful cyber activity. Such measures appear to be commensurate with the possession of technological capabilities to deny temporarily Internet service either to particular users or throughout the State, even though the latter may disproportionately affect the function of the governmental and economic infrastructure of the State. Thus, it appears to be a matter of balancing the cost of Internet denial to the State of origin against the effect of the injurious acts to the victim State and this is to be assessed in the particular circumstances of each case. However, total denial of service may not, in principle, be regarded as a reasonable response to injurious cyber acts; but it may not be excluded, either in particular circumstances or even more so when States appear prepared to resort to it to silence political opponents or contain internal unrest. What is important is that a State that is established to have knowledge of injurious cyber acts emanating from its territory is under a duty to act in a preventative manner irrespective of the fact\n75 *Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay (Argentina v. Uruguay)*  ICJ Rep. 14, 77.\n76 Cf. Tallinn Manual (n 38) 33.\nNicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389\nDownloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM\nvia University of Tasmania\n70 Research handbook on international law and cyberspace\nthat the said cyber activity also originates from the territories of other States. To say that the failure to employ measures within that State’s capability is of no consequence because the wrongful cyber activity also emanates from computers located in a plurality of States does not absolve the former from responsibility under due diligence. The ICJ ruled in *Bosnian Genocide* that such an assertion is irrelevant to the breach of an obligation of conduct warranted by the duty of due diligence, especially when there is a possibility of cooperation through concerted action in a situation where the perpetrator of an injurious cyber act takes over a large number of computers situated in a plurality of States.⁷⁷ Indeed, it is because of this contingency, so frequent in practice, that cooperation and concerted action is essential either on an *ad hoc* basis to counter specific wrongful cyber activities or on a more permanent basis through institutionalized mechanisms or a pre-existing framework of good practices in cyber-space.⁷⁸ Thus, the NATO initiatives on information security are in principle steps in the right direction⁷⁹ as well as the initiative of China and the Russian Federation for the introduction of an International Code of Conduct for Information Security.⁸⁰",
    "# 5. CONCLUSION": "Cyberspace raises many challenges to the law on State responsibility as it has evolved through State practice, judicial decisions and the work of the ILC culminating in the 2001 ARS. Cyberspace as a domain has international dimensions; therefore it is in principle amenable to regulation by international law and the rules on State responsibility, in particular, may be applied. While a breach of an international obligation may be established without much difficulty in relation to certain types of cyber activity, it is attribution of it to a specific State that raises difficulties that in practice appear insurmountable and seem to defy the rules on attribution established in the ILC ARS.\nThese rules on attribution are centred on acts of persons and their imputation to a particular State. Moreover, the process of attribution is a juridical one. However, the nature of cyberspace as a domain, the freedom and the prima facie lawfulness of its use, the transmission of information through computers and the anonymity of the users of those computers leave very little scope for establishing with a relative degree of certainty both the identity of the user and his/her link to a specific State. The only fact that can be established with certainty is the location of a particular computer or computers in the territory of one or more States. This gives rise to the presumption that the State from the territory of which cyber injurious acts emanate could be the one that may incur responsibility. However, this does not dispense with the specific rules of\n⁷⁷ Case Concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (n 16) 221.\n⁷⁸ O’Connell (n 6) 206–9.\n⁷⁹ NATO, ‘NATO and Cyber Defence’ (7 August 2014) <http: en=\"\" esp=\"\" natolive=\"\" topics_78170.htm?=\"\" www.nato.int=\"\"> accessed 13 August 2014.\n⁸⁰ Letter dated 12 September 2011 from the Permanent Representatives of China, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary–General, Annex, A/66/359.\nNicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389\nDownloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM\nvia University of Tasmania</http:>\nState responsibility in cyberspace 71\nattribution and the fact that computers situated in the territory of a one or more States are the actual source of wrongful cyber acts as they may have been ‘hijacked’ by the real perpetrator. Hence there have been suggestions of overcoming this difficulty by addressing attribution more flexibly or even by going beyond its existing legal framework and establishing it on existing political relations between the States concerned. Whereas political relations may constitute a factor for a victim State of selecting another State or other States as the likely source of wrongful cyber activity, it should not constitute a substitute for the existing rules on attribution and should not dispense with the burden of proof of the grounds of attribution. This enterprise requires evidence and as this is not possible to collect on the territory of a State from which cyber activity occurs, circumstantial evidence may be admissible (for instance, the revelation in the press by former government agents that a State has engaged in wrongful cyber acts) as well as the reversal of the burden of proof upon the State allegedly perpetrating injurious cyber acts.\nThe difficulty in applying the existing rules on attribution could be overcome by focusing on the primary rule breached (namely, the specific international obligation) in conjunction with the duty of due diligence either by reference to the substantive content of the primary obligation or the general principle of international law that no State must knowingly allow its territory to be used for injurious acts against other States. In this manner, responsibility may be established on the fact that certain wrongful cyber acts have their source in computers located in the territory of a State or a plurality of States and it occurs with knowledge of the latter. This knowledge would be established on the basis of alerting the territorial State (or States) to the fact of wrongful cyber activity from its territory and its failure to act by employing measures within its capabilities to curb that activity. The best course of action to achieve cessation of injurious cyber acts appears to be through the adoption of good Internet practices and international cooperation.\nNicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389\nDownloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM via University of Tasmania"

They represent domains the use of which is indispensable to the entire or at least a substantial part of the global population. At the same time, as this author understands it, they are not identical in meaning as a matter of computer science terminology. The Internet is a ‘global network connecting millions of computers’; it is ‘decentralized by design’, subject to ownership or control (unlike ‘online services’) by no single (or a plurality of) person or entity. The Internet has a physical dimension because of the interconnection of different computer systems, their accessibility and the transmission of information to and from such systems by using the standard Internet Protocol (IP). Cyberspace, however, is a more abstract term; it is a non-physical domain created by computer systems that allows people to communicate with each other, to exchange or to gather information. Moreover, it refers to the ‘notional environment in which digitized information is communicated over computer networks’. Be this as it may, it appears that there exists a tendency to treat these two terms as synonyms and use them interchangeably. To give an example, the US Government Cyber Policy Review 2009 defines cyberspace as ‘the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, and includes the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers in critical industries. Common usage of the term also refers to the virtual environment of information and interactions between people’. It appears therefore, that apart from identity in terms, these two concepts have a dual role: they refer to the domain as well as to the medium of conducting certain activities. Furthermore, it would be an understatement to say that the Internet is important to private individuals, corporations and States: the US Government has stated that cyberspace / the Internet underlines every aspect of modern society and it is both the\n Vangie Beal, ‘Internet’ (Webopedia) <http: Internet.html=\"\" term=\"\" www.webopedia.com=\"\"> accessed on 1 November 2013.\n Bill Young, ‘Navigating Cyberspace: Introduction to Cyberspace’ (9 January 2013) University of Texas <http: cs329e=\"\" slides1-introduction.pdf=\"\" www.cs.utexas.edu=\"\" ~byoung=\"\"> accessed on 4 November 2013.\n US Department of Defense, ‘Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms’ JP 1–02 (12 April 2001, as amended through 31 August 2005) 139.\n The White House, ‘Cyberspace Policy Review: Assuring a trusted and resilient information and communications infrastructure’ (2009) <http: assets=\"\" documents=\"\" cyberspace_policy_review_final.pdf=\"\" www.whitehouse.gov=\"\"> 1, accessed on 4 November 2013.\nNicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389\nDownloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM\nvia University of Tasmania</http:></http:></http:>\nResearch handbook on international law and cyberspace\ndomain where and the medium by which economic, public safety, civil society and national security activities are pursued.\nWhile the usefulness of the Internet is universally acknowledged, the same is the case with regard to its misuse or hostile use, in the form of cyber-crime and espionage. In particular, as nowadays private business and governments conduct most of their functions and activities in cyberspace, safety and resilience are matters to be preserved. In the words of the US Cyber Policy Review 2009 ‘to realize the full benefits of digital revolution, users must have confidence that sensitive information is secure, commerce is not compromised and the infrastructure is not infiltrated. Nation-states also need confidence that the networks that support their national security and economic prosperity are safe and resilient. ...’ It is, therefore, not inconceivable that the Internet may be used in such a way as to cause harm to States or as to compel them to act in a particular manner. There have been three episodes in State practice that have revealed how the hostile use of the Internet may affect the orderly function of basic services in a State or threaten its security. In 2007 Estonia was the object of massive and coordinated computer hacking attacks that paralyzed its economy and the functioning of government services for weeks. In 2008 Georgia was the target of similar attacks during the conflict with the Russian Federation with respect to South Ossetia. Also, in 2009 a computer virus by the name of Stuxnet caused the progress of the nuclear program of Iran to suffer significant delay. In this context the question arises whether such use of the Internet may give rise to State responsibility. The answer must be in the affirmative provided that a specific use of the Internet amounts to an ‘internationally wrongful act’. As the Internet is an international domain, then States must conduct themselves over this domain in accordance with international law and therefore the use of cyberspace is subject to international law. As Harold Koh, the former Legal Advisor of the US State Department has remarked ‘international law principles do apply in cyberspace. ...’ However, there are substantive challenges facing the law on international responsibility as it exists in contemporary international law by the particularities of cyberspace since this body of rules is premised heavily on attribution of acts of individuals to a State. Be as it may, the present author submits, that the application of this area of international law to cyberspace is not impossible, mainly as a result of establishing responsibility on the basis of the breach of the obligation of due diligence on the part of States, which dispenses with the difficulty of attributing acts of individuals to a State, while even attribution may in certain cases be established.

AN OUTLINE OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF STATE RESPONSIBILITY\nState responsibility appears to have emerged as a branch of international law by way of private law analogy. As the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ) ruled in Factory at Chorzów (Indemnities) ‘it is a principle of international law, and even a general conception of law, that any breach of an engagement involves an obligation to make reparation’. However, subsequent judicial pronouncements and the work of the International Law Commission (ILC) form a departure from legal analogies with the domestic law of tort in favour of reconstructing the responsibility as a matter of international public law arising when, an act: (1) is attributable to a State; and (2) constitutes a breach of an international obligation. In US Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran the International Court (ICJ) stated that it had to ‘determine how far, legally, the acts in question may be regarded as imputable to the Iranian State’ and whether they were compatible or not ‘with the obligations of Iran under treaties in force or under any other rules of international law that may be applicable’. Moreover, in Bosnian Genocide the ICJ ruled with regard to the breach of the Genocide Convention that ‘the obligations in question … and the responsibilities of States that would arise from breach of such obligations are obligations and responsibilities under international law. They are not of a criminal nature’.\nThe contemporary law of State responsibility has as its principal source of reference the Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARS)\n Ibid.

This text is not (or not yet) a treaty. However, since 2001 it has been so extensively cited by international courts and tribunals, as well as in State practice, that it is considered as an authoritative statement of the customary international law on State responsibility. The legal regime introduced by ARS is premised on the distinction introduced by ILC Rapporteur Roberto Ago between ‘primary obligations’ and ‘secondary rules’. The very first paragraph of the Introduction of the Commentaries to ARS states that:\nThe emphasis is on the secondary rules of State responsibility, that is to say, the general conditions under international law for the State to be considered responsible for wrongful actions or omissions, and the legal consequences which flow therefrom. The articles do not attempt to define the content of the international obligations breach of which gives rise to responsibility.\nA second basic feature of ARS is that it views responsibility of States not as an exclusive pattern of bilateral relations between the wrongdoing and injured State. By contrast, State responsibility is given a public order dimension by laying emphasis on the existence of an internationally wrongful act and not upon the damage or injury caused and the existence of a causal link between the damage and the breach of obligation. Thus, the Commentary to Article 1 ARS states that:\n[T]he term ‘international responsibility’ ... covers the relations which arise under international law from the internationally wrongful act of a State, whether such relations are limited to the wrongdoing State and one injured State or whether they extend also to other States or indeed to other subjects of international law, and whether they are centred on obligations of restitution or compensation or also give the injured State the possibility of responding by way of counter-measures.\nMoreover, this dimension of State responsibility is further supported by Articles 40 and 48 ARS dealing, respectively, with serious breaches of obligations arising under a peremptory norm of international law and the invocation of the responsibility of a State by States other than the injured party.\nAs the emphasis in ARS lies in the wrongful act, central position is given to its requirements, namely, attribution to a State and breach of an international obligation (Art. 2 ARS). Attribution means ‘the operation of attaching a given act or omission to a State’ and to this end the ARS relies on the identity of natural persons and their\n [2001] Yearbook of the ILC, vol. II (Part Two).\n UNGA Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts – Compilation of Decisions of International Courts, Tribunals and other bodies (Report of the Secretary-General) A/65/76; [2010] UNGA Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts – Comments and Information received from Governments (Report of the Secretary-General) A/65/96; James Crawford (ed.), Brownlie’s Principles of Public International Law (8th edn., OUP 2012) 540.\n Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, with commentaries [2001] A/56/10 31.\n The International Law Commission Articles on State Responsibility (n 9) art 1.\n Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, with commentaries (n 19) 33.\n Ibid. 36.\nNicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389\nDownloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM\nvia University of Tasmania\nState responsibility in cyberspace 59\nrelationship with a particular State. As the Commentary to Article 2 ARS makes absolutely clear the fact is that States act through human beings or groups; therefore, the issue of attribution is reduced to identifying the persons or groups that should be considered to act on behalf of the State. This finding appears to rest on a dual basis that is disjunctively applied: either the identity of a person or group as such or the control exercised by a State over the activities of a person or a group. In a nutshell, the ARS, for the purposes of attribution, are centred on the individual. Thus, the responsibility of a State is engaged for acts or omissions by the following categories of individuals:\n(a) De jure State agents or organs, irrespective of their hierarchical position in the apparatus of the State or the constitutional structure or organization of the State (namely, whether it is a unitary or federal State) (Art.4 ARS);\n(b) De facto State organs, namely, non-State actors or entities that have been 'elevated' to de facto State agents or organs because they are under the absolute dependence and control of a State. In Bosnian Genocide the issue before the ICJ was whether the atrocities perpetrated by the Bosnian Serbs in Srebrenica in July 1995, which as the Court ruled amounted to commission of genocide under the 1948 Genocide Convention, could be attributed to Serbia. The Court ruled that:\n[t]his question has in fact two aspects, which the Court must consider separately. First, it should be ascertained whether the acts committed in Srebrenica were perpetrated by organs of the Respondent [namely, Serbia], i.e., by persons or entities whose conduct is necessarily attributable to it, because they are in fact instruments of its action. Next, if the preceding question is answered in the negative, it should be ascertained whether the acts in question were committed by persons who, while not organs of the Respondent, did nevertheless act on the instruments of, or under the direction or control of, the Respondent.\nThe Court then proceeded to identify de facto States organs as;\npersons, groups of persons or entities [that], may for purposes of international responsibility, be equated with State organs even if that status does not follow from internal law, provided that in fact the persons, groups or entities act in 'complete dependence' on the State of which they are ultimately the instrument ...;\n(c) Delegation of Government Authority. In this contingency the conduct of a non-State actor (i.e. 'a person or entity which is not the organ of the State') is to be considered as an act of the State if the non-State actor 'is empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of governmental authority' and it 'is acting in that capacity in the particular instance' (Art. 5 ARS);\n(d) The situation where an organ of a State is placed at the disposal of another State. The acts or omissions of this organ in the exercise of government authority on behalf of the State at the disposal of which it has been placed give rise to this State's responsibility (Art. 6 ARS);\n Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (n 19) 35.\n Case Concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (n 16) (Merits) 201.\n Ibid. 205 [emphasis added].\nNicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389\nDownloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM\nvia University of Tasmania\nResearch handbook on international law and cyberspace\n(e) Ultra Vires Acts. A State organ or entity gives rise to the responsibility of the State even when acting in this capacity it exceeds its authority or against instructions (Art.7 ARS);\n(f) Instructions, Direction and Control of a State over acts of private persons. In the jurisprudence of the ICJ this control must be ‘effective control’ in order to give rise to the responsibility of the State. The Court reached this finding in Nicaragua where it ruled that the US assistance to the contras and its general control over them were not sufficient in default of further evidence to attribute their acts violating human rights and humanitarian law to the US government. By contrast ‘[f]or this conduct to give rise to legal responsibility of the United States, it would in principle have to be proved that that State had effective control of the military and paramilitary operations in the course of which the alleged violations were committed.’ 26 Moreover, in Bosnian Genocide the Court, having found that the Bosnian Serbs did not constitute a de facto organ of Serbia, proceeded to determine whether Serbia exercised effective control over them. The Court explained that the:\ntest thus formulated differs in two respects from the test ... to determine whether a person or entity may be equated with a State organ even if not having that status under internal law. First, in this context it is not necessary to show that the persons who performed the acts alleged to have violated international law were in general in a relationship of ‘complete dependence’ on the respondent State; it has to be proved that they acted in accordance with the State’s instructions or under its ‘effective control’. It must however be shown that this ‘effective control’ was exercised, or that the State’s instructions were given, in respect of each operation in which the alleged violations occurred, not generally in respect of the overall actions taken by the persons or groups of persons having committed the violations.27\nIn this respect, the Court declined to uphold the ruling of the ICTY Appeals Chamber in the Tadić case where the ad hoc Tribunal applied the test of ‘overall control’ that dispenses with the need to evaluate control of a State over each specific operation of a non-State actor;28 the Court took the view that the determination of State responsibility on the part of Serbia did not constitute an indispensable finding to determine individual criminal responsibility by an international criminal tribunal29 (Art. 8 ARS);\n(g) Exercise of elements of government authority in the absence of or inadequate function of State authorities and in circumstances that warrant the exercise of this authority. In Yeager v. Islamic Republic of Iran the Iran-US Claims Tribunal ruled\n\nNicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389\nDownloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM\nvia University of Tasmania\nState responsibility in cyberspace 61\nthat the immigration, customs and other similar acts that had been carried out by the Revolutionary Guards at the Tehran airport in the immediate aftermath of the Islamic revolution were attributable to Iran. The Tribunal reasoned that even though these functions were not authorized by the Iranian government they objectively consisted in the exercise of elements of governmental authority in the absence of official authorities of the State ‘in operations of which the new Government must have had knowledge and to which it did not specifically object.’ (Art. 9 ARS);\n(h) The ARS provides in particular that acts or omissions by an insurrectional or other movement are attributed to a State in the event the insurrection is successful and the movement become the government of the State (Art. 10 ARS);\n(i) Approval and Adoption by a State of acts of private persons or entities. In US Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran the Court ruled that the act of overrunning of the US Embassy in Tehran by demonstrators and the seizure as hostages of the US diplomatic staff could not be as such attributed to the Iranian Government because the demonstrators were neither State organs nor did they carry out a specific government act on behalf of the State. However, the responsibility of Iran for the acts of the demonstrators was established at a later stage when the Iranian government approved of and adopted the occupation of the Embassy premises and the captivity of the US diplomatic staff as its own (Art.11 ARS).\nThe second requirement of State responsibility, namely a breach of an international obligation, may consist in a physical act or omission and may emanate from a rule of either customary law or treaty (Art. 12 ARS) that introduces an obligation in force for the particular State (Art.13 ARS). Moreover, the responsibility of a State may arise whether the act is or is not of a continuing character (Arts 14 and 15 ARS) or it constitutes part of a composite activity. Furthermore, State responsibility arises with respect to acts of other States. This is not to say that acts of other States are attributed to another State for, as the ILC has made clear, the ARS is premised on the principle that ‘each State is responsible for its own wrongful conduct … attributable to it … which is in breach of an international obligation of that State …’ and that ‘responsibility is specific to the State concerned’. Even though in this respect the ILC identifies contingencies of ‘collaborative conduct’ it does not appear to introduce a particular legal framework of ‘shared responsibility’ for the collaborative element appears to be viewed simply as a factual rather than a normative parameter. This is further corroborated by Article 47(1) ARS on the invocation of State responsibility for an\n [1987] 17 Iran–US Claims Tribunal Rep. (1987), 104.\n Case Concerning United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran (n 15) (Merits), 29–30.\n Ibid. 33–36.\n Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (n 19) 64.\n Ibid.\n On shared responsibility see generally André Nollkaemper and Dov Jacobs, ‘Shared responsibility in international law: A conceptual framework’ (2013) 34(2) Michigan J. Int’l. L. 359.\nNicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389\nDownloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM\nvia University of Tasmania\nResearch handbook on international law and cyberspace\ninternationally wrongful act committed by a plurality of States: in this contingency the responsibility of each State may be invoked with respect to this act. Having said this, the responsibility of a State for the acts of another State arises on the basis of conduct of the former State in relation to the latter that consists in aid or assistance, direction and control and coercion (of the latter State). In each of these contingencies there must be two requirements cumulatively: first, the conduct must be internationally wrongful if it was committed by the other State and, secondly, the aiding/controlling/coercing State must have knowledge of the circumstances of the internationally wrongful act (Arts 16–18 ARS). Finally, the ILC ARS provide for grounds precluding the wrongfulness of an act that *prima facie* constitutes a breach of an international obligation; these are: consent (Art. 20); self-defence (Art. 21); countermeasures (Arts 22, 49–54); *force majeure* (Art. 23); distress (Art. 24); and necessity (Art. 25).\n# 3. ATTRIBUTION IN CYBERSPACE\nCyberspace as a domain and the use of electronic devices as a medium of State conduct raises difficulties with respect to ascribing particular acts to States. There is no reason sweepingly to deny as a matter of principle the application of the rules of attribution provided in ARS to conduct in cyberspace. However, the identification of individuals or entities that use the Internet is characterized by considerable difficulty, for the Internet guarantees, if not actually absolute, certainly a large measure of anonymity or deniability. Thus, it is almost impossible to identify directly and with certainty the person or entity operating a personal computer. Identification of persons, and by consequence, attribution is only possible via the identification of a computer by way of its IP that identifies its precise location.\nTherefore, an internationally wrongful act in cyberspace appears to be ascribed to a particular computer whereas the identity of the person operating it may only be established either by way of presumption or on the basis of inside information disclosed by government agents of the State perpetrating the internationally wrongful acts in cyberspace. Thus, if a computer is identified by way of its location (in the premises of a government department or a diplomatic mission) as a government computer then the transmission of malware or denial of service interference may in principle be attributed to a particular State. This appears to be established either on the identity of the operator who is presumed to be a government agent or on the mere location of the computer as this falls under the exclusive and complete control of a State. Thus, in October and November 2013 the German Government launched strong diplomatic protests with the US and UK Governments for allegations of electronic surveillance of German governmental departments, including the German Chancellor’s\n Viz. the information disclosed by the former US National Security Agency (NSA) Edward Snowden on the NSA surveillance of many foreign government agencies; see Joshua Eaton, ‘Timeline of Edward Snowden’s revelations’, *Al Jazeera America* <http: articles=\"\" multimedia=\"\" timeline–edward–snowden–revelations.html=\"\" www.dailymotion.com=\"\"> accessed on 26 November 2013.\nNicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389\nDownloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM\nvia University of Tasmania</http:>\nState responsibility in cyberspace 63\nOffice, from the US and UK embassies in Berlin. In particular, the German Government warned the UK ambassador that the interception of German Government information by intelligence services from a diplomatic mission constituted a breach of international law.\nAt the same time, the Tallinn Manual adopts a rather cautious approach to attribution with respect to cyber wrongful acts by stating that the fact that a cyber operation has its source in government cyber infrastructure is not sufficient to attribute these acts to a State; it merely constitutes an indication that a particular State is associated with the cyber operation. The Manual explains this approach by reference to the particular features of cyber context and especially the likelihood that a government cyber infrastructure may be ‘hijacked’ by non-State actors. Moreover, the former Legal Advisor of the US Department of State has acknowledged the problem of attribution in that cyberspace ‘significantly increases an actor’s ability to engage in attacks with “plausible deniability”, by acting through proxies’ and suggested that this challenge is ‘as much [a question] of a technical and policy nature rather than exclusively or predominantly’ a question of law. But attribution is predominantly a question of law and it is not determined ‘on the mere recognition of a link of factual causality’. Furthermore, neither the Tallinn Manual nor the US Government propose an alternative cogent framework of attribution but leave the whole issue surrounded in ambiguity which suggests a wide margin of discretion on the part of an injured State to decide the matter of attribution on the basis of extra-legal factors, such as the general political climate between it and another State. In the absence of an alternative proposition it appears that this position casts aside the current legal framework of attribution by replacing it with a laissez faire approach by an injured State on a case-by-case basis.\nAttribution of an injurious act to a State is a matter of evidence. As injurious acts in cyberspace emanate from computers located in the territory of one or more States the territorial location of computers may serve as a starting-point. State sovereignty entails the expectation that every State exercises control over cyber infrastructure and activities within its territory. However, as the ICJ ruled in Corfu Channel the mere fact of existence of objects constituting a source of injurious acts (in this case computers engaged in injurious cyber acts) within its territory is not sufficient to impute knowledge of these acts to the State. At the same time, the victim State is permitted ‘a more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence’.

In the cyber context the establishment of the exact and actual source of the injurious act is extremely difficult to locate, let alone establish the identity of the perpetrator. Thus, it appears that a very liberal approach to evidence is called for by the very nature of cyberspace that would combine expert technical knowledge, press reports (where available) revelation by defector public officials of a State (the US NSA surveillance activities were divulged by former NSA official Edward Snowden) even though the fact of defection may diminish its probative value as evidence contrary to the interests of his own State. The inherent difficulty in identifying a single State as the source of an injurious cyber act appears to leave the victim State two possible avenues: either the identification of the perpetrating State on the basis of the existing political climate between it and the victim State or cooperation with other States whether in the context of international organizations or not. The first avenue may entail a degree of arbitrariness and ultimately it does not, and cannot by itself, establish responsibility in the absence of more objective evidence. By contrast, the second avenue offers a better potential of identifying the alleged wrong-doing State. The fact, however, remains that such identification defies to a large extent the established legal framework of attribution.\nOn the basis of the assumption that injurious cyber activity can be traced to the territory of a single State it is submitted that the best approach in the cyber context is to attribute hostile cyber acts to this State on the basis of a presumption of responsibility which may be rebutted by the State on the basis of evidence. In other words, attribution may rest on a presumption that introduces a reversal of the burden of proof. This submission departs from the ruling of the ICJ in Corfu Channel but unlike sea-mines, computers are ubiquitous and by their nature not injurious. Thus, all that has to be established is their location in the territory of a particular State and the latter's alertness by the victim to the fact that injurious cyber acts emanate therefrom. Once this takes place knowledge of the injurious activity is established. It is true that the State from the territory of which the injurious acts emanate may not constitute their actual source, as the computers on its territory may have been hijacked. But this is no reason to deny the right of the victim to alert this State and demand measures on its part for the cessation of the injurious activities. Such measures may entail, depending on the circumstances, a degree of denial of Internet services throughout the territory of that State, and it is a question of balancing the interests of both the victim State and the State from the territory of which the particular cyber activity emanates on whether or not this is feasible. However, this cannot be prima facie excluded as a possibility in\n Tsagourias (n 41) 233–5.\n Cf. Nicaragua Case (n 26) 40–41.\n Ibid. 43.\n Tsagourias mentions that the cyber attack on Estonia in 2007 ‘involved a large botnet of approximately 85,000 hijacked computers from around 178 countries’: see: (n 41) 233.\n Tallinn Manual (n 38) 33.\nNicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389\nDownloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM\nvia University of Tasmania\nState responsibility in cyberspace 65\nview of the fact that States in other circumstances (for instance, when facing unrest by dissident political groups) are all too prepared to adopt sweeping measures of Internet service-denial even throughout their territories. Having said this, there appears to be only one situation in which injurious cyber acts may not be imputed to the territorial State, namely, where the acts emanate from a location that is under the exclusive jurisdiction of another State, such as the premises of a diplomatic mission or the installation of a military base. In the context of the US NSA electronic surveillance practices it was reported that special units located on the rooftops of a number of US embassies in Europe and Asia (such as the US embassies in Athens and Baku) collected data. In these cases these acts would not be attributed to the host States (respectively, Greece and Azerbaijan) but to the USA.\n## 4. BREACH OF AN INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATION IN CYBERSPACE\nThere is no difficulty with the proposition that activities in cyberspace may constitute breach of international obligations giving rise to State responsibility. Thus, certain acts may violate the sovereignty of another State or other States, in the sense of interfering in areas of competence that are exclusively reserved to every State. This contingency may be relative to incidents of electronic surveillance of, or espionage against, government departments and personnel of another State. However, there is no consensus on this issue: according to a school of thought that relies on the famous (or infamous?) Lotus principle, espionage is not prohibited or regulated by international law; therefore, its practice does not as such constitute a breach of the sovereignty of another State, unless perhaps some additional damage is caused. On the other hand, it is argued that if an act is not expressly prohibited by international law this does not lead necessarily and automatically to its permissibility; espionage, in particular, is practiced extensively by States but no government has ever asserted that it constitutes a lawful enterprise. Moreover, cyber acts may constitute instances of unlawful intervention in the internal or external affairs of another State, provided the element of ‘coercion’ exists, or use of force.\n Morris (n 37).\n On cyber espionage and international law see Buchan (Ch 8 of this book).\n The Case of the ‘S.S.

The considerable difficulty of attribution of an act perpetrated in cyberspace on the basis of the identity or the link of a person or of an entity operating computers to a State, points at the other, in most cases the only, ground for establishing responsibility: the violation of the duty of due diligence arising from the principle that no State may knowingly allow its territory to be used for, or be the source of, acts injurious to other States.57 The proof of attribution in this contingency is made redundant because it concerns an omission to act in accordance with a primary obligation and it may be established by the fact that a State possesses the requisite infrastructure operated by its agents or de facto agents or private parties to which government authority was delegated, to prevent such injurious acts. Thus, due diligence is the primary obligation the breach of which (failure to act or omission) ensures the observance of other primary obligations (either based on treaty or customary law). The precise content and extent of due diligence varies in conjunction with specific obligations. The ILC has deliberately refrained from including due diligence in the Articles on State Responsibility because this would entail examination of the content of primary rules; nevertheless, it did point out that there is a presumption that any primary rule contains a qualification of due diligence.58\nIn the context of trans-boundary harm from hazardous activities the ILC has adopted the view that the duty of due diligence involved does not extend to guaranteeing that significant harm is to be totally prevented if it is impossible to do so. Furthermore the ILC stated that the standard of due diligence to assess the conduct of a State would be that which would be deemed 'appropriate and proportional to the degree of risk of trans-boundary harm in the particular instance'.59 Moreover, the Sea Bed Disputes Chamber of the International Tribunal of the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) ruled in its Advisory Opinion in the Responsibilities and Obligations of States with respect to Activities in the Area ruled that due diligence is a 'variable concept' and the standard it may set may change as a result of scientific and technological developments as well as the risks involved in a particular activity.60\nIn the human rights field the duty of due diligence has been upheld in Velasquez-Rodriguez in which the Inter-American Court of Human Rights interpreted the obligation introduced in Article 1(1) of the Inter-American Convention of Human Rights to respect and ensure the exercise of the rights enshrined in the Convention. The Court ruled that the obligation to 'ensure' the exercise of these rights gave rise to the duty of contracting States to organize the governmental infrastructure in such a way so as to ensure 'free and full enjoyment' of the rights and prevent, investigate and punish\n\nNicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389\nDownloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM\nvia University of Tasmania\nState responsibility in cyberspace 67\ntheir violation; this obligation to ‘ensure’ is not fulfilled solely by the existence of ‘a legal system designed to make it possible to comply with this obligation – it also requires the government to conduct itself so as to effectively ensure the free and full exercise of human rights’.\nThe ICJ has dealt with the duty of diligence in a number of disputes involving alleged breaches of international obligations in a variety of contexts. In *Corfu Channel* the Court ruled at the outset that the mere existence of the source of an injurious act (in this case the mines) in the territory of Albania was not sufficient to attribute this act to the State, for the control exercised by a State over its territory as a result of sovereignty does not establish *prima facie* knowledge of every activity taking place therein. After establishing knowledge by Albania of the laying of mines in its territorial sea, the Court ruled that the responsibility of Albania lay in her failure to notify the existence of a minefield in its territorial sea to third-State shipping. In the opinion of the Court, this obligation rested on three general principles, namely, elementary considerations of humanity, the freedom of maritime communication and ‘every State’s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States’. But the Court also took account of the particular factual circumstances of the case in order to confirm its legal finding: it acknowledged that if the mines had been laid at the last possible moment, namely, less than 24 hours before the UK warships struck them it would have been difficult or even impossible to issue a general notification to third-State shipping. But, as the incident took place at a time by which the Albanian authorities could have had knowledge of the existence of the mines as a result of their close surveillance of the *Corfu Strait*, Albania did not observe its duty of due diligence. In *US Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran* the Court ruled that the acts of the demonstrators who took over the premises of the US embassy and held its staff hostage could not be imputed *per se* to the government of Iran. However, Iran bore responsibility because of its failure to observe its obligation under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (1961) to protect the inviolability of the persons and premises of another State’s diplomatic mission.\nIn *Congo v. Uganda* the Court dealt in the context of the first counterclaim of Uganda with the allegation that the Congo had violated its obligation of due diligence (or duty of vigilance) by failing to prevent the action of dissident armed bands against Uganda from its territory. The Court ruled that the existence and toleration of armed groups on Congolese territory could not be assimilated with active support to these groups; in addition, the Court took into account the inimical geographical terrain where the groups operated and the material inability of the Congolese (as well as the former Zairian) Government to effectively control that part of the territory of the State.

In the course of its reasoning the Court made some statements of principle regarding the duty to prevent (due diligence) even though it made it clear that it did not intend to introduce a general framework of universal application on the duty of due diligence; it observed that ‘the content of duty to prevent varies from one instrument to another, according to the wording of the relevant provisions, and depending on the nature of the acts to be prevented’. Then the Court analysed the content of the duty to prevent in relation to the crime of genocide. It stated at the outset that this duty was an obligation of conduct and not of result; hence, a State did not have the obligation to succeed in preventing genocide ‘whatever the circumstances’ but was under the obligation to ‘employ all means reasonably available’ to it to prevent the commission of the crime. Thus, failure to achieve the desired result does not give rise to responsibility; by contrast, responsibility arises in case of manifest failure to take all steps within its power that would contribute to preventing genocide because ‘in this area the notion of “due diligence”, which calls for an assessment in concreto, is of critical importance. Various parameters operate when assessing whether a State has duly discharged the obligation concerned’. The Court proceeded to identify those parameters in relation to the specific obligation to prevent genocide and found of particular importance the capacity to influence (within the limits of the law) the perpetrators on the basis of: (a) the geographical distance between the State concerned and the scene of the crime: and (b) the strength of political or other links between the State and the perpetrators. The essence of due diligence lies, therefore, in the application of all means at the disposal of the State even though such application may be proved on the basis of evidence to be futile; in other words a State must not be inert even in the knowledge that its measures will in all probability be ineffective to prevent the injurious act. Even though the Court found that the duty to prevent genocide would give rise to responsibility only when the crime was actually committed (viz. Article 14(3) ARS) it recognized that a State was not absolved from responsibility if it remains inactive until commission of the crime commences where there is a serious risk of its commission; in such a contingency the State is under the obligation to employ the means available to it to prevent the crime, otherwise the substance of the obligation would be negated.\n Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (Democratic Republic of the Congo v.

The latter contingency would require further evidence that the ultimate outcome was the direct result of acts or omissions amounting to the breach of this other primary rule and not simply the failure to adopt preventative measures that even they might not guarantee beyond all doubt that the end result would not occur.\nOn the basis of the preceding analysis it is submitted that the responsibility of a State for internationally wrongful acts in cyberspace may be established in customary law on the duty of due diligence in observing the obligation of not knowingly allowing its territory to be the source of acts violating the rights of other States. The content of the due diligence must be assessed by taking into account, first, that the use of the Internet is not unlawful *per se*; secondly, that transmission from a computer or a host of computers may or may not be the actual source of the injurious activity and; finally, that the existence of thousands of computers on the territory of a State does not by and of itself constitute knowledge of such injurious activity. Moreover, due diligence being an obligation of conduct and not of result does not entail as a necessary outcome the obligation to take steps to protect the rights of other States as this appears to go beyond the requirement to employ all means that a State reasonably possesses to prevent an unlawful act.76 Furthermore, knowledge of the cyber injurious act could be established only upon the notification by the victim State that has the discretion to select the States (they may be many) from the territories of which injurious transmissions occur.\nThe criteria for selection for notification are a matter of political decision, but once notification takes place ‘knowledge’ exists and the State or States notified are under an obligation to employ measures reasonably at their disposal to prevent the wrongful cyber activity. Such measures appear to be commensurate with the possession of technological capabilities to deny temporarily Internet service either to particular users or throughout the State, even though the latter may disproportionately affect the function of the governmental and economic infrastructure of the State. Thus, it appears to be a matter of balancing the cost of Internet denial to the State of origin against the effect of the injurious acts to the victim State and this is to be assessed in the particular circumstances of each case. However, total denial of service may not, in principle, be regarded as a reasonable response to injurious cyber acts; but it may not be excluded, either in particular circumstances or even more so when States appear prepared to resort to it to silence political opponents or contain internal unrest. What is important is that a State that is established to have knowledge of injurious cyber acts emanating from its territory is under a duty to act in a preventative manner irrespective of the fact\n\nNicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389\nDownloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM\nvia University of Tasmania\n\nthat the said cyber activity also originates from the territories of other States. To say that the failure to employ measures within that State’s capability is of no consequence because the wrongful cyber activity also emanates from computers located in a plurality of States does not absolve the former from responsibility under due diligence. The ICJ ruled in *Bosnian Genocide* that such an assertion is irrelevant to the breach of an obligation of conduct warranted by the duty of due diligence, especially when there is a possibility of cooperation through concerted action in a situation where the perpetrator of an injurious cyber act takes over a large number of computers situated in a plurality of States. Indeed, it is because of this contingency, so frequent in practice, that cooperation and concerted action is essential either on an *ad hoc* basis to counter specific wrongful cyber activities or on a more permanent basis through institutionalized mechanisms or a pre-existing framework of good practices in cyber-space. Thus, the NATO initiatives on information security are in principle steps in the right direction as well as the initiative of China and the Russian Federation for the introduction of an International Code of Conduct for Information Security.\n# 5. CONCLUSION\nCyberspace raises many challenges to the law on State responsibility as it has evolved through State practice, judicial decisions and the work of the ILC culminating in the 2001 ARS. Cyberspace as a domain has international dimensions; therefore it is in principle amenable to regulation by international law and the rules on State responsibility, in particular, may be applied. While a breach of an international obligation may be established without much difficulty in relation to certain types of cyber activity, it is attribution of it to a specific State that raises difficulties that in practice appear insurmountable and seem to defy the rules on attribution established in the ILC ARS.\nThese rules on attribution are centred on acts of persons and their imputation to a particular State. Moreover, the process of attribution is a juridical one. However, the nature of cyberspace as a domain, the freedom and the prima facie lawfulness of its use, the transmission of information through computers and the anonymity of the users of those computers leave very little scope for establishing with a relative degree of certainty both the identity of the user and his/her link to a specific State. The only fact that can be established with certainty is the location of a particular computer or computers in the territory of one or more States. This gives rise to the presumption that the State from the territory of which cyber injurious acts emanate could be the one that may incur responsibility. However, this does not dispense with the specific rules of\n Case Concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (n 16) 221.\n O’Connell (n 6) 206–9.\n NATO, ‘NATO and Cyber Defence’ (7 August 2014) <http: en=\"\" esp=\"\" natolive=\"\" topics_78170.htm?=\"\" www.nato.int=\"\"> accessed 13 August 2014.\n Letter dated 12 September 2011 from the Permanent Representatives of China, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary–General, Annex, A/66/359.\nNicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389\nDownloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM\nvia University of Tasmania</http:>\nState responsibility in cyberspace 71\nattribution and the fact that computers situated in the territory of a one or more States are the actual source of wrongful cyber acts as they may have been ‘hijacked’ by the real perpetrator. Hence there have been suggestions of overcoming this difficulty by addressing attribution more flexibly or even by going beyond its existing legal framework and establishing it on existing political relations between the States concerned. Whereas political relations may constitute a factor for a victim State of selecting another State or other States as the likely source of wrongful cyber activity, it should not constitute a substitute for the existing rules on attribution and should not dispense with the burden of proof of the grounds of attribution. This enterprise requires evidence and as this is not possible to collect on the territory of a State from which cyber activity occurs, circumstantial evidence may be admissible (for instance, the revelation in the press by former government agents that a State has engaged in wrongful cyber acts) as well as the reversal of the burden of proof upon the State allegedly perpetrating injurious cyber acts.\nThe difficulty in applying the existing rules on attribution could be overcome by focusing on the primary rule breached (namely, the specific international obligation) in conjunction with the duty of due diligence either by reference to the substantive content of the primary obligation or the general principle of international law that no State must knowingly allow its territory to be used for injurious acts against other States. In this manner, responsibility may be established on the fact that certain wrongful cyber acts have their source in computers located in the territory of a State or a plurality of States and it occurs with knowledge of the latter. This knowledge would be established on the basis of alerting the territorial State (or States) to the fact of wrongful cyber activity from its territory and its failure to act by employing measures within its capabilities to curb that activity. The best course of action to achieve cessation of injurious cyber acts appears to be through the adoption of good Internet practices and international cooperation.\nNicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389\nDownloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM via University of Tasmania",

      "flat_text": "# 3. State responsibility in cyberspace\nConstantine Antonopoulos\n## 1. INTRODUCTION\nThe terms Internet and Cyberspace are household words. They represent domains the use of which is indispensable to the entire or at least a substantial part of the global population. At the same time, as this author understands it, they are not identical in meaning as a matter of computer science terminology. The Internet is a ‘global network connecting millions of computers’; it is ‘decentralized by design’, subject to ownership or control (unlike ‘online services’) by no single (or a plurality of) person or entity. The Internet has a physical dimension because of the interconnection of different computer systems, their accessibility and the transmission of information to and from such systems by using the standard Internet Protocol (IP). Cyberspace, however, is a more abstract term; it is a non-physical domain created by computer systems that allows people to communicate with each other, to exchange or to gather information. Moreover, it refers to the ‘notional environment in which digitized information is communicated over computer networks’. Be this as it may, it appears that there exists a tendency to treat these two terms as synonyms and use them interchangeably. To give an example, the US Government Cyber Policy Review 2009 defines cyberspace as ‘the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, and includes the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers in critical industries. Common usage of the term also refers to the virtual environment of information and interactions between people’. It appears therefore, that apart from identity in terms, these two concepts have a dual role: they refer to the domain as well as to the medium of conducting certain activities. Furthermore, it would be an understatement to say that the Internet is important to private individuals, corporations and States: the US Government has stated that cyberspace / the Internet underlines every aspect of modern society and it is both the\n Vangie Beal, ‘Internet’ (Webopedia) <http: Internet.html=\"\" term=\"\" www.webopedia.com=\"\"> accessed on 1 November 2013.\n Bill Young, ‘Navigating Cyberspace: Introduction to Cyberspace’ (9 January 2013) University of Texas <http: cs329e=\"\" slides1-introduction.pdf=\"\" www.cs.utexas.edu=\"\" ~byoung=\"\"> accessed on 4 November 2013.\n US Department of Defense, ‘Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms’ JP 1–02 (12 April 2001, as amended through 31 August 2005) 139.\n The White House, ‘Cyberspace Policy Review: Assuring a trusted and resilient information and communications infrastructure’ (2009) <http: assets=\"\" documents=\"\" cyberspace_policy_review_final.pdf=\"\" www.whitehouse.gov=\"\"> 1, accessed on 4 November 2013.\nNicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389\nDownloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM\nvia University of Tasmania</http:></http:></http:>\nResearch handbook on international law and cyberspace\ndomain where and the medium by which economic, public safety, civil society and national security activities are pursued.\nWhile the usefulness of the Internet is universally acknowledged, the same is the case with regard to its misuse or hostile use, in the form of cyber-crime and espionage. In particular, as nowadays private business and governments conduct most of their functions and activities in cyberspace, safety and resilience are matters to be preserved. In the words of the US Cyber Policy Review 2009 ‘to realize the full benefits of digital revolution, users must have confidence that sensitive information is secure, commerce is not compromised and the infrastructure is not infiltrated. Nation-states also need confidence that the networks that support their national security and economic prosperity are safe and resilient. ...’ It is, therefore, not inconceivable that the Internet may be used in such a way as to cause harm to States or as to compel them to act in a particular manner. There have been three episodes in State practice that have revealed how the hostile use of the Internet may affect the orderly function of basic services in a State or threaten its security. In 2007 Estonia was the object of massive and coordinated computer hacking attacks that paralyzed its economy and the functioning of government services for weeks. In 2008 Georgia was the target of similar attacks during the conflict with the Russian Federation with respect to South Ossetia. Also, in 2009 a computer virus by the name of Stuxnet caused the progress of the nuclear program of Iran to suffer significant delay. In this context the question arises whether such use of the Internet may give rise to State responsibility. The answer must be in the affirmative provided that a specific use of the Internet amounts to an ‘internationally wrongful act’. As the Internet is an international domain, then States must conduct themselves over this domain in accordance with international law and therefore the use of cyberspace is subject to international law. As Harold Koh, the former Legal Advisor of the US State Department has remarked ‘international law principles do apply in cyberspace. ...’ However, there are substantive challenges facing the law on international responsibility as it exists in contemporary international law by the particularities of cyberspace since this body of rules is premised heavily on attribution of acts of individuals to a State. Be as it may, the present author submits, that the application of this area of international law to cyberspace is not impossible, mainly as a result of establishing responsibility on the basis of the breach of the obligation of due diligence on the part of States, which dispenses with the difficulty of attributing acts of individuals to a State, while even attribution may in certain cases be established.

AN OUTLINE OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF STATE RESPONSIBILITY\nState responsibility appears to have emerged as a branch of international law by way of private law analogy. As the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ) ruled in Factory at Chorzów (Indemnities) ‘it is a principle of international law, and even a general conception of law, that any breach of an engagement involves an obligation to make reparation’. However, subsequent judicial pronouncements and the work of the International Law Commission (ILC) form a departure from legal analogies with the domestic law of tort in favour of reconstructing the responsibility as a matter of international public law arising when, an act: (1) is attributable to a State; and (2) constitutes a breach of an international obligation. In US Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran the International Court (ICJ) stated that it had to ‘determine how far, legally, the acts in question may be regarded as imputable to the Iranian State’ and whether they were compatible or not ‘with the obligations of Iran under treaties in force or under any other rules of international law that may be applicable’. Moreover, in Bosnian Genocide the ICJ ruled with regard to the breach of the Genocide Convention that ‘the obligations in question … and the responsibilities of States that would arise from breach of such obligations are obligations and responsibilities under international law. They are not of a criminal nature’.\nThe contemporary law of State responsibility has as its principal source of reference the Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARS)\n Ibid.

This text is not (or not yet) a treaty. However, since 2001 it has been so extensively cited by international courts and tribunals, as well as in State practice, that it is considered as an authoritative statement of the customary international law on State responsibility. The legal regime introduced by ARS is premised on the distinction introduced by ILC Rapporteur Roberto Ago between ‘primary obligations’ and ‘secondary rules’. The very first paragraph of the Introduction of the Commentaries to ARS states that:\nThe emphasis is on the secondary rules of State responsibility, that is to say, the general conditions under international law for the State to be considered responsible for wrongful actions or omissions, and the legal consequences which flow therefrom. The articles do not attempt to define the content of the international obligations breach of which gives rise to responsibility.\nA second basic feature of ARS is that it views responsibility of States not as an exclusive pattern of bilateral relations between the wrongdoing and injured State. By contrast, State responsibility is given a public order dimension by laying emphasis on the existence of an internationally wrongful act and not upon the damage or injury caused and the existence of a causal link between the damage and the breach of obligation. Thus, the Commentary to Article 1 ARS states that:\n[T]he term ‘international responsibility’ ... covers the relations which arise under international law from the internationally wrongful act of a State, whether such relations are limited to the wrongdoing State and one injured State or whether they extend also to other States or indeed to other subjects of international law, and whether they are centred on obligations of restitution or compensation or also give the injured State the possibility of responding by way of counter-measures.\nMoreover, this dimension of State responsibility is further supported by Articles 40 and 48 ARS dealing, respectively, with serious breaches of obligations arising under a peremptory norm of international law and the invocation of the responsibility of a State by States other than the injured party.\nAs the emphasis in ARS lies in the wrongful act, central position is given to its requirements, namely, attribution to a State and breach of an international obligation (Art. 2 ARS). Attribution means ‘the operation of attaching a given act or omission to a State’ and to this end the ARS relies on the identity of natural persons and their\n [2001] Yearbook of the ILC, vol. II (Part Two).\n UNGA Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts – Compilation of Decisions of International Courts, Tribunals and other bodies (Report of the Secretary-General) A/65/76; [2010] UNGA Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts – Comments and Information received from Governments (Report of the Secretary-General) A/65/96; James Crawford (ed.), Brownlie’s Principles of Public International Law (8th edn., OUP 2012) 540.\n Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, with commentaries [2001] A/56/10 31.\n The International Law Commission Articles on State Responsibility (n 9) art 1.\n Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, with commentaries (n 19) 33.\n Ibid. 36.\nNicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389\nDownloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM\nvia University of Tasmania\nState responsibility in cyberspace 59\nrelationship with a particular State. As the Commentary to Article 2 ARS makes absolutely clear the fact is that States act through human beings or groups; therefore, the issue of attribution is reduced to identifying the persons or groups that should be considered to act on behalf of the State. This finding appears to rest on a dual basis that is disjunctively applied: either the identity of a person or group as such or the control exercised by a State over the activities of a person or a group. In a nutshell, the ARS, for the purposes of attribution, are centred on the individual. Thus, the responsibility of a State is engaged for acts or omissions by the following categories of individuals:\n(a) De jure State agents or organs, irrespective of their hierarchical position in the apparatus of the State or the constitutional structure or organization of the State (namely, whether it is a unitary or federal State) (Art.4 ARS);\n(b) De facto State organs, namely, non-State actors or entities that have been 'elevated' to de facto State agents or organs because they are under the absolute dependence and control of a State. In Bosnian Genocide the issue before the ICJ was whether the atrocities perpetrated by the Bosnian Serbs in Srebrenica in July 1995, which as the Court ruled amounted to commission of genocide under the 1948 Genocide Convention, could be attributed to Serbia. The Court ruled that:\n[t]his question has in fact two aspects, which the Court must consider separately. First, it should be ascertained whether the acts committed in Srebrenica were perpetrated by organs of the Respondent [namely, Serbia], i.e., by persons or entities whose conduct is necessarily attributable to it, because they are in fact instruments of its action. Next, if the preceding question is answered in the negative, it should be ascertained whether the acts in question were committed by persons who, while not organs of the Respondent, did nevertheless act on the instruments of, or under the direction or control of, the Respondent.\nThe Court then proceeded to identify de facto States organs as;\npersons, groups of persons or entities [that], may for purposes of international responsibility, be equated with State organs even if that status does not follow from internal law, provided that in fact the persons, groups or entities act in 'complete dependence' on the State of which they are ultimately the instrument ...;\n(c) Delegation of Government Authority. In this contingency the conduct of a non-State actor (i.e. 'a person or entity which is not the organ of the State') is to be considered as an act of the State if the non-State actor 'is empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of governmental authority' and it 'is acting in that capacity in the particular instance' (Art. 5 ARS);\n(d) The situation where an organ of a State is placed at the disposal of another State. The acts or omissions of this organ in the exercise of government authority on behalf of the State at the disposal of which it has been placed give rise to this State's responsibility (Art. 6 ARS);\n Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (n 19) 35.\n Case Concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (n 16) (Merits) 201.\n Ibid. 205 [emphasis added].\nNicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389\nDownloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM\nvia University of Tasmania\nResearch handbook on international law and cyberspace\n(e) Ultra Vires Acts. A State organ or entity gives rise to the responsibility of the State even when acting in this capacity it exceeds its authority or against instructions (Art.7 ARS);\n(f) Instructions, Direction and Control of a State over acts of private persons. In the jurisprudence of the ICJ this control must be ‘effective control’ in order to give rise to the responsibility of the State. The Court reached this finding in Nicaragua where it ruled that the US assistance to the contras and its general control over them were not sufficient in default of further evidence to attribute their acts violating human rights and humanitarian law to the US government. By contrast ‘[f]or this conduct to give rise to legal responsibility of the United States, it would in principle have to be proved that that State had effective control of the military and paramilitary operations in the course of which the alleged violations were committed.’ 26 Moreover, in Bosnian Genocide the Court, having found that the Bosnian Serbs did not constitute a de facto organ of Serbia, proceeded to determine whether Serbia exercised effective control over them. The Court explained that the:\ntest thus formulated differs in two respects from the test ... to determine whether a person or entity may be equated with a State organ even if not having that status under internal law. First, in this context it is not necessary to show that the persons who performed the acts alleged to have violated international law were in general in a relationship of ‘complete dependence’ on the respondent State; it has to be proved that they acted in accordance with the State’s instructions or under its ‘effective control’. It must however be shown that this ‘effective control’ was exercised, or that the State’s instructions were given, in respect of each operation in which the alleged violations occurred, not generally in respect of the overall actions taken by the persons or groups of persons having committed the violations.27\nIn this respect, the Court declined to uphold the ruling of the ICTY Appeals Chamber in the Tadić case where the ad hoc Tribunal applied the test of ‘overall control’ that dispenses with the need to evaluate control of a State over each specific operation of a non-State actor;28 the Court took the view that the determination of State responsibility on the part of Serbia did not constitute an indispensable finding to determine individual criminal responsibility by an international criminal tribunal29 (Art. 8 ARS);\n(g) Exercise of elements of government authority in the absence of or inadequate function of State authorities and in circumstances that warrant the exercise of this authority. In Yeager v. Islamic Republic of Iran the Iran-US Claims Tribunal ruled\n\nNicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389\nDownloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM\nvia University of Tasmania\nState responsibility in cyberspace 61\nthat the immigration, customs and other similar acts that had been carried out by the Revolutionary Guards at the Tehran airport in the immediate aftermath of the Islamic revolution were attributable to Iran. The Tribunal reasoned that even though these functions were not authorized by the Iranian government they objectively consisted in the exercise of elements of governmental authority in the absence of official authorities of the State ‘in operations of which the new Government must have had knowledge and to which it did not specifically object.’ (Art. 9 ARS);\n(h) The ARS provides in particular that acts or omissions by an insurrectional or other movement are attributed to a State in the event the insurrection is successful and the movement become the government of the State (Art. 10 ARS);\n(i) Approval and Adoption by a State of acts of private persons or entities. In US Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran the Court ruled that the act of overrunning of the US Embassy in Tehran by demonstrators and the seizure as hostages of the US diplomatic staff could not be as such attributed to the Iranian Government because the demonstrators were neither State organs nor did they carry out a specific government act on behalf of the State. However, the responsibility of Iran for the acts of the demonstrators was established at a later stage when the Iranian government approved of and adopted the occupation of the Embassy premises and the captivity of the US diplomatic staff as its own (Art.11 ARS).\nThe second requirement of State responsibility, namely a breach of an international obligation, may consist in a physical act or omission and may emanate from a rule of either customary law or treaty (Art. 12 ARS) that introduces an obligation in force for the particular State (Art.13 ARS). Moreover, the responsibility of a State may arise whether the act is or is not of a continuing character (Arts 14 and 15 ARS) or it constitutes part of a composite activity. Furthermore, State responsibility arises with respect to acts of other States. This is not to say that acts of other States are attributed to another State for, as the ILC has made clear, the ARS is premised on the principle that ‘each State is responsible for its own wrongful conduct … attributable to it … which is in breach of an international obligation of that State …’ and that ‘responsibility is specific to the State concerned’. Even though in this respect the ILC identifies contingencies of ‘collaborative conduct’ it does not appear to introduce a particular legal framework of ‘shared responsibility’ for the collaborative element appears to be viewed simply as a factual rather than a normative parameter. This is further corroborated by Article 47(1) ARS on the invocation of State responsibility for an\n [1987] 17 Iran–US Claims Tribunal Rep. (1987), 104.\n Case Concerning United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran (n 15) (Merits), 29–30.\n Ibid. 33–36.\n Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (n 19) 64.\n Ibid.\n On shared responsibility see generally André Nollkaemper and Dov Jacobs, ‘Shared responsibility in international law: A conceptual framework’ (2013) 34(2) Michigan J.

Having said this, the responsibility of a State for the acts of another State arises on the basis of conduct of the former State in relation to the latter that consists in aid or assistance, direction and control and coercion (of the latter State). In each of these contingencies there must be two requirements cumulatively: first, the conduct must be internationally wrongful if it was committed by the other State and, secondly, the aiding/controlling/coercing State must have knowledge of the circumstances of the internationally wrongful act (Arts 16–18 ARS). Finally, the ILC ARS provide for grounds precluding the wrongfulness of an act that *prima facie* constitutes a breach of an international obligation; these are: consent (Art. 20); self-defence (Art. 21); countermeasures (Arts 22, 49–54); *force majeure* (Art. 23); distress (Art. 24); and necessity (Art. 25).\n# 3. ATTRIBUTION IN CYBERSPACE\nCyberspace as a domain and the use of electronic devices as a medium of State conduct raises difficulties with respect to ascribing particular acts to States. There is no reason sweepingly to deny as a matter of principle the application of the rules of attribution provided in ARS to conduct in cyberspace. However, the identification of individuals or entities that use the Internet is characterized by considerable difficulty, for the Internet guarantees, if not actually absolute, certainly a large measure of anonymity or deniability. Thus, it is almost impossible to identify directly and with certainty the person or entity operating a personal computer. Identification of persons, and by consequence, attribution is only possible via the identification of a computer by way of its IP that identifies its precise location.\nTherefore, an internationally wrongful act in cyberspace appears to be ascribed to a particular computer whereas the identity of the person operating it may only be established either by way of presumption or on the basis of inside information disclosed by government agents of the State perpetrating the internationally wrongful acts in cyberspace. Thus, if a computer is identified by way of its location (in the premises of a government department or a diplomatic mission) as a government computer then the transmission of malware or denial of service interference may in principle be attributed to a particular State. This appears to be established either on the identity of the operator who is presumed to be a government agent or on the mere location of the computer as this falls under the exclusive and complete control of a State. Thus, in October and November 2013 the German Government launched strong diplomatic protests with the US and UK Governments for allegations of electronic surveillance of German governmental departments, including the German Chancellor’s\n Viz. the information disclosed by the former US National Security Agency (NSA) Edward Snowden on the NSA surveillance of many foreign government agencies; see Joshua Eaton, ‘Timeline of Edward Snowden’s revelations’, *Al Jazeera America* <http: articles=\"\" multimedia=\"\" timeline–edward–snowden–revelations.html=\"\" www.dailymotion.com=\"\"> accessed on 26 November 2013.\nNicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389\nDownloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM\nvia University of Tasmania</http:>\nState responsibility in cyberspace 63\nOffice, from the US and UK embassies in Berlin. In particular, the German Government warned the UK ambassador that the interception of German Government information by intelligence services from a diplomatic mission constituted a breach of international law.\nAt the same time, the Tallinn Manual adopts a rather cautious approach to attribution with respect to cyber wrongful acts by stating that the fact that a cyber operation has its source in government cyber infrastructure is not sufficient to attribute these acts to a State; it merely constitutes an indication that a particular State is associated with the cyber operation. The Manual explains this approach by reference to the particular features of cyber context and especially the likelihood that a government cyber infrastructure may be ‘hijacked’ by non-State actors. Moreover, the former Legal Advisor of the US Department of State has acknowledged the problem of attribution in that cyberspace ‘significantly increases an actor’s ability to engage in attacks with “plausible deniability”, by acting through proxies’ and suggested that this challenge is ‘as much [a question] of a technical and policy nature rather than exclusively or predominantly’ a question of law. But attribution is predominantly a question of law and it is not determined ‘on the mere recognition of a link of factual causality’. Furthermore, neither the Tallinn Manual nor the US Government propose an alternative cogent framework of attribution but leave the whole issue surrounded in ambiguity which suggests a wide margin of discretion on the part of an injured State to decide the matter of attribution on the basis of extra-legal factors, such as the general political climate between it and another State. In the absence of an alternative proposition it appears that this position casts aside the current legal framework of attribution by replacing it with a laissez faire approach by an injured State on a case-by-case basis.\nAttribution of an injurious act to a State is a matter of evidence. As injurious acts in cyberspace emanate from computers located in the territory of one or more States the territorial location of computers may serve as a starting-point. State sovereignty entails the expectation that every State exercises control over cyber infrastructure and activities within its territory. However, as the ICJ ruled in Corfu Channel the mere fact of existence of objects constituting a source of injurious acts (in this case computers engaged in injurious cyber acts) within its territory is not sufficient to impute knowledge of these acts to the State. At the same time, the victim State is permitted ‘a more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence’.

In the cyber context the establishment of the exact and actual source of the injurious act is extremely difficult to locate, let alone establish the identity of the perpetrator. Thus, it appears that a very liberal approach to evidence is called for by the very nature of cyberspace that would combine expert technical knowledge, press reports (where available) revelation by defector public officials of a State (the US NSA surveillance activities were divulged by former NSA official Edward Snowden) even though the fact of defection may diminish its probative value as evidence contrary to the interests of his own State. The inherent difficulty in identifying a single State as the source of an injurious cyber act appears to leave the victim State two possible avenues: either the identification of the perpetrating State on the basis of the existing political climate between it and the victim State or cooperation with other States whether in the context of international organizations or not. The first avenue may entail a degree of arbitrariness and ultimately it does not, and cannot by itself, establish responsibility in the absence of more objective evidence. By contrast, the second avenue offers a better potential of identifying the alleged wrong-doing State. The fact, however, remains that such identification defies to a large extent the established legal framework of attribution.\nOn the basis of the assumption that injurious cyber activity can be traced to the territory of a single State it is submitted that the best approach in the cyber context is to attribute hostile cyber acts to this State on the basis of a presumption of responsibility which may be rebutted by the State on the basis of evidence. In other words, attribution may rest on a presumption that introduces a reversal of the burden of proof. This submission departs from the ruling of the ICJ in Corfu Channel but unlike sea-mines, computers are ubiquitous and by their nature not injurious. Thus, all that has to be established is their location in the territory of a particular State and the latter's alertness by the victim to the fact that injurious cyber acts emanate therefrom. Once this takes place knowledge of the injurious activity is established. It is true that the State from the territory of which the injurious acts emanate may not constitute their actual source, as the computers on its territory may have been hijacked. But this is no reason to deny the right of the victim to alert this State and demand measures on its part for the cessation of the injurious activities. Such measures may entail, depending on the circumstances, a degree of denial of Internet services throughout the territory of that State, and it is a question of balancing the interests of both the victim State and the State from the territory of which the particular cyber activity emanates on whether or not this is feasible. However, this cannot be prima facie excluded as a possibility in\n Tsagourias (n 41) 233–5.\n Cf. Nicaragua Case (n 26) 40–41.\n Ibid. 43.\n Tsagourias mentions that the cyber attack on Estonia in 2007 ‘involved a large botnet of approximately 85,000 hijacked computers from around 178 countries’: see: (n 41) 233.\n Tallinn Manual (n 38) 33.\nNicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389\nDownloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM\nvia University of Tasmania\nState responsibility in cyberspace 65\nview of the fact that States in other circumstances (for instance, when facing unrest by dissident political groups) are all too prepared to adopt sweeping measures of Internet service-denial even throughout their territories. Having said this, there appears to be only one situation in which injurious cyber acts may not be imputed to the territorial State, namely, where the acts emanate from a location that is under the exclusive jurisdiction of another State, such as the premises of a diplomatic mission or the installation of a military base. In the context of the US NSA electronic surveillance practices it was reported that special units located on the rooftops of a number of US embassies in Europe and Asia (such as the US embassies in Athens and Baku) collected data. In these cases these acts would not be attributed to the host States (respectively, Greece and Azerbaijan) but to the USA.\n## 4. BREACH OF AN INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATION IN CYBERSPACE\nThere is no difficulty with the proposition that activities in cyberspace may constitute breach of international obligations giving rise to State responsibility. Thus, certain acts may violate the sovereignty of another State or other States, in the sense of interfering in areas of competence that are exclusively reserved to every State. This contingency may be relative to incidents of electronic surveillance of, or espionage against, government departments and personnel of another State. However, there is no consensus on this issue: according to a school of thought that relies on the famous (or infamous?) Lotus principle, espionage is not prohibited or regulated by international law; therefore, its practice does not as such constitute a breach of the sovereignty of another State, unless perhaps some additional damage is caused. On the other hand, it is argued that if an act is not expressly prohibited by international law this does not lead necessarily and automatically to its permissibility; espionage, in particular, is practiced extensively by States but no government has ever asserted that it constitutes a lawful enterprise. Moreover, cyber acts may constitute instances of unlawful intervention in the internal or external affairs of another State, provided the element of ‘coercion’ exists, or use of force.\n Morris (n 37).\n On cyber espionage and international law see Buchan (Ch 8 of this book).\n The Case of the ‘S.S.

The considerable difficulty of attribution of an act perpetrated in cyberspace on the basis of the identity or the link of a person or of an entity operating computers to a State, points at the other, in most cases the only, ground for establishing responsibility: the violation of the duty of due diligence arising from the principle that no State may knowingly allow its territory to be used for, or be the source of, acts injurious to other States.57 The proof of attribution in this contingency is made redundant because it concerns an omission to act in accordance with a primary obligation and it may be established by the fact that a State possesses the requisite infrastructure operated by its agents or de facto agents or private parties to which government authority was delegated, to prevent such injurious acts. Thus, due diligence is the primary obligation the breach of which (failure to act or omission) ensures the observance of other primary obligations (either based on treaty or customary law). The precise content and extent of due diligence varies in conjunction with specific obligations. The ILC has deliberately refrained from including due diligence in the Articles on State Responsibility because this would entail examination of the content of primary rules; nevertheless, it did point out that there is a presumption that any primary rule contains a qualification of due diligence.58\nIn the context of trans-boundary harm from hazardous activities the ILC has adopted the view that the duty of due diligence involved does not extend to guaranteeing that significant harm is to be totally prevented if it is impossible to do so. Furthermore the ILC stated that the standard of due diligence to assess the conduct of a State would be that which would be deemed 'appropriate and proportional to the degree of risk of trans-boundary harm in the particular instance'.59 Moreover, the Sea Bed Disputes Chamber of the International Tribunal of the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) ruled in its Advisory Opinion in the Responsibilities and Obligations of States with respect to Activities in the Area ruled that due diligence is a 'variable concept' and the standard it may set may change as a result of scientific and technological developments as well as the risks involved in a particular activity.60\nIn the human rights field the duty of due diligence has been upheld in Velasquez-Rodriguez in which the Inter-American Court of Human Rights interpreted the obligation introduced in Article 1(1) of the Inter-American Convention of Human Rights to respect and ensure the exercise of the rights enshrined in the Convention. The Court ruled that the obligation to 'ensure' the exercise of these rights gave rise to the duty of contracting States to organize the governmental infrastructure in such a way so as to ensure 'free and full enjoyment' of the rights and prevent, investigate and punish\n\nNicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389\nDownloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM\nvia University of Tasmania\nState responsibility in cyberspace 67\ntheir violation; this obligation to ‘ensure’ is not fulfilled solely by the existence of ‘a legal system designed to make it possible to comply with this obligation – it also requires the government to conduct itself so as to effectively ensure the free and full exercise of human rights’.\nThe ICJ has dealt with the duty of diligence in a number of disputes involving alleged breaches of international obligations in a variety of contexts. In *Corfu Channel* the Court ruled at the outset that the mere existence of the source of an injurious act (in this case the mines) in the territory of Albania was not sufficient to attribute this act to the State, for the control exercised by a State over its territory as a result of sovereignty does not establish *prima facie* knowledge of every activity taking place therein. After establishing knowledge by Albania of the laying of mines in its territorial sea, the Court ruled that the responsibility of Albania lay in her failure to notify the existence of a minefield in its territorial sea to third-State shipping. In the opinion of the Court, this obligation rested on three general principles, namely, elementary considerations of humanity, the freedom of maritime communication and ‘every State’s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States’. But the Court also took account of the particular factual circumstances of the case in order to confirm its legal finding: it acknowledged that if the mines had been laid at the last possible moment, namely, less than 24 hours before the UK warships struck them it would have been difficult or even impossible to issue a general notification to third-State shipping. But, as the incident took place at a time by which the Albanian authorities could have had knowledge of the existence of the mines as a result of their close surveillance of the *Corfu Strait*, Albania did not observe its duty of due diligence. In *US Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran* the Court ruled that the acts of the demonstrators who took over the premises of the US embassy and held its staff hostage could not be imputed *per se* to the government of Iran. However, Iran bore responsibility because of its failure to observe its obligation under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (1961) to protect the inviolability of the persons and premises of another State’s diplomatic mission.\nIn *Congo v. Uganda* the Court dealt in the context of the first counterclaim of Uganda with the allegation that the Congo had violated its obligation of due diligence (or duty of vigilance) by failing to prevent the action of dissident armed bands against Uganda from its territory. The Court ruled that the existence and toleration of armed groups on Congolese territory could not be assimilated with active support to these groups; in addition, the Court took into account the inimical geographical terrain where the groups operated and the material inability of the Congolese (as well as the former Zairian) Government to effectively control that part of the territory of the State.

In the course of its reasoning the Court made some statements of principle regarding the duty to prevent (due diligence) even though it made it clear that it did not intend to introduce a general framework of universal application on the duty of due diligence; it observed that ‘the content of duty to prevent varies from one instrument to another, according to the wording of the relevant provisions, and depending on the nature of the acts to be prevented’. Then the Court analysed the content of the duty to prevent in relation to the crime of genocide. It stated at the outset that this duty was an obligation of conduct and not of result; hence, a State did not have the obligation to succeed in preventing genocide ‘whatever the circumstances’ but was under the obligation to ‘employ all means reasonably available’ to it to prevent the commission of the crime. Thus, failure to achieve the desired result does not give rise to responsibility; by contrast, responsibility arises in case of manifest failure to take all steps within its power that would contribute to preventing genocide because ‘in this area the notion of “due diligence”, which calls for an assessment in concreto, is of critical importance. Various parameters operate when assessing whether a State has duly discharged the obligation concerned’. The Court proceeded to identify those parameters in relation to the specific obligation to prevent genocide and found of particular importance the capacity to influence (within the limits of the law) the perpetrators on the basis of: (a) the geographical distance between the State concerned and the scene of the crime: and (b) the strength of political or other links between the State and the perpetrators. The essence of due diligence lies, therefore, in the application of all means at the disposal of the State even though such application may be proved on the basis of evidence to be futile; in other words a State must not be inert even in the knowledge that its measures will in all probability be ineffective to prevent the injurious act. Even though the Court found that the duty to prevent genocide would give rise to responsibility only when the crime was actually committed (viz. Article 14(3) ARS) it recognized that a State was not absolved from responsibility if it remains inactive until commission of the crime commences where there is a serious risk of its commission; in such a contingency the State is under the obligation to employ the means available to it to prevent the crime, otherwise the substance of the obligation would be negated.\n Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (Democratic Republic of the Congo v.

The latter contingency would require further evidence that the ultimate outcome was the direct result of acts or omissions amounting to the breach of this other primary rule and not simply the failure to adopt preventative measures that even they might not guarantee beyond all doubt that the end result would not occur.\nOn the basis of the preceding analysis it is submitted that the responsibility of a State for internationally wrongful acts in cyberspace may be established in customary law on the duty of due diligence in observing the obligation of not knowingly allowing its territory to be the source of acts violating the rights of other States. The content of the due diligence must be assessed by taking into account, first, that the use of the Internet is not unlawful *per se*; secondly, that transmission from a computer or a host of computers may or may not be the actual source of the injurious activity and; finally, that the existence of thousands of computers on the territory of a State does not by and of itself constitute knowledge of such injurious activity. Moreover, due diligence being an obligation of conduct and not of result does not entail as a necessary outcome the obligation to take steps to protect the rights of other States as this appears to go beyond the requirement to employ all means that a State reasonably possesses to prevent an unlawful act.76 Furthermore, knowledge of the cyber injurious act could be established only upon the notification by the victim State that has the discretion to select the States (they may be many) from the territories of which injurious transmissions occur.\nThe criteria for selection for notification are a matter of political decision, but once notification takes place ‘knowledge’ exists and the State or States notified are under an obligation to employ measures reasonably at their disposal to prevent the wrongful cyber activity. Such measures appear to be commensurate with the possession of technological capabilities to deny temporarily Internet service either to particular users or throughout the State, even though the latter may disproportionately affect the function of the governmental and economic infrastructure of the State. Thus, it appears to be a matter of balancing the cost of Internet denial to the State of origin against the effect of the injurious acts to the victim State and this is to be assessed in the particular circumstances of each case. However, total denial of service may not, in principle, be regarded as a reasonable response to injurious cyber acts; but it may not be excluded, either in particular circumstances or even more so when States appear prepared to resort to it to silence political opponents or contain internal unrest. What is important is that a State that is established to have knowledge of injurious cyber acts emanating from its territory is under a duty to act in a preventative manner irrespective of the fact\n\nNicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389\nDownloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM\nvia University of Tasmania\n\nthat the said cyber activity also originates from the territories of other States. To say that the failure to employ measures within that State’s capability is of no consequence because the wrongful cyber activity also emanates from computers located in a plurality of States does not absolve the former from responsibility under due diligence. The ICJ ruled in *Bosnian Genocide* that such an assertion is irrelevant to the breach of an obligation of conduct warranted by the duty of due diligence, especially when there is a possibility of cooperation through concerted action in a situation where the perpetrator of an injurious cyber act takes over a large number of computers situated in a plurality of States. Indeed, it is because of this contingency, so frequent in practice, that cooperation and concerted action is essential either on an *ad hoc* basis to counter specific wrongful cyber activities or on a more permanent basis through institutionalized mechanisms or a pre-existing framework of good practices in cyber-space. Thus, the NATO initiatives on information security are in principle steps in the right direction as well as the initiative of China and the Russian Federation for the introduction of an International Code of Conduct for Information Security.\n# 5. CONCLUSION\nCyberspace raises many challenges to the law on State responsibility as it has evolved through State practice, judicial decisions and the work of the ILC culminating in the 2001 ARS. Cyberspace as a domain has international dimensions; therefore it is in principle amenable to regulation by international law and the rules on State responsibility, in particular, may be applied. While a breach of an international obligation may be established without much difficulty in relation to certain types of cyber activity, it is attribution of it to a specific State that raises difficulties that in practice appear insurmountable and seem to defy the rules on attribution established in the ILC ARS.\nThese rules on attribution are centred on acts of persons and their imputation to a particular State. Moreover, the process of attribution is a juridical one. However, the nature of cyberspace as a domain, the freedom and the prima facie lawfulness of its use, the transmission of information through computers and the anonymity of the users of those computers leave very little scope for establishing with a relative degree of certainty both the identity of the user and his/her link to a specific State. The only fact that can be established with certainty is the location of a particular computer or computers in the territory of one or more States. This gives rise to the presumption that the State from the territory of which cyber injurious acts emanate could be the one that may incur responsibility. However, this does not dispense with the specific rules of\n Case Concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (n 16) 221.\n O’Connell (n 6) 206–9.\n NATO, ‘NATO and Cyber Defence’ (7 August 2014) <http: en=\"\" esp=\"\" natolive=\"\" topics_78170.htm?=\"\" www.nato.int=\"\"> accessed 13 August 2014.\n Letter dated 12 September 2011 from the Permanent Representatives of China, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary–General, Annex, A/66/359.\nNicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389\nDownloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM\nvia University of Tasmania</http:>\nState responsibility in cyberspace 71\nattribution and the fact that computers situated in the territory of a one or more States are the actual source of wrongful cyber acts as they may have been ‘hijacked’ by the real perpetrator. Hence there have been suggestions of overcoming this difficulty by addressing attribution more flexibly or even by going beyond its existing legal framework and establishing it on existing political relations between the States concerned. Whereas political relations may constitute a factor for a victim State of selecting another State or other States as the likely source of wrongful cyber activity, it should not constitute a substitute for the existing rules on attribution and should not dispense with the burden of proof of the grounds of attribution. This enterprise requires evidence and as this is not possible to collect on the territory of a State from which cyber activity occurs, circumstantial evidence may be admissible (for instance, the revelation in the press by former government agents that a State has engaged in wrongful cyber acts) as well as the reversal of the burden of proof upon the State allegedly perpetrating injurious cyber acts.\nThe difficulty in applying the existing rules on attribution could be overcome by focusing on the primary rule breached (namely, the specific international obligation) in conjunction with the duty of due diligence either by reference to the substantive content of the primary obligation or the general principle of international law that no State must knowingly allow its territory to be used for injurious acts against other States. In this manner, responsibility may be established on the fact that certain wrongful cyber acts have their source in computers located in the territory of a State or a plurality of States and it occurs with knowledge of the latter. This knowledge would be established on the basis of alerting the territorial State (or States) to the fact of wrongful cyber activity from its territory and its failure to act by employing measures within its capabilities to curb that activity. The best course of action to achieve cessation of injurious cyber acts appears to be through the adoption of good Internet practices and international cooperation.\nNicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389\nDownloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM via University of Tasmania"

They represent domains the use of which is indispensable to the entire or at least a substantial part of the global population. At the same time, as this author understands it, they are not identical in meaning as a matter of computer science terminology. The Internet is a ‘global network connecting millions of computers’; it is ‘decentralized by design’, subject to ownership or control (unlike ‘online services’) by no single (or a plurality of) person or entity.¹ The Internet has a physical dimension because of the interconnection of different computer systems, their accessibility and the transmission of information to and from such systems by using the standard Internet Protocol (IP).² Cyberspace, however, is a more abstract term; it is a non-physical domain created by computer systems that allows people to communicate with each other, to exchange or to gather information. Moreover, it refers to the ‘notional environment in which digitized information is communicated over computer networks’.³ Be this as it may, it appears that there exists a tendency to treat these two terms as synonyms and use them interchangeably. To give an example, the US Government Cyber Policy Review 2009 defines cyberspace as ‘the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, and includes the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers in critical industries. Common usage of the term also refers to the virtual environment of information and interactions between people’.⁴ It appears therefore, that apart from identity in terms, these two concepts have a dual role: they refer to the domain as well as to the medium of conducting certain activities. Furthermore, it would be an understatement to say that the Internet is important to private individuals, corporations and States: the US Government has stated that cyberspace / the Internet underlines every aspect of modern society and it is both the\n¹ Vangie Beal, ‘Internet’ (Webopedia) <http: Internet.html=\"\" term=\"\" www.webopedia.com=\"\"> accessed on 1 November 2013.\n² Bill Young, ‘Navigating Cyberspace: Introduction to Cyberspace’ (9 January 2013) University of Texas <http: cs329e=\"\" slides1-introduction.pdf=\"\" www.cs.utexas.edu=\"\" ~byoung=\"\"> accessed on 4 November 2013.\n³ US Department of Defense, ‘Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms’ JP 1–02 (12 April 2001, as amended through 31 August 2005) 139.\n⁴ The White House, ‘Cyberspace Policy Review: Assuring a trusted and resilient information and communications infrastructure’ (2009) <http: assets=\"\" documents=\"\" cyberspace_policy_review_final.pdf=\"\" www.whitehouse.gov=\"\"> 1, accessed on 4 November 2013.\nNicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389\nDownloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM\nvia University of Tasmania</http:></http:></http:>\nResearch handbook on international law and cyberspace\ndomain where and the medium by which economic, public safety, civil society and national security activities are pursued.⁵\nWhile the usefulness of the Internet is universally acknowledged, the same is the case with regard to its misuse or hostile use, in the form of cyber-crime and espionage.⁶ In particular, as nowadays private business and governments conduct most of their functions and activities in cyberspace, safety and resilience are matters to be preserved. In the words of the US Cyber Policy Review 2009 ‘to realize the full benefits of digital revolution, users must have confidence that sensitive information is secure, commerce is not compromised and the infrastructure is not infiltrated. Nation-states also need confidence that the networks that support their national security and economic prosperity are safe and resilient. ...’⁷ It is, therefore, not inconceivable that the Internet may be used in such a way as to cause harm to States or as to compel them to act in a particular manner. There have been three episodes in State practice that have revealed how the hostile use of the Internet may affect the orderly function of basic services in a State or threaten its security. In 2007 Estonia was the object of massive and coordinated computer hacking attacks that paralyzed its economy and the functioning of government services for weeks. In 2008 Georgia was the target of similar attacks during the conflict with the Russian Federation with respect to South Ossetia. Also, in 2009 a computer virus by the name of Stuxnet caused the progress of the nuclear program of Iran to suffer significant delay.⁸ In this context the question arises whether such use of the Internet may give rise to State responsibility. The answer must be in the affirmative provided that a specific use of the Internet amounts to an ‘internationally wrongful act’.⁹ As the Internet is an international domain, then States must conduct themselves over this domain in accordance with international law¹⁰ and therefore the use of cyberspace is subject to international law. As Harold Koh, the former Legal Advisor of the US State Department has remarked ‘international law principles do apply in cyberspace. ...’¹¹ However, there are substantive challenges facing the law on international responsibility as it exists in contemporary international law by the particularities of cyberspace since this body of rules is premised heavily on attribution of acts of individuals to a State. Be as it may, the present author submits, that the application of this area of international law to cyberspace is not impossible, mainly as a result of establishing responsibility on the basis of the breach of the obligation of due diligence on the part of States, which dispenses with the difficulty of attributing acts of individuals to a State, while even attribution may in certain cases be established.

AN OUTLINE OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF STATE RESPONSIBILITY\nState responsibility appears to have emerged as a branch of international law by way of private law analogy.¹³ As the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ) ruled in Factory at Chorzów (Indemnities) ‘it is a principle of international law, and even a general conception of law, that any breach of an engagement involves an obligation to make reparation’.¹⁴ However, subsequent judicial pronouncements and the work of the International Law Commission (ILC) form a departure from legal analogies with the domestic law of tort in favour of reconstructing the responsibility as a matter of international public law arising when, an act: (1) is attributable to a State; and (2) constitutes a breach of an international obligation. In US Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran the International Court (ICJ) stated that it had to ‘determine how far, legally, the acts in question may be regarded as imputable to the Iranian State’ and whether they were compatible or not ‘with the obligations of Iran under treaties in force or under any other rules of international law that may be applicable’.¹⁵ Moreover, in Bosnian Genocide the ICJ ruled with regard to the breach of the Genocide Convention that ‘the obligations in question … and the responsibilities of States that would arise from breach of such obligations are obligations and responsibilities under international law. They are not of a criminal nature’.¹⁶\nThe contemporary law of State responsibility has as its principal source of reference the Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARS)\n¹² Ibid.

However, since 2001 it has been so extensively cited by international courts and tribunals, as well as in State practice, that it is considered as an authoritative statement of the customary international law on State responsibility.¹⁸ The legal regime introduced by ARS is premised on the distinction introduced by ILC Rapporteur Roberto Ago between ‘primary obligations’ and ‘secondary rules’. The very first paragraph of the Introduction of the Commentaries to ARS states that:\nThe emphasis is on the secondary rules of State responsibility, that is to say, the general conditions under international law for the State to be considered responsible for wrongful actions or omissions, and the legal consequences which flow therefrom. The articles do not attempt to define the content of the international obligations breach of which gives rise to responsibility.¹⁹\nA second basic feature of ARS is that it views responsibility of States not as an exclusive pattern of bilateral relations between the wrongdoing and injured State. By contrast, State responsibility is given a public order dimension by laying emphasis on the existence of an internationally wrongful act²⁰ and not upon the damage or injury caused and the existence of a causal link between the damage and the breach of obligation. Thus, the Commentary to Article 1 ARS states that:\n[T]he term ‘international responsibility’ ... covers the relations which arise under international law from the internationally wrongful act of a State, whether such relations are limited to the wrongdoing State and one injured State or whether they extend also to other States or indeed to other subjects of international law, and whether they are centred on obligations of restitution or compensation or also give the injured State the possibility of responding by way of counter-measures.²¹\nMoreover, this dimension of State responsibility is further supported by Articles 40 and 48 ARS dealing, respectively, with serious breaches of obligations arising under a peremptory norm of international law and the invocation of the responsibility of a State by States other than the injured party.\nAs the emphasis in ARS lies in the wrongful act, central position is given to its requirements, namely, attribution to a State and breach of an international obligation (Art. 2 ARS). Attribution means ‘the operation of attaching a given act or omission to a State’²² and to this end the ARS relies on the identity of natural persons and their\n¹⁷  Yearbook of the ILC, vol.

As the Commentary to Article 2 ARS makes absolutely clear the fact is that States act through human beings or groups; therefore, the issue of attribution is reduced to identifying the persons or groups that should be considered to act on behalf of the State.²³ This finding appears to rest on a dual basis that is disjunctively applied: either the identity of a person or group as such or the control exercised by a State over the activities of a person or a group. In a nutshell, the ARS, for the purposes of attribution, are centred on the individual. Thus, the responsibility of a State is engaged for acts or omissions by the following categories of individuals:\n(a) De jure State agents or organs, irrespective of their hierarchical position in the apparatus of the State or the constitutional structure or organization of the State (namely, whether it is a unitary or federal State) (Art.4 ARS);\n(b) De facto State organs, namely, non-State actors or entities that have been 'elevated' to de facto State agents or organs because they are under the absolute dependence and control of a State. In Bosnian Genocide the issue before the ICJ was whether the atrocities perpetrated by the Bosnian Serbs in Srebrenica in July 1995, which as the Court ruled amounted to commission of genocide under the 1948 Genocide Convention, could be attributed to Serbia. The Court ruled that:\n[t]his question has in fact two aspects, which the Court must consider separately. First, it should be ascertained whether the acts committed in Srebrenica were perpetrated by organs of the Respondent [namely, Serbia], i.e., by persons or entities whose conduct is necessarily attributable to it, because they are in fact instruments of its action. Next, if the preceding question is answered in the negative, it should be ascertained whether the acts in question were committed by persons who, while not organs of the Respondent, did nevertheless act on the instruments of, or under the direction or control of, the Respondent.²⁴\nThe Court then proceeded to identify de facto States organs as;\npersons, groups of persons or entities [that], may for purposes of international responsibility, be equated with State organs even if that status does not follow from internal law, provided that in fact the persons, groups or entities act in 'complete dependence' on the State of which they are ultimately the instrument ...²⁵;\n(c) Delegation of Government Authority. In this contingency the conduct of a non-State actor (i.e. 'a person or entity which is not the organ of the State') is to be considered as an act of the State if the non-State actor 'is empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of governmental authority' and it 'is acting in that capacity in the particular instance' (Art. 5 ARS);\n(d) The situation where an organ of a State is placed at the disposal of another State. The acts or omissions of this organ in the exercise of government authority on behalf of the State at the disposal of which it has been placed give rise to this State's responsibility (Art. 6 ARS);\n²³ Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (n 19) 35.\n²⁴ Case Concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (n 16) (Merits) 201.\n²⁵ Ibid. 205 [emphasis added].\nNicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389\nDownloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM\nvia University of Tasmania\nResearch handbook on international law and cyberspace\n(e) Ultra Vires Acts. A State organ or entity gives rise to the responsibility of the State even when acting in this capacity it exceeds its authority or against instructions (Art.7 ARS);\n(f) Instructions, Direction and Control of a State over acts of private persons. In the jurisprudence of the ICJ this control must be ‘effective control’ in order to give rise to the responsibility of the State. The Court reached this finding in Nicaragua where it ruled that the US assistance to the contras and its general control over them were not sufficient in default of further evidence to attribute their acts violating human rights and humanitarian law to the US government. By contrast ‘[f]or this conduct to give rise to legal responsibility of the United States, it would in principle have to be proved that that State had effective control of the military and paramilitary operations in the course of which the alleged violations were committed.’ 26 Moreover, in Bosnian Genocide the Court, having found that the Bosnian Serbs did not constitute a de facto organ of Serbia, proceeded to determine whether Serbia exercised effective control over them. The Court explained that the:\ntest thus formulated differs in two respects from the test ... to determine whether a person or entity may be equated with a State organ even if not having that status under internal law. First, in this context it is not necessary to show that the persons who performed the acts alleged to have violated international law were in general in a relationship of ‘complete dependence’ on the respondent State; it has to be proved that they acted in accordance with the State’s instructions or under its ‘effective control’. It must however be shown that this ‘effective control’ was exercised, or that the State’s instructions were given, in respect of each operation in which the alleged violations occurred, not generally in respect of the overall actions taken by the persons or groups of persons having committed the violations.27\nIn this respect, the Court declined to uphold the ruling of the ICTY Appeals Chamber in the Tadić case where the ad hoc Tribunal applied the test of ‘overall control’ that dispenses with the need to evaluate control of a State over each specific operation of a non-State actor;28 the Court took the view that the determination of State responsibility on the part of Serbia did not constitute an indispensable finding to determine individual criminal responsibility by an international criminal tribunal29 (Art. 8 ARS);\n(g) Exercise of elements of government authority in the absence of or inadequate function of State authorities and in circumstances that warrant the exercise of this authority. In Yeager v. Islamic Republic of Iran the Iran-US Claims Tribunal ruled\n26 Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

Tadić,  ICTY Appeals Chamber Judgment, IT–94–1–A, para. 145; but cf. ibid. paras 118–122, where the Tribunal has drawn a distinction between acts performed by private individuals to which the effective control test applies (as articulated in Nicaragua Case) and organized military groups to which the overall control test applies.\n29 Case Concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (n 16) 209–10.\nNicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389\nDownloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM\nvia University of Tasmania\nState responsibility in cyberspace 61\nthat the immigration, customs and other similar acts that had been carried out by the Revolutionary Guards at the Tehran airport in the immediate aftermath of the Islamic revolution were attributable to Iran. The Tribunal reasoned that even though these functions were not authorized by the Iranian government they objectively consisted in the exercise of elements of governmental authority in the absence of official authorities of the State ‘in operations of which the new Government must have had knowledge and to which it did not specifically object.’³⁰ (Art. 9 ARS);\n(h) The ARS provides in particular that acts or omissions by an insurrectional or other movement are attributed to a State in the event the insurrection is successful and the movement become the government of the State (Art. 10 ARS);\n(i) Approval and Adoption by a State of acts of private persons or entities. In US Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran the Court ruled that the act of overrunning of the US Embassy in Tehran by demonstrators and the seizure as hostages of the US diplomatic staff could not be as such attributed to the Iranian Government because the demonstrators were neither State organs nor did they carry out a specific government act on behalf of the State³¹. However, the responsibility of Iran for the acts of the demonstrators was established at a later stage when the Iranian government approved of and adopted the occupation of the Embassy premises and the captivity of the US diplomatic staff as its own³² (Art.11 ARS).\nThe second requirement of State responsibility, namely a breach of an international obligation, may consist in a physical act or omission and may emanate from a rule of either customary law or treaty (Art. 12 ARS) that introduces an obligation in force for the particular State (Art.13 ARS). Moreover, the responsibility of a State may arise whether the act is or is not of a continuing character (Arts 14 and 15 ARS) or it constitutes part of a composite activity. Furthermore, State responsibility arises with respect to acts of other States. This is not to say that acts of other States are attributed to another State for, as the ILC has made clear, the ARS is premised on the principle that ‘each State is responsible for its own wrongful conduct … attributable to it … which is in breach of an international obligation of that State …’ and that ‘responsibility is specific to the State concerned’.³³ Even though in this respect the ILC identifies contingencies of ‘collaborative conduct’³⁴ it does not appear to introduce a particular legal framework of ‘shared responsibility’ for the collaborative element appears to be viewed simply as a factual rather than a normative parameter.³⁵ This is further corroborated by Article 47(1) ARS on the invocation of State responsibility for an\n³⁰  17 Iran–US Claims Tribunal Rep.

Having said this, the responsibility of a State for the acts of another State arises on the basis of conduct of the former State in relation to the latter that consists in aid or assistance, direction and control and coercion (of the latter State). In each of these contingencies there must be two requirements cumulatively: first, the conduct must be internationally wrongful if it was committed by the other State and, secondly, the aiding/controlling/coercing State must have knowledge of the circumstances of the internationally wrongful act (Arts 16–18 ARS). Finally, the ILC ARS provide for grounds precluding the wrongfulness of an act that *prima facie* constitutes a breach of an international obligation; these are: consent (Art. 20); self-defence (Art. 21); countermeasures (Arts 22, 49–54); *force majeure* (Art. 23); distress (Art. 24); and necessity (Art. 25).\n# 3. ATTRIBUTION IN CYBERSPACE\nCyberspace as a domain and the use of electronic devices as a medium of State conduct raises difficulties with respect to ascribing particular acts to States. There is no reason sweepingly to deny as a matter of principle the application of the rules of attribution provided in ARS to conduct in cyberspace. However, the identification of individuals or entities that use the Internet is characterized by considerable difficulty, for the Internet guarantees, if not actually absolute, certainly a large measure of anonymity or deniability. Thus, it is almost impossible to identify directly and with certainty the person or entity operating a personal computer. Identification of persons, and by consequence, attribution is only possible via the identification of a computer by way of its IP that identifies its precise location.\nTherefore, an internationally wrongful act in cyberspace appears to be ascribed to a particular computer whereas the identity of the person operating it may only be established either by way of presumption or on the basis of inside information disclosed by government agents of the State perpetrating the internationally wrongful acts in cyberspace.³⁶ Thus, if a computer is identified by way of its location (in the premises of a government department or a diplomatic mission) as a government computer then the transmission of malware or denial of service interference may in principle be attributed to a particular State. This appears to be established either on the identity of the operator who is presumed to be a government agent or on the mere location of the computer as this falls under the exclusive and complete control of a State. Thus, in October and November 2013 the German Government launched strong diplomatic protests with the US and UK Governments for allegations of electronic surveillance of German governmental departments, including the German Chancellor’s\n³⁶ Viz. the information disclosed by the former US National Security Agency (NSA) Edward Snowden on the NSA surveillance of many foreign government agencies; see Joshua Eaton, ‘Timeline of Edward Snowden’s revelations’, *Al Jazeera America* <http: articles=\"\" multimedia=\"\" timeline–edward–snowden–revelations.html=\"\" www.dailymotion.com=\"\"> accessed on 26 November 2013.\nNicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389\nDownloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM\nvia University of Tasmania</http:>\nState responsibility in cyberspace 63\nOffice, from the US and UK embassies in Berlin. In particular, the German Government warned the UK ambassador that the interception of German Government information by intelligence services from a diplomatic mission constituted a breach of international law.³⁷\nAt the same time, the Tallinn Manual adopts a rather cautious approach to attribution with respect to cyber wrongful acts by stating that the fact that a cyber operation has its source in government cyber infrastructure is not sufficient to attribute these acts to a State; it merely constitutes an indication that a particular State is associated with the cyber operation. The Manual explains this approach by reference to the particular features of cyber context and especially the likelihood that a government cyber infrastructure may be ‘hijacked’ by non-State actors.³⁸ Moreover, the former Legal Advisor of the US Department of State has acknowledged the problem of attribution in that cyberspace ‘significantly increases an actor’s ability to engage in attacks with “plausible deniability”, by acting through proxies’ and suggested that this challenge is ‘as much [a question] of a technical and policy nature rather than exclusively or predominantly’ a question of law.³⁹ But attribution is predominantly a question of law and it is not determined ‘on the mere recognition of a link of factual causality’.⁴⁰ Furthermore, neither the Tallinn Manual nor the US Government propose an alternative cogent framework of attribution but leave the whole issue surrounded in ambiguity which suggests a wide margin of discretion on the part of an injured State to decide the matter of attribution on the basis of extra-legal factors, such as the general political climate between it and another State.⁴¹ In the absence of an alternative proposition it appears that this position casts aside the current legal framework of attribution by replacing it with a laissez faire approach by an injured State on a case-by-case basis.\nAttribution of an injurious act to a State is a matter of evidence. As injurious acts in cyberspace emanate from computers located in the territory of one or more States the territorial location of computers may serve as a starting-point. State sovereignty entails the expectation that every State exercises control over cyber infrastructure and activities within its territory.⁴² However, as the ICJ ruled in Corfu Channel the mere fact of existence of objects constituting a source of injurious acts (in this case computers engaged in injurious cyber acts) within its territory is not sufficient to impute knowledge of these acts to the State. At the same time, the victim State is permitted ‘a more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence’.⁴³ This lower\n³⁷ Nigel Morris et. al., ‘Germany calls in Britain’s ambassador to demand explanation over “secret Berlin listening post”’ (6 November 2013) The Independent <http: news=\"\" uk=\"\" politics=\"\" germany--calls--in--britains--ambassador--to--demand--explanation--over--secret--berlin--listening--post--8923082.html=\"\" www.independent.co.uk=\"\"> accessed 13 August 2014.\n³⁸ Michael N.

In the cyber context the establishment of the exact and actual source of the injurious act is extremely difficult to locate, let alone establish the identity of the perpetrator.⁴⁴ Thus, it appears that a very liberal approach to evidence is called for by the very nature of cyberspace that would combine expert technical knowledge, press reports⁴⁵ (where available) revelation by defector public officials of a State (the US NSA surveillance activities were divulged by former NSA official Edward Snowden) even though the fact of defection may diminish its probative value as evidence contrary to the interests of his own State.⁴⁶ The inherent difficulty in identifying a single State as the source of an injurious cyber act⁴⁷ appears to leave the victim State two possible avenues: either the identification of the perpetrating State on the basis of the existing political climate between it and the victim State or cooperation with other States whether in the context of international organizations or not. The first avenue may entail a degree of arbitrariness and ultimately it does not, and cannot by itself, establish responsibility in the absence of more objective evidence. By contrast, the second avenue offers a better potential of identifying the alleged wrong-doing State. The fact, however, remains that such identification defies to a large extent the established legal framework of attribution.\nOn the basis of the assumption that injurious cyber activity can be traced to the territory of a single State it is submitted that the best approach in the cyber context is to attribute hostile cyber acts to this State on the basis of a presumption of responsibility which may be rebutted by the State on the basis of evidence. In other words, attribution may rest on a presumption that introduces a reversal of the burden of proof. This submission departs from the ruling of the ICJ in Corfu Channel but unlike sea-mines, computers are ubiquitous and by their nature not injurious. Thus, all that has to be established is their location in the territory of a particular State and the latter's alertness by the victim to the fact that injurious cyber acts emanate therefrom. Once this takes place knowledge of the injurious activity is established. It is true that the State from the territory of which the injurious acts emanate may not constitute their actual source, as the computers on its territory may have been hijacked. But this is no reason to deny the right of the victim to alert this State and demand measures on its part for the cessation of the injurious activities. Such measures may entail, depending on the circumstances, a degree of denial of Internet services throughout the territory of that State, and it is a question of balancing the interests of both the victim State and the State from the territory of which the particular cyber activity emanates on whether or not this is feasible.⁴⁸ However, this cannot be prima facie excluded as a possibility in\n⁴⁴ Tsagourias (n 41) 233–5.\n⁴⁵ Cf. Nicaragua Case (n 26) 40–41.\n⁴⁶ Ibid. 43.\n⁴⁷ Tsagourias mentions that the cyber attack on Estonia in 2007 ‘involved a large botnet of approximately 85,000 hijacked computers from around 178 countries’: see: (n 41) 233.\n⁴⁸ Tallinn Manual (n 38) 33.\nNicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389\nDownloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM\nvia University of Tasmania\nState responsibility in cyberspace 65\nview of the fact that States in other circumstances (for instance, when facing unrest by dissident political groups) are all too prepared to adopt sweeping measures of Internet service-denial even throughout their territories. Having said this, there appears to be only one situation in which injurious cyber acts may not be imputed to the territorial State, namely, where the acts emanate from a location that is under the exclusive jurisdiction of another State, such as the premises of a diplomatic mission or the installation of a military base. In the context of the US NSA electronic surveillance practices it was reported that special units located on the rooftops of a number of US embassies in Europe and Asia (such as the US embassies in Athens and Baku) collected data.⁴⁹ In these cases these acts would not be attributed to the host States (respectively, Greece and Azerbaijan) but to the USA.\n## 4. BREACH OF AN INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATION IN CYBERSPACE\nThere is no difficulty with the proposition that activities in cyberspace may constitute breach of international obligations giving rise to State responsibility. Thus, certain acts may violate the sovereignty of another State or other States, in the sense of interfering in areas of competence that are exclusively reserved to every State. This contingency may be relative to incidents of electronic surveillance of, or espionage against, government departments and personnel of another State.⁵⁰ However, there is no consensus on this issue: according to a school of thought that relies on the famous (or infamous?) Lotus principle,⁵¹ espionage is not prohibited or regulated by international law; therefore, its practice does not as such constitute a breach of the sovereignty of another State, unless perhaps some additional damage is caused.⁵² On the other hand, it is argued that if an act is not expressly prohibited by international law this does not lead necessarily and automatically to its permissibility;⁵³ espionage, in particular, is practiced extensively by States but no government has ever asserted that it constitutes a lawful enterprise.⁵⁴ Moreover, cyber acts may constitute instances of unlawful intervention in the internal or external affairs of another State, provided the element of ‘coercion’ exists,⁵⁵ or use of force.⁵⁶\n⁴⁹ Morris (n 37).\n⁵⁰ On cyber espionage and international law see Buchan (Ch 8 of this book).\n⁵¹ The Case of the ‘S.S.

The considerable difficulty of attribution of an act perpetrated in cyberspace on the basis of the identity or the link of a person or of an entity operating computers to a State, points at the other, in most cases the only, ground for establishing responsibility: the violation of the duty of due diligence arising from the principle that no State may knowingly allow its territory to be used for, or be the source of, acts injurious to other States.57 The proof of attribution in this contingency is made redundant because it concerns an omission to act in accordance with a primary obligation and it may be established by the fact that a State possesses the requisite infrastructure operated by its agents or de facto agents or private parties to which government authority was delegated, to prevent such injurious acts. Thus, due diligence is the primary obligation the breach of which (failure to act or omission) ensures the observance of other primary obligations (either based on treaty or customary law). The precise content and extent of due diligence varies in conjunction with specific obligations. The ILC has deliberately refrained from including due diligence in the Articles on State Responsibility because this would entail examination of the content of primary rules; nevertheless, it did point out that there is a presumption that any primary rule contains a qualification of due diligence.58\nIn the context of trans-boundary harm from hazardous activities the ILC has adopted the view that the duty of due diligence involved does not extend to guaranteeing that significant harm is to be totally prevented if it is impossible to do so. Furthermore the ILC stated that the standard of due diligence to assess the conduct of a State would be that which would be deemed 'appropriate and proportional to the degree of risk of trans-boundary harm in the particular instance'.59 Moreover, the Sea Bed Disputes Chamber of the International Tribunal of the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) ruled in its Advisory Opinion in the Responsibilities and Obligations of States with respect to Activities in the Area ruled that due diligence is a 'variable concept' and the standard it may set may change as a result of scientific and technological developments as well as the risks involved in a particular activity.60\nIn the human rights field the duty of due diligence has been upheld in Velasquez-Rodriguez in which the Inter-American Court of Human Rights interpreted the obligation introduced in Article 1(1) of the Inter-American Convention of Human Rights to respect and ensure the exercise of the rights enshrined in the Convention. The Court ruled that the obligation to 'ensure' the exercise of these rights gave rise to the duty of contracting States to organize the governmental infrastructure in such a way so as to ensure 'free and full enjoyment' of the rights and prevent, investigate and punish\n57 Corfu Channel Case (n 43) 22.\n58 Report of the International Law Commission on the work of its 51st session (Supplement No 10, 3 May–23 July 1999) GAOR, A/54/10, 86; Jan A Hessbruegge, ‘The historical development of the doctrines of attribution and due diligence in international law’ (2004) N.Y.U.

In *Corfu Channel* the Court ruled at the outset that the mere existence of the source of an injurious act (in this case the mines) in the territory of Albania was not sufficient to attribute this act to the State, for the control exercised by a State over its territory as a result of sovereignty does not establish *prima facie* knowledge of every activity taking place therein.⁶² After establishing knowledge by Albania of the laying of mines in its territorial sea,⁶³ the Court ruled that the responsibility of Albania lay in her failure to notify the existence of a minefield in its territorial sea to third-State shipping. In the opinion of the Court, this obligation rested on three general principles, namely, elementary considerations of humanity, the freedom of maritime communication and ‘every State’s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States’.⁶⁴ But the Court also took account of the particular factual circumstances of the case in order to confirm its legal finding: it acknowledged that if the mines had been laid at the last possible moment, namely, less than 24 hours before the UK warships struck them it would have been difficult or even impossible to issue a general notification to third-State shipping. But, as the incident took place at a time by which the Albanian authorities could have had knowledge of the existence of the mines as a result of their close surveillance of the *Corfu Strait*, Albania did not observe its duty of due diligence.⁶⁵ In *US Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran* the Court ruled that the acts of the demonstrators who took over the premises of the US embassy and held its staff hostage could not be imputed *per se* to the government of Iran. However, Iran bore responsibility because of its failure to observe its obligation under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (1961) to protect the inviolability of the persons and premises of another State’s diplomatic mission.⁶⁶\nIn *Congo v. Uganda* the Court dealt in the context of the first counterclaim of Uganda with the allegation that the Congo had violated its obligation of due diligence (or duty of vigilance) by failing to prevent the action of dissident armed bands against Uganda from its territory. The Court ruled that the existence and toleration of armed groups on Congolese territory could not be assimilated with active support to these groups; in addition, the Court took into account the inimical geographical terrain where the groups operated and the material inability of the Congolese (as well as the former Zairian) Government to effectively control that part of the territory of the State. Thus,\n⁶¹ Velasquez–Rodriguez v. Honduras (Judgment of 29 July 1988)  Inter–Am. Ct.

It stated at the outset that this duty was an obligation of conduct and not of result; hence, a State did not have the obligation to succeed in preventing genocide ‘whatever the circumstances’ but was under the obligation to ‘employ all means reasonably available’ to it to prevent the commission of the crime.⁷⁰ Thus, failure to achieve the desired result does not give rise to responsibility; by contrast, responsibility arises in case of manifest failure to take all steps within its power that would contribute to preventing genocide because ‘in this area the notion of “due diligence”, which calls for an assessment in concreto, is of critical importance. Various parameters operate when assessing whether a State has duly discharged the obligation concerned’.⁷¹ The Court proceeded to identify those parameters in relation to the specific obligation to prevent genocide and found of particular importance the capacity to influence (within the limits of the law) the perpetrators on the basis of: (a) the geographical distance between the State concerned and the scene of the crime: and (b) the strength of political or other links between the State and the perpetrators.⁷² The essence of due diligence lies, therefore, in the application of all means at the disposal of the State even though such application may be proved on the basis of evidence to be futile; in other words a State must not be inert even in the knowledge that its measures will in all probability be ineffective to prevent the injurious act.⁷³ Even though the Court found that the duty to prevent genocide would give rise to responsibility only when the crime was actually committed (viz. Article 14(3) ARS) it recognized that a State was not absolved from responsibility if it remains inactive until commission of the crime commences where there is a serious risk of its commission; in such a contingency the State is under the obligation to employ the means available to it to prevent the crime, otherwise the substance of the obligation would be negated.⁷⁴\n⁶⁷ Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (Democratic Republic of the Congo v.

The latter contingency would require further evidence that the ultimate outcome was the direct result of acts or omissions amounting to the breach of this other primary rule and not simply the failure to adopt preventative measures that even they might not guarantee beyond all doubt that the end result would not occur.\nOn the basis of the preceding analysis it is submitted that the responsibility of a State for internationally wrongful acts in cyberspace may be established in customary law on the duty of due diligence in observing the obligation of not knowingly allowing its territory to be the source of acts violating the rights of other States. The content of the due diligence must be assessed by taking into account, first, that the use of the Internet is not unlawful *per se*; secondly, that transmission from a computer or a host of computers may or may not be the actual source of the injurious activity and; finally, that the existence of thousands of computers on the territory of a State does not by and of itself constitute knowledge of such injurious activity. Moreover, due diligence being an obligation of conduct and not of result does not entail as a necessary outcome the obligation to take steps to protect the rights of other States as this appears to go beyond the requirement to employ all means that a State reasonably possesses to prevent an unlawful act.76 Furthermore, knowledge of the cyber injurious act could be established only upon the notification by the victim State that has the discretion to select the States (they may be many) from the territories of which injurious transmissions occur.\nThe criteria for selection for notification are a matter of political decision, but once notification takes place ‘knowledge’ exists and the State or States notified are under an obligation to employ measures reasonably at their disposal to prevent the wrongful cyber activity. Such measures appear to be commensurate with the possession of technological capabilities to deny temporarily Internet service either to particular users or throughout the State, even though the latter may disproportionately affect the function of the governmental and economic infrastructure of the State. Thus, it appears to be a matter of balancing the cost of Internet denial to the State of origin against the effect of the injurious acts to the victim State and this is to be assessed in the particular circumstances of each case. However, total denial of service may not, in principle, be regarded as a reasonable response to injurious cyber acts; but it may not be excluded, either in particular circumstances or even more so when States appear prepared to resort to it to silence political opponents or contain internal unrest. What is important is that a State that is established to have knowledge of injurious cyber acts emanating from its territory is under a duty to act in a preventative manner irrespective of the fact\n75 *Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay (Argentina v. Uruguay)*  ICJ Rep. 14, 77.\n76 Cf. Tallinn Manual (n 38) 33.\nNicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389\nDownloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM\nvia University of Tasmania\n70 Research handbook on international law and cyberspace\nthat the said cyber activity also originates from the territories of other States. To say that the failure to employ measures within that State’s capability is of no consequence because the wrongful cyber activity also emanates from computers located in a plurality of States does not absolve the former from responsibility under due diligence. The ICJ ruled in *Bosnian Genocide* that such an assertion is irrelevant to the breach of an obligation of conduct warranted by the duty of due diligence, especially when there is a possibility of cooperation through concerted action in a situation where the perpetrator of an injurious cyber act takes over a large number of computers situated in a plurality of States.⁷⁷ Indeed, it is because of this contingency, so frequent in practice, that cooperation and concerted action is essential either on an *ad hoc* basis to counter specific wrongful cyber activities or on a more permanent basis through institutionalized mechanisms or a pre-existing framework of good practices in cyber-space.⁷⁸ Thus, the NATO initiatives on information security are in principle steps in the right direction⁷⁹ as well as the initiative of China and the Russian Federation for the introduction of an International Code of Conduct for Information Security.⁸⁰\n# 5. CONCLUSION\nCyberspace raises many challenges to the law on State responsibility as it has evolved through State practice, judicial decisions and the work of the ILC culminating in the 2001 ARS. Cyberspace as a domain has international dimensions; therefore it is in principle amenable to regulation by international law and the rules on State responsibility, in particular, may be applied. While a breach of an international obligation may be established without much difficulty in relation to certain types of cyber activity, it is attribution of it to a specific State that raises difficulties that in practice appear insurmountable and seem to defy the rules on attribution established in the ILC ARS.\nThese rules on attribution are centred on acts of persons and their imputation to a particular State. Moreover, the process of attribution is a juridical one. However, the nature of cyberspace as a domain, the freedom and the prima facie lawfulness of its use, the transmission of information through computers and the anonymity of the users of those computers leave very little scope for establishing with a relative degree of certainty both the identity of the user and his/her link to a specific State. The only fact that can be established with certainty is the location of a particular computer or computers in the territory of one or more States. This gives rise to the presumption that the State from the territory of which cyber injurious acts emanate could be the one that may incur responsibility. However, this does not dispense with the specific rules of\n⁷⁷ Case Concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (n 16) 221.\n⁷⁸ O’Connell (n 6) 206–9.\n⁷⁹ NATO, ‘NATO and Cyber Defence’ (7 August 2014) <http: en=\"\" esp=\"\" natolive=\"\" topics_78170.htm?=\"\" www.nato.int=\"\"> accessed 13 August 2014.\n⁸⁰ Letter dated 12 September 2011 from the Permanent Representatives of China, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary–General, Annex, A/66/359.\nNicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389\nDownloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM\nvia University of Tasmania</http:>\nState responsibility in cyberspace 71\nattribution and the fact that computers situated in the territory of a one or more States are the actual source of wrongful cyber acts as they may have been ‘hijacked’ by the real perpetrator. Hence there have been suggestions of overcoming this difficulty by addressing attribution more flexibly or even by going beyond its existing legal framework and establishing it on existing political relations between the States concerned. Whereas political relations may constitute a factor for a victim State of selecting another State or other States as the likely source of wrongful cyber activity, it should not constitute a substitute for the existing rules on attribution and should not dispense with the burden of proof of the grounds of attribution. This enterprise requires evidence and as this is not possible to collect on the territory of a State from which cyber activity occurs, circumstantial evidence may be admissible (for instance, the revelation in the press by former government agents that a State has engaged in wrongful cyber acts) as well as the reversal of the burden of proof upon the State allegedly perpetrating injurious cyber acts.\nThe difficulty in applying the existing rules on attribution could be overcome by focusing on the primary rule breached (namely, the specific international obligation) in conjunction with the duty of due diligence either by reference to the substantive content of the primary obligation or the general principle of international law that no State must knowingly allow its territory to be used for injurious acts against other States. In this manner, responsibility may be established on the fact that certain wrongful cyber acts have their source in computers located in the territory of a State or a plurality of States and it occurs with knowledge of the latter. This knowledge would be established on the basis of alerting the territorial State (or States) to the fact of wrongful cyber activity from its territory and its failure to act by employing measures within its capabilities to curb that activity. The best course of action to achieve cessation of injurious cyber acts appears to be through the adoption of good Internet practices and international cooperation.\nNicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389\nDownloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM via University of Tasmania"

They represent domains the use of which is indispensable to the entire or at least a substantial part of the global population. At the same time, as this author understands it, they are not identical in meaning as a matter of computer science terminology. The Internet is a ‘global network connecting millions of computers’; it is ‘decentralized by design’, subject to ownership or control (unlike ‘online services’) by no single (or a plurality of) person or entity.¹ The Internet has a physical dimension because of the interconnection of different computer systems, their accessibility and the transmission of information to and from such systems by using the standard Internet Protocol (IP).² Cyberspace, however, is a more abstract term; it is a non-physical domain created by computer systems that allows people to communicate with each other, to exchange or to gather information. Moreover, it refers to the ‘notional environment in which digitized information is communicated over computer networks’.³ Be this as it may, it appears that there exists a tendency to treat these two terms as synonyms and use them interchangeably. To give an example, the US Government Cyber Policy Review 2009 defines cyberspace as ‘the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, and includes the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers in critical industries. Common usage of the term also refers to the virtual environment of information and interactions between people’.⁴ It appears therefore, that apart from identity in terms, these two concepts have a dual role: they refer to the domain as well as to the medium of conducting certain activities. Furthermore, it would be an understatement to say that the Internet is important to private individuals, corporations and States: the US Government has stated that cyberspace / the Internet underlines every aspect of modern society and it is both the\n¹ Vangie Beal, ‘Internet’ (Webopedia) <http: Internet.html=\"\" term=\"\" www.webopedia.com=\"\"> accessed on 1 November 2013.\n² Bill Young, ‘Navigating Cyberspace: Introduction to Cyberspace’ (9 January 2013) University of Texas <http: cs329e=\"\" slides1-introduction.pdf=\"\" www.cs.utexas.edu=\"\" ~byoung=\"\"> accessed on 4 November 2013.\n³ US Department of Defense, ‘Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms’ JP 1–02 (12 April 2001, as amended through 31 August 2005) 139.\n⁴ The White House, ‘Cyberspace Policy Review: Assuring a trusted and resilient information and communications infrastructure’ (2009) <http: assets=\"\" documents=\"\" cyberspace_policy_review_final.pdf=\"\" www.whitehouse.gov=\"\"> 1, accessed on 4 November 2013.\nNicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389\nDownloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM\nvia University of Tasmania</http:></http:></http:>\nResearch handbook on international law and cyberspace\ndomain where and the medium by which economic, public safety, civil society and national security activities are pursued.⁵\nWhile the usefulness of the Internet is universally acknowledged, the same is the case with regard to its misuse or hostile use, in the form of cyber-crime and espionage.⁶ In particular, as nowadays private business and governments conduct most of their functions and activities in cyberspace, safety and resilience are matters to be preserved. In the words of the US Cyber Policy Review 2009 ‘to realize the full benefits of digital revolution, users must have confidence that sensitive information is secure, commerce is not compromised and the infrastructure is not infiltrated. Nation-states also need confidence that the networks that support their national security and economic prosperity are safe and resilient. ...’⁷ It is, therefore, not inconceivable that the Internet may be used in such a way as to cause harm to States or as to compel them to act in a particular manner. There have been three episodes in State practice that have revealed how the hostile use of the Internet may affect the orderly function of basic services in a State or threaten its security. In 2007 Estonia was the object of massive and coordinated computer hacking attacks that paralyzed its economy and the functioning of government services for weeks. In 2008 Georgia was the target of similar attacks during the conflict with the Russian Federation with respect to South Ossetia. Also, in 2009 a computer virus by the name of Stuxnet caused the progress of the nuclear program of Iran to suffer significant delay.⁸ In this context the question arises whether such use of the Internet may give rise to State responsibility. The answer must be in the affirmative provided that a specific use of the Internet amounts to an ‘internationally wrongful act’.⁹ As the Internet is an international domain, then States must conduct themselves over this domain in accordance with international law¹⁰ and therefore the use of cyberspace is subject to international law. As Harold Koh, the former Legal Advisor of the US State Department has remarked ‘international law principles do apply in cyberspace. ...’¹¹ However, there are substantive challenges facing the law on international responsibility as it exists in contemporary international law by the particularities of cyberspace since this body of rules is premised heavily on attribution of acts of individuals to a State. Be as it may, the present author submits, that the application of this area of international law to cyberspace is not impossible, mainly as a result of establishing responsibility on the basis of the breach of the obligation of due diligence on the part of States, which dispenses with the difficulty of attributing acts of individuals to a State, while even attribution may in certain cases be established.

AN OUTLINE OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF STATE RESPONSIBILITY\nState responsibility appears to have emerged as a branch of international law by way of private law analogy.¹³ As the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ) ruled in Factory at Chorzów (Indemnities) ‘it is a principle of international law, and even a general conception of law, that any breach of an engagement involves an obligation to make reparation’.¹⁴ However, subsequent judicial pronouncements and the work of the International Law Commission (ILC) form a departure from legal analogies with the domestic law of tort in favour of reconstructing the responsibility as a matter of international public law arising when, an act: (1) is attributable to a State; and (2) constitutes a breach of an international obligation. In US Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran the International Court (ICJ) stated that it had to ‘determine how far, legally, the acts in question may be regarded as imputable to the Iranian State’ and whether they were compatible or not ‘with the obligations of Iran under treaties in force or under any other rules of international law that may be applicable’.¹⁵ Moreover, in Bosnian Genocide the ICJ ruled with regard to the breach of the Genocide Convention that ‘the obligations in question … and the responsibilities of States that would arise from breach of such obligations are obligations and responsibilities under international law. They are not of a criminal nature’.¹⁶\nThe contemporary law of State responsibility has as its principal source of reference the Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARS)\n¹² Ibid.

However, since 2001 it has been so extensively cited by international courts and tribunals, as well as in State practice, that it is considered as an authoritative statement of the customary international law on State responsibility.¹⁸ The legal regime introduced by ARS is premised on the distinction introduced by ILC Rapporteur Roberto Ago between ‘primary obligations’ and ‘secondary rules’. The very first paragraph of the Introduction of the Commentaries to ARS states that:\nThe emphasis is on the secondary rules of State responsibility, that is to say, the general conditions under international law for the State to be considered responsible for wrongful actions or omissions, and the legal consequences which flow therefrom. The articles do not attempt to define the content of the international obligations breach of which gives rise to responsibility.¹⁹\nA second basic feature of ARS is that it views responsibility of States not as an exclusive pattern of bilateral relations between the wrongdoing and injured State. By contrast, State responsibility is given a public order dimension by laying emphasis on the existence of an internationally wrongful act²⁰ and not upon the damage or injury caused and the existence of a causal link between the damage and the breach of obligation. Thus, the Commentary to Article 1 ARS states that:\n[T]he term ‘international responsibility’ ... covers the relations which arise under international law from the internationally wrongful act of a State, whether such relations are limited to the wrongdoing State and one injured State or whether they extend also to other States or indeed to other subjects of international law, and whether they are centred on obligations of restitution or compensation or also give the injured State the possibility of responding by way of counter-measures.²¹\nMoreover, this dimension of State responsibility is further supported by Articles 40 and 48 ARS dealing, respectively, with serious breaches of obligations arising under a peremptory norm of international law and the invocation of the responsibility of a State by States other than the injured party.\nAs the emphasis in ARS lies in the wrongful act, central position is given to its requirements, namely, attribution to a State and breach of an international obligation (Art. 2 ARS). Attribution means ‘the operation of attaching a given act or omission to a State’²² and to this end the ARS relies on the identity of natural persons and their\n¹⁷ [2001] Yearbook of the ILC, vol.

As the Commentary to Article 2 ARS makes absolutely clear the fact is that States act through human beings or groups; therefore, the issue of attribution is reduced to identifying the persons or groups that should be considered to act on behalf of the State.²³ This finding appears to rest on a dual basis that is disjunctively applied: either the identity of a person or group as such or the control exercised by a State over the activities of a person or a group. In a nutshell, the ARS, for the purposes of attribution, are centred on the individual. Thus, the responsibility of a State is engaged for acts or omissions by the following categories of individuals:\n(a) De jure State agents or organs, irrespective of their hierarchical position in the apparatus of the State or the constitutional structure or organization of the State (namely, whether it is a unitary or federal State) (Art.4 ARS);\n(b) De facto State organs, namely, non-State actors or entities that have been 'elevated' to de facto State agents or organs because they are under the absolute dependence and control of a State. In Bosnian Genocide the issue before the ICJ was whether the atrocities perpetrated by the Bosnian Serbs in Srebrenica in July 1995, which as the Court ruled amounted to commission of genocide under the 1948 Genocide Convention, could be attributed to Serbia. The Court ruled that:\n[t]his question has in fact two aspects, which the Court must consider separately. First, it should be ascertained whether the acts committed in Srebrenica were perpetrated by organs of the Respondent [namely, Serbia], i.e., by persons or entities whose conduct is necessarily attributable to it, because they are in fact instruments of its action. Next, if the preceding question is answered in the negative, it should be ascertained whether the acts in question were committed by persons who, while not organs of the Respondent, did nevertheless act on the instruments of, or under the direction or control of, the Respondent.²⁴\nThe Court then proceeded to identify de facto States organs as;\npersons, groups of persons or entities [that], may for purposes of international responsibility, be equated with State organs even if that status does not follow from internal law, provided that in fact the persons, groups or entities act in 'complete dependence' on the State of which they are ultimately the instrument ...²⁵;\n(c) Delegation of Government Authority. In this contingency the conduct of a non-State actor (i.e. 'a person or entity which is not the organ of the State') is to be considered as an act of the State if the non-State actor 'is empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of governmental authority' and it 'is acting in that capacity in the particular instance' (Art. 5 ARS);\n(d) The situation where an organ of a State is placed at the disposal of another State. The acts or omissions of this organ in the exercise of government authority on behalf of the State at the disposal of which it has been placed give rise to this State's responsibility (Art. 6 ARS);\n²³ Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (n 19) 35.\n²⁴ Case Concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (n 16) (Merits) 201.\n²⁵ Ibid. 205 [emphasis added].\nNicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389\nDownloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM\nvia University of Tasmania\nResearch handbook on international law and cyberspace\n(e) Ultra Vires Acts. A State organ or entity gives rise to the responsibility of the State even when acting in this capacity it exceeds its authority or against instructions (Art.7 ARS);\n(f) Instructions, Direction and Control of a State over acts of private persons. In the jurisprudence of the ICJ this control must be ‘effective control’ in order to give rise to the responsibility of the State. The Court reached this finding in Nicaragua where it ruled that the US assistance to the contras and its general control over them were not sufficient in default of further evidence to attribute their acts violating human rights and humanitarian law to the US government. By contrast ‘[f]or this conduct to give rise to legal responsibility of the United States, it would in principle have to be proved that that State had effective control of the military and paramilitary operations in the course of which the alleged violations were committed.’ 26 Moreover, in Bosnian Genocide the Court, having found that the Bosnian Serbs did not constitute a de facto organ of Serbia, proceeded to determine whether Serbia exercised effective control over them. The Court explained that the:\ntest thus formulated differs in two respects from the test ... to determine whether a person or entity may be equated with a State organ even if not having that status under internal law. First, in this context it is not necessary to show that the persons who performed the acts alleged to have violated international law were in general in a relationship of ‘complete dependence’ on the respondent State; it has to be proved that they acted in accordance with the State’s instructions or under its ‘effective control’. It must however be shown that this ‘effective control’ was exercised, or that the State’s instructions were given, in respect of each operation in which the alleged violations occurred, not generally in respect of the overall actions taken by the persons or groups of persons having committed the violations.27\nIn this respect, the Court declined to uphold the ruling of the ICTY Appeals Chamber in the Tadić case where the ad hoc Tribunal applied the test of ‘overall control’ that dispenses with the need to evaluate control of a State over each specific operation of a non-State actor;28 the Court took the view that the determination of State responsibility on the part of Serbia did not constitute an indispensable finding to determine individual criminal responsibility by an international criminal tribunal29 (Art. 8 ARS);\n(g) Exercise of elements of government authority in the absence of or inadequate function of State authorities and in circumstances that warrant the exercise of this authority. In Yeager v. Islamic Republic of Iran the Iran-US Claims Tribunal ruled\n\nNicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389 Downloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM via University of Tasmania State responsibility in cyberspace 61 that the immigration, customs and other similar acts that had been carried out by the Revolutionary Guards at the Tehran airport in the immediate aftermath of the Islamic revolution were attributable to Iran. The Tribunal reasoned that even though these functions were not authorized by the Iranian government they objectively consisted in the exercise of elements of governmental authority in the absence of official authorities of the State ‘in operations of which the new Government must have had knowledge and to which it did not specifically object.’³⁰ (Art. 9 ARS); (h) The ARS provides in particular that acts or omissions by an insurrectional or other movement are attributed to a State in the event the insurrection is successful and the movement become the government of the State (Art. 10 ARS); (i) Approval and Adoption by a State of acts of private persons or entities. In US Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran the Court ruled that the act of overrunning of the US Embassy in Tehran by demonstrators and the seizure as hostages of the US diplomatic staff could not be as such attributed to the Iranian Government because the demonstrators were neither State organs nor did they carry out a specific government act on behalf of the State³¹. However, the responsibility of Iran for the acts of the demonstrators was established at a later stage when the Iranian government approved of and adopted the occupation of the Embassy premises and the captivity of the US diplomatic staff as its own³² (Art.11 ARS).\nThe second requirement of State responsibility, namely a breach of an international obligation, may consist in a physical act or omission and may emanate from a rule of either customary law or treaty (Art. 12 ARS) that introduces an obligation in force for the particular State (Art.13 ARS). Moreover, the responsibility of a State may arise whether the act is or is not of a continuing character (Arts 14 and 15 ARS) or it constitutes part of a composite activity. Furthermore, State responsibility arises with respect to acts of other States. This is not to say that acts of other States are attributed to another State for, as the ILC has made clear, the ARS is premised on the principle that ‘each State is responsible for its own wrongful conduct … attributable to it … which is in breach of an international obligation of that State …’ and that ‘responsibility is specific to the State concerned’.³³ Even though in this respect the ILC identifies contingencies of ‘collaborative conduct’³⁴ it does not appear to introduce a particular legal framework of ‘shared responsibility’ for the collaborative element appears to be viewed simply as a factual rather than a normative parameter.³⁵ This is further corroborated by Article 47(1) ARS on the invocation of State responsibility for an ³⁰ [1987] 17 Iran–US Claims Tribunal Rep.

Having said this, the responsibility of a State for the acts of another State arises on the basis of conduct of the former State in relation to the latter that consists in aid or assistance, direction and control and coercion (of the latter State). In each of these contingencies there must be two requirements cumulatively: first, the conduct must be internationally wrongful if it was committed by the other State and, secondly, the aiding/controlling/coercing State must have knowledge of the circumstances of the internationally wrongful act (Arts 16–18 ARS). Finally, the ILC ARS provide for grounds precluding the wrongfulness of an act that *prima facie* constitutes a breach of an international obligation; these are: consent (Art. 20); self-defence (Art. 21); countermeasures (Arts 22, 49–54); *force majeure* (Art. 23); distress (Art. 24); and necessity (Art. 25).\n# 3. ATTRIBUTION IN CYBERSPACE Cyberspace as a domain and the use of electronic devices as a medium of State conduct raises difficulties with respect to ascribing particular acts to States. There is no reason sweepingly to deny as a matter of principle the application of the rules of attribution provided in ARS to conduct in cyberspace. However, the identification of individuals or entities that use the Internet is characterized by considerable difficulty, for the Internet guarantees, if not actually absolute, certainly a large measure of anonymity or deniability. Thus, it is almost impossible to identify directly and with certainty the person or entity operating a personal computer. Identification of persons, and by consequence, attribution is only possible via the identification of a computer by way of its IP that identifies its precise location.\nTherefore, an internationally wrongful act in cyberspace appears to be ascribed to a particular computer whereas the identity of the person operating it may only be established either by way of presumption or on the basis of inside information disclosed by government agents of the State perpetrating the internationally wrongful acts in cyberspace.³⁶ Thus, if a computer is identified by way of its location (in the premises of a government department or a diplomatic mission) as a government computer then the transmission of malware or denial of service interference may in principle be attributed to a particular State. This appears to be established either on the identity of the operator who is presumed to be a government agent or on the mere location of the computer as this falls under the exclusive and complete control of a State. Thus, in October and November 2013 the German Government launched strong diplomatic protests with the US and UK Governments for allegations of electronic surveillance of German governmental departments, including the German Chancellor’s ³⁶ Viz. the information disclosed by the former US National Security Agency (NSA) Edward Snowden on the NSA surveillance of many foreign government agencies; see Joshua Eaton, ‘Timeline of Edward Snowden’s revelations’, *Al Jazeera America* <http: articles=\"\"multimedia=\"\"timeline–edward–snowden–revelations.html=\"\"www.dailymotion.com=\"\"> accessed on 26 November 2013.\nNicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389 Downloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM via University of Tasmania</http:> State responsibility in cyberspace 63 Office, from the US and UK embassies in Berlin. In particular, the German Government warned the UK ambassador that the interception of German Government information by intelligence services from a diplomatic mission constituted a breach of international law.³⁷ At the same time, the Tallinn Manual adopts a rather cautious approach to attribution with respect to cyber wrongful acts by stating that the fact that a cyber operation has its source in government cyber infrastructure is not sufficient to attribute these acts to a State; it merely constitutes an indication that a particular State is associated with the cyber operation. The Manual explains this approach by reference to the particular features of cyber context and especially the likelihood that a government cyber infrastructure may be ‘hijacked’ by non-State actors.³⁸ Moreover, the former Legal Advisor of the US Department of State has acknowledged the problem of attribution in that cyberspace ‘significantly increases an actor’s ability to engage in attacks with “plausible deniability”, by acting through proxies’ and suggested that this challenge is ‘as much [a question] of a technical and policy nature rather than exclusively or predominantly’ a question of law.³⁹ But attribution is predominantly a question of law and it is not determined ‘on the mere recognition of a link of factual causality’.⁴⁰ Furthermore, neither the Tallinn Manual nor the US Government propose an alternative cogent framework of attribution but leave the whole issue surrounded in ambiguity which suggests a wide margin of discretion on the part of an injured State to decide the matter of attribution on the basis of extra-legal factors, such as the general political climate between it and another State.⁴¹ In the absence of an alternative proposition it appears that this position casts aside the current legal framework of attribution by replacing it with a laissez faire approach by an injured State on a case-by-case basis.\nAttribution of an injurious act to a State is a matter of evidence. As injurious acts in cyberspace emanate from computers located in the territory of one or more States the territorial location of computers may serve as a starting-point. State sovereignty entails the expectation that every State exercises control over cyber infrastructure and activities within its territory.⁴² However, as the ICJ ruled in Corfu Channel the mere fact of existence of objects constituting a source of injurious acts (in this case computers engaged in injurious cyber acts) within its territory is not sufficient to impute knowledge of these acts to the State. At the same time, the victim State is permitted ‘a more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence’.⁴³ This lower ³⁷ Nigel Morris et. al., ‘Germany calls in Britain’s ambassador to demand explanation over “secret Berlin listening post”’ (6 November 2013) The Independent <http: news=\"\"uk=\"\"politics=\"\"germany--calls--in--britains--ambassador--to--demand--explanation--over--secret--berlin--listening--post--8923082.html=\"\"www.independent.co.uk=\"\"> accessed 13 August 2014.\n³⁸ Michael N.

Albania) (Merits) [1949] ICJ Rep. 4, 18; also see Tallinn Manual (n 38) 34.\nNicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389 Downloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM via University of Tasmania</http:> Research handbook on international law and cyberspace standard of evidence was admitted in Corfu Channel because the UK did not have direct access to evidence and this in the context of a dispute where there was no controversy either over the territorial source of the injurious act (the territorial sea of Albania) or the agency (the mines) through which this act materialized. In the cyber context the establishment of the exact and actual source of the injurious act is extremely difficult to locate, let alone establish the identity of the perpetrator.⁴⁴ Thus, it appears that a very liberal approach to evidence is called for by the very nature of cyberspace that would combine expert technical knowledge, press reports⁴⁵ (where available) revelation by defector public officials of a State (the US NSA surveillance activities were divulged by former NSA official Edward Snowden) even though the fact of defection may diminish its probative value as evidence contrary to the interests of his own State.⁴⁶ The inherent difficulty in identifying a single State as the source of an injurious cyber act⁴⁷ appears to leave the victim State two possible avenues: either the identification of the perpetrating State on the basis of the existing political climate between it and the victim State or cooperation with other States whether in the context of international organizations or not. The first avenue may entail a degree of arbitrariness and ultimately it does not, and cannot by itself, establish responsibility in the absence of more objective evidence. By contrast, the second avenue offers a better potential of identifying the alleged wrong-doing State. The fact, however, remains that such identification defies to a large extent the established legal framework of attribution.\nOn the basis of the assumption that injurious cyber activity can be traced to the territory of a single State it is submitted that the best approach in the cyber context is to attribute hostile cyber acts to this State on the basis of a presumption of responsibility which may be rebutted by the State on the basis of evidence. In other words, attribution may rest on a presumption that introduces a reversal of the burden of proof. This submission departs from the ruling of the ICJ in Corfu Channel but unlike sea-mines, computers are ubiquitous and by their nature not injurious. Thus, all that has to be established is their location in the territory of a particular State and the latter's alertness by the victim to the fact that injurious cyber acts emanate therefrom. Once this takes place knowledge of the injurious activity is established. It is true that the State from the territory of which the injurious acts emanate may not constitute their actual source, as the computers on its territory may have been hijacked. But this is no reason to deny the right of the victim to alert this State and demand measures on its part for the cessation of the injurious activities. Such measures may entail, depending on the circumstances, a degree of denial of Internet services throughout the territory of that State, and it is a question of balancing the interests of both the victim State and the State from the territory of which the particular cyber activity emanates on whether or not this is feasible.⁴⁸ However, this cannot be prima facie excluded as a possibility in ⁴⁴ Tsagourias (n 41) 233–5.\n⁴⁵ Cf. Nicaragua Case (n 26) 40–41.\n⁴⁶ Ibid. 43.\n⁴⁷ Tsagourias mentions that the cyber attack on Estonia in 2007 ‘involved a large botnet of approximately 85,000 hijacked computers from around 178 countries’: see: (n 41) 233.\n⁴⁸ Tallinn Manual (n 38) 33.\nNicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389 Downloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM via University of Tasmania State responsibility in cyberspace 65 view of the fact that States in other circumstances (for instance, when facing unrest by dissident political groups) are all too prepared to adopt sweeping measures of Internet service-denial even throughout their territories. Having said this, there appears to be only one situation in which injurious cyber acts may not be imputed to the territorial State, namely, where the acts emanate from a location that is under the exclusive jurisdiction of another State, such as the premises of a diplomatic mission or the installation of a military base. In the context of the US NSA electronic surveillance practices it was reported that special units located on the rooftops of a number of US embassies in Europe and Asia (such as the US embassies in Athens and Baku) collected data.⁴⁹ In these cases these acts would not be attributed to the host States (respectively, Greece and Azerbaijan) but to the USA.\n## 4. BREACH OF AN INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATION IN CYBERSPACE There is no difficulty with the proposition that activities in cyberspace may constitute breach of international obligations giving rise to State responsibility. Thus, certain acts may violate the sovereignty of another State or other States, in the sense of interfering in areas of competence that are exclusively reserved to every State. This contingency may be relative to incidents of electronic surveillance of, or espionage against, government departments and personnel of another State.⁵⁰ However, there is no consensus on this issue: according to a school of thought that relies on the famous (or infamous?) Lotus principle,⁵¹ espionage is not prohibited or regulated by international law; therefore, its practice does not as such constitute a breach of the sovereignty of another State, unless perhaps some additional damage is caused.⁵² On the other hand, it is argued that if an act is not expressly prohibited by international law this does not lead necessarily and automatically to its permissibility;⁵³ espionage, in particular, is practiced extensively by States but no government has ever asserted that it constitutes a lawful enterprise.⁵⁴ Moreover, cyber acts may constitute instances of unlawful intervention in the internal or external affairs of another State, provided the element of ‘coercion’ exists,⁵⁵ or use of force.⁵⁶ ⁴⁹ Morris (n 37).\n⁵⁰ On cyber espionage and international law see Buchan (Ch 8 of this book).\n⁵¹ The Case of the ‘S.S.

The considerable difficulty of attribution of an act perpetrated in cyberspace on the basis of the identity or the link of a person or of an entity operating computers to a State, points at the other, in most cases the only, ground for establishing responsibility: the violation of the duty of due diligence arising from the principle that no State may knowingly allow its territory to be used for, or be the source of, acts injurious to other States.57 The proof of attribution in this contingency is made redundant because it concerns an omission to act in accordance with a primary obligation and it may be established by the fact that a State possesses the requisite infrastructure operated by its agents or de facto agents or private parties to which government authority was delegated, to prevent such injurious acts. Thus, due diligence is the primary obligation the breach of which (failure to act or omission) ensures the observance of other primary obligations (either based on treaty or customary law). The precise content and extent of due diligence varies in conjunction with specific obligations. The ILC has deliberately refrained from including due diligence in the Articles on State Responsibility because this would entail examination of the content of primary rules; nevertheless, it did point out that there is a presumption that any primary rule contains a qualification of due diligence.58 In the context of trans-boundary harm from hazardous activities the ILC has adopted the view that the duty of due diligence involved does not extend to guaranteeing that significant harm is to be totally prevented if it is impossible to do so. Furthermore the ILC stated that the standard of due diligence to assess the conduct of a State would be that which would be deemed 'appropriate and proportional to the degree of risk of trans-boundary harm in the particular instance'.59 Moreover, the Sea Bed Disputes Chamber of the International Tribunal of the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) ruled in its Advisory Opinion in the Responsibilities and Obligations of States with respect to Activities in the Area ruled that due diligence is a 'variable concept' and the standard it may set may change as a result of scientific and technological developments as well as the risks involved in a particular activity.60 In the human rights field the duty of due diligence has been upheld in Velasquez-Rodriguez in which the Inter-American Court of Human Rights interpreted the obligation introduced in Article 1(1) of the Inter-American Convention of Human Rights to respect and ensure the exercise of the rights enshrined in the Convention. The Court ruled that the obligation to 'ensure' the exercise of these rights gave rise to the duty of contracting States to organize the governmental infrastructure in such a way so as to ensure 'free and full enjoyment' of the rights and prevent, investigate and punish Nicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389 Downloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM via University of Tasmania State responsibility in cyberspace 67 their violation; this obligation to ‘ensure’ is not fulfilled solely by the existence of ‘a legal system designed to make it possible to comply with this obligation – it also requires the government to conduct itself so as to effectively ensure the free and full exercise of human rights’.⁶¹ The ICJ has dealt with the duty of diligence in a number of disputes involving alleged breaches of international obligations in a variety of contexts. In *Corfu Channel* the Court ruled at the outset that the mere existence of the source of an injurious act (in this case the mines) in the territory of Albania was not sufficient to attribute this act to the State, for the control exercised by a State over its territory as a result of sovereignty does not establish *prima facie* knowledge of every activity taking place therein.⁶² After establishing knowledge by Albania of the laying of mines in its territorial sea,⁶³ the Court ruled that the responsibility of Albania lay in her failure to notify the existence of a minefield in its territorial sea to third-State shipping. In the opinion of the Court, this obligation rested on three general principles, namely, elementary considerations of humanity, the freedom of maritime communication and ‘every State’s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States’.⁶⁴ But the Court also took account of the particular factual circumstances of the case in order to confirm its legal finding: it acknowledged that if the mines had been laid at the last possible moment, namely, less than 24 hours before the UK warships struck them it would have been difficult or even impossible to issue a general notification to third-State shipping. But, as the incident took place at a time by which the Albanian authorities could have had knowledge of the existence of the mines as a result of their close surveillance of the *Corfu Strait*, Albania did not observe its duty of due diligence.⁶⁵ In *US Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran* the Court ruled that the acts of the demonstrators who took over the premises of the US embassy and held its staff hostage could not be imputed *per se* to the government of Iran. However, Iran bore responsibility because of its failure to observe its obligation under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (1961) to protect the inviolability of the persons and premises of another State’s diplomatic mission.⁶⁶ In *Congo v. Uganda* the Court dealt in the context of the first counterclaim of Uganda with the allegation that the Congo had violated its obligation of due diligence (or duty of vigilance) by failing to prevent the action of dissident armed bands against Uganda from its territory. The Court ruled that the existence and toleration of armed groups on Congolese territory could not be assimilated with active support to these groups; in addition, the Court took into account the inimical geographical terrain where the groups operated and the material inability of the Congolese (as well as the former Zairian) Government to effectively control that part of the territory of the State. Thus, ⁶¹ Velasquez–Rodriguez v. Honduras (Judgment of 29 July 1988) [1988] Inter–Am. Ct. HR (Ser C), No. 4, paras 166–167.\n⁶² *Corfu Channel Case* (n 43) 18.\n⁶³ *Ibid.* 18–22.\n⁶⁴ *Ibid.* 22.\n⁶⁵ *Ibid.* 22–3.\n⁶⁶ *Case Concerning United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran* (n 15) 30–33.\nNicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389 Downloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM via University of Tasmania Research handbook on international law and cyberspace the Court concluded that it could not uphold the allegation of breach of the duty of vigilance on the part of the Congo.⁶⁷ Moreover, in *Bosnian Genocide* the Court dealt with the obligation to prevent genocide that is enunciated in the 1948 Genocide Convention.⁶⁸ In the course of its reasoning the Court made some statements of principle regarding the duty to prevent (due diligence) even though it made it clear that it did not intend to introduce a general framework of universal application on the duty of due diligence; it observed that ‘the content of duty to prevent varies from one instrument to another, according to the wording of the relevant provisions, and depending on the nature of the acts to be prevented’.⁶⁹ Then the Court analysed the content of the duty to prevent in relation to the crime of genocide. It stated at the outset that this duty was an obligation of conduct and not of result; hence, a State did not have the obligation to succeed in preventing genocide ‘whatever the circumstances’ but was under the obligation to ‘employ all means reasonably available’ to it to prevent the commission of the crime.⁷⁰ Thus, failure to achieve the desired result does not give rise to responsibility; by contrast, responsibility arises in case of manifest failure to take all steps within its power that would contribute to preventing genocide because ‘in this area the notion of “due diligence”, which calls for an assessment in concreto, is of critical importance. Various parameters operate when assessing whether a State has duly discharged the obligation concerned’.⁷¹ The Court proceeded to identify those parameters in relation to the specific obligation to prevent genocide and found of particular importance the capacity to influence (within the limits of the law) the perpetrators on the basis of: (a) the geographical distance between the State concerned and the scene of the crime: and (b) the strength of political or other links between the State and the perpetrators.⁷² The essence of due diligence lies, therefore, in the application of all means at the disposal of the State even though such application may be proved on the basis of evidence to be futile; in other words a State must not be inert even in the knowledge that its measures will in all probability be ineffective to prevent the injurious act.⁷³ Even though the Court found that the duty to prevent genocide would give rise to responsibility only when the crime was actually committed (viz. Article 14(3) ARS) it recognized that a State was not absolved from responsibility if it remains inactive until commission of the crime commences where there is a serious risk of its commission; in such a contingency the State is under the obligation to employ the means available to it to prevent the crime, otherwise the substance of the obligation would be negated.⁷⁴ ⁶⁷ Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (Democratic Republic of the Congo v.

The latter contingency would require further evidence that the ultimate outcome was the direct result of acts or omissions amounting to the breach of this other primary rule and not simply the failure to adopt preventative measures that even they might not guarantee beyond all doubt that the end result would not occur.\nOn the basis of the preceding analysis it is submitted that the responsibility of a State for internationally wrongful acts in cyberspace may be established in customary law on the duty of due diligence in observing the obligation of not knowingly allowing its territory to be the source of acts violating the rights of other States. The content of the due diligence must be assessed by taking into account, first, that the use of the Internet is not unlawful *per se*; secondly, that transmission from a computer or a host of computers may or may not be the actual source of the injurious activity and; finally, that the existence of thousands of computers on the territory of a State does not by and of itself constitute knowledge of such injurious activity. Moreover, due diligence being an obligation of conduct and not of result does not entail as a necessary outcome the obligation to take steps to protect the rights of other States as this appears to go beyond the requirement to employ all means that a State reasonably possesses to prevent an unlawful act.76 Furthermore, knowledge of the cyber injurious act could be established only upon the notification by the victim State that has the discretion to select the States (they may be many) from the territories of which injurious transmissions occur.\nThe criteria for selection for notification are a matter of political decision, but once notification takes place ‘knowledge’ exists and the State or States notified are under an obligation to employ measures reasonably at their disposal to prevent the wrongful cyber activity. Such measures appear to be commensurate with the possession of technological capabilities to deny temporarily Internet service either to particular users or throughout the State, even though the latter may disproportionately affect the function of the governmental and economic infrastructure of the State. Thus, it appears to be a matter of balancing the cost of Internet denial to the State of origin against the effect of the injurious acts to the victim State and this is to be assessed in the particular circumstances of each case. However, total denial of service may not, in principle, be regarded as a reasonable response to injurious cyber acts; but it may not be excluded, either in particular circumstances or even more so when States appear prepared to resort to it to silence political opponents or contain internal unrest. What is important is that a State that is established to have knowledge of injurious cyber acts emanating from its territory is under a duty to act in a preventative manner irrespective of the fact Nicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389 Downloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM via University of Tasmania that the said cyber activity also originates from the territories of other States. To say that the failure to employ measures within that State’s capability is of no consequence because the wrongful cyber activity also emanates from computers located in a plurality of States does not absolve the former from responsibility under due diligence. The ICJ ruled in *Bosnian Genocide* that such an assertion is irrelevant to the breach of an obligation of conduct warranted by the duty of due diligence, especially when there is a possibility of cooperation through concerted action in a situation where the perpetrator of an injurious cyber act takes over a large number of computers situated in a plurality of States.⁷⁷ Indeed, it is because of this contingency, so frequent in practice, that cooperation and concerted action is essential either on an *ad hoc* basis to counter specific wrongful cyber activities or on a more permanent basis through institutionalized mechanisms or a pre-existing framework of good practices in cyber-space.⁷⁸ Thus, the NATO initiatives on information security are in principle steps in the right direction⁷⁹ as well as the initiative of China and the Russian Federation for the introduction of an International Code of Conduct for Information Security.⁸⁰ # 5. CONCLUSION Cyberspace raises many challenges to the law on State responsibility as it has evolved through State practice, judicial decisions and the work of the ILC culminating in the 2001 ARS. Cyberspace as a domain has international dimensions; therefore it is in principle amenable to regulation by international law and the rules on State responsibility, in particular, may be applied. While a breach of an international obligation may be established without much difficulty in relation to certain types of cyber activity, it is attribution of it to a specific State that raises difficulties that in practice appear insurmountable and seem to defy the rules on attribution established in the ILC ARS.\nThese rules on attribution are centred on acts of persons and their imputation to a particular State. Moreover, the process of attribution is a juridical one. However, the nature of cyberspace as a domain, the freedom and the prima facie lawfulness of its use, the transmission of information through computers and the anonymity of the users of those computers leave very little scope for establishing with a relative degree of certainty both the identity of the user and his/her link to a specific State. The only fact that can be established with certainty is the location of a particular computer or computers in the territory of one or more States. This gives rise to the presumption that the State from the territory of which cyber injurious acts emanate could be the one that may incur responsibility. However, this does not dispense with the specific rules of ⁷⁷ Case Concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (n 16) 221.\n⁷⁸ O’Connell (n 6) 206–9.\n⁷⁹ NATO, ‘NATO and Cyber Defence’ (7 August 2014) <http: en=\"\"esp=\"\"natolive=\"\"topics_78170.htm?=\"\"www.nato.int=\"\"> accessed 13 August 2014.\n⁸⁰ Letter dated 12 September 2011 from the Permanent Representatives of China, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary–General, Annex, A/66/359.\nNicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389 Downloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM via University of Tasmania</http:> State responsibility in cyberspace 71 attribution and the fact that computers situated in the territory of a one or more States are the actual source of wrongful cyber acts as they may have been ‘hijacked’ by the real perpetrator. Hence there have been suggestions of overcoming this difficulty by addressing attribution more flexibly or even by going beyond its existing legal framework and establishing it on existing political relations between the States concerned. Whereas political relations may constitute a factor for a victim State of selecting another State or other States as the likely source of wrongful cyber activity, it should not constitute a substitute for the existing rules on attribution and should not dispense with the burden of proof of the grounds of attribution. This enterprise requires evidence and as this is not possible to collect on the territory of a State from which cyber activity occurs, circumstantial evidence may be admissible (for instance, the revelation in the press by former government agents that a State has engaged in wrongful cyber acts) as well as the reversal of the burden of proof upon the State allegedly perpetrating injurious cyber acts.\nThe difficulty in applying the existing rules on attribution could be overcome by focusing on the primary rule breached (namely, the specific international obligation) in conjunction with the duty of due diligence either by reference to the substantive content of the primary obligation or the general principle of international law that no State must knowingly allow its territory to be used for injurious acts against other States. In this manner, responsibility may be established on the fact that certain wrongful cyber acts have their source in computers located in the territory of a State or a plurality of States and it occurs with knowledge of the latter. This knowledge would be established on the basis of alerting the territorial State (or States) to the fact of wrongful cyber activity from its territory and its failure to act by employing measures within its capabilities to curb that activity. The best course of action to achieve cessation of injurious cyber acts appears to be through the adoption of good Internet practices and international cooperation.\nNicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389 Downloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM via University of Tasmania"

They represent domains the use of which is indispensable to the entire or at least a substantial part of the global population. At the same time, as this author understands it, they are not identical in meaning as a matter of computer science terminology.

In the words of the US Cyber Policy Review 2009 ‘to realize the full benefits of digital revolution, users must have confidence that sensitive information is secure, commerce is not compromised and the infrastructure is not infiltrated. Nation-states also need confidence that the networks that support their national security and economic prosperity are safe and resilient. ...’⁷ It is, therefore, not inconceivable that the Internet may be used in such a way as to cause harm to States or as to compel them to act in a particular manner. There have been three episodes in State practice that have revealed how the hostile use of the Internet may affect the orderly function of basic services in a State or threaten its security. In 2007 Estonia was the object of massive and coordinated computer hacking attacks that paralyzed its economy and the functioning of government services for weeks. In 2008 Georgia was the target of similar attacks during the conflict with the Russian Federation with respect to South Ossetia. Also, in 2009 a computer virus by the name of Stuxnet caused the progress of the nuclear program of Iran to suffer significant delay.⁸ In this context the question arises whether such use of the Internet may give rise to State responsibility. The answer must be in the affirmative provided that a specific use of the Internet amounts to an ‘internationally wrongful act’.⁹ As the Internet is an international domain, then States must conduct themselves over this domain in accordance with international law¹⁰ and therefore the use of cyberspace is subject to international law. As Harold Koh, the former Legal Advisor of the US State Department has remarked ‘international law principles do apply in cyberspace. ...’¹¹ However, there are substantive challenges facing the law on international responsibility as it exists in contemporary international law by the particularities of cyberspace since this body of rules is premised heavily on attribution of acts of individuals to a State. Be as it may, the present author submits, that the application of this area of international law to cyberspace is not impossible, mainly as a result of establishing responsibility on the basis of the breach of the obligation of due diligence on the part of States, which dispenses with the difficulty of attributing acts of individuals to a State, while even attribution may in certain cases be established.

The answer must be in the affirmative provided that a specific use of the Internet amounts to an ‘internationally wrongful act’.⁹ As the Internet is an international domain, then States must conduct themselves over this domain in accordance with international law¹⁰ and therefore the use of cyberspace is subject to international law. As Harold Koh, the former Legal Advisor of the US State Department has remarked ‘international law principles do apply in cyberspace. ...’¹¹ However, there are substantive challenges facing the law on international responsibility as it exists in contemporary international law by the particularities of cyberspace since this body of rules is premised heavily on attribution of acts of individuals to a State. Be as it may, the present author submits, that the application of this area of international law to cyberspace is not impossible, mainly as a result of establishing responsibility on the basis of the breach of the obligation of due diligence on the part of States, which dispenses with the difficulty of attributing acts of individuals to a State, while even attribution may in certain cases be established.

AN OUTLINE OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF STATE RESPONSIBILITY\n\nState responsibility appears to have emerged as a branch of international law by way of private law analogy.¹³ As the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ) ruled in Factory at Chorzów (Indemnities) ‘it is a principle of international law, and even a general conception of law, that any breach of an engagement involves an obligation to make reparation’.¹⁴ However, subsequent judicial pronouncements and the work of the International Law Commission (ILC) form a departure from legal analogies with the domestic law of tort in favour of reconstructing the responsibility as a matter of international public law arising when, an act: (1) is attributable to a State; and (2) constitutes a breach of an international obligation. In US Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran the International Court (ICJ) stated that it had to ‘determine how far, legally, the acts in question may be regarded as imputable to the Iranian State’ and whether they were compatible or not ‘with the obligations of Iran under treaties in force or under any other rules of international law that may be applicable’.¹⁵ Moreover, in Bosnian Genocide the ICJ ruled with regard to the breach of the Genocide Convention that ‘the obligations in question … and the responsibilities of States that would arise from breach of such obligations are obligations and responsibilities under international law. They are not of a criminal nature’.¹⁶\n\nThe contemporary law of State responsibility has as its principal source of reference the Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARS)\n\n¹² Ibid.

    "Research handbook on international law and cyberspace\n\nadopted by the ILC in 2001.¹⁷ This text is not (or not yet) a treaty. However, since 2001 it has been so extensively cited by international courts and tribunals, as well as in State practice, that it is considered as an authoritative statement of the customary international law on State responsibility.¹⁸ The legal regime introduced by ARS is premised on the distinction introduced by ILC Rapporteur Roberto Ago between ‘primary obligations’ and ‘secondary rules’. The very first paragraph of the Introduction of the Commentaries to ARS states that:\n\nThe emphasis is on the secondary rules of State responsibility, that is to say, the general conditions under international law for the State to be considered responsible for wrongful actions or omissions, and the legal consequences which flow therefrom. The articles do not attempt to define the content of the international obligations breach of which gives rise to responsibility.¹⁹\n\nA second basic feature of ARS is that it views responsibility of States not as an exclusive pattern of bilateral relations between the wrongdoing and injured State. By contrast, State responsibility is given a public order dimension by laying emphasis on the existence of an internationally wrongful act²⁰ and not upon the damage or injury caused and the existence of a causal link between the damage and the breach of obligation. Thus, the Commentary to Article 1 ARS states that:\n\n[T]he term ‘international responsibility’ ... covers the relations which arise under international law from the internationally wrongful act of a State, whether such relations are limited to the wrongdoing State and one injured State or whether they extend also to other States or indeed to other subjects of international law, and whether they are centred on obligations of restitution or compensation or also give the injured State the possibility of responding by way of counter-measures.²¹\n\nMoreover, this dimension of State responsibility is further supported by Articles 40 and 48 ARS dealing, respectively, with serious breaches of obligations arising under a peremptory norm of international law and the invocation of the responsibility of a State by States other than the injured party.\n\nAs the emphasis in ARS lies in the wrongful act, central position is given to its requirements, namely, attribution to a State and breach of an international obligation (Art. 2 ARS). Attribution means ‘the operation of attaching a given act or omission to a State’²² and to this end the ARS relies on the identity of natural persons and their\n\n¹⁷ [2001] Yearbook of the ILC, vol.

As the Commentary to Article 2 ARS makes absolutely clear the fact is that States act through human beings or groups; therefore, the issue of attribution is reduced to identifying the persons or groups that should be considered to act on behalf of the State.²³ This finding appears to rest on a dual basis that is disjunctively applied: either the identity of a person or group as such or the control exercised by a State over the activities of a person or a group. In a nutshell, the ARS, for the purposes of attribution, are centred on the individual. Thus, the responsibility of a State is engaged for acts or omissions by the following categories of individuals:\n\n(a) De jure State agents or organs, irrespective of their hierarchical position in the apparatus of the State or the constitutional structure or organization of the State (namely, whether it is a unitary or federal State) (Art.4 ARS);\n\n(b) De facto State organs, namely, non-State actors or entities that have been 'elevated' to de facto State agents or organs because they are under the absolute dependence and control of a State. In Bosnian Genocide the issue before the ICJ was whether the atrocities perpetrated by the Bosnian Serbs in Srebrenica in July 1995, which as the Court ruled amounted to commission of genocide under the 1948 Genocide Convention, could be attributed to Serbia. The Court ruled that:\n\n[t]his question has in fact two aspects, which the Court must consider separately. First, it should be ascertained whether the acts committed in Srebrenica were perpetrated by organs of the Respondent [namely, Serbia], i.e., by persons or entities whose conduct is necessarily attributable to it, because they are in fact instruments of its action. Next, if the preceding question is answered in the negative, it should be ascertained whether the acts in question were committed by persons who, while not organs of the Respondent, did nevertheless act on the instruments of, or under the direction or control of, the Respondent.²⁴\n\nThe Court then proceeded to identify de facto States organs as;\n\npersons, groups of persons or entities [that], may for purposes of international responsibility, be equated with State organs even if that status does not follow from internal law, provided that in fact the persons, groups or entities act in 'complete dependence' on the State of which they are ultimately the instrument ...²⁵;\n\n(c) Delegation of Government Authority. In this contingency the conduct of a non-State actor (i.e. 'a person or entity which is not the organ of the State') is to be considered as an act of the State if the non-State actor 'is empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of governmental authority' and it 'is acting in that capacity in the particular instance' (Art. 5 ARS);\n\n(d) The situation where an organ of a State is placed at the disposal of another State. The acts or omissions of this organ in the exercise of government authority on behalf of the State at the disposal of which it has been placed give rise to this State's responsibility (Art. 6 ARS);\n\n²³ Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (n 19) 35.\n\n²⁴ Case Concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (n 16) (Merits) 201.\n\n²⁵ Ibid. 205 [emphasis added].\n\nNicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389\n\nDownloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM\n\nvia University of Tasmania",

A State organ or entity gives rise to the responsibility of the State even when acting in this capacity it exceeds its authority or against instructions (Art.7 ARS);\n\n(f) Instructions, Direction and Control of a State over acts of private persons. In the jurisprudence of the ICJ this control must be ‘effective control’ in order to give rise to the responsibility of the State. The Court reached this finding in Nicaragua where it ruled that the US assistance to the contras and its general control over them were not sufficient in default of further evidence to attribute their acts violating human rights and humanitarian law to the US government. By contrast ‘[f]or this conduct to give rise to legal responsibility of the United States, it would in principle have to be proved that that State had effective control of the military and paramilitary operations in the course of which the alleged violations were committed.’ 26 Moreover, in Bosnian Genocide the Court, having found that the Bosnian Serbs did not constitute a de facto organ of Serbia, proceeded to determine whether Serbia exercised effective control over them. The Court explained that the:\n\ntest thus formulated differs in two respects from the test ... to determine whether a person or entity may be equated with a State organ even if not having that status under internal law. First, in this context it is not necessary to show that the persons who performed the acts alleged to have violated international law were in general in a relationship of ‘complete dependence’ on the respondent State; it has to be proved that they acted in accordance with the State’s instructions or under its ‘effective control’. It must however be shown that this ‘effective control’ was exercised, or that the State’s instructions were given, in respect of each operation in which the alleged violations occurred, not generally in respect of the overall actions taken by the persons or groups of persons having committed the violations.27\n\nIn this respect, the Court declined to uphold the ruling of the ICTY Appeals Chamber in the Tadić case where the ad hoc Tribunal applied the test of ‘overall control’ that dispenses with the need to evaluate control of a State over each specific operation of a non-State actor;28 the Court took the view that the determination of State responsibility on the part of Serbia did not constitute an indispensable finding to determine individual criminal responsibility by an international criminal tribunal29 (Art. 8 ARS);\n\n(g) Exercise of elements of government authority in the absence of or inadequate function of State authorities and in circumstances that warrant the exercise of this authority.

The Tribunal reasoned that even though these functions were not authorized by the Iranian government they objectively consisted in the exercise of elements of governmental authority in the absence of official authorities of the State ‘in operations of which the new Government must have had knowledge and to which it did not specifically object.’³⁰ (Art. 9 ARS);\n\n(h) The ARS provides in particular that acts or omissions by an insurrectional or other movement are attributed to a State in the event the insurrection is successful and the movement become the government of the State (Art. 10 ARS);\n\n(i) Approval and Adoption by a State of acts of private persons or entities. In US Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran the Court ruled that the act of overrunning of the US Embassy in Tehran by demonstrators and the seizure as hostages of the US diplomatic staff could not be as such attributed to the Iranian Government because the demonstrators were neither State organs nor did they carry out a specific government act on behalf of the State³¹. However, the responsibility of Iran for the acts of the demonstrators was established at a later stage when the Iranian government approved of and adopted the occupation of the Embassy premises and the captivity of the US diplomatic staff as its own³² (Art.11 ARS).\n\nThe second requirement of State responsibility, namely a breach of an international obligation, may consist in a physical act or omission and may emanate from a rule of either customary law or treaty (Art. 12 ARS) that introduces an obligation in force for the particular State (Art.13 ARS). Moreover, the responsibility of a State may arise whether the act is or is not of a continuing character (Arts 14 and 15 ARS) or it constitutes part of a composite activity. Furthermore, State responsibility arises with respect to acts of other States. This is not to say that acts of other States are attributed to another State for, as the ILC has made clear, the ARS is premised on the principle that ‘each State is responsible for its own wrongful conduct … attributable to it … which is in breach of an international obligation of that State …’ and that ‘responsibility is specific to the State concerned’.³³ Even though in this respect the ILC identifies contingencies of ‘collaborative conduct’³⁴ it does not appear to introduce a particular legal framework of ‘shared responsibility’ for the collaborative element appears to be viewed simply as a factual rather than a normative parameter.³⁵ This is further corroborated by Article 47(1) ARS on the invocation of State responsibility for an\n\n³⁰ [1987] 17 Iran–US Claims Tribunal Rep.

Having said this, the responsibility of a State for the acts of another State arises on the basis of conduct of the former State in relation to the latter that consists in aid or assistance, direction and control and coercion (of the latter State). In each of these contingencies there must be two requirements cumulatively: first, the conduct must be internationally wrongful if it was committed by the other State and, secondly, the aiding/controlling/coercing State must have knowledge of the circumstances of the internationally wrongful act (Arts 16–18 ARS). Finally, the ILC ARS provide for grounds precluding the wrongfulness of an act that *prima facie* constitutes a breach of an international obligation; these are: consent (Art. 20); self-defence (Art. 21); countermeasures (Arts 22, 49–54); *force majeure* (Art. 23); distress (Art. 24); and necessity (Art. 25).\n\n# 3. ATTRIBUTION IN CYBERSPACE\n\nCyberspace as a domain and the use of electronic devices as a medium of State conduct raises difficulties with respect to ascribing particular acts to States. There is no reason sweepingly to deny as a matter of principle the application of the rules of attribution provided in ARS to conduct in cyberspace. However, the identification of individuals or entities that use the Internet is characterized by considerable difficulty, for the Internet guarantees, if not actually absolute, certainly a large measure of anonymity or deniability. Thus, it is almost impossible to identify directly and with certainty the person or entity operating a personal computer. Identification of persons, and by consequence, attribution is only possible via the identification of a computer by way of its IP that identifies its precise location.\n\nTherefore, an internationally wrongful act in cyberspace appears to be ascribed to a particular computer whereas the identity of the person operating it may only be established either by way of presumption or on the basis of inside information disclosed by government agents of the State perpetrating the internationally wrongful acts in cyberspace.³⁶ Thus, if a computer is identified by way of its location (in the premises of a government department or a diplomatic mission) as a government computer then the transmission of malware or denial of service interference may in principle be attributed to a particular State. This appears to be established either on the identity of the operator who is presumed to be a government agent or on the mere location of the computer as this falls under the exclusive and complete control of a State. Thus, in October and November 2013 the German Government launched strong diplomatic protests with the US and UK Governments for allegations of electronic surveillance of German governmental departments, including the German Chancellor’s\n\n³⁶ Viz. the information disclosed by the former US National Security Agency (NSA) Edward Snowden on the NSA surveillance of many foreign government agencies; see Joshua Eaton, ‘Timeline of Edward Snowden’s revelations’, *Al Jazeera America* <http: articles=\"\" multimedia=\"\" timeline–edward–snowden–revelations.html=\"\" www.dailymotion.com=\"\"> accessed on 26 November 2013.\n\nNicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389\n\nDownloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM\n\nvia University of Tasmania</http:>",

In particular, the German Government warned the UK ambassador that the interception of German Government information by intelligence services from a diplomatic mission constituted a breach of international law.³⁷\n\nAt the same time, the Tallinn Manual adopts a rather cautious approach to attribution with respect to cyber wrongful acts by stating that the fact that a cyber operation has its source in government cyber infrastructure is not sufficient to attribute these acts to a State; it merely constitutes an indication that a particular State is associated with the cyber operation. The Manual explains this approach by reference to the particular features of cyber context and especially the likelihood that a government cyber infrastructure may be ‘hijacked’ by non-State actors.³⁸ Moreover, the former Legal Advisor of the US Department of State has acknowledged the problem of attribution in that cyberspace ‘significantly increases an actor’s ability to engage in attacks with “plausible deniability”, by acting through proxies’ and suggested that this challenge is ‘as much [a question] of a technical and policy nature rather than exclusively or predominantly’ a question of law.³⁹ But attribution is predominantly a question of law and it is not determined ‘on the mere recognition of a link of factual causality’.⁴⁰ Furthermore, neither the Tallinn Manual nor the US Government propose an alternative cogent framework of attribution but leave the whole issue surrounded in ambiguity which suggests a wide margin of discretion on the part of an injured State to decide the matter of attribution on the basis of extra-legal factors, such as the general political climate between it and another State.⁴¹ In the absence of an alternative proposition it appears that this position casts aside the current legal framework of attribution by replacing it with a laissez faire approach by an injured State on a case-by-case basis.\n\nAttribution of an injurious act to a State is a matter of evidence. As injurious acts in cyberspace emanate from computers located in the territory of one or more States the territorial location of computers may serve as a starting-point. State sovereignty entails the expectation that every State exercises control over cyber infrastructure and activities within its territory.⁴² However, as the ICJ ruled in Corfu Channel the mere fact of existence of objects constituting a source of injurious acts (in this case computers engaged in injurious cyber acts) within its territory is not sufficient to impute knowledge of these acts to the State. At the same time, the victim State is permitted ‘a more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence’.⁴³ This lower\n\n³⁷ Nigel Morris et. al., ‘Germany calls in Britain’s ambassador to demand explanation over “secret Berlin listening post”’ (6 November 2013) The Independent <http: news=\"\" uk=\"\" politics=\"\" germany--calls--in--britains--ambassador--to--demand--explanation--over--secret--berlin--listening--post--8923082.html=\"\" www.independent.co.uk=\"\"> accessed 13 August 2014.\n\n³⁸ Michael N.

In the cyber context the establishment of the exact and actual source of the injurious act is extremely difficult to locate, let alone establish the identity of the perpetrator.⁴⁴ Thus, it appears that a very liberal approach to evidence is called for by the very nature of cyberspace that would combine expert technical knowledge, press reports⁴⁵ (where available) revelation by defector public officials of a State (the US NSA surveillance activities were divulged by former NSA official Edward Snowden) even though the fact of defection may diminish its probative value as evidence contrary to the interests of his own State.⁴⁶ The inherent difficulty in identifying a single State as the source of an injurious cyber act⁴⁷ appears to leave the victim State two possible avenues: either the identification of the perpetrating State on the basis of the existing political climate between it and the victim State or cooperation with other States whether in the context of international organizations or not. The first avenue may entail a degree of arbitrariness and ultimately it does not, and cannot by itself, establish responsibility in the absence of more objective evidence. By contrast, the second avenue offers a better potential of identifying the alleged wrong-doing State. The fact, however, remains that such identification defies to a large extent the established legal framework of attribution.\n\nOn the basis of the assumption that injurious cyber activity can be traced to the territory of a single State it is submitted that the best approach in the cyber context is to attribute hostile cyber acts to this State on the basis of a presumption of responsibility which may be rebutted by the State on the basis of evidence. In other words, attribution may rest on a presumption that introduces a reversal of the burden of proof. This submission departs from the ruling of the ICJ in Corfu Channel but unlike sea-mines, computers are ubiquitous and by their nature not injurious. Thus, all that has to be established is their location in the territory of a particular State and the latter's alertness by the victim to the fact that injurious cyber acts emanate therefrom. Once this takes place knowledge of the injurious activity is established. It is true that the State from the territory of which the injurious acts emanate may not constitute their actual source, as the computers on its territory may have been hijacked. But this is no reason to deny the right of the victim to alert this State and demand measures on its part for the cessation of the injurious activities. Such measures may entail, depending on the circumstances, a degree of denial of Internet services throughout the territory of that State, and it is a question of balancing the interests of both the victim State and the State from the territory of which the particular cyber activity emanates on whether or not this is feasible.⁴⁸ However, this cannot be prima facie excluded as a possibility in\n\n⁴⁴ Tsagourias (n 41) 233–5.\n⁴⁵ Cf.

Having said this, there appears to be only one situation in which injurious cyber acts may not be imputed to the territorial State, namely, where the acts emanate from a location that is under the exclusive jurisdiction of another State, such as the premises of a diplomatic mission or the installation of a military base. In the context of the US NSA electronic surveillance practices it was reported that special units located on the rooftops of a number of US embassies in Europe and Asia (such as the US embassies in Athens and Baku) collected data.⁴⁹ In these cases these acts would not be attributed to the host States (respectively, Greece and Azerbaijan) but to the USA.\n\n## 4. BREACH OF AN INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATION IN CYBERSPACE\n\nThere is no difficulty with the proposition that activities in cyberspace may constitute breach of international obligations giving rise to State responsibility. Thus, certain acts may violate the sovereignty of another State or other States, in the sense of interfering in areas of competence that are exclusively reserved to every State. This contingency may be relative to incidents of electronic surveillance of, or espionage against, government departments and personnel of another State.⁵⁰ However, there is no consensus on this issue: according to a school of thought that relies on the famous (or infamous?) Lotus principle,⁵¹ espionage is not prohibited or regulated by international law; therefore, its practice does not as such constitute a breach of the sovereignty of another State, unless perhaps some additional damage is caused.⁵² On the other hand, it is argued that if an act is not expressly prohibited by international law this does not lead necessarily and automatically to its permissibility;⁵³ espionage, in particular, is practiced extensively by States but no government has ever asserted that it constitutes a lawful enterprise.⁵⁴ Moreover, cyber acts may constitute instances of unlawful intervention in the internal or external affairs of another State, provided the element of ‘coercion’ exists,⁵⁵ or use of force.⁵⁶\n\n⁴⁹ Morris (n 37).\n⁵⁰ On cyber espionage and international law see Buchan (Ch 8 of this book).\n⁵¹ The Case of the ‘S.S.

    "Research handbook on international law and cyberspace\n\nHowever, all these may constitute a breach of international legal obligations presuppose attribution of the unlawful acts to a State. The considerable difficulty of attribution of an act perpetrated in cyberspace on the basis of the identity or the link of a person or of an entity operating computers to a State, points at the other, in most cases the only, ground for establishing responsibility: the violation of the duty of due diligence arising from the principle that no State may knowingly allow its territory to be used for, or be the source of, acts injurious to other States.57 The proof of attribution in this contingency is made redundant because it concerns an omission to act in accordance with a primary obligation and it may be established by the fact that a State possesses the requisite infrastructure operated by its agents or de facto agents or private parties to which government authority was delegated, to prevent such injurious acts. Thus, due diligence is the primary obligation the breach of which (failure to act or omission) ensures the observance of other primary obligations (either based on treaty or customary law). The precise content and extent of due diligence varies in conjunction with specific obligations. The ILC has deliberately refrained from including due diligence in the Articles on State Responsibility because this would entail examination of the content of primary rules; nevertheless, it did point out that there is a presumption that any primary rule contains a qualification of due diligence.58\n\nIn the context of trans-boundary harm from hazardous activities the ILC has adopted the view that the duty of due diligence involved does not extend to guaranteeing that significant harm is to be totally prevented if it is impossible to do so. Furthermore the ILC stated that the standard of due diligence to assess the conduct of a State would be that which would be deemed 'appropriate and proportional to the degree of risk of trans-boundary harm in the particular instance'.59 Moreover, the Sea Bed Disputes Chamber of the International Tribunal of the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) ruled in its Advisory Opinion in the Responsibilities and Obligations of States with respect to Activities in the Area ruled that due diligence is a 'variable concept' and the standard it may set may change as a result of scientific and technological developments as well as the risks involved in a particular activity.60\n\nIn the human rights field the duty of due diligence has been upheld in Velasquez-Rodriguez in which the Inter-American Court of Human Rights interpreted the obligation introduced in Article 1(1) of the Inter-American Convention of Human Rights to respect and ensure the exercise of the rights enshrined in the Convention. The Court ruled that the obligation to 'ensure' the exercise of these rights gave rise to the duty of contracting States to organize the governmental infrastructure in such a way so as to ensure 'free and full enjoyment' of the rights and prevent, investigate and punish\n\n57 Corfu Channel Case (n 43) 22.\n58 Report of the International Law Commission on the work of its 51st session (Supplement No 10, 3 May–23 July 1999) GAOR, A/54/10, 86; Jan A Hessbruegge, ‘The historical development of the doctrines of attribution and due diligence in international law’ (2004) N.Y.U.

In *Corfu Channel* the Court ruled at the outset that the mere existence of the source of an injurious act (in this case the mines) in the territory of Albania was not sufficient to attribute this act to the State, for the control exercised by a State over its territory as a result of sovereignty does not establish *prima facie* knowledge of every activity taking place therein.⁶² After establishing knowledge by Albania of the laying of mines in its territorial sea,⁶³ the Court ruled that the responsibility of Albania lay in her failure to notify the existence of a minefield in its territorial sea to third-State shipping. In the opinion of the Court, this obligation rested on three general principles, namely, elementary considerations of humanity, the freedom of maritime communication and ‘every State’s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States’.⁶⁴ But the Court also took account of the particular factual circumstances of the case in order to confirm its legal finding: it acknowledged that if the mines had been laid at the last possible moment, namely, less than 24 hours before the UK warships struck them it would have been difficult or even impossible to issue a general notification to third-State shipping. But, as the incident took place at a time by which the Albanian authorities could have had knowledge of the existence of the mines as a result of their close surveillance of the *Corfu Strait*, Albania did not observe its duty of due diligence.⁶⁵ In *US Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran* the Court ruled that the acts of the demonstrators who took over the premises of the US embassy and held its staff hostage could not be imputed *per se* to the government of Iran. However, Iran bore responsibility because of its failure to observe its obligation under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (1961) to protect the inviolability of the persons and premises of another State’s diplomatic mission.⁶⁶\n\nIn *Congo v. Uganda* the Court dealt in the context of the first counterclaim of Uganda with the allegation that the Congo had violated its obligation of due diligence (or duty of vigilance) by failing to prevent the action of dissident armed bands against Uganda from its territory. The Court ruled that the existence and toleration of armed groups on Congolese territory could not be assimilated with active support to these groups; in addition, the Court took into account the inimical geographical terrain where the groups operated and the material inability of the Congolese (as well as the former Zairian) Government to effectively control that part of the territory of the State. Thus,\n\n⁶¹ Velasquez–Rodriguez v. Honduras (Judgment of 29 July 1988) [1988] Inter–Am. Ct.

    "Research handbook on international law and cyberspace\n\nthe Court concluded that it could not uphold the allegation of breach of the duty of vigilance on the part of the Congo.⁶⁷\n\nMoreover, in *Bosnian Genocide* the Court dealt with the obligation to prevent genocide that is enunciated in the 1948 Genocide Convention.⁶⁸ In the course of its reasoning the Court made some statements of principle regarding the duty to prevent (due diligence) even though it made it clear that it did not intend to introduce a general framework of universal application on the duty of due diligence; it observed that ‘the content of duty to prevent varies from one instrument to another, according to the wording of the relevant provisions, and depending on the nature of the acts to be prevented’.⁶⁹ Then the Court analysed the content of the duty to prevent in relation to the crime of genocide. It stated at the outset that this duty was an obligation of conduct and not of result; hence, a State did not have the obligation to succeed in preventing genocide ‘whatever the circumstances’ but was under the obligation to ‘employ all means reasonably available’ to it to prevent the commission of the crime.⁷⁰ Thus, failure to achieve the desired result does not give rise to responsibility; by contrast, responsibility arises in case of manifest failure to take all steps within its power that would contribute to preventing genocide because ‘in this area the notion of “due diligence”, which calls for an assessment in concreto, is of critical importance. Various parameters operate when assessing whether a State has duly discharged the obligation concerned’.⁷¹ The Court proceeded to identify those parameters in relation to the specific obligation to prevent genocide and found of particular importance the capacity to influence (within the limits of the law) the perpetrators on the basis of: (a) the geographical distance between the State concerned and the scene of the crime: and (b) the strength of political or other links between the State and the perpetrators.⁷² The essence of due diligence lies, therefore, in the application of all means at the disposal of the State even though such application may be proved on the basis of evidence to be futile; in other words a State must not be inert even in the knowledge that its measures will in all probability be ineffective to prevent the injurious act.⁷³ Even though the Court found that the duty to prevent genocide would give rise to responsibility only when the crime was actually committed (viz. Article 14(3) ARS) it recognized that a State was not absolved from responsibility if it remains inactive until commission of the crime commences where there is a serious risk of its commission; in such a contingency the State is under the obligation to employ the means available to it to prevent the crime, otherwise the substance of the obligation would be negated.⁷⁴\n\n⁶⁷ Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (Democratic Republic of the Congo v.

    "State responsibility in cyberspace 69\n\nFinally, in *Pulp Mills* the Court ruled that both litigants (Argentina and Uruguay) were under an obligation of due diligence to act through the Administrative Commission of the River Uruguay (CARU) with respect to adopting measures to preserve the ecological balance of the river by virtue of Article 36 of the Statute of the River Uruguay of 1975.75 The present author submits that State responsibility as a result of breach of the duty of due diligence is consummated in the conduct of a State consisting in its failure to act and it does not extend to the end result that occurred as a consequence of this failure and that constitutes breach of a different primary rule (for instance, the prohibition of the use of force). The latter contingency would require further evidence that the ultimate outcome was the direct result of acts or omissions amounting to the breach of this other primary rule and not simply the failure to adopt preventative measures that even they might not guarantee beyond all doubt that the end result would not occur.\n\nOn the basis of the preceding analysis it is submitted that the responsibility of a State for internationally wrongful acts in cyberspace may be established in customary law on the duty of due diligence in observing the obligation of not knowingly allowing its territory to be the source of acts violating the rights of other States. The content of the due diligence must be assessed by taking into account, first, that the use of the Internet is not unlawful *per se*; secondly, that transmission from a computer or a host of computers may or may not be the actual source of the injurious activity and; finally, that the existence of thousands of computers on the territory of a State does not by and of itself constitute knowledge of such injurious activity. Moreover, due diligence being an obligation of conduct and not of result does not entail as a necessary outcome the obligation to take steps to protect the rights of other States as this appears to go beyond the requirement to employ all means that a State reasonably possesses to prevent an unlawful act.76 Furthermore, knowledge of the cyber injurious act could be established only upon the notification by the victim State that has the discretion to select the States (they may be many) from the territories of which injurious transmissions occur.\n\nThe criteria for selection for notification are a matter of political decision, but once notification takes place ‘knowledge’ exists and the State or States notified are under an obligation to employ measures reasonably at their disposal to prevent the wrongful cyber activity. Such measures appear to be commensurate with the possession of technological capabilities to deny temporarily Internet service either to particular users or throughout the State, even though the latter may disproportionately affect the function of the governmental and economic infrastructure of the State. Thus, it appears to be a matter of balancing the cost of Internet denial to the State of origin against the effect of the injurious acts to the victim State and this is to be assessed in the particular circumstances of each case. However, total denial of service may not, in principle, be regarded as a reasonable response to injurious cyber acts; but it may not be excluded, either in particular circumstances or even more so when States appear prepared to resort to it to silence political opponents or contain internal unrest. What is important is that a State that is established to have knowledge of injurious cyber acts emanating from its territory is under a duty to act in a preventative manner irrespective of the fact\n\n75 *Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay (Argentina v.

To say that the failure to employ measures within that State’s capability is of no consequence because the wrongful cyber activity also emanates from computers located in a plurality of States does not absolve the former from responsibility under due diligence. The ICJ ruled in *Bosnian Genocide* that such an assertion is irrelevant to the breach of an obligation of conduct warranted by the duty of due diligence, especially when there is a possibility of cooperation through concerted action in a situation where the perpetrator of an injurious cyber act takes over a large number of computers situated in a plurality of States.⁷⁷ Indeed, it is because of this contingency, so frequent in practice, that cooperation and concerted action is essential either on an *ad hoc* basis to counter specific wrongful cyber activities or on a more permanent basis through institutionalized mechanisms or a pre-existing framework of good practices in cyber-space.⁷⁸ Thus, the NATO initiatives on information security are in principle steps in the right direction⁷⁹ as well as the initiative of China and the Russian Federation for the introduction of an International Code of Conduct for Information Security.⁸⁰\n\n# 5. CONCLUSION\n\nCyberspace raises many challenges to the law on State responsibility as it has evolved through State practice, judicial decisions and the work of the ILC culminating in the 2001 ARS. Cyberspace as a domain has international dimensions; therefore it is in principle amenable to regulation by international law and the rules on State responsibility, in particular, may be applied. While a breach of an international obligation may be established without much difficulty in relation to certain types of cyber activity, it is attribution of it to a specific State that raises difficulties that in practice appear insurmountable and seem to defy the rules on attribution established in the ILC ARS.\n\nThese rules on attribution are centred on acts of persons and their imputation to a particular State. Moreover, the process of attribution is a juridical one. However, the nature of cyberspace as a domain, the freedom and the prima facie lawfulness of its use, the transmission of information through computers and the anonymity of the users of those computers leave very little scope for establishing with a relative degree of certainty both the identity of the user and his/her link to a specific State. The only fact that can be established with certainty is the location of a particular computer or computers in the territory of one or more States. This gives rise to the presumption that the State from the territory of which cyber injurious acts emanate could be the one that may incur responsibility. However, this does not dispense with the specific rules of\n\n⁷⁷ Case Concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (n 16) 221.\n⁷⁸ O’Connell (n 6) 206–9.\n⁷⁹ NATO, ‘NATO and Cyber Defence’ (7 August 2014) <http: en=\"\" esp=\"\" natolive=\"\" topics_78170.htm?=\"\" www.nato.int=\"\"> accessed 13 August 2014.\n⁸⁰ Letter dated 12 September 2011 from the Permanent Representatives of China, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary–General, Annex, A/66/359.\n\nNicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389\nDownloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM\nvia University of Tasmania</http:>",
    "State responsibility in cyberspace 71\n\nattribution and the fact that computers situated in the territory of a one or more States are the actual source of wrongful cyber acts as they may have been ‘hijacked’ by the real perpetrator. Hence there have been suggestions of overcoming this difficulty by addressing attribution more flexibly or even by going beyond its existing legal framework and establishing it on existing political relations between the States concerned. Whereas political relations may constitute a factor for a victim State of selecting another State or other States as the likely source of wrongful cyber activity, it should not constitute a substitute for the existing rules on attribution and should not dispense with the burden of proof of the grounds of attribution. This enterprise requires evidence and as this is not possible to collect on the territory of a State from which cyber activity occurs, circumstantial evidence may be admissible (for instance, the revelation in the press by former government agents that a State has engaged in wrongful cyber acts) as well as the reversal of the burden of proof upon the State allegedly perpetrating injurious cyber acts.\n\nThe difficulty in applying the existing rules on attribution could be overcome by focusing on the primary rule breached (namely, the specific international obligation) in conjunction with the duty of due diligence either by reference to the substantive content of the primary obligation or the general principle of international law that no State must knowingly allow its territory to be used for injurious acts against other States. In this manner, responsibility may be established on the fact that certain wrongful cyber acts have their source in computers located in the territory of a State or a plurality of States and it occurs with knowledge of the latter. This knowledge would be established on the basis of alerting the territorial State (or States) to the fact of wrongful cyber activity from its territory and its failure to act by employing measures within its capabilities to curb that activity. The best course of action to achieve cessation of injurious cyber acts appears to be through the adoption of good Internet practices and international cooperation.\n\nNicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan - 9781782547389\nDownloaded from Elgar Online at 10/29/2018 06:12:21PM via University of Tasmania"
