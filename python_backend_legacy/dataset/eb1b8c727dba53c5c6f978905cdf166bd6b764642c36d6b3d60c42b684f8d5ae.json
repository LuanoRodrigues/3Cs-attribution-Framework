Traditional notions of armed attack and invasion, which were transparent over the course of the twentieth century, are now reconsidered in light of cyber domain.² Given an “inability to live at peace,” humanity has already developed and employed weapons vis-à-vis the cyber domain as illustrated through the Stuxnet incident.³ Through Stuxnet, humanity has demonstrated that computer-originated attacks can result in kinetic effects. Equally concerning, the cyber domain has created a new battlefield where traditional understandings of “combatants” require reexamination.

With the possibility of this trend, governments will need to develop a legal framework for responding to civilians who directly participate in cyber hostilities.\n\nIn physical warfare settings, the principle of distinction requires belligerents to differentiate between combatants and civilians under the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC). Under LOAC, civilians enjoy protection from being the direct target of armed attack. The notion of Direct Participation in Hostilities (DPH) provides that a civilian loses this protection for undertaking combat operations against military forces in an armed conflict.⁴ This concept became relevant in the U.S. campaigns in Iraq, Afghanistan, the Global War on Terror, and other overseas contingency operations. In these conflicts, U.S. forces confronted the problem by positively identifying and engaging a civilian determined to be directly participating in hostilities. Combining the complexity of DPH with the cyber domain presents a conundrum because, unlike traditional warfare, civilians who can directly participate in cyber hostilities need not be physically located within the theater of hostilities. A hacker who undertakes hostilities can attack from any location in the world with a laptop and internet access. Therefore, the issue of direct participation in cyber hostilities (DPCH) has many factors that will require analysis in order to develop a legal framework for response.\n\nThis article stands for the proposition that a civilian who directly participates in hostilities in the cyber domain forfeits protection and becomes a lawful target. In support, this article will first highlight the background and law applicable to DPCH in general. In particular, this article will discuss the factors that render a civilian targetable by analyzing the traditional framework of DPH as applied through the Tallinn Manual.⁵ This discussion will include an understanding of what constitutes an “attack” and provide examples of which hostile roles render civilians targetable. Next, this article will discuss some of the challenges that leaders will confront in responding to issues involving DPCH. These issues include sovereignty and “targeting law” under LOAC. However, this article will provide a framework that contemplates non-kinetic, kinetic, and covert action.\n\n⁴ Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of August 12, 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts art. 51(3), adopted June 8, 1977, 1125 U.N.T.S. 3 [hereinafter Additional Protocol I]; Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts art. 13(3), adopted June 8, 1977, 1125 U.N.T.S. 609 [hereinafter Additional Protocol II].\n\n⁵ TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE (Michael N.

Background: Direct Participation in Hostilities, Cyber Warfare, and the Law\n\nCurrently, there is no clear international consensus on many cyber warfare (CW) issues, least of all DPCH. Moreover, customary international law (State practice and opinio juris) has not developed or crystallized as found in other areas of International Humanitarian Law (IHL). The ability to detect and defend against such attacks, whether State-sponsored or not, has become exceedingly difficult given the speed and regularity of occurrences within the cyber domain generally. On the subject of \"imminence\" alone, U.S. Government officials struggle to develop policy that applies traditional concepts to determine whether a strike in self-defense is justified or is preventative war and thus prohibited as an unprovoked act of aggression. Furthermore, unlike traditional combat, IHL applicability to CW has not been tested before the International Court of Justice (ICJ). Therefore, CW does not cleanly fit into the hostilities paradigm for which LOAC was created. It is analogous to pouring a new wine into an old bottle.\n\nNevertheless, IHL will serve as a baseline to regulate the conduct of CW until greater international consensus is reached. The fact that IHL does not specifically reference cyber operations does not imply that such operations are not subject to IHL, especially given the possibilities of physical harm caused by CW.[11] Thus, as an international cyber warfare legal framework does not currently exist, the applied \"law\" is national policy interpreting and incorporating IHL as a foundation. Given the Frankenstein-like nature of this framework and uncertainties associated with cyber weapons, many national policies will not be readily transparent.[12] For example, many of the U.S. authorities and policies applicable to CW remain classified and withheld at the\n\n[^6]: Jean-Marie Henckaerts, *Study on Customary International Humanitarian Law: A Contribution to the Understanding and Respect For the Rule of Law in Armed Conflict*, 87 INT'L REV.

While principally derived from customary international law and the 1907 Hague Convention, contemporary notions of distinction are codified in Article 48 of Additional Protocol I (AP I) to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, which provides: “In order to ensure respect for and protection of the civilian population and civilian objects, the Parties to the conflict shall at all times distinguish between the civilian population and combatants and between civilian objects and military objectives and accordingly shall direct their operations only against military objectives.”¹⁶ Thus, civilians enjoy protection from an armed attack as a generally accepted principle under IHL.¹⁷ Under the principle of distinction, parties to a conflict are required to distinguish between the civilian population and objects, and from otherwise lawful targets (e.g., military combatants).¹⁸ The United States and CCD COE acknowledged this requirement of distinction is required in CW.¹⁹\n\nThe notion of DPH, derived from Article 51(3) of AP I, provides that civilians shall enjoy protection from armed attack “unless and for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities” for international armed conflicts (IAC).²⁰ The notion is virtually identical for non-international armed conflicts (NIAC) as\n\n¹³ *Id.*\n\n¹⁴ Harold H.

While civilians are subject to lawful targeting while taking direct part in hostilities, they are only lawful targets “for such time as” or while they actually commit hostile acts directly producing harmful effects to an enemy.²² This preceding language providing for a temporal requirement remains controversial. Institutions such as the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) interpret this section very restrictively to mean that such civilians can only be targeted until he or she has returned to the pre-deployment location.²³ Thus, if a civilian conducts repeated attacks, that civilian will regain protection upon return from each engagement.²⁴ This remains highly debated among scholars and the ICRC. Other scholars take a broader view, allowing for targeting of a civilian long after he or she has lost protection.²⁵ For the purposes of cyber-conflict, the CCD COE agreed that the temporal requirement would at least include actions immediately preceding or subsequent to the qualifying act.²⁶ However, the CCD COE experts were split on the time between repeated attacks.²⁷ Thus, this issue is unresolved in both physical and cyber domains and will become a policy decision vis-à-vis rules of engagement or operational orders. This article will assume a broad view allowing for targeting in between attacks.\n\n## III. The Cumulative Factors of DPCH\n\nWhile the ICRC has not published similar comprehensive guidance on DPCH or CW, the ICRC’s DPH guidance remains helpful as discussed infra. Moreover, the ICRC contributed to the development of the Tallinn Manual and generally agrees with the rules developed with some exceptions.²⁸ In particular, many of the notions for resolving DPCH issues are derived from the ICRC’s interpretive guidance on DPH. Thus, the Tallinn Manual remains the most comprehensive work that serves as DPCH guidance within the framework of IHL.

Understanding an Attack: Threshold of Harm\n\nPer Article 49(1) of AP I, “attacks” are acts of violence against the adversary, whether in offense or in defense.³³ To illustrate, military convoys in Iraq or Afghanistan would be able to target, in self-defense, a roadside Improvised Explosive Device (IED) bomber or sniper for engaging in a hostile act amounting to an attack. On the other hand, a civilian who simply stands in the middle of the road holding up a sign in protest does not qualify as an attack. Targeting this protestor would be prohibited under IHL unless that civilian committed or attempt to commit an act that amounts to direct participation. By analogy, the aforementioned Stuxnet worm would clearly illustrate a kinetic attack given the resultant physical damage to Iranian centrifuges.³⁴ Conversely, the same conclusion would not easily be reached for “hacktivists,” who protest by spamming computer networks with protest e-mails.³⁵ Therefore, to understand the definition of “cyber-attack,” an analysis of the “threshold of harm” associated with it is required. Factors involved in this analysis include: “the context of the event, the actor perpetrating the action (recognizing\n\n²⁹ TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 118.\n\n³⁰ Id.\n\n³¹ Id.\n\n³² Id. at 119-121.\n\n³³ Additional Protocol I, supra note 4, art. 49(1); see also TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 106.

The intended effects of cyber-attack are not necessarily limited to the targeted computer systems or data themselves—for instance, attacks on computer systems which are intended to degrade or destroy infrastructure or [command and control] capability. A cyber-attack may use intermediate delivery vehicles including peripheral devices, electronic transmitters, embedded code, or human operators. The activation or effect of a cyber-attack may be widely separated temporally and geographically from the delivery.³⁷\n\nThe U.S. definition provides some inference that a cyber-attack need not physically destroy systems to qualify as an attack. Rather, disruption of these systems will suffice as meeting a threshold of harm.³⁸\n\nBy comparison, the ICRC’s DPH guidance provides some level of amplification on this point, despite not directly speaking about DPCH or CW specifically. The ICRC indicates that the threshold of harm for DPH is satisfied when the civilian’s actions adversely affect military operations or the military capacity of a party to the conflict.³⁹ The ICRC states that the denial of an adversary’s military use of certain objects, equipment, and territory would reach the required threshold of harm.⁴⁰ The ICRC specifically notes that the electronic interference with military computer networks would fall into this category of denial, whether accomplished through computer network attacks (CNA) or computer network exploitation (CNE).⁴¹ As cybersecurity strategist Joshua\n\n³⁶ Koh, supra note 14, at 4; see also Schmitt, supra note 14, at 19.\n\n³⁷ Memorandum from Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to Chiefs of the Military Services et al., subject: Joint Terminology for Cyberspace Operations (Nov. 2010) [hereinafter “Joint Terminology for Cyberspace Operations”].\n\n³⁸ Id.\n\n³⁹ ICRC DPH GUIDANCE, supra note 23, at 48.\n\n⁴⁰ Id.\n\n⁴¹ Id. at 48.

Rather, it simply implies interference, no different from radio or radar jamming. This proposition is consistent with the ICRC’s view under DPH.

An emerging trend is to define physical harm in the cyber domain as the level of effect on the functionality of the targeted object.⁵⁰ Some experts argue that if a cyber-attack impairs the functionality such that physical components require replacement, then this would constitute damage as envisaged in the concept of attack.⁵¹ Other experts provide that physical component replacement is not required; loss of functionality through data corruption requiring software reinstallation or network rebooting would constitute “physical damage.”⁵² While the physical damage standard is not required for military networks, understanding this disparity is important if cyber-attacks against non-military networks occur as part of greater campaign during an armed conflict.\n\n## B. Direct Causation\n\nThe ICRC guidance provides that there must be a direct causation from the civilian act to the harm suffered for the act to potentially constitute DPH.⁵³ In particular, the ICRC states: “there must be a direct causal link between a specific act and the harm likely to result either from that act, or from a coordinated military operation of which that act constitutes an integral part.”⁵⁴ In terms of a physical context, this implies that the harm suffered cannot be the result of an indirect or secondary order effect. The Tallinn Manual aligns with the ICRC’s DPH analysis by requiring the existence of “a direct causal link between the act in question and the harm intended or inflicted.”⁵⁵ In CW, this standard appears easier to fulfill than in the physical combat scenario, where “fog of war” tends to complicate the issue. By analogy, if a civilian farmer fires his weapon at another local national to ward off livestock poaching, the sound of gunfire or the physical impact of a bullet may incite a nearby military patrol to\n\n⁴⁹ ICRC DPH GUIDANCE, supra note 23, at 49.\n⁵⁰ Droege, supra note 11, at 557–58.\n⁵¹ TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 108.\n⁵² Id. at 109.\n⁵³ ICRC DPH GUIDANCE, supra note 23, at 50–51.\n⁵⁴ Id. at 51.\n⁵⁵ TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 119.",

In some instances, mere possession and public display of personal weapons, could be perceived as a threat without additional accompanying acts.\n\nOn the other hand, CW will not suffer from the same “fog of war” issue. The use of a cyber-weapon to deny a military’s capability or interfere with a military operation can hardly be seen as incidental or an indirect cause.⁵⁶ The Tallinn Manual supports this point through the example of disruption to the enemy’s command and control as being directly caused by a cyber-attack.⁵⁷ Therefore, if a civilian hacker gained access into a military network to exploit or disrupt the network, that civilian’s acts would be the direct cause of the harm suffered, rendering him or her targetable. As a counterpoint, this theory should not discount the possibility of accidental cyber-attacks by civilian entities or individuals. There are potential scenarios where technology companies or independent contractors could theoretically accidentally release malware onto a network. However, the Tallinn Manual and ICRC guidance on direct causation does not address the underlying intentions behind the action. Thus, the challenge with these scenarios is that they reinforce the notion of reasonable precautions within IHL (i.e., the obligation to take reasonable precautions to avoid or minimize incidental civilian losses).⁵⁸ Therefore, while fog of war is relatively diminished, prior to responding to a cyber-attack premised upon DPCH, reasonable precautions (e.g., reviewing human, electronic, and signals intelligence; verifying the source of the attack; using the least destructive means available to neutralize the threat) should be taken to minimize potentially attacking an otherwise innocent party.⁵⁹\n\n## C.

As a qualifying statement, the ICRC notes that acts that do not satisfy the threshold of harm are “non-belligerent . . . and, therefore, must be addressed through law enforcement measures.” 61 A seminal example is the IED maker whose actions contribute to hostilities without necessarily being connected to the conflict. In this example, if the intelligence shows that the IED maker is developing and supplying bombs for the insurgents as a part of an ongoing campaign, then he/she is targetable. This analysis will change if he/she is just selling them to the insurgents. The ICRC also provides that the belligerent nexus element does not require a subjective intent determination, where the state of mind of the person is at issue in committing the act.62 The ICRC posits that a belligerent nexus requires an objective standard expressed in the design of the act or operation which does not depend on the mindset of every participating individual.63 Belligerent nexus is generally not influenced by factors such as personal distress or preferences, or by the mental ability or willingness of persons to assume responsibility for their conduct. Consequently, if an insurgent is forced or coerced in some manner to commit an attack, he/she would still be lawfully targetable under IHL.\n\nAs applied, the Tallinn Manual expounds on the ICRC’s belligerent nexus notion by stating that cyber acts must be directly related to the hostilities between parties to a conflict.64 By example, if a civilian directs a cyber-attack against a military’s command and control node, his or her actions would satisfy this condition as it impacts a military force to the benefit of the opposition. Equally, if a hacker were coerced to commit this cyber-attack, he or she would lose protection and become lawfully targetable. The Tallinn Manual’s criterion rules out acts of a purely criminal or private nature that occur during an armed conflict.65 For example, hackers, using cyber means to commit a variety of crimes against non-military institutions, would not be targetable even if the victim State were a party to the conflict.66 However, if the criminal actions were conducted to support particular military operations of one party and to the detriment of the military opposition, then the civilian would forfeit protection for DPCH.\n\n61 Id. at 59.\n62 Id.\n63 Id.\n64 TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 119.\n65 Id. at 120.\n66 Id.\n\n96",

As Applied: Which Civilians are Targetable?\n\nGiven these cumulative factors, consideration should be given as to the categories of civilians who become lawful targets under DPCH. Up front, government-employed or -contracted computer technicians and related personnel would not be targetable under Geneva Convention III (GC III) as “persons who accompany the armed forces without actually being members thereof,” provided they fulfill more support roles and do not directly participate in hostilities.67 On the other hand, if government contracted personnel were to engage in cyber hostilities, they would lose protection analogous to mercenaries.68 Similarly, civilians who serve a continuous combat function in an organized armed group during an IAC or NIAC are targetable.69 At a minimum, the Tallinn Manual’s guidance provides that members of organized armed groups, whether as levée en masse or not, who directly participate in hostilities, are targetable.70 Such civilians will remain targetable throughout the conflict, including the temporal breaks in between or after attacks mentioned supra. However, the CCD COE experts remain divided over this issue. Some experts argue that a civilian who is simply a member of the group is targetable regardless of their nature, no differently from members of a uniformed armed force (with exception for protected clergy and medical personnel); others follow the ICRC DPH guidance requirement of a “continuous combat function.” Thus, a cook or administrative clerk for a non-state cyber-combat organization would not be targetable under the ICRC standard. This issue remains unresolved in the physical domain and will be resolved through policy or rules of engagement (ROE) decisions by leaders on a fact-specific basis. Nevertheless, civilians will be more readily targetable if they are part of a hostile group actively partaking in the armed conflict.\n\nNotwithstanding these preliminary categories, identifying a civilian directly participating in cyber hostilities will be fact-specific and require a case-by-case analysis consistent with the principles discussed in Part III. Using these cumulative factors, the examples below illustrate the Tallinn Manual’s principles applied to unaffiliated civilians who directly participate in cyber hostilities. While not exhaustive, these examples serve as possible permutations for illustrating DPCH analysis via the Tallinn Manual and the ICRC’s DPH guidance.\n\n67 Art. 4(A)(4), Geneva Convention (III) Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, Aug. 12, 1949, 75 U.N.T.S. 135.

Example One: The Case of the 13-year-old Thrill Seeker\n\nCivilians who are not parties to an IAC or NIAC may be lawfully targeted where they directly participate in cyber hostilities. Consider the hypothetical situation where, during an IAC between the U.S. and Iran, a 13-year-old child is armed with a laptop and malware. In this scenario, this hacker perpetrates a cyber-attack from Switzerland that is designed to disrupt a U.S. military logistics system related to moving of supplies and personnel for the purposes of disrupting (but not physically damaging) processes. This is especially conceivable given the inexpensive nature of developing or acquiring malicious code.[72] Just recently a 12-year-old pled guilty to charges in Canada for hacking government systems in support of the international network of hacktivists known as Anonymous.[73]\n\nOnce this hypothetical 13-year-old child conducts a cyber-attack by transmitting malware into this U.S. military logistics system, the child has clearly forfeited protection and is targetable for the following reasons: first, this act qualifies as an attack given that it meets the threshold of harm by disrupting military operations, where physical harm is not required;[74] secondly, the child's act of launching the malware directly causes the subsequent disruption (or attempted disruption);[75] lastly, the child's act satisfies the belligerent nexus element because the hostile act is directed against the U.S. military network and objectively benefits Iran.[76] Thus, the 13-year-old hacker is a lawful military target under a DPCH theory consistent with the ICRC and Tallinn Manual. Assuming the child only gained access to the network to exploit information by posting it to the internet, the child would still be targetable because such an act would exploit a vulnerability to the benefit of Iran. Conversely, if the child's actions were directed at a U.S. banking network, then the child's actions would be considered a criminal matter, unless the intelligence demonstrates that the child's actions were connected to the exploitation of U.S. infrastructure vulnerabilities in support of Iran's military campaign.\n\n[71] Emily Crawford, *Virtual Battlegrounds: Direct Participation in Cyber Warfare*, 9 ISJLP 1, 15 (2013), available at http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/students/groups/is/files/2013/08/5-Crawford.pdf.\n[72] Daniel Cohen &amp; Aviv Rotbart, *The Use of Code Mutation to Produce Multi-use Cyber Weapons*, THE INSTITUTE FOR NATIONAL SECURITY STUDIES (Jul. 8, 2013), http://www.inss.org.il/index.aspx?id=4538&amp;articleid=5163.\n[73] Lisa Vaas, *12-year-old Canadian Boy Admits to Hacking Police and Government Sites for Anonymous*, NAKED SECURITY (Oct. 26, 2013), http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2013/10/26/12-year-old-canadian-boy-admits-to-hacking-police-and-government-sites-for-anonymous; David Kushner, *The Masked Avengers, How Anonymous Incited Online Vigilantism from Tunisia to Ferguson*, THE NEW YORKER (SEP. 8, 2014), http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/09/08/masked-avengers.\n[74] TALLINN MANUAL, *supra* note 5, at 119.\n[75] Turns, *supra* note 8, at 295.\n[76] *Id.*\n\n98",

Example Two: Hacktivist⁷⁷\n\nPatriotic hacktivism adds a different dimension to DPCH given that their activities may or may not cross the threshold of harm or have a nexus to the conflict. Russian hacktivists participated in a myriad of activities in Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in 2008.⁷⁸ Similar to the above example, a hacktivist, who disrupts military networks through distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, is targetable regardless of his or her subjective underlying intent. However, the analysis will change depending on whether their activities disrupt military operations. Suppose during this U.S.-Iranian conflict, a hacktivist from Anonymous decides to deploy a conspicuous message on a high-traffic, non-DoD, U.S. Government website as a form of cyber-protest of the war. While criminal, these actions will not constitute DPCH if the hacker's actions do not have a belligerent nexus to the conflict, directly cause disruption to military operations, or cause physical harm. This scenario would be true if the hacktivist's actions were targeted against the Affordable Care Act or Department of Justice websites.⁷⁹\n\nOn a sliding scale, the analysis changes if the hacker leaves a conspicuous message on a DoD information website as a form of \"cyber-protest\" of the war. An analysis of those actions is required to determine if the message interferes or disrupts military operations in order to satisfy the belligerent nexus requirement (supporting Iran). For example, if it could be determined that the message was designed to undermine the morale of DoD users fighting the war or interfere with military members' readiness (e.g., disrupting military members' pay on the Defense Finance and Accounting Service website), the hacktivist is clearly targetable under LOAC. However, if a hacktivist's message or action cannot be readily connected to the conflict, he or she is still \"at risk of being targeted, as their attacks would be difficult to differentiate from attacks being conducted by persons with a connection to the hostilities.\"⁸⁰\n\n## C. Example Three: Malware Programmer⁸¹\n\nOther roles, such as a malware programmer, are more complex to analyze for DPCH purposes because of the question of direct causation, no different from a weapons builder.

Whether the programmer is targetable depends on the nature of his or her involvement in supporting the hacker. According to the Tallinn Manual, if the programmer had specifically designed the malware for exploitation of a DoD vulnerability (e.g., a military logistics or finance website), then the malware programmer can be targeted. In this instance, the malware programmer's acts (designing a code to exploit a DoD vulnerability) directly cause the disruptive harm to the military's operations, directly benefiting Iran. Thus, the programmer can be lawfully engaged in addition to the 13-year-old executing the code.⁸² By analogy, an IED developer who designs bombs specifically to exploit U.S. military vehicles (e.g., up-armored HUMVEEs or MRAPs) is targetable under DPH.\n\nConversely, if the malware programmer's only activity is developing generalized malware made available on a website, then causation would not be satisfied given the remoteness of involvement.⁸³ This permutation resembles someone ordering firearms from an online vendor. An online vendor of cyber weapons does not become targetable, unless it is demonstrated that this developer is selling specialized malware to undermine DoD systems during an armed conflict. On the other hand, if the programmer designs malware for the 13-year-old, unaware of the intended target, there may be two possible outcomes.⁸⁴ The CCD COE members were divided on malware programmers in this scenario.⁸⁵ Drawing from the analogy of an IED builder, if military intelligence can establish factors supporting the inference that malware is specifically designed to exploit military weaknesses, then the programmer is targetable, unlike a person developing Trojan Horse viruses downloadable via a website. In short, further targeting decisions of malware programmers will require additional indicia of direct causation.\n\n## D. Technical Support Personnel⁸⁶\n\nAs a final example, technical support personnel require consideration under a DPCH analysis. If the 13-year-old hacker solicits technical support, the nature of that individual's involvement will be a determining factor for DPCH. If the hacker contacts technical support to assist with hardware or system software issues pertaining to the computer, then the support personnel will not be targetable as they are neither connected to the conflict nor the direct cause of harm.⁸⁷ This result would be the same if the technical personnel assisted with\n\n⁸² Turns, supra note 8, at 295.\n⁸³ TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 120.\n⁸⁴ Id.\n⁸⁵ Id.\n⁸⁶ Crawford, supra note 71, at 17.\n⁸⁷ Id.\n\n100",

On the other hand, if a malware programmer provides technical assistance or instructive guidance to the child hacker on refining malware to exploit DoD systems, then the programmer (as a technical advisor) would lose their protected status and be targetable consistent with the Tallinn Manual’s view of a DPCH framework.\n\n## V. Challenges\n\nThe cumulative criteria mentioned above provide only a starting point for understanding what actions render a civilian targetable under LOAC. The decision to use force against a non-state civilian actor who directly participates in hostilities raises a myriad of other issues that will require consideration by states engaged in armed conflict. Each topic is individually complex and could be explored in elaborate discussions beyond the scope of this article. Nevertheless, the below discussions are limited to understanding how a state should consider these issues prior to considering a response to a civilian who forfeits protection under DPCH. These scenarios assume that the non-state actor’s attacks are not attributable to the state.\n\n## A. Sovereignty\n\n“Longstanding notions of sovereignty fall apart when it comes to cyber operations.”⁸⁹ This quote foretells of a complex predicament should neutral nations become the staging grounds for non-state actors launching cyber-attacks in either IACs or NIACs. Of equal importance, the manner in which a State responds to civilians participating in CW from outside the theater of hostilities presents a challenging issue given that such neutral States maintain the inherent right of self-defense pursuant to Article 51 of the U.N. Charter.⁹⁰ For IACs, LOAC provides that belligerent nations are prohibited from actions that harm a neutral nation and draw it into the conflict in any fashion.⁹¹ Conversely, neutral\n\n⁸⁸ *Id.* at 18.\n\n⁸⁹ Eric Talbot Jensen, *Sovereignty and Neutrality in Cyber Conflict*, 35 FORDHAM INT’L L.J. 815, 816 (2012) (citing David Perera, *Schmidle: Cyber Ops Might Require New Combatant Command Structure*, FIERCEGOVERNMENTIT (May 15, 2011, 4:29 PM), http://www.fiercegovernmentit.com/story/schmidle-cyber-ops-might-require-newcombatant-command-structure/2011-05-15 (quoting Lieutenant General Robert Schmidle, Deputy Commander of US Cyber Command)).\n\n⁹⁰ *Id.*; see also UN Charter art. 51.\n\n⁹¹ Jensen, *supra* note 89, at 819; see also INT’L COMM.

If the Swiss preclude this individual from attacking further but refuse to extradite, then the United States would no longer be able to target this individual under the temporal considerations of a LOAC analysis. Alternatively, if the Swiss take no action at all or are unable to prevent harm from occurring, then the United States would find itself in a predicament that theoretically draws a comparison of physical terrorist attacks launched from lawless countries, including (pre-9/11) Afghanistan or Somalia.⁹⁷ Thus, the United States can launch a non-kinetic\n\nand Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons in Case of War on Land, the 1907 Hague Convention No. XIII concerning the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers in Naval War, the four 1949 Geneva Conventions[,] and Additional Protocol I of 1977.

Moreover, the United States can target the 13-year-old kinetically for committing cyber-attacks against its military consistent with the cumulative factors under the Tallinn Manual's view.\n\nBoth responses would be proffered as an “unwilling or unable” international law argument.⁹⁸ Although scholars support this standard’s incorporation into customary international law, the ICJ rejected it on several occasions and thus, the “unwilling or unable” doctrine remains contentious and unsettled within customary international law (CIL).⁹⁹ Should the United States invoke this standard, as in the case of Afghanistan in 2002, a U.S. response without Switzerland’s permission could result in strong political and military repercussions. Unlike Afghanistan before September 2001, Switzerland is not a lawless State, but still bears the responsibility under the *sic utere* doctrine to prevent international cyber-attacks from occurring within its national borders. In response to a U.S. kinetic or non-kinetic attack against the hacker, the Swiss could bring the issue to the ICJ. Switzerland could also respond militarily or in the cyber domain in self-defense against the United States. Given the permutations involved, this scenario illustrates the several considerations the United States would confront in conducting a counter-attack against a hacker located in a neutral State that refuses to cooperate.\n\n## B. Law of Targeting Considerations\n\nIf the United States responds to this hacker in the cyber or physical domain, “targeting law” will certainly apply in both cases. “Targeting law” evaluates whether the weapon’s employment (methodology) would violate the general principles of LOAC.¹⁰⁰ The general principles of LOAC involve military necessity, distinction, proportionality, and humanity.¹⁰¹ For the purposes of kinetic operations using conventional means in the physical domain, targeting law remains well settled. As noted in the Tallinn Manual, these concepts do apply in the cyber domain and will require further examination. “Military necessity may be defined as the principle that justifies the use of all measures needed to defeat the enemy as quickly and efficiently as possible that are not prohibited by the law of war.”¹⁰² Thus, military commanders must act in a manner necessary for advancing military objectives and ensure that their actions\n\n⁹⁸ Goldsmith, *supra* note 93.\n⁹⁹ *Id.*\n¹⁰⁰ Jeffrey S.

The CCD COE posits that “[m]eans and methods of cyber warfare will only in rare cases violate this Rule.”¹⁰⁵ However, the Tallinn Manual illustrates a possible violation of this rule through hacking into a victim’s pacemaker to stop the target’s heart and then reviving him multiple times before finally killing him.¹⁰⁶ An example could include hacking into pharmaceutical records for the purpose of prescribing medications aimed at causing long-term allergic reactions leading to death. Using a cyber-attack to poison or corrupt a military water supply serves as another example as strictly prohibited as a violation of this LOAC principle. Given the ramifications, U.S. policy would exclude attacking this hacker through means that cause unnecessary suffering.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, “distinction” requires combatants to distinguish between lawful military targets (opposing combatants and their equipment and facilities) and protected persons (e.g., civilians, medical personnel, chaplains, hors de combat) and property. However, in DPH and DPCH targeting contexts, distinction requires discriminating between civilians who have forfeited protection from those civilians and related objects that retain protection. Thus, if the United States were to conduct a non-kinetic cyber-attack against the 13-year-old hacker via a Swiss server, the United States would need to utilize malware that targets the offending computer only with no adverse effect or corruption of the server or other resident users. Similarly, if the 13-year-old hacker were using a Wi-Fi café in a Swiss hospital, the United States would not be able to attack the hospital’s server given that it is protected. If the United States can transmit a response (e.g., a DDoS attack) through the Wi-Fi café router that only impacts the targeted computer, then distinction would be otherwise satisfied. Similarly, targeting servers for non-kinetic (e.g., DDoS) or kinetic (e.g., Stuxnet-type virus) purposes requires verification of the hacker’s location. Therefore, the United States would need intelligence models on the systems’ architects and servers in order to modify malware to distinguish civilian perpetrators from protected persons.\n\n¹⁰³ Id. at 52.\n\n¹⁰⁴ Id. at 53.\n\n¹⁰⁵ TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 144.\n\n¹⁰⁶ Id.",

For cyber considerations, civilian objects would include such items as servers, computers, and related hardware. Data is also considered a protected object, especially if the data on a resident server is owned by a protected civilian. As mentioned, the CCD COE specifically chose not exclude data from the ambit of the term “attack.” This is especially true where malware is directed against data that physical objects rely upon for functionality.¹⁰⁷ Thus, a cyber-attack that damages protected civilian data would violate the rules of distinction. While the data’s restoration via a backup could serve as a test for targeting, this is not the test used for physical property since buildings can be rebuilt, and cars can be remanufactured over time. Thus, this issue remains unsettled and a consideration for distinction. As applied, if the Wi-Fi café shares the same servers which contain patients’ records and data, then the intentional damage to such data would violate this principle.\n\nTargeting law also requires a “proportionality” analysis.¹⁰⁸ The Tallinn Manual restates the requirements for proportionality codified in customary international law and in AP I:\n\nA cyber[-]attack that may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated is prohibited.¹⁰⁹\n\nWhile this principle is simply stated, proportionality is entirely subjective given that comparing the value of a military advantage to damage to civilians is tantamount to comparing “apples to oranges.”¹¹⁰ The analysis becomes case-specific, based on the nature of the target and the national thresholds for collateral damage. As applied, if the United States decides to conduct a DDoS attack against the 13-year-old hacker in Switzerland in a hospital Wi-Fi café, then the United States will have to assess the effects of the DDoS attack on that network and whether the resultant collateral damage can be mitigated by modifying the malware.¹¹¹ By comparison, such modifications are consistent with DoD Collateral Damage Estimation Methodologies (CDEM) for\n\n¹⁰⁷ *Id.* at 108, 113.\n¹⁰⁸ HENDERSON, *supra* note 102, at 7.\n¹⁰⁹ TALLINN MANUAL, *supra* note 5, at 159 (Rule 51).\n¹¹⁰ KENNETH ANDERSON &amp; MATTHEW WAXMAN, LAW AND ETHICS FOR AUTONOMOUS WEAPON SYSTEMS: WHY A BAN WON’T WORK AND HOW THE LAWS OF WAR CAN 12 (2013), available at http://www.hoover.org/publications/monographs/144241.\n¹¹¹ TALLINN MANUAL, *supra* note 5, at 113.",

Practical Responses to Civilians who Directly Participate\n\nDespite challenges associated with cyber-warfare, States have a right of self-defense against civilians who conduct cyber-attacks during an armed conflict setting. While political and diplomatic measures remain available, the foregoing discussion provides an understanding of the nature of each response to a DPCH scenario assuming the offending civilian is located and attributed to the action. For the purposes of this framework, the U.S.-Iran armed conflict scenario discussed earlier will be utilized again.\n\n## A. Non-kinetic Responses\n\nNon-kinetic response can be acknowledged or covert as discussed below. Cyber defenses, for example, can be employed to have a non-kinetic effect depending upon their intended effect and usage. If a hacker attempts to gain access into an otherwise prohibited system, the host system can utilize a defense that can essentially block such access with no further effect. More active cyber defenses include tracking hackers’ computers, hacking back into systems to retrieve data, shutting down systems, sabotaging data, infecting the attacker with malware, taking over the attacker’s botnet, or employing a botnet to track or attack the hacker’s computer.¹¹⁵ While active defense responses to DPCH seem plausible, LOAC principles must be taken into consideration. For instance, if a DoD system conducts an active defense hack-back or counter-attack using\n\n¹¹² CDEM assesses the likelihood of collateral damage for conventional weapons based on several factors, such as types of weapons, employment tactics, proximity of civilian structures.

A more interesting question is how such systems can distinguish between a criminal hacker and a LOAC hacker. At a minimum, in both cases, employing an active defense capable of preserving evidence and intelligence related to this hacker and operation will be critical for potential prosecution or follow-on responses.¹¹⁶ Offensive cyber capabilities with non-kinetic effects would employ similar effects described for active defenses. The distinction is that offensive capabilities would not necessarily occur as an automatic response from a computer, but rather a directed operation.\n\n## B. Kinetic Responses\n\nResponding to a cyber-attack kinetically raises questions regarding escalation. A response can take on two forms: a conventional attack (e.g., a missile) or a cyber-attack with physical effects (e.g., Stuxnet). Due to political and diplomatic considerations, use of force by the United States will require nothing short of Presidential authorization. In the instance of international armed conflict, the legal framework for employing a kinetic attack against a designated hostile force or individual (e.g., via AUMF or “targeted killing”) is well settled.¹¹⁷ A cyber-attack with kinetic effects directed against designated hostile forces in a theater of combat is legally supportable. Similarly, the targeted killing of a U.S. terrorist in self-defense is also considered consistent with U.S. domestic law, whether conducted with a drone strike or a kinetic cyber-attack. As scholar Hays Parks notes, the targeted killing of a legitimate enemy is not assassination.¹¹⁸ If a civilian forfeits protection due to DPCH attacks or serves as a cyber-terrorist causing physical harm to U.S. civilians, he or she can be lawfully targeted with a kinetic attack. With this understanding, there will be some additional considerations.\n\nIf the 13-year-old hacker is in Iran during the U.S.-Iranian conflict, the United States could escalate to kinetic force against the child no differently from an insurgent planting IEDs or shooting at a military convoy. On the other hand, kinetic operations during a cyber-only conflict expand the range of options available to the hostile nation for targeting a civilian cyber-attacker within its borders.¹¹⁹ In other words, Iran would be able to escalate to kinetic force in self-defense. Thus, in a cyber-only conflict, targeting this hacker kinetically may\n\n¹¹⁶ *Id.*\n\n¹¹⁷ *US to Outline Legal Backing for ‘Targeted Kill’ Programme*, THE GUARDIAN (Mar. 1, 2012, 2:58 AM), http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/05/us-legal-backing-targeted-kill-programme.\n\n¹¹⁸ W.

These considerations are heightened if kinetic force is applied to or within neutral nations as mentioned in Part IV. A kinetic response to a cyber-attack will require a case-by-case analysis of the nature of the cyber-attack’s operation, intended target(s), and underlying strategic significance.¹²⁰ At a minimum, kinetic action, whether conducted through conventional or cyber-attacks, should be limited in scope and duration, consistent with self-defense proportionality principles, in order to avert an unnecessary escalation.\n\n## C. Covert Action\n\nIn most cases, the benefit of acknowledged non-kinetic or kinetic cyber-attacks against a neutral nation will be significantly outweighed by the diplomatic, economic, and military backlashes that would occur. Such acts would undoubtedly be perceived as an act of aggression by the United Nations, as interpreted by the ICJ.¹²¹ For these reasons, covert action represents a readily available solution while CIL develops in this area. Responding to non-state actors performing cyber-attacks from neutral states presents complex issues given the potential of affronting neutrality and widening the conflict. The stealthy nature of cyber warfare enables covert action as use of the cyber domain enables anonymity, takes advantage of targeted individuals’ awareness, and utilizes speed that overcomes the ability to readily safeguard against the consequences.¹²² Returning to the earlier scenario involving the child hacker located in Switzerland, the United States could consider covert action to thwart this non-state actor. This scenario presumes that Switzerland is uncooperative in extraditing or precluding this child from committing cyber-attacks against the United States.\n\nFirst, the United States could consider a targeted killing operation against this individual within Swiss borders. The targeting of this child for DPCH in support of Iran would not be considered an assassination as prohibited by Executive Order 12333.¹²³ Under U.S. domestic law, an Authorization to Use Military Force will be required to authorize targeted killings. This requirement was illustrated in the U.S. campaign against al-Qaeda. Assuming the U.S.-Iranian conflict contains an AUMF, language should be included to at least authorize the killing of supporting parties for DPCH, regardless of location.

Alternatively, even if an AUMF does not have broader language, a covert targeted killing would still be lawful if it can be established that the killing was required in self-defense consistent with Article 51 of the UN Charter. To prevent attribution of such killing within Swiss borders, the United States could use military means, such as Special Forces operations analogous to those employed during the Osama bin Laden raid.\n\nSecond, covert action could also be conducted for rendition of the child to prosecute him in the United States. The practice of rendition (also referred to as irregular rendition) is typically defined as the kidnapping or taking of an individual to move that person to the jurisdiction of another country.[124] This is distinguished from extraordinary rendition which involves transferring the individual to a foreign country for the purposes of detention and interrogation by a foreign government.[125] Rendition does not deprive U.S. courts of jurisdiction unless an applicable extradition treaty explicitly calls for that result and that treaty has been given legislative effect within U.S. domestic law.[126] Since the U.S.-Swiss extradition treaty contains no rendition language, the United States would not be barred from exercising jurisdiction and prosecuting this individual.[127] A covert action for rendition would resemble a raid using either special operations or U.S. law enforcement.\n\nFinally, covert action could be carried out against this individual via cyber means. A cyber-attack could have a non-kinetic or kinetic impact, as discussed earlier, and would be a more tenable solution if the originator of the attack were unknown. A covert operation employing cyber capabilities would require a complex number of variables beyond the scope of this article. Needless to say, such an operation would involve understanding the location of the child, a breakdown of the child's activities (pattern of life), an understanding of the targeted system's architecture, and other variables. A covert, non-kinetic cyberattack could be aimed at locating, tracking, and denying access to the 13-year-old hacker via the child's computer or home internet service provider. This kind of non-kinetic operation could be aimed at developing further intelligence on the child's activities for further planning should the child continue his or her attacks.\n\n124 BARRY E.

Malware could be used to destroy the child’s data or to render the child’s computer unusable. On the other hand, if the desired effect is to kill the 13-year-old hacker, then a more elaborate cyber-attack would be required. Should the child need a pacemaker or medical assistance, a potential attack would include using malware or other cyber technique to kill the hacker, provided that the prohibition against unnecessary suffering was enforced. “CyberJacking,” the act of remotely taking control of someone’s vehicle, could be used as cyber means of a targeted killing.¹²⁸ In this past summer’s BlackHat conference, two researchers demonstrated how they could control a car using their laptop while within the car.¹²⁹ Such capabilities could easily be weaponized to target this 13-year-old hacker, assuming that the killing of the civilian driver or other occupants as collateral damage would be proportionally acceptable under the circumstances.\n\n## VII. Conclusion\n\nIn summary, DPCH will remain an ongoing concern in the coming years given the lack of an international consensus on the basic legal principles governing hostilities in the cyber domain. At a minimum, the Tallinn Manual’s DPCH framework provides clear guidance derived from IHL that will enable states to respond to civilian hackers who undertake hostilities in armed conflict while seeking to prevent collateral damage. While developing a cyber-hostilities treaty appears as a readily available solution, the sharp disagreement among states (e.g., the United States, Great Britain, France, China, Russia) on the basic principle of regulating the cyber domain makes such treaty a fleeting prospect. Nevertheless, states always retain the inherent authority of self-defense, regardless of the lack of international consensus concerning cyber hostilities. Thus, IHL provides an immediate legal framework for cyber operations. Over time, these practices will refine and crystalize into customary international law through State practice and opinio juris. Although international consensus seems unattainable, regional or organization practices such as the NATO effort in the Tallinn Manual support the development of CIL in those regions. While the cyber domain requires an analysis of the nature of hostilities, the principles of IHL govern the conduct of these hostilities in order to safeguard against collateral damage while preserving a state’s right of self-defense.\n\n¹²⁸ Scott Schweitzer, *CyberJacking, Sophisticated Assassination*, CYBER WEAPONS &amp; WARFARE (Oct. 6, 2013, 8:55 AM), http://cyberweapons.blogspot.com/.\n\n¹²⁹ *Id.* The BlackHat conference is a yearly event where thousands of security experts gather to discuss information security and expose vulnerabilities at the pertaining to computers, networks and other related digital media.

Equally concerning, the cyber domain has created a new battlefield where traditional understandings of “combatants” require reexamination.

With the possibility of this trend, governments will need to develop a legal framework for responding to civilians who directly participate in cyber hostilities.\nIn physical warfare settings, the principle of distinction requires belligerents to differentiate between combatants and civilians under the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC). Under LOAC, civilians enjoy protection from being the direct target of armed attack. The notion of Direct Participation in Hostilities (DPH) provides that a civilian loses this protection for undertaking combat operations against military forces in an armed conflict.⁴ This concept became relevant in the U.S. campaigns in Iraq, Afghanistan, the Global War on Terror, and other overseas contingency operations. In these conflicts, U.S. forces confronted the problem by positively identifying and engaging a civilian determined to be directly participating in hostilities. Combining the complexity of DPH with the cyber domain presents a conundrum because, unlike traditional warfare, civilians who can directly participate in cyber hostilities need not be physically located within the theater of hostilities. A hacker who undertakes hostilities can attack from any location in the world with a laptop and internet access. Therefore, the issue of direct participation in cyber hostilities (DPCH) has many factors that will require analysis in order to develop a legal framework for response.\nThis article stands for the proposition that a civilian who directly participates in hostilities in the cyber domain forfeits protection and becomes a lawful target. In support, this article will first highlight the background and law applicable to DPCH in general. In particular, this article will discuss the factors that render a civilian targetable by analyzing the traditional framework of DPH as applied through the Tallinn Manual.⁵ This discussion will include an understanding of what constitutes an “attack” and provide examples of which hostile roles render civilians targetable. Next, this article will discuss some of the challenges that leaders will confront in responding to issues involving DPCH. These issues include sovereignty and “targeting law” under LOAC.

Schmitt ed., 2013) [hereinafter TALLINN MANUAL].\n87\n2015\nPouring New Wine Into Old Bottles\n## II. Background: Direct Participation in Hostilities, Cyber Warfare, and the Law\nCurrently, there is no clear international consensus on many cyber warfare (CW) issues, least of all DPCH. Moreover, customary international law (State practice and opinio juris) has not developed or crystallized as found in other areas of International Humanitarian Law (IHL). The ability to detect and defend against such attacks, whether State-sponsored or not, has become exceedingly difficult given the speed and regularity of occurrences within the cyber domain generally. On the subject of \"imminence\" alone, U.S. Government officials struggle to develop policy that applies traditional concepts to determine whether a strike in self-defense is justified or is preventative war and thus prohibited as an unprovoked act of aggression. Furthermore, unlike traditional combat, IHL applicability to CW has not been tested before the International Court of Justice (ICJ). Therefore, CW does not cleanly fit into the hostilities paradigm for which LOAC was created. It is analogous to pouring a new wine into an old bottle.\nNevertheless, IHL will serve as a baseline to regulate the conduct of CW until greater international consensus is reached. The fact that IHL does not specifically reference cyber operations does not imply that such operations are not subject to IHL, especially given the possibilities of physical harm caused by CW.[11] Thus, as an international cyber warfare legal framework does not currently exist, the applied \"law\" is national policy interpreting and incorporating IHL as a foundation. Given the Frankenstein-like nature of this framework and uncertainties associated with cyber weapons, many national policies will not be readily transparent.[12] For example, many of the U.S. authorities and policies applicable to CW remain classified and withheld at the\n[^6]: Jean-Marie Henckaerts, *Study on Customary International Humanitarian Law: A Contribution to the Understanding and Respect For the Rule of Law in Armed Conflict*, 87 INT'L REV.

While principally derived from customary international law and the 1907 Hague Convention, contemporary notions of distinction are codified in Article 48 of Additional Protocol I (AP I) to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, which provides: “In order to ensure respect for and protection of the civilian population and civilian objects, the Parties to the conflict shall at all times distinguish between the civilian population and combatants and between civilian objects and military objectives and accordingly shall direct their operations only against military objectives.”¹⁶ Thus, civilians enjoy protection from an armed attack as a generally accepted principle under IHL.¹⁷ Under the principle of distinction, parties to a conflict are required to distinguish between the civilian population and objects, and from otherwise lawful targets (e.g., military combatants).¹⁸ The United States and CCD COE acknowledged this requirement of distinction is required in CW.¹⁹\nThe notion of DPH, derived from Article 51(3) of AP I, provides that civilians shall enjoy protection from armed attack “unless and for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities” for international armed conflicts (IAC).²⁰ The notion is virtually identical for non-international armed conflicts (NIAC) as\n¹³ *Id.*\n¹⁴ Harold H.

While civilians are subject to lawful targeting while taking direct part in hostilities, they are only lawful targets “for such time as” or while they actually commit hostile acts directly producing harmful effects to an enemy.²² This preceding language providing for a temporal requirement remains controversial. Institutions such as the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) interpret this section very restrictively to mean that such civilians can only be targeted until he or she has returned to the pre-deployment location.²³ Thus, if a civilian conducts repeated attacks, that civilian will regain protection upon return from each engagement.²⁴ This remains highly debated among scholars and the ICRC. Other scholars take a broader view, allowing for targeting of a civilian long after he or she has lost protection.²⁵ For the purposes of cyber-conflict, the CCD COE agreed that the temporal requirement would at least include actions immediately preceding or subsequent to the qualifying act.²⁶ However, the CCD COE experts were split on the time between repeated attacks.²⁷ Thus, this issue is unresolved in both physical and cyber domains and will become a policy decision vis-à-vis rules of engagement or operational orders. This article will assume a broad view allowing for targeting in between attacks.\n## III. The Cumulative Factors of DPCH\nWhile the ICRC has not published similar comprehensive guidance on DPCH or CW, the ICRC’s DPH guidance remains helpful as discussed infra. Moreover, the ICRC contributed to the development of the Tallinn Manual and generally agrees with the rules developed with some exceptions.²⁸ In particular, many of the notions for resolving DPCH issues are derived from the ICRC’s interpretive guidance on DPH. Thus, the Tallinn Manual remains the most comprehensive work that serves as DPCH guidance within the framework of IHL. Rule 35 of the Tallinn Manual provides that an act of direct participation in hostilities by civilians renders them liable to be attacked, by cyber or other\n21 Additional Protocol II, supra note 4, art. 13(3).\n22 Id.\n23 NILS MELZER, ICRC INTERPRETIVE GUIDANCE ON THE NOTION OF DIRECT PARTICIPATION IN HOSTILITIES UNDER INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW 70–71 (2009), available at http://www.icrc.org/eng/assets/files/other/icrc-002-0990.pdf [hereinafter ICRC DPH GUIDANCE].\n24 Id.

Understanding an Attack: Threshold of Harm\nPer Article 49(1) of AP I, “attacks” are acts of violence against the adversary, whether in offense or in defense.³³ To illustrate, military convoys in Iraq or Afghanistan would be able to target, in self-defense, a roadside Improvised Explosive Device (IED) bomber or sniper for engaging in a hostile act amounting to an attack. On the other hand, a civilian who simply stands in the middle of the road holding up a sign in protest does not qualify as an attack. Targeting this protestor would be prohibited under IHL unless that civilian committed or attempt to commit an act that amounts to direct participation. By analogy, the aforementioned Stuxnet worm would clearly illustrate a kinetic attack given the resultant physical damage to Iranian centrifuges.³⁴ Conversely, the same conclusion would not easily be reached for “hacktivists,” who protest by spamming computer networks with protest e-mails.³⁵ Therefore, to understand the definition of “cyber-attack,” an analysis of the “threshold of harm” associated with it is required. Factors involved in this analysis include: “the context of the event, the actor perpetrating the action (recognizing\n²⁹ TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 118.\n³⁰ Id.\n³¹ Id.\n³² Id. at 119-121.\n³³ Additional Protocol I, supra note 4, art. 49(1); see also TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 106. (“[I]t is the use of violence against a target that distinguishes attacks from other military operations. Non-violent operations, such as psychological cyber operations or cyber espionage, do not qualify as attacks. ‘Acts of violence’ should not be understood as limited to activities that release kinetic force. . . . In this regard, note that chemical, biological, or radiological attacks do not usually have a kinetic effect on their designated target, but it is universally agreed that they constitute attacks as a matter of law.”)\n³⁴ 60 Minutes: Stuxnet: Computer Worm Opens New Era of Warfare (CBS television broadcast Jul. 1, 2012), available at http://www.cbsnews.com/news/stuxnet-computer-worm-opens-new-era-of-warfare-01-07-2012/.\n³⁵ Hacktivism is defined as the use of computer hacking to help advance political or social causes. See Mark Manion &amp; Abby Goodrum, Terrorism or Civil Disobedience: Toward a Hacktivist Ethic, 30 COMPUTERS &amp; SOC’Y 14 (2000).\n2015\nPouring New Wine Into Old Bottles\nchallenging issues of attribution in cyberspace), the target and location, [and] effects and intent, among other possible issues.”³⁶\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) defines “cyber-attack” as:\nA hostile act using computer or related networks or systems, and intended to disrupt and/or destroy an adversary’s critical cyber systems, assets, or functions. The intended effects of cyber-attack are not necessarily limited to the targeted computer systems or data themselves—for instance, attacks on computer systems which are intended to degrade or destroy infrastructure or [command and control] capability. A cyber-attack may use intermediate delivery vehicles including peripheral devices, electronic transmitters, embedded code, or human operators. The activation or effect of a cyber-attack may be widely separated temporally and geographically from the delivery.³⁷\nThe U.S. definition provides some inference that a cyber-attack need not physically destroy systems to qualify as an attack. Rather, disruption of these systems will suffice as meeting a threshold of harm.³⁸\nBy comparison, the ICRC’s DPH guidance provides some level of amplification on this point, despite not directly speaking about DPCH or CW specifically. The ICRC indicates that the threshold of harm for DPH is satisfied when the civilian’s actions adversely affect military operations or the military capacity of a party to the conflict.³⁹ The ICRC states that the denial of an adversary’s military use of certain objects, equipment, and territory would reach the required threshold of harm.⁴⁰ The ICRC specifically notes that the electronic interference with military computer networks would fall into this category of denial, whether accomplished through computer network attacks (CNA) or computer network exploitation (CNE).⁴¹ As cybersecurity strategist Joshua\n³⁶ Koh, supra note 14, at 4; see also Schmitt, supra note 14, at 19.\n³⁷ Memorandum from Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to Chiefs of the Military Services et al., subject: Joint Terminology for Cyberspace Operations (Nov. 2010) [hereinafter “Joint Terminology for Cyberspace Operations”].\n³⁸ Id.\n³⁹ ICRC DPH GUIDANCE, supra note 23, at 48.\n⁴⁰ Id.\n⁴¹ Id. at 48. CNA is defined as a “category of fires employed for offensive purposes in which actions are taken through the use of computer networks to disrupt, deny, degrade, manipulate, or destroy information resident in the target system or computer networks, or the systems/networks themselves.”; CNE is defined as “[e]nabling operations and intelligence collection capabilities conducted through the use of computer networks to gather data about target or adversary automated\n92\nNaval Law Review\nLXIV\nCorman notes, a cyber-attack is essentially no different from electronic warfare where an adversary denies military use of equipment through jamming or interfering with a network.⁴² Thus, a civilian who engages in actions tantamount to interference with military communications or operations through CNA (e.g., a Denial of Service operation) or CNE would constitute a DPCH attack in ICRC’s view.\nThe Tallinn Manual thus incorporates the ICRC’s notion by stating that:\n[T]he act (or a closely related series of acts) must have the intended or actual effect of negatively affecting the adversary’s military operations or capabilities, or inflicting death, physical harm, or material destruction on persons or objects protected against direct attack (threshold of harm).⁴³\nThe CCD COE experts provide that a cyber-attack that satisfies the “threshold of harm” is an operation that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects.⁴⁴ The CCD COE was very specific that this “limitation should not be understood as excluding cyber operations against data (which are non-physical entities) from the ambit of the term attack.”⁴⁵ This is especially true if an operation against data upon which the functionality of physical objects relies can sometimes constitute an attack.⁴⁶\nHowever, for the purposes of DPCH against military adversaries, the CCD COE clarifies that there is no requirement for physical damage to objects or harm to individuals so long as a cyber-attack negatively affects enemy military operations.⁴⁷ For example, a cyber-attack that disrupts the operation of the military’s command and control network would satisfy the criterion.⁴⁸ Disruption in this context does not mean physical damage to servers, data, or computers. Rather, it simply implies interference, no different from radio or radar jamming. This proposition is consistent with the ICRC’s view under DPH. Stated negatively, if these actions were not directed at an adversary’s military capability, the ICRC requires that the “specific act must be likely to cause at\ninformation systems or networks.” See Joint Terminology for Cyberspace Operations, supra note 37, at 3-4.\n⁴² Skype Interview with cybersecurity strategist Joshua Corman, Chief Technology Officer at Sonatype (Sept. 23, 2013) (video recordation on file with author).\n⁴³ TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 119.\n⁴⁴ Id. at 107.\n⁴⁵ Id. at 107–08.\n⁴⁶ Id. at 119.\n⁴⁷ Id.\n⁴⁸ Id.\n93\n2015\nPouring New Wine Into Old Bottles\nleast death, injury, or destruction” of property in order to reach this threshold of harm.⁴⁹ Thus, the ICRC’s notion as applied to CW means that a civilian hacker interfering with a civilian computer system (e.g., Social Security), instead of the military, would not necessarily lose protection for that purpose unless it can be demonstrated that either the cyber-attack against the non-military network was intended to have an effect on the military in some fashion or that physical harm would otherwise result.\nAs an aside, this notion of physical harm to a non-military network need not be defined in the physical destruction associated with a kinetic strike. An emerging trend is to define physical harm in the cyber domain as the level of effect on the functionality of the targeted object.⁵⁰ Some experts argue that if a cyber-attack impairs the functionality such that physical components require replacement, then this would constitute damage as envisaged in the concept of attack.⁵¹ Other experts provide that physical component replacement is not required; loss of functionality through data corruption requiring software reinstallation or network rebooting would constitute “physical damage.”⁵² While the physical damage standard is not required for military networks, understanding this disparity is important if cyber-attacks against non-military networks occur as part of greater campaign during an armed conflict.\n## B. Direct Causation\nThe ICRC guidance provides that there must be a direct causation from the civilian act to the harm suffered for the act to potentially constitute DPH.⁵³ In particular, the ICRC states: “there must be a direct causal link between a specific act and the harm likely to result either from that act, or from a coordinated military operation of which that act constitutes an integral part.”⁵⁴ In terms of a physical context, this implies that the harm suffered cannot be the result of an indirect or secondary order effect. The Tallinn Manual aligns with the ICRC’s DPH analysis by requiring the existence of “a direct causal link between the act in question and the harm intended or inflicted.”⁵⁵ In CW, this standard appears easier to fulfill than in the physical combat scenario, where “fog of war” tends to complicate the issue. By analogy, if a civilian farmer fires his weapon at another local national to ward off livestock poaching, the sound of gunfire or the physical impact of a bullet may incite a nearby military patrol to\n⁴⁹ ICRC DPH GUIDANCE, supra note 23, at 49.\n⁵⁰ Droege, supra note 11, at 557–58.\n⁵¹ TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 108.\n⁵² Id. at 109.\n⁵³ ICRC DPH GUIDANCE, supra note 23, at 50–51.\n⁵⁴ Id. at 51.\n⁵⁵ TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 119.\nNaval Law Review\nLXIV\nengage in self-defense. In some instances, mere possession and public display of personal weapons, could be perceived as a threat without additional accompanying acts.\nOn the other hand, CW will not suffer from the same “fog of war” issue. The use of a cyber-weapon to deny a military’s capability or interfere with a military operation can hardly be seen as incidental or an indirect cause.⁵⁶ The Tallinn Manual supports this point through the example of disruption to the enemy’s command and control as being directly caused by a cyber-attack.⁵⁷ Therefore, if a civilian hacker gained access into a military network to exploit or disrupt the network, that civilian’s acts would be the direct cause of the harm suffered, rendering him or her targetable. As a counterpoint, this theory should not discount the possibility of accidental cyber-attacks by civilian entities or individuals. There are potential scenarios where technology companies or independent contractors could theoretically accidentally release malware onto a network. However, the Tallinn Manual and ICRC guidance on direct causation does not address the underlying intentions behind the action. Thus, the challenge with these scenarios is that they reinforce the notion of reasonable precautions within IHL (i.e., the obligation to take reasonable precautions to avoid or minimize incidental civilian losses).⁵⁸ Therefore, while fog of war is relatively diminished, prior to responding to a cyber-attack premised upon DPCH, reasonable precautions (e.g., reviewing human, electronic, and signals intelligence; verifying the source of the attack; using the least destructive means available to neutralize the threat) should be taken to minimize potentially attacking an otherwise innocent party.⁵⁹\n## C. Belligerent Nexus\nThe ICRC DPH guidance provides that:\nIn order to meet the requirement of belligerent nexus, an act must be specifically designed to directly cause the required threshold of harm in support of a party to the conflict and to the detriment of another.⁶⁰\n⁵⁶ Id. at 119–20.\n⁵⁷ Id. at 120.\n⁵⁸ Additional Protocol I, supra note 4, art. 57(1); see also Customary IHL—Rule 15. Precautions in Attack, INT’L COMM. OF THE RED CROSS, http://www.icrc.org/customary-ibl/eng/docs/v1_cha_chapter5_rule15 (last visited July 30, 2014) (suggesting that Article 13(1) of Additional Protocol II implies this obligation); TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 164–65.\n⁵⁹ See generally TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 159–176 (Rules 51–58).\n⁶⁰ ICRC DPH GUIDANCE, supra note 23, at 58.\n2015\nPouring New Wine Into Old Bottles\nHostile acts such as firing a weapon at an enemy or planting a bomb serve as easy examples. As a qualifying statement, the ICRC notes that acts that do not satisfy the threshold of harm are “non-belligerent . . . and, therefore, must be addressed through law enforcement measures.” 61 A seminal example is the IED maker whose actions contribute to hostilities without necessarily being connected to the conflict. In this example, if the intelligence shows that the IED maker is developing and supplying bombs for the insurgents as a part of an ongoing campaign, then he/she is targetable. This analysis will change if he/she is just selling them to the insurgents. The ICRC also provides that the belligerent nexus element does not require a subjective intent determination, where the state of mind of the person is at issue in committing the act.62 The ICRC posits that a belligerent nexus requires an objective standard expressed in the design of the act or operation which does not depend on the mindset of every participating individual.63 Belligerent nexus is generally not influenced by factors such as personal distress or preferences, or by the mental ability or willingness of persons to assume responsibility for their conduct. Consequently, if an insurgent is forced or coerced in some manner to commit an attack, he/she would still be lawfully targetable under IHL.\nAs applied, the Tallinn Manual expounds on the ICRC’s belligerent nexus notion by stating that cyber acts must be directly related to the hostilities between parties to a conflict.64 By example, if a civilian directs a cyber-attack against a military’s command and control node, his or her actions would satisfy this condition as it impacts a military force to the benefit of the opposition. Equally, if a hacker were coerced to commit this cyber-attack, he or she would lose protection and become lawfully targetable. The Tallinn Manual’s criterion rules out acts of a purely criminal or private nature that occur during an armed conflict.65 For example, hackers, using cyber means to commit a variety of crimes against non-military institutions, would not be targetable even if the victim State were a party to the conflict.66 However, if the criminal actions were conducted to support particular military operations of one party and to the detriment of the military opposition, then the civilian would forfeit protection for DPCH.\n61 Id. at 59.\n62 Id.\n63 Id.\n64 TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 119.\n65 Id. at 120.\n66 Id.\n96\nNaval Law Review\nLXIV\n## IV. As Applied: Which Civilians are Targetable?\nGiven these cumulative factors, consideration should be given as to the categories of civilians who become lawful targets under DPCH. Up front, government-employed or -contracted computer technicians and related personnel would not be targetable under Geneva Convention III (GC III) as “persons who accompany the armed forces without actually being members thereof,” provided they fulfill more support roles and do not directly participate in hostilities.67 On the other hand, if government contracted personnel were to engage in cyber hostilities, they would lose protection analogous to mercenaries.68 Similarly, civilians who serve a continuous combat function in an organized armed group during an IAC or NIAC are targetable.69 At a minimum, the Tallinn Manual’s guidance provides that members of organized armed groups, whether as levée en masse or not, who directly participate in hostilities, are targetable.70 Such civilians will remain targetable throughout the conflict, including the temporal breaks in between or after attacks mentioned supra. However, the CCD COE experts remain divided over this issue. Some experts argue that a civilian who is simply a member of the group is targetable regardless of their nature, no differently from members of a uniformed armed force (with exception for protected clergy and medical personnel); others follow the ICRC DPH guidance requirement of a “continuous combat function.” Thus, a cook or administrative clerk for a non-state cyber-combat organization would not be targetable under the ICRC standard. This issue remains unresolved in the physical domain and will be resolved through policy or rules of engagement (ROE) decisions by leaders on a fact-specific basis. Nevertheless, civilians will be more readily targetable if they are part of a hostile group actively partaking in the armed conflict.\nNotwithstanding these preliminary categories, identifying a civilian directly participating in cyber hostilities will be fact-specific and require a case-by-case analysis consistent with the principles discussed in Part III. Using these cumulative factors, the examples below illustrate the Tallinn Manual’s principles applied to unaffiliated civilians who directly participate in cyber hostilities. While not exhaustive, these examples serve as possible permutations for illustrating DPCH analysis via the Tallinn Manual and the ICRC’s DPH guidance.\n67 Art. 4(A)(4), Geneva Convention (III) Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, Aug. 12, 1949, 75 U.N.T.S. 135.

Example One: The Case of the 13-year-old Thrill Seeker\nCivilians who are not parties to an IAC or NIAC may be lawfully targeted where they directly participate in cyber hostilities. Consider the hypothetical situation where, during an IAC between the U.S. and Iran, a 13-year-old child is armed with a laptop and malware. In this scenario, this hacker perpetrates a cyber-attack from Switzerland that is designed to disrupt a U.S. military logistics system related to moving of supplies and personnel for the purposes of disrupting (but not physically damaging) processes. This is especially conceivable given the inexpensive nature of developing or acquiring malicious code.[72] Just recently a 12-year-old pled guilty to charges in Canada for hacking government systems in support of the international network of hacktivists known as Anonymous.[73]\nOnce this hypothetical 13-year-old child conducts a cyber-attack by transmitting malware into this U.S. military logistics system, the child has clearly forfeited protection and is targetable for the following reasons: first, this act qualifies as an attack given that it meets the threshold of harm by disrupting military operations, where physical harm is not required;[74] secondly, the child's act of launching the malware directly causes the subsequent disruption (or attempted disruption);[75] lastly, the child's act satisfies the belligerent nexus element because the hostile act is directed against the U.S. military network and objectively benefits Iran.[76] Thus, the 13-year-old hacker is a lawful military target under a DPCH theory consistent with the ICRC and Tallinn Manual. Assuming the child only gained access to the network to exploit information by posting it to the internet, the child would still be targetable because such an act would exploit a vulnerability to the benefit of Iran. Conversely, if the child's actions were directed at a U.S. banking network, then the child's actions would be considered a criminal matter, unless the intelligence demonstrates that the child's actions were connected to the exploitation of U.S. infrastructure vulnerabilities in support of Iran's military campaign.\n[71] Emily Crawford, *Virtual Battlegrounds: Direct Participation in Cyber Warfare*, 9 ISJLP 1, 15 (2013), available at http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/students/groups/is/files/2013/08/5-Crawford.pdf.\n[72] Daniel Cohen &amp; Aviv Rotbart, *The Use of Code Mutation to Produce Multi-use Cyber Weapons*, THE INSTITUTE FOR NATIONAL SECURITY STUDIES (Jul. 8, 2013), http://www.inss.org.il/index.aspx?id=4538&amp;articleid=5163.\n[73] Lisa Vaas, *12-year-old Canadian Boy Admits to Hacking Police and Government Sites for Anonymous*, NAKED SECURITY (Oct. 26, 2013), http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2013/10/26/12-year-old-canadian-boy-admits-to-hacking-police-and-government-sites-for-anonymous; David Kushner, *The Masked Avengers, How Anonymous Incited Online Vigilantism from Tunisia to Ferguson*, THE NEW YORKER (SEP. 8, 2014), http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/09/08/masked-avengers.\n[74] TALLINN MANUAL, *supra* note 5, at 119.\n[75] Turns, *supra* note 8, at 295.\n[76] *Id.*\n98\nNaval Law Review\nLXIV\n## B. Example Two: Hacktivist⁷⁷\nPatriotic hacktivism adds a different dimension to DPCH given that their activities may or may not cross the threshold of harm or have a nexus to the conflict. Russian hacktivists participated in a myriad of activities in Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in 2008.⁷⁸ Similar to the above example, a hacktivist, who disrupts military networks through distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, is targetable regardless of his or her subjective underlying intent. However, the analysis will change depending on whether their activities disrupt military operations. Suppose during this U.S.-Iranian conflict, a hacktivist from Anonymous decides to deploy a conspicuous message on a high-traffic, non-DoD, U.S. Government website as a form of cyber-protest of the war. While criminal, these actions will not constitute DPCH if the hacker's actions do not have a belligerent nexus to the conflict, directly cause disruption to military operations, or cause physical harm. This scenario would be true if the hacktivist's actions were targeted against the Affordable Care Act or Department of Justice websites.⁷⁹\nOn a sliding scale, the analysis changes if the hacker leaves a conspicuous message on a DoD information website as a form of \"cyber-protest\" of the war. An analysis of those actions is required to determine if the message interferes or disrupts military operations in order to satisfy the belligerent nexus requirement (supporting Iran). For example, if it could be determined that the message was designed to undermine the morale of DoD users fighting the war or interfere with military members' readiness (e.g., disrupting military members' pay on the Defense Finance and Accounting Service website), the hacktivist is clearly targetable under LOAC. However, if a hacktivist's message or action cannot be readily connected to the conflict, he or she is still \"at risk of being targeted, as their attacks would be difficult to differentiate from attacks being conducted by persons with a connection to the hostilities.\"⁸⁰\n## C. Example Three: Malware Programmer⁸¹\nOther roles, such as a malware programmer, are more complex to analyze for DPCH purposes because of the question of direct causation, no different from a weapons builder. Returning to the example of the U.S.-Iran conflict, a cyber-weapons programmer could have played a role in developing\n⁷⁷ Id. at 293.\n⁷⁸ Id. at 293, n.59.\n⁷⁹ TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 119–20.\n⁸⁰ Crawford, supra note 71, at 17.\n⁸¹ Id. at 16; see Turns, supra note 8, at 295.\n2015\nPouring New Wine Into Old Bottles\nand providing the malware to the 13-year-old hacker. Whether the programmer is targetable depends on the nature of his or her involvement in supporting the hacker. According to the Tallinn Manual, if the programmer had specifically designed the malware for exploitation of a DoD vulnerability (e.g., a military logistics or finance website), then the malware programmer can be targeted. In this instance, the malware programmer's acts (designing a code to exploit a DoD vulnerability) directly cause the disruptive harm to the military's operations, directly benefiting Iran. Thus, the programmer can be lawfully engaged in addition to the 13-year-old executing the code.⁸² By analogy, an IED developer who designs bombs specifically to exploit U.S. military vehicles (e.g., up-armored HUMVEEs or MRAPs) is targetable under DPH.\nConversely, if the malware programmer's only activity is developing generalized malware made available on a website, then causation would not be satisfied given the remoteness of involvement.⁸³ This permutation resembles someone ordering firearms from an online vendor. An online vendor of cyber weapons does not become targetable, unless it is demonstrated that this developer is selling specialized malware to undermine DoD systems during an armed conflict. On the other hand, if the programmer designs malware for the 13-year-old, unaware of the intended target, there may be two possible outcomes.⁸⁴ The CCD COE members were divided on malware programmers in this scenario.⁸⁵ Drawing from the analogy of an IED builder, if military intelligence can establish factors supporting the inference that malware is specifically designed to exploit military weaknesses, then the programmer is targetable, unlike a person developing Trojan Horse viruses downloadable via a website. In short, further targeting decisions of malware programmers will require additional indicia of direct causation.\n## D. Technical Support Personnel⁸⁶\nAs a final example, technical support personnel require consideration under a DPCH analysis. If the 13-year-old hacker solicits technical support, the nature of that individual's involvement will be a determining factor for DPCH. If the hacker contacts technical support to assist with hardware or system software issues pertaining to the computer, then the support personnel will not be targetable as they are neither connected to the conflict nor the direct cause of harm.⁸⁷ This result would be the same if the technical personnel assisted with\n⁸² Turns, supra note 8, at 295.\n⁸³ TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 120.\n⁸⁴ Id.\n⁸⁵ Id.\n⁸⁶ Crawford, supra note 71, at 17.\n⁸⁷ Id.\n100\nNaval Law Review\nLXIV\nhardware and software issues knowing the intentions of the hacker.⁸⁸ These personnel are criminally liable for such actions under a domestic framework within the United States, but are not targetable under LOAC. On the other hand, if a malware programmer provides technical assistance or instructive guidance to the child hacker on refining malware to exploit DoD systems, then the programmer (as a technical advisor) would lose their protected status and be targetable consistent with the Tallinn Manual’s view of a DPCH framework.\n## V. Challenges\nThe cumulative criteria mentioned above provide only a starting point for understanding what actions render a civilian targetable under LOAC. The decision to use force against a non-state civilian actor who directly participates in hostilities raises a myriad of other issues that will require consideration by states engaged in armed conflict. Each topic is individually complex and could be explored in elaborate discussions beyond the scope of this article. Nevertheless, the below discussions are limited to understanding how a state should consider these issues prior to considering a response to a civilian who forfeits protection under DPCH. These scenarios assume that the non-state actor’s attacks are not attributable to the state.\n## A. Sovereignty\n“Longstanding notions of sovereignty fall apart when it comes to cyber operations.”⁸⁹ This quote foretells of a complex predicament should neutral nations become the staging grounds for non-state actors launching cyber-attacks in either IACs or NIACs. Of equal importance, the manner in which a State responds to civilians participating in CW from outside the theater of hostilities presents a challenging issue given that such neutral States maintain the inherent right of self-defense pursuant to Article 51 of the U.N. Charter.⁹⁰ For IACs, LOAC provides that belligerent nations are prohibited from actions that harm a neutral nation and draw it into the conflict in any fashion.⁹¹ Conversely, neutral\n⁸⁸ *Id.* at 18.\n⁸⁹ Eric Talbot Jensen, *Sovereignty and Neutrality in Cyber Conflict*, 35 FORDHAM INT’L L.J. 815, 816 (2012) (citing David Perera, *Schmidle: Cyber Ops Might Require New Combatant Command Structure*, FIERCEGOVERNMENTIT (May 15, 2011, 4:29 PM), http://www.fiercegovernmentit.com/story/schmidle-cyber-ops-might-require-newcombatant-command-structure/2011-05-15 (quoting Lieutenant General Robert Schmidle, Deputy Commander of US Cyber Command)).\n⁹⁰ *Id.*; see also UN Charter art. 51.\n⁹¹ Jensen, *supra* note 89, at 819; see also INT’L COMM.

United States*⁹⁴ case, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) supported the proposition that states engaged in non-international conflict enjoy a right of non-interference from outside parties.⁹⁵\nTo illustrate, suppose the non-state actor sponsored 13-year-old hacker launches a cyber-attack against the United States from Switzerland in support of Iran. Notwithstanding the existence of an extradition treaty, Switzerland has had a history of harboring U.S. fugitives.⁹⁶ In this scenario, suppose also that the United States locates and identifies the attacker. If the Swiss preclude this individual from attacking further but refuse to extradite, then the United States would no longer be able to target this individual under the temporal considerations of a LOAC analysis. Alternatively, if the Swiss take no action at all or are unable to prevent harm from occurring, then the United States would find itself in a predicament that theoretically draws a comparison of physical terrorist attacks launched from lawless countries, including (pre-9/11) Afghanistan or Somalia.⁹⁷ Thus, the United States can launch a non-kinetic\nand Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons in Case of War on Land, the 1907 Hague Convention No. XIII concerning the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers in Naval War, the four 1949 Geneva Conventions[,] and Additional Protocol I of 1977.

For example, Article 2(5) of the Charter requires UN Member States to give the UN every assistance in any action it takes, and Article 25 requires UN members to accept and comply with the decisions of the Security Council; the enforcement measures spelled out in Chapter VII can also have an impact, as they are governed by particular rules which differ from those of the law of neutrality.”).\n⁹² Jensen, *supra* note 89, at 819.\n⁹³ Jutta Brunnée, *Sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas*, in *9 MAX PLANCK ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW* 188 (2012); See also Jack Goldsmith, *Thoughts on the Latest Round of Johnson v.

Moreover, the United States can target the 13-year-old kinetically for committing cyber-attacks against its military consistent with the cumulative factors under the Tallinn Manual's view.\nBoth responses would be proffered as an “unwilling or unable” international law argument.⁹⁸ Although scholars support this standard’s incorporation into customary international law, the ICJ rejected it on several occasions and thus, the “unwilling or unable” doctrine remains contentious and unsettled within customary international law (CIL).⁹⁹ Should the United States invoke this standard, as in the case of Afghanistan in 2002, a U.S. response without Switzerland’s permission could result in strong political and military repercussions. Unlike Afghanistan before September 2001, Switzerland is not a lawless State, but still bears the responsibility under the *sic utere* doctrine to prevent international cyber-attacks from occurring within its national borders. In response to a U.S. kinetic or non-kinetic attack against the hacker, the Swiss could bring the issue to the ICJ. Switzerland could also respond militarily or in the cyber domain in self-defense against the United States. Given the permutations involved, this scenario illustrates the several considerations the United States would confront in conducting a counter-attack against a hacker located in a neutral State that refuses to cooperate.\n## B. Law of Targeting Considerations\nIf the United States responds to this hacker in the cyber or physical domain, “targeting law” will certainly apply in both cases. “Targeting law” evaluates whether the weapon’s employment (methodology) would violate the general principles of LOAC.¹⁰⁰ The general principles of LOAC involve military necessity, distinction, proportionality, and humanity.¹⁰¹ For the purposes of kinetic operations using conventional means in the physical domain, targeting law remains well settled. As noted in the Tallinn Manual, these concepts do apply in the cyber domain and will require further examination. “Military necessity may be defined as the principle that justifies the use of all measures needed to defeat the enemy as quickly and efficiently as possible that are not prohibited by the law of war.”¹⁰² Thus, military commanders must act in a manner necessary for advancing military objectives and ensure that their actions\n⁹⁸ Goldsmith, *supra* note 93.\n⁹⁹ *Id.*\n¹⁰⁰ Jeffrey S. Thurnher, *The Law that Applies to Autonomous Weapon Systems*, 17 AM. SOC’Y INT’L L.

See also IAN HENDERSON, THE CONTEMPORARY LAW OF TARGETING 7 (2009).\n2015\nPouring New Wine Into Old Bottles\nare not otherwise prohibited by another principle of LOAC.¹⁰³ As a principle, military necessity not only tolerates violence towards the enemy but alternative operations which influence or impede the enemy (e.g. psychological operations, electronic jamming, intelligence operations).¹⁰⁴ As applied, cyber-attacks may be employed against military objectives provide such actions do not violate the principles of proportionality, humanity, and distinction.\n“Humanity” implies that belligerents should not cause unnecessary suffering. The CCD COE posits that “[m]eans and methods of cyber warfare will only in rare cases violate this Rule.”¹⁰⁵ However, the Tallinn Manual illustrates a possible violation of this rule through hacking into a victim’s pacemaker to stop the target’s heart and then reviving him multiple times before finally killing him.¹⁰⁶ An example could include hacking into pharmaceutical records for the purpose of prescribing medications aimed at causing long-term allergic reactions leading to death. Using a cyber-attack to poison or corrupt a military water supply serves as another example as strictly prohibited as a violation of this LOAC principle. Given the ramifications, U.S. policy would exclude attacking this hacker through means that cause unnecessary suffering.\nAs mentioned earlier, “distinction” requires combatants to distinguish between lawful military targets (opposing combatants and their equipment and facilities) and protected persons (e.g., civilians, medical personnel, chaplains, hors de combat) and property. However, in DPH and DPCH targeting contexts, distinction requires discriminating between civilians who have forfeited protection from those civilians and related objects that retain protection. Thus, if the United States were to conduct a non-kinetic cyber-attack against the 13-year-old hacker via a Swiss server, the United States would need to utilize malware that targets the offending computer only with no adverse effect or corruption of the server or other resident users. Similarly, if the 13-year-old hacker were using a Wi-Fi café in a Swiss hospital, the United States would not be able to attack the hospital’s server given that it is protected. If the United States can transmit a response (e.g., a DDoS attack) through the Wi-Fi café router that only impacts the targeted computer, then distinction would be otherwise satisfied. Similarly, targeting servers for non-kinetic (e.g., DDoS) or kinetic (e.g., Stuxnet-type virus) purposes requires verification of the hacker’s location. Therefore, the United States would need intelligence models on the systems’ architects and servers in order to modify malware to distinguish civilian perpetrators from protected persons.\n¹⁰³ Id. at 52.\n¹⁰⁴ Id. at 53.\n¹⁰⁵ TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 144.\n¹⁰⁶ Id.\nNaval Law Review\nLXIV\nTraditionally, the term civilian objects implied buildings, utilities (e.g., power lines), and related infrastructure. For cyber considerations, civilian objects would include such items as servers, computers, and related hardware. Data is also considered a protected object, especially if the data on a resident server is owned by a protected civilian. As mentioned, the CCD COE specifically chose not exclude data from the ambit of the term “attack.” This is especially true where malware is directed against data that physical objects rely upon for functionality.¹⁰⁷ Thus, a cyber-attack that damages protected civilian data would violate the rules of distinction. While the data’s restoration via a backup could serve as a test for targeting, this is not the test used for physical property since buildings can be rebuilt, and cars can be remanufactured over time. Thus, this issue remains unsettled and a consideration for distinction. As applied, if the Wi-Fi café shares the same servers which contain patients’ records and data, then the intentional damage to such data would violate this principle.\nTargeting law also requires a “proportionality” analysis.¹⁰⁸ The Tallinn Manual restates the requirements for proportionality codified in customary international law and in AP I:\nA cyber[-]attack that may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated is prohibited.¹⁰⁹\nWhile this principle is simply stated, proportionality is entirely subjective given that comparing the value of a military advantage to damage to civilians is tantamount to comparing “apples to oranges.”¹¹⁰ The analysis becomes case-specific, based on the nature of the target and the national thresholds for collateral damage. As applied, if the United States decides to conduct a DDoS attack against the 13-year-old hacker in Switzerland in a hospital Wi-Fi café, then the United States will have to assess the effects of the DDoS attack on that network and whether the resultant collateral damage can be mitigated by modifying the malware.¹¹¹ By comparison, such modifications are consistent with DoD Collateral Damage Estimation Methodologies (CDEM) for\n¹⁰⁷ *Id.* at 108, 113.\n¹⁰⁸ HENDERSON, *supra* note 102, at 7.\n¹⁰⁹ TALLINN MANUAL, *supra* note 5, at 159 (Rule 51).\n¹¹⁰ KENNETH ANDERSON &amp; MATTHEW WAXMAN, LAW AND ETHICS FOR AUTONOMOUS WEAPON SYSTEMS: WHY A BAN WON’T WORK AND HOW THE LAWS OF WAR CAN 12 (2013), available at http://www.hoover.org/publications/monographs/144241.\n¹¹¹ TALLINN MANUAL, *supra* note 5, at 113.\n2015\nPouring New Wine Into Old Bottles\nconventional weapons so as to avoid malware collaterally spreading or damaging other users, data, or networks.¹¹² An analysis of the Stuxnet malware revealed fail-safe features such as code that limited the infection to Siemens systems, the number of devices that each infected device could infect, and the self-destruct code erasing the virus on June 24, 2012.¹¹³ Regardless of the overall effectiveness of the fail-safe measures, they illustrate “the inherent caution” of Stuxnet’s creators as an attempt to prevent further damage to other systems.¹¹⁴ Nations attempting to develop more sophisticated cyber weapons will need to consider proportionality issues and collateral damage.\n## VI. Practical Responses to Civilians who Directly Participate\nDespite challenges associated with cyber-warfare, States have a right of self-defense against civilians who conduct cyber-attacks during an armed conflict setting. While political and diplomatic measures remain available, the foregoing discussion provides an understanding of the nature of each response to a DPCH scenario assuming the offending civilian is located and attributed to the action. For the purposes of this framework, the U.S.-Iran armed conflict scenario discussed earlier will be utilized again.\n## A. Non-kinetic Responses\nNon-kinetic response can be acknowledged or covert as discussed below. Cyber defenses, for example, can be employed to have a non-kinetic effect depending upon their intended effect and usage. If a hacker attempts to gain access into an otherwise prohibited system, the host system can utilize a defense that can essentially block such access with no further effect. More active cyber defenses include tracking hackers’ computers, hacking back into systems to retrieve data, shutting down systems, sabotaging data, infecting the attacker with malware, taking over the attacker’s botnet, or employing a botnet to track or attack the hacker’s computer.¹¹⁵ While active defense responses to DPCH seem plausible, LOAC principles must be taken into consideration. For instance, if a DoD system conducts an active defense hack-back or counter-attack using\n¹¹² CDEM assesses the likelihood of collateral damage for conventional weapons based on several factors, such as types of weapons, employment tactics, proximity of civilian structures. See generally Major Jefferson D. Reynolds, *Collateral Damage on the 21st Century Battlefield: Enemy Exploitation of the Law of Armed Conflict, and the Struggle for a Moral High Ground*, 56 A.F. L. REV. 1 (2005).\n¹¹³ Michael J. Gross, *Stuxnet Worm: A Declaration of Cyber-War*, VANITY FAIR (Apr. 2011), http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2011/04/stuxnet-201104.\n¹¹⁴ *Id.*\n¹¹⁵ Jody Westby, *Caution: Active Response to Cyber Attacks Has High Risk*, FORBES (Nov. 29, 2012, 10:52 AM), http://www.forbes.com/sites/jodywestby/2012/11/29/caution-active-response-to-cyber-attacks-has-high-risk/.\n106\nNaval Law Review\nLXIV\nmalware, such programs must be capable of limited or no effects on innocent users or servers. A more interesting question is how such systems can distinguish between a criminal hacker and a LOAC hacker. At a minimum, in both cases, employing an active defense capable of preserving evidence and intelligence related to this hacker and operation will be critical for potential prosecution or follow-on responses.¹¹⁶ Offensive cyber capabilities with non-kinetic effects would employ similar effects described for active defenses. The distinction is that offensive capabilities would not necessarily occur as an automatic response from a computer, but rather a directed operation.\n## B. Kinetic Responses\nResponding to a cyber-attack kinetically raises questions regarding escalation. A response can take on two forms: a conventional attack (e.g., a missile) or a cyber-attack with physical effects (e.g., Stuxnet). Due to political and diplomatic considerations, use of force by the United States will require nothing short of Presidential authorization. In the instance of international armed conflict, the legal framework for employing a kinetic attack against a designated hostile force or individual (e.g., via AUMF or “targeted killing”) is well settled.¹¹⁷ A cyber-attack with kinetic effects directed against designated hostile forces in a theater of combat is legally supportable. Similarly, the targeted killing of a U.S. terrorist in self-defense is also considered consistent with U.S. domestic law, whether conducted with a drone strike or a kinetic cyber-attack. As scholar Hays Parks notes, the targeted killing of a legitimate enemy is not assassination.¹¹⁸ If a civilian forfeits protection due to DPCH attacks or serves as a cyber-terrorist causing physical harm to U.S. civilians, he or she can be lawfully targeted with a kinetic attack. With this understanding, there will be some additional considerations.\nIf the 13-year-old hacker is in Iran during the U.S.-Iranian conflict, the United States could escalate to kinetic force against the child no differently from an insurgent planting IEDs or shooting at a military convoy. On the other hand, kinetic operations during a cyber-only conflict expand the range of options available to the hostile nation for targeting a civilian cyber-attacker within its borders.¹¹⁹ In other words, Iran would be able to escalate to kinetic force in self-defense. Thus, in a cyber-only conflict, targeting this hacker kinetically may\n¹¹⁶ *Id.*\n¹¹⁷ *US to Outline Legal Backing for ‘Targeted Kill’ Programme*, THE GUARDIAN (Mar. 1, 2012, 2:58 AM), http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/05/us-legal-backing-targeted-kill-programme.\n¹¹⁸ W.

Q. 46, 65 (2012).\n2015\nPouring New Wine Into Old Bottles\nundoubtedly escalate the conflict and requires political considerations. These considerations are heightened if kinetic force is applied to or within neutral nations as mentioned in Part IV. A kinetic response to a cyber-attack will require a case-by-case analysis of the nature of the cyber-attack’s operation, intended target(s), and underlying strategic significance.¹²⁰ At a minimum, kinetic action, whether conducted through conventional or cyber-attacks, should be limited in scope and duration, consistent with self-defense proportionality principles, in order to avert an unnecessary escalation.\n## C. Covert Action\nIn most cases, the benefit of acknowledged non-kinetic or kinetic cyber-attacks against a neutral nation will be significantly outweighed by the diplomatic, economic, and military backlashes that would occur. Such acts would undoubtedly be perceived as an act of aggression by the United Nations, as interpreted by the ICJ.¹²¹ For these reasons, covert action represents a readily available solution while CIL develops in this area. Responding to non-state actors performing cyber-attacks from neutral states presents complex issues given the potential of affronting neutrality and widening the conflict. The stealthy nature of cyber warfare enables covert action as use of the cyber domain enables anonymity, takes advantage of targeted individuals’ awareness, and utilizes speed that overcomes the ability to readily safeguard against the consequences.¹²² Returning to the earlier scenario involving the child hacker located in Switzerland, the United States could consider covert action to thwart this non-state actor. This scenario presumes that Switzerland is uncooperative in extraditing or precluding this child from committing cyber-attacks against the United States.\nFirst, the United States could consider a targeted killing operation against this individual within Swiss borders. The targeting of this child for DPCH in support of Iran would not be considered an assassination as prohibited by Executive Order 12333.¹²³ Under U.S. domestic law, an Authorization to Use Military Force will be required to authorize targeted killings. This requirement was illustrated in the U.S. campaign against al-Qaeda. Assuming the U.S.-Iranian conflict contains an AUMF, language should be included to at least authorize the killing of supporting parties for DPCH, regardless of location. This\n¹²⁰ *Id.* at 61.\n¹²¹ See generally UN Charter, arts. 2(4), 51; see also Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicar. v. U.S.), 1986 I.C.J. 14, 181 (June 27) (separate opinion of Judge Ago); Jensen, *supra* note 89, at 821.\n¹²² Ellyne Phneah, *Cyber Warfare Not Theoretical, Can Actually Kill*, ZDNET (Nov. 17, 2011, 5:26 AM), http://www.zdnet.com/cyber-warfare-not-theoretical-can-actually-kill-2062302921/.\n¹²³ Parks, *supra* note 118.\nNaval Law Review\nLXIV\nproposition would provide legal credibility since Executive Order 12333 prohibits the unlawful, politically-motivated killing of a person who is not a legitimate target. Alternatively, even if an AUMF does not have broader language, a covert targeted killing would still be lawful if it can be established that the killing was required in self-defense consistent with Article 51 of the UN Charter. To prevent attribution of such killing within Swiss borders, the United States could use military means, such as Special Forces operations analogous to those employed during the Osama bin Laden raid.\nSecond, covert action could also be conducted for rendition of the child to prosecute him in the United States. The practice of rendition (also referred to as irregular rendition) is typically defined as the kidnapping or taking of an individual to move that person to the jurisdiction of another country.[124] This is distinguished from extraordinary rendition which involves transferring the individual to a foreign country for the purposes of detention and interrogation by a foreign government.[125] Rendition does not deprive U.S. courts of jurisdiction unless an applicable extradition treaty explicitly calls for that result and that treaty has been given legislative effect within U.S. domestic law.[126] Since the U.S.-Swiss extradition treaty contains no rendition language, the United States would not be barred from exercising jurisdiction and prosecuting this individual.[127] A covert action for rendition would resemble a raid using either special operations or U.S. law enforcement.\nFinally, covert action could be carried out against this individual via cyber means. A cyber-attack could have a non-kinetic or kinetic impact, as discussed earlier, and would be a more tenable solution if the originator of the attack were unknown. A covert operation employing cyber capabilities would require a complex number of variables beyond the scope of this article. Needless to say, such an operation would involve understanding the location of the child, a breakdown of the child's activities (pattern of life), an understanding of the targeted system's architecture, and other variables. A covert, non-kinetic cyberattack could be aimed at locating, tracking, and denying access to the 13-year-old hacker via the child's computer or home internet service provider. This kind of non-kinetic operation could be aimed at developing further intelligence on the child's activities for further planning should the child continue his or her attacks.\n124 BARRY E.

Malware could be used to destroy the child’s data or to render the child’s computer unusable. On the other hand, if the desired effect is to kill the 13-year-old hacker, then a more elaborate cyber-attack would be required. Should the child need a pacemaker or medical assistance, a potential attack would include using malware or other cyber technique to kill the hacker, provided that the prohibition against unnecessary suffering was enforced. “CyberJacking,” the act of remotely taking control of someone’s vehicle, could be used as cyber means of a targeted killing.¹²⁸ In this past summer’s BlackHat conference, two researchers demonstrated how they could control a car using their laptop while within the car.¹²⁹ Such capabilities could easily be weaponized to target this 13-year-old hacker, assuming that the killing of the civilian driver or other occupants as collateral damage would be proportionally acceptable under the circumstances.\n## VII. Conclusion\nIn summary, DPCH will remain an ongoing concern in the coming years given the lack of an international consensus on the basic legal principles governing hostilities in the cyber domain. At a minimum, the Tallinn Manual’s DPCH framework provides clear guidance derived from IHL that will enable states to respond to civilian hackers who undertake hostilities in armed conflict while seeking to prevent collateral damage. While developing a cyber-hostilities treaty appears as a readily available solution, the sharp disagreement among states (e.g., the United States, Great Britain, France, China, Russia) on the basic principle of regulating the cyber domain makes such treaty a fleeting prospect. Nevertheless, states always retain the inherent authority of self-defense, regardless of the lack of international consensus concerning cyber hostilities. Thus, IHL provides an immediate legal framework for cyber operations. Over time, these practices will refine and crystalize into customary international law through State practice and opinio juris. Although international consensus seems unattainable, regional or organization practices such as the NATO effort in the Tallinn Manual support the development of CIL in those regions. While the cyber domain requires an analysis of the nature of hostilities, the principles of IHL govern the conduct of these hostilities in order to safeguard against collateral damage while preserving a state’s right of self-defense.\n¹²⁸ Scott Schweitzer, *CyberJacking, Sophisticated Assassination*, CYBER WEAPONS &amp; WARFARE (Oct. 6, 2013, 8:55 AM), http://cyberweapons.blogspot.com/.\n¹²⁹ *Id.* The BlackHat conference is a yearly event where thousands of security experts gather to discuss information security and expose vulnerabilities at the pertaining to computers, networks and other related digital media.

Advancements in technology and the advent of the internet have created new issues that current bodies of law do not directly reference or address. Traditional notions of armed attack and invasion, which were transparent over the course of the twentieth century, are now reconsidered in light of cyber domain. Given an “inability to live at peace,” humanity has already developed and employed weapons vis-à-vis the cyber domain as illustrated through the Stuxnet incident. Through Stuxnet, humanity has demonstrated that computer-originated attacks can result in kinetic effects. Equally concerning, the cyber domain has created a new battlefield where traditional understandings of “combatants” require reexamination.

With the possibility of this trend, governments will need to develop a legal framework for responding to civilians who directly participate in cyber hostilities.\nIn physical warfare settings, the principle of distinction requires belligerents to differentiate between combatants and civilians under the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC). Under LOAC, civilians enjoy protection from being the direct target of armed attack. The notion of Direct Participation in Hostilities (DPH) provides that a civilian loses this protection for undertaking combat operations against military forces in an armed conflict. This concept became relevant in the U.S. campaigns in Iraq, Afghanistan, the Global War on Terror, and other overseas contingency operations. In these conflicts, U.S. forces confronted the problem by positively identifying and engaging a civilian determined to be directly participating in hostilities. Combining the complexity of DPH with the cyber domain presents a conundrum because, unlike traditional warfare, civilians who can directly participate in cyber hostilities need not be physically located within the theater of hostilities. A hacker who undertakes hostilities can attack from any location in the world with a laptop and internet access. Therefore, the issue of direct participation in cyber hostilities (DPCH) has many factors that will require analysis in order to develop a legal framework for response.\nThis article stands for the proposition that a civilian who directly participates in hostilities in the cyber domain forfeits protection and becomes a lawful target. In support, this article will first highlight the background and law applicable to DPCH in general. In particular, this article will discuss the factors that render a civilian targetable by analyzing the traditional framework of DPH as applied through the Tallinn Manual. This discussion will include an understanding of what constitutes an “attack” and provide examples of which hostile roles render civilians targetable. Next, this article will discuss some of the challenges that leaders will confront in responding to issues involving DPCH. These issues include sovereignty and “targeting law” under LOAC. However, this article will provide a framework that contemplates non-kinetic, kinetic, and covert action.\n Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of August 12, 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts art. 51(3), adopted June 8, 1977, 1125 U.N.T.S. 3 [hereinafter Additional Protocol I]; Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts art. 13(3), adopted June 8, 1977, 1125 U.N.T.S. 609 [hereinafter Additional Protocol II].\n TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE (Michael N. Schmitt ed., 2013) [hereinafter TALLINN MANUAL].\n\nPouring New Wine Into Old Bottles\n## II. Background: Direct Participation in Hostilities, Cyber Warfare, and the Law\nCurrently, there is no clear international consensus on many cyber warfare (CW) issues, least of all DPCH. Moreover, customary international law (State practice and opinio juris) has not developed or crystallized as found in other areas of International Humanitarian Law (IHL). The ability to detect and defend against such attacks, whether State-sponsored or not, has become exceedingly difficult given the speed and regularity of occurrences within the cyber domain generally. On the subject of \"imminence\" alone, U.S. Government officials struggle to develop policy that applies traditional concepts to determine whether a strike in self-defense is justified or is preventative war and thus prohibited as an unprovoked act of aggression. Furthermore, unlike traditional combat, IHL applicability to CW has not been tested before the International Court of Justice (ICJ). Therefore, CW does not cleanly fit into the hostilities paradigm for which LOAC was created. It is analogous to pouring a new wine into an old bottle.\nNevertheless, IHL will serve as a baseline to regulate the conduct of CW until greater international consensus is reached. The fact that IHL does not specifically reference cyber operations does not imply that such operations are not subject to IHL, especially given the possibilities of physical harm caused by CW.[11] Thus, as an international cyber warfare legal framework does not currently exist, the applied \"law\" is national policy interpreting and incorporating IHL as a foundation. Given the Frankenstein-like nature of this framework and uncertainties associated with cyber weapons, many national policies will not be readily transparent.[12] For example, many of the U.S. authorities and policies applicable to CW remain classified and withheld at the\n[^6]: Jean-Marie Henckaerts, *Study on Customary International Humanitarian Law: A Contribution to the Understanding and Respect For the Rule of Law in Armed Conflict*, 87 INT'L REV.

At a minimum, the United States has acknowledged IHL’s applicability to CW. Moreover, U.S. policy runs parallel with the experts who authored the Tallinn Manual from NATO’s Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCD COE), who argue that traditional notions of IHL apply to CW. Therefore, this article will analyze DPCH through IHL and the Tallinn Manual as a developmental framework.\nWithin IHL, the principle of distinction between combatants and civilians serves as the starting point for DPCH. While principally derived from customary international law and the 1907 Hague Convention, contemporary notions of distinction are codified in Article 48 of Additional Protocol I (AP I) to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, which provides: “In order to ensure respect for and protection of the civilian population and civilian objects, the Parties to the conflict shall at all times distinguish between the civilian population and combatants and between civilian objects and military objectives and accordingly shall direct their operations only against military objectives.” Thus, civilians enjoy protection from an armed attack as a generally accepted principle under IHL. Under the principle of distinction, parties to a conflict are required to distinguish between the civilian population and objects, and from otherwise lawful targets (e.g., military combatants). The United States and CCD COE acknowledged this requirement of distinction is required in CW.\nThe notion of DPH, derived from Article 51(3) of AP I, provides that civilians shall enjoy protection from armed attack “unless and for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities” for international armed conflicts (IAC). The notion is virtually identical for non-international armed conflicts (NIAC) as\n *Id.*\n Harold H. Koh, *International Law in Cyberspace*, 54 HARV. INT’L.

Thus, civilians who directly participate in hostilities forfeit their protections and can be lawfully targeted. While civilians are subject to lawful targeting while taking direct part in hostilities, they are only lawful targets “for such time as” or while they actually commit hostile acts directly producing harmful effects to an enemy. This preceding language providing for a temporal requirement remains controversial. Institutions such as the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) interpret this section very restrictively to mean that such civilians can only be targeted until he or she has returned to the pre-deployment location. Thus, if a civilian conducts repeated attacks, that civilian will regain protection upon return from each engagement. This remains highly debated among scholars and the ICRC. Other scholars take a broader view, allowing for targeting of a civilian long after he or she has lost protection. For the purposes of cyber-conflict, the CCD COE agreed that the temporal requirement would at least include actions immediately preceding or subsequent to the qualifying act. However, the CCD COE experts were split on the time between repeated attacks. Thus, this issue is unresolved in both physical and cyber domains and will become a policy decision vis-à-vis rules of engagement or operational orders. This article will assume a broad view allowing for targeting in between attacks.\n## III. The Cumulative Factors of DPCH\nWhile the ICRC has not published similar comprehensive guidance on DPCH or CW, the ICRC’s DPH guidance remains helpful as discussed infra. Moreover, the ICRC contributed to the development of the Tallinn Manual and generally agrees with the rules developed with some exceptions. In particular, many of the notions for resolving DPCH issues are derived from the ICRC’s interpretive guidance on DPH. Thus, the Tallinn Manual remains the most comprehensive work that serves as DPCH guidance within the framework of IHL. Rule 35 of the Tallinn Manual provides that an act of direct participation in hostilities by civilians renders them liable to be attacked, by cyber or other\n\nNaval Law Review\nLXIV\nlawful means. Similar to AP I and AP II, Rule 35 describes that civilians are targetable “for such time as he or she is engaged in the qualifying act of direct participation.” Rule 35 sets forth the three cumulative criteria (threshold of harm, direct causation, and belligerent nexus) for qualification of an act as direct participation in cyber hostilities that are derived from the ICRC interpretive guidance. This rule also provides discussion regarding specific nuances within each of the three factors require case-by-case consideration in order for a civilian to be targeted for losing protection as a result of DPCH.\n## A. Understanding an Attack: Threshold of Harm\nPer Article 49(1) of AP I, “attacks” are acts of violence against the adversary, whether in offense or in defense. To illustrate, military convoys in Iraq or Afghanistan would be able to target, in self-defense, a roadside Improvised Explosive Device (IED) bomber or sniper for engaging in a hostile act amounting to an attack. On the other hand, a civilian who simply stands in the middle of the road holding up a sign in protest does not qualify as an attack. Targeting this protestor would be prohibited under IHL unless that civilian committed or attempt to commit an act that amounts to direct participation. By analogy, the aforementioned Stuxnet worm would clearly illustrate a kinetic attack given the resultant physical damage to Iranian centrifuges. Conversely, the same conclusion would not easily be reached for “hacktivists,” who protest by spamming computer networks with protest e-mails. Therefore, to understand the definition of “cyber-attack,” an analysis of the “threshold of harm” associated with it is required. Factors involved in this analysis include: “the context of the event, the actor perpetrating the action (recognizing\n TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 118.\n Id.\n Id.\n Id. at 119-121.\n Additional Protocol I, supra note 4, art. 49(1); see also TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 106. (“[I]t is the use of violence against a target that distinguishes attacks from other military operations. Non-violent operations, such as psychological cyber operations or cyber espionage, do not qualify as attacks. ‘Acts of violence’ should not be understood as limited to activities that release kinetic force. . . . In this regard, note that chemical, biological, or radiological attacks do not usually have a kinetic effect on their designated target, but it is universally agreed that they constitute attacks as a matter of law.”)\n\n Hacktivism is defined as the use of computer hacking to help advance political or social causes. See Mark Manion &amp; Abby Goodrum, Terrorism or Civil Disobedience: Toward a Hacktivist Ethic, 30 COMPUTERS &amp; SOC’Y 14 (2000).\n\nchallenging issues of attribution in cyberspace), the target and location, [and] effects and intent, among other possible issues.”\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) defines “cyber-attack” as:\nA hostile act using computer or related networks or systems, and intended to disrupt and/or destroy an adversary’s critical cyber systems, assets, or functions. The intended effects of cyber-attack are not necessarily limited to the targeted computer systems or data themselves—for instance, attacks on computer systems which are intended to degrade or destroy infrastructure or [command and control] capability. A cyber-attack may use intermediate delivery vehicles including peripheral devices, electronic transmitters, embedded code, or human operators. The activation or effect of a cyber-attack may be widely separated temporally and geographically from the delivery.\nThe U.S. definition provides some inference that a cyber-attack need not physically destroy systems to qualify as an attack. Rather, disruption of these systems will suffice as meeting a threshold of harm.\nBy comparison, the ICRC’s DPH guidance provides some level of amplification on this point, despite not directly speaking about DPCH or CW specifically. The ICRC indicates that the threshold of harm for DPH is satisfied when the civilian’s actions adversely affect military operations or the military capacity of a party to the conflict. The ICRC states that the denial of an adversary’s military use of certain objects, equipment, and territory would reach the required threshold of harm. The ICRC specifically notes that the electronic interference with military computer networks would fall into this category of denial, whether accomplished through computer network attacks (CNA) or computer network exploitation (CNE). As cybersecurity strategist Joshua\n Koh, supra note 14, at 4; see also Schmitt, supra note 14, at 19.\n Memorandum from Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to Chiefs of the Military Services et al., subject: Joint Terminology for Cyberspace Operations (Nov. 2010) [hereinafter “Joint Terminology for Cyberspace Operations”].\n Id.\n ICRC DPH GUIDANCE, supra note 23, at 48.\n Id.\n Id. at 48. CNA is defined as a “category of fires employed for offensive purposes in which actions are taken through the use of computer networks to disrupt, deny, degrade, manipulate, or destroy information resident in the target system or computer networks, or the systems/networks themselves.”; CNE is defined as “[e]nabling operations and intelligence collection capabilities conducted through the use of computer networks to gather data about target or adversary automated\n\nLXIV\nCorman notes, a cyber-attack is essentially no different from electronic warfare where an adversary denies military use of equipment through jamming or interfering with a network. Thus, a civilian who engages in actions tantamount to interference with military communications or operations through CNA (e.g., a Denial of Service operation) or CNE would constitute a DPCH attack in ICRC’s view.\nThe Tallinn Manual thus incorporates the ICRC’s notion by stating that:\n[T]he act (or a closely related series of acts) must have the intended or actual effect of negatively affecting the adversary’s military operations or capabilities, or inflicting death, physical harm, or material destruction on persons or objects protected against direct attack (threshold of harm).\nThe CCD COE experts provide that a cyber-attack that satisfies the “threshold of harm” is an operation that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects. The CCD COE was very specific that this “limitation should not be understood as excluding cyber operations against data (which are non-physical entities) from the ambit of the term attack.” This is especially true if an operation against data upon which the functionality of physical objects relies can sometimes constitute an attack.\nHowever, for the purposes of DPCH against military adversaries, the CCD COE clarifies that there is no requirement for physical damage to objects or harm to individuals so long as a cyber-attack negatively affects enemy military operations. For example, a cyber-attack that disrupts the operation of the military’s command and control network would satisfy the criterion. Disruption in this context does not mean physical damage to servers, data, or computers. Rather, it simply implies interference, no different from radio or radar jamming. This proposition is consistent with the ICRC’s view under DPH. Stated negatively, if these actions were not directed at an adversary’s military capability, the ICRC requires that the “specific act must be likely to cause at\ninformation systems or networks.” See Joint Terminology for Cyberspace Operations, supra note 37, at 3-4.\n Skype Interview with cybersecurity strategist Joshua Corman, Chief Technology Officer at Sonatype (Sept. 23, 2013) (video recordation on file with author).\n TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 119.\n Id. at 107.\n Id. at 107–08.\n Id. at 119.\n Id.\n Id.\n\nPouring New Wine Into Old Bottles\nleast death, injury, or destruction” of property in order to reach this threshold of harm. Thus, the ICRC’s notion as applied to CW means that a civilian hacker interfering with a civilian computer system (e.g., Social Security), instead of the military, would not necessarily lose protection for that purpose unless it can be demonstrated that either the cyber-attack against the non-military network was intended to have an effect on the military in some fashion or that physical harm would otherwise result.\nAs an aside, this notion of physical harm to a non-military network need not be defined in the physical destruction associated with a kinetic strike. An emerging trend is to define physical harm in the cyber domain as the level of effect on the functionality of the targeted object. Some experts argue that if a cyber-attack impairs the functionality such that physical components require replacement, then this would constitute damage as envisaged in the concept of attack. Other experts provide that physical component replacement is not required; loss of functionality through data corruption requiring software reinstallation or network rebooting would constitute “physical damage.” While the physical damage standard is not required for military networks, understanding this disparity is important if cyber-attacks against non-military networks occur as part of greater campaign during an armed conflict.\n## B. Direct Causation\nThe ICRC guidance provides that there must be a direct causation from the civilian act to the harm suffered for the act to potentially constitute DPH. In particular, the ICRC states: “there must be a direct causal link between a specific act and the harm likely to result either from that act, or from a coordinated military operation of which that act constitutes an integral part.” In terms of a physical context, this implies that the harm suffered cannot be the result of an indirect or secondary order effect. The Tallinn Manual aligns with the ICRC’s DPH analysis by requiring the existence of “a direct causal link between the act in question and the harm intended or inflicted.” In CW, this standard appears easier to fulfill than in the physical combat scenario, where “fog of war” tends to complicate the issue. By analogy, if a civilian farmer fires his weapon at another local national to ward off livestock poaching, the sound of gunfire or the physical impact of a bullet may incite a nearby military patrol to\n ICRC DPH GUIDANCE, supra note 23, at 49.\n Droege, supra note 11, at 557–58.\n TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 108.\n Id. at 109.\n ICRC DPH GUIDANCE, supra note 23, at 50–51.\n Id. at 51.\n TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 119.\nNaval Law Review\nLXIV\nengage in self-defense. In some instances, mere possession and public display of personal weapons, could be perceived as a threat without additional accompanying acts.\nOn the other hand, CW will not suffer from the same “fog of war” issue. The use of a cyber-weapon to deny a military’s capability or interfere with a military operation can hardly be seen as incidental or an indirect cause. The Tallinn Manual supports this point through the example of disruption to the enemy’s command and control as being directly caused by a cyber-attack. Therefore, if a civilian hacker gained access into a military network to exploit or disrupt the network, that civilian’s acts would be the direct cause of the harm suffered, rendering him or her targetable. As a counterpoint, this theory should not discount the possibility of accidental cyber-attacks by civilian entities or individuals. There are potential scenarios where technology companies or independent contractors could theoretically accidentally release malware onto a network. However, the Tallinn Manual and ICRC guidance on direct causation does not address the underlying intentions behind the action. Thus, the challenge with these scenarios is that they reinforce the notion of reasonable precautions within IHL (i.e., the obligation to take reasonable precautions to avoid or minimize incidental civilian losses). Therefore, while fog of war is relatively diminished, prior to responding to a cyber-attack premised upon DPCH, reasonable precautions (e.g., reviewing human, electronic, and signals intelligence; verifying the source of the attack; using the least destructive means available to neutralize the threat) should be taken to minimize potentially attacking an otherwise innocent party.\n## C. Belligerent Nexus\nThe ICRC DPH guidance provides that:\nIn order to meet the requirement of belligerent nexus, an act must be specifically designed to directly cause the required threshold of harm in support of a party to the conflict and to the detriment of another.\n Id. at 119–20.\n Id. at 120.\n Additional Protocol I, supra note 4, art. 57(1); see also Customary IHL—Rule 15. Precautions in Attack, INT’L COMM. OF THE RED CROSS, http://www.icrc.org/customary-ibl/eng/docs/v1_cha_chapter5_rule15 (last visited July 30, 2014) (suggesting that Article 13(1) of Additional Protocol II implies this obligation); TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 164–65.\n See generally TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 159–176 (Rules 51–58).\n ICRC DPH GUIDANCE, supra note 23, at 58.\n\nHostile acts such as firing a weapon at an enemy or planting a bomb serve as easy examples. As a qualifying statement, the ICRC notes that acts that do not satisfy the threshold of harm are “non-belligerent . . . and, therefore, must be addressed through law enforcement measures.” 61 A seminal example is the IED maker whose actions contribute to hostilities without necessarily being connected to the conflict. In this example, if the intelligence shows that the IED maker is developing and supplying bombs for the insurgents as a part of an ongoing campaign, then he/she is targetable. This analysis will change if he/she is just selling them to the insurgents. The ICRC also provides that the belligerent nexus element does not require a subjective intent determination, where the state of mind of the person is at issue in committing the act.62 The ICRC posits that a belligerent nexus requires an objective standard expressed in the design of the act or operation which does not depend on the mindset of every participating individual.63 Belligerent nexus is generally not influenced by factors such as personal distress or preferences, or by the mental ability or willingness of persons to assume responsibility for their conduct. Consequently, if an insurgent is forced or coerced in some manner to commit an attack, he/she would still be lawfully targetable under IHL.\nAs applied, the Tallinn Manual expounds on the ICRC’s belligerent nexus notion by stating that cyber acts must be directly related to the hostilities between parties to a conflict.64 By example, if a civilian directs a cyber-attack against a military’s command and control node, his or her actions would satisfy this condition as it impacts a military force to the benefit of the opposition. Equally, if a hacker were coerced to commit this cyber-attack, he or she would lose protection and become lawfully targetable. The Tallinn Manual’s criterion rules out acts of a purely criminal or private nature that occur during an armed conflict.65 For example, hackers, using cyber means to commit a variety of crimes against non-military institutions, would not be targetable even if the victim State were a party to the conflict.66 However, if the criminal actions were conducted to support particular military operations of one party and to the detriment of the military opposition, then the civilian would forfeit protection for DPCH.\n\nLXIV\n## IV. As Applied: Which Civilians are Targetable?\nGiven these cumulative factors, consideration should be given as to the categories of civilians who become lawful targets under DPCH. Up front, government-employed or -contracted computer technicians and related personnel would not be targetable under Geneva Convention III (GC III) as “persons who accompany the armed forces without actually being members thereof,” provided they fulfill more support roles and do not directly participate in hostilities.67 On the other hand, if government contracted personnel were to engage in cyber hostilities, they would lose protection analogous to mercenaries.68 Similarly, civilians who serve a continuous combat function in an organized armed group during an IAC or NIAC are targetable.69 At a minimum, the Tallinn Manual’s guidance provides that members of organized armed groups, whether as levée en masse or not, who directly participate in hostilities, are targetable.70 Such civilians will remain targetable throughout the conflict, including the temporal breaks in between or after attacks mentioned supra. However, the CCD COE experts remain divided over this issue. Some experts argue that a civilian who is simply a member of the group is targetable regardless of their nature, no differently from members of a uniformed armed force (with exception for protected clergy and medical personnel); others follow the ICRC DPH guidance requirement of a “continuous combat function.” Thus, a cook or administrative clerk for a non-state cyber-combat organization would not be targetable under the ICRC standard. This issue remains unresolved in the physical domain and will be resolved through policy or rules of engagement (ROE) decisions by leaders on a fact-specific basis. Nevertheless, civilians will be more readily targetable if they are part of a hostile group actively partaking in the armed conflict.\nNotwithstanding these preliminary categories, identifying a civilian directly participating in cyber hostilities will be fact-specific and require a case-by-case analysis consistent with the principles discussed in Part III. Using these cumulative factors, the examples below illustrate the Tallinn Manual’s principles applied to unaffiliated civilians who directly participate in cyber hostilities. While not exhaustive, these examples serve as possible permutations for illustrating DPCH analysis via the Tallinn Manual and the ICRC’s DPH guidance.\n\n## A. Example One: The Case of the 13-year-old Thrill Seeker\nCivilians who are not parties to an IAC or NIAC may be lawfully targeted where they directly participate in cyber hostilities. Consider the hypothetical situation where, during an IAC between the U.S. and Iran, a 13-year-old child is armed with a laptop and malware. In this scenario, this hacker perpetrates a cyber-attack from Switzerland that is designed to disrupt a U.S. military logistics system related to moving of supplies and personnel for the purposes of disrupting (but not physically damaging) processes. This is especially conceivable given the inexpensive nature of developing or acquiring malicious code.[72] Just recently a 12-year-old pled guilty to charges in Canada for hacking government systems in support of the international network of hacktivists known as Anonymous.[73]\nOnce this hypothetical 13-year-old child conducts a cyber-attack by transmitting malware into this U.S. military logistics system, the child has clearly forfeited protection and is targetable for the following reasons: first, this act qualifies as an attack given that it meets the threshold of harm by disrupting military operations, where physical harm is not required;[74] secondly, the child's act of launching the malware directly causes the subsequent disruption (or attempted disruption);[75] lastly, the child's act satisfies the belligerent nexus element because the hostile act is directed against the U.S. military network and objectively benefits Iran.[76] Thus, the 13-year-old hacker is a lawful military target under a DPCH theory consistent with the ICRC and Tallinn Manual. Assuming the child only gained access to the network to exploit information by posting it to the internet, the child would still be targetable because such an act would exploit a vulnerability to the benefit of Iran. Conversely, if the child's actions were directed at a U.S. banking network, then the child's actions would be considered a criminal matter, unless the intelligence demonstrates that the child's actions were connected to the exploitation of U.S. infrastructure vulnerabilities in support of Iran's military campaign.\n[71] Emily Crawford, *Virtual Battlegrounds: Direct Participation in Cyber Warfare*, 9 ISJLP 1, 15 (2013), available at http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/students/groups/is/files/2013/08/5-Crawford.pdf.\n[72] Daniel Cohen &amp; Aviv Rotbart, *The Use of Code Mutation to Produce Multi-use Cyber Weapons*, THE INSTITUTE FOR NATIONAL SECURITY STUDIES (Jul. 8, 2013), http://www.inss.org.il/index.aspx?id=4538&amp;articleid=5163.\n[73] Lisa Vaas, *12-year-old Canadian Boy Admits to Hacking Police and Government Sites for Anonymous*, NAKED SECURITY (Oct. 26, 2013), http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2013/10/26/12-year-old-canadian-boy-admits-to-hacking-police-and-government-sites-for-anonymous; David Kushner, *The Masked Avengers, How Anonymous Incited Online Vigilantism from Tunisia to Ferguson*, THE NEW YORKER (SEP. 8, 2014), http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/09/08/masked-avengers.\n[74] TALLINN MANUAL, *supra* note 5, at 119.\n[75] Turns, *supra* note 8, at 295.\n[76] *Id.*\n\nLXIV\n## B. Example Two: Hacktivist\nPatriotic hacktivism adds a different dimension to DPCH given that their activities may or may not cross the threshold of harm or have a nexus to the conflict. Russian hacktivists participated in a myriad of activities in Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in 2008. Similar to the above example, a hacktivist, who disrupts military networks through distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, is targetable regardless of his or her subjective underlying intent. However, the analysis will change depending on whether their activities disrupt military operations. Suppose during this U.S.-Iranian conflict, a hacktivist from Anonymous decides to deploy a conspicuous message on a high-traffic, non-DoD, U.S. Government website as a form of cyber-protest of the war. While criminal, these actions will not constitute DPCH if the hacker's actions do not have a belligerent nexus to the conflict, directly cause disruption to military operations, or cause physical harm. This scenario would be true if the hacktivist's actions were targeted against the Affordable Care Act or Department of Justice websites.\nOn a sliding scale, the analysis changes if the hacker leaves a conspicuous message on a DoD information website as a form of \"cyber-protest\" of the war. An analysis of those actions is required to determine if the message interferes or disrupts military operations in order to satisfy the belligerent nexus requirement (supporting Iran). For example, if it could be determined that the message was designed to undermine the morale of DoD users fighting the war or interfere with military members' readiness (e.g., disrupting military members' pay on the Defense Finance and Accounting Service website), the hacktivist is clearly targetable under LOAC. However, if a hacktivist's message or action cannot be readily connected to the conflict, he or she is still \"at risk of being targeted, as their attacks would be difficult to differentiate from attacks being conducted by persons with a connection to the hostilities.\"\n## C. Example Three: Malware Programmer\nOther roles, such as a malware programmer, are more complex to analyze for DPCH purposes because of the question of direct causation, no different from a weapons builder. Returning to the example of the U.S.-Iran conflict, a cyber-weapons programmer could have played a role in developing\n Id. at 293.\n Id. at 293, n.59.\n TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 119–20.\n Crawford, supra note 71, at 17.\n Id. at 16; see Turns, supra note 8, at 295.\n\nand providing the malware to the 13-year-old hacker. Whether the programmer is targetable depends on the nature of his or her involvement in supporting the hacker. According to the Tallinn Manual, if the programmer had specifically designed the malware for exploitation of a DoD vulnerability (e.g., a military logistics or finance website), then the malware programmer can be targeted. In this instance, the malware programmer's acts (designing a code to exploit a DoD vulnerability) directly cause the disruptive harm to the military's operations, directly benefiting Iran. Thus, the programmer can be lawfully engaged in addition to the 13-year-old executing the code. By analogy, an IED developer who designs bombs specifically to exploit U.S. military vehicles (e.g., up-armored HUMVEEs or MRAPs) is targetable under DPH.\nConversely, if the malware programmer's only activity is developing generalized malware made available on a website, then causation would not be satisfied given the remoteness of involvement. This permutation resembles someone ordering firearms from an online vendor. An online vendor of cyber weapons does not become targetable, unless it is demonstrated that this developer is selling specialized malware to undermine DoD systems during an armed conflict. On the other hand, if the programmer designs malware for the 13-year-old, unaware of the intended target, there may be two possible outcomes. The CCD COE members were divided on malware programmers in this scenario. Drawing from the analogy of an IED builder, if military intelligence can establish factors supporting the inference that malware is specifically designed to exploit military weaknesses, then the programmer is targetable, unlike a person developing Trojan Horse viruses downloadable via a website. In short, further targeting decisions of malware programmers will require additional indicia of direct causation.\n## D. Technical Support Personnel\nAs a final example, technical support personnel require consideration under a DPCH analysis. If the 13-year-old hacker solicits technical support, the nature of that individual's involvement will be a determining factor for DPCH. If the hacker contacts technical support to assist with hardware or system software issues pertaining to the computer, then the support personnel will not be targetable as they are neither connected to the conflict nor the direct cause of harm. This result would be the same if the technical personnel assisted with\n Turns, supra note 8, at 295.\n TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 120.\n Id.\n Id.\n Crawford, supra note 71, at 17.\n Id.\n\nLXIV\nhardware and software issues knowing the intentions of the hacker. These personnel are criminally liable for such actions under a domestic framework within the United States, but are not targetable under LOAC. On the other hand, if a malware programmer provides technical assistance or instructive guidance to the child hacker on refining malware to exploit DoD systems, then the programmer (as a technical advisor) would lose their protected status and be targetable consistent with the Tallinn Manual’s view of a DPCH framework.\n## V. Challenges\nThe cumulative criteria mentioned above provide only a starting point for understanding what actions render a civilian targetable under LOAC. The decision to use force against a non-state civilian actor who directly participates in hostilities raises a myriad of other issues that will require consideration by states engaged in armed conflict. Each topic is individually complex and could be explored in elaborate discussions beyond the scope of this article. Nevertheless, the below discussions are limited to understanding how a state should consider these issues prior to considering a response to a civilian who forfeits protection under DPCH. These scenarios assume that the non-state actor’s attacks are not attributable to the state.\n## A. Sovereignty\n“Longstanding notions of sovereignty fall apart when it comes to cyber operations.” This quote foretells of a complex predicament should neutral nations become the staging grounds for non-state actors launching cyber-attacks in either IACs or NIACs. Of equal importance, the manner in which a State responds to civilians participating in CW from outside the theater of hostilities presents a challenging issue given that such neutral States maintain the inherent right of self-defense pursuant to Article 51 of the U.N. Charter. For IACs, LOAC provides that belligerent nations are prohibited from actions that harm a neutral nation and draw it into the conflict in any fashion. Conversely, neutral\n *Id.* at 18.\n Eric Talbot Jensen, *Sovereignty and Neutrality in Cyber Conflict*, 35 FORDHAM INT’L L.J. 815, 816 (2012) (citing David Perera, *Schmidle: Cyber Ops Might Require New Combatant Command Structure*, FIERCEGOVERNMENTIT (May 15, 2011, 4:29 PM), http://www.fiercegovernmentit.com/story/schmidle-cyber-ops-might-require-newcombatant-command-structure/2011-05-15 (quoting Lieutenant General Robert Schmidle, Deputy Commander of US Cyber Command)).\n *Id.*; see also UN Charter art. 51.\n Jensen, *supra* note 89, at 819; see also INT’L COMM.

While it is arguable that the law of neutrality does not extend to NIACs, the international law principle of *sic utere* provides that a state cannot knowingly allow its territory to be used to the detriment of another. Moreover, as illustrated in the *Nicaragua v. United States* case, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) supported the proposition that states engaged in non-international conflict enjoy a right of non-interference from outside parties.\nTo illustrate, suppose the non-state actor sponsored 13-year-old hacker launches a cyber-attack against the United States from Switzerland in support of Iran. Notwithstanding the existence of an extradition treaty, Switzerland has had a history of harboring U.S. fugitives. In this scenario, suppose also that the United States locates and identifies the attacker. If the Swiss preclude this individual from attacking further but refuse to extradite, then the United States would no longer be able to target this individual under the temporal considerations of a LOAC analysis. Alternatively, if the Swiss take no action at all or are unable to prevent harm from occurring, then the United States would find itself in a predicament that theoretically draws a comparison of physical terrorist attacks launched from lawless countries, including (pre-9/11) Afghanistan or Somalia.

The United Nations Charter of 1945 and Security Council decisions based on the Charter may in certain circumstances modify the law of neutrality. For example, Article 2(5) of the Charter requires UN Member States to give the UN every assistance in any action it takes, and Article 25 requires UN members to accept and comply with the decisions of the Security Council; the enforcement measures spelled out in Chapter VII can also have an impact, as they are governed by particular rules which differ from those of the law of neutrality.”).\n Jensen, *supra* note 89, at 819.\n Jutta Brunnée, *Sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas*, in *9 MAX PLANCK ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW* 188 (2012); See also Jack Goldsmith, *Thoughts on the Latest Round of Johnson v.

Moreover, the United States can target the 13-year-old kinetically for committing cyber-attacks against its military consistent with the cumulative factors under the Tallinn Manual's view.\nBoth responses would be proffered as an “unwilling or unable” international law argument. Although scholars support this standard’s incorporation into customary international law, the ICJ rejected it on several occasions and thus, the “unwilling or unable” doctrine remains contentious and unsettled within customary international law (CIL). Should the United States invoke this standard, as in the case of Afghanistan in 2002, a U.S. response without Switzerland’s permission could result in strong political and military repercussions. Unlike Afghanistan before September 2001, Switzerland is not a lawless State, but still bears the responsibility under the *sic utere* doctrine to prevent international cyber-attacks from occurring within its national borders. In response to a U.S. kinetic or non-kinetic attack against the hacker, the Swiss could bring the issue to the ICJ. Switzerland could also respond militarily or in the cyber domain in self-defense against the United States. Given the permutations involved, this scenario illustrates the several considerations the United States would confront in conducting a counter-attack against a hacker located in a neutral State that refuses to cooperate.\n## B. Law of Targeting Considerations\nIf the United States responds to this hacker in the cyber or physical domain, “targeting law” will certainly apply in both cases. “Targeting law” evaluates whether the weapon’s employment (methodology) would violate the general principles of LOAC. The general principles of LOAC involve military necessity, distinction, proportionality, and humanity. For the purposes of kinetic operations using conventional means in the physical domain, targeting law remains well settled. As noted in the Tallinn Manual, these concepts do apply in the cyber domain and will require further examination. “Military necessity may be defined as the principle that justifies the use of all measures needed to defeat the enemy as quickly and efficiently as possible that are not prohibited by the law of war.” Thus, military commanders must act in a manner necessary for advancing military objectives and ensure that their actions\n Goldsmith, *supra* note 93.\n *Id.*\n Jeffrey S. Thurnher, *The Law that Applies to Autonomous Weapon Systems*, 17 AM. SOC’Y INT’L L. INSIGHTS (Jan. 18, 2013), http://www.asil.org/insights/volume/17/issue/4/law-applies-autonomous-weapon-systems.\n U.S. DEP’T. OF DEF., DOD LAW OF WAR MANUAL 50 (JUNE 2015),\n *Id.* at 52. See also IAN HENDERSON, THE CONTEMPORARY LAW OF TARGETING 7 (2009).\n\nare not otherwise prohibited by another principle of LOAC. As a principle, military necessity not only tolerates violence towards the enemy but alternative operations which influence or impede the enemy (e.g. psychological operations, electronic jamming, intelligence operations). As applied, cyber-attacks may be employed against military objectives provide such actions do not violate the principles of proportionality, humanity, and distinction.\n“Humanity” implies that belligerents should not cause unnecessary suffering. The CCD COE posits that “[m]eans and methods of cyber warfare will only in rare cases violate this Rule.” However, the Tallinn Manual illustrates a possible violation of this rule through hacking into a victim’s pacemaker to stop the target’s heart and then reviving him multiple times before finally killing him. An example could include hacking into pharmaceutical records for the purpose of prescribing medications aimed at causing long-term allergic reactions leading to death. Using a cyber-attack to poison or corrupt a military water supply serves as another example as strictly prohibited as a violation of this LOAC principle. Given the ramifications, U.S. policy would exclude attacking this hacker through means that cause unnecessary suffering.\nAs mentioned earlier, “distinction” requires combatants to distinguish between lawful military targets (opposing combatants and their equipment and facilities) and protected persons (e.g., civilians, medical personnel, chaplains, hors de combat) and property. However, in DPH and DPCH targeting contexts, distinction requires discriminating between civilians who have forfeited protection from those civilians and related objects that retain protection. Thus, if the United States were to conduct a non-kinetic cyber-attack against the 13-year-old hacker via a Swiss server, the United States would need to utilize malware that targets the offending computer only with no adverse effect or corruption of the server or other resident users. Similarly, if the 13-year-old hacker were using a Wi-Fi café in a Swiss hospital, the United States would not be able to attack the hospital’s server given that it is protected. If the United States can transmit a response (e.g., a DDoS attack) through the Wi-Fi café router that only impacts the targeted computer, then distinction would be otherwise satisfied. Similarly, targeting servers for non-kinetic (e.g., DDoS) or kinetic (e.g., Stuxnet-type virus) purposes requires verification of the hacker’s location. Therefore, the United States would need intelligence models on the systems’ architects and servers in order to modify malware to distinguish civilian perpetrators from protected persons.\n Id. at 52.\n Id. at 53.\n TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 144.\n Id.\nNaval Law Review\nLXIV\nTraditionally, the term civilian objects implied buildings, utilities (e.g., power lines), and related infrastructure. For cyber considerations, civilian objects would include such items as servers, computers, and related hardware. Data is also considered a protected object, especially if the data on a resident server is owned by a protected civilian. As mentioned, the CCD COE specifically chose not exclude data from the ambit of the term “attack.” This is especially true where malware is directed against data that physical objects rely upon for functionality. Thus, a cyber-attack that damages protected civilian data would violate the rules of distinction. While the data’s restoration via a backup could serve as a test for targeting, this is not the test used for physical property since buildings can be rebuilt, and cars can be remanufactured over time. Thus, this issue remains unsettled and a consideration for distinction. As applied, if the Wi-Fi café shares the same servers which contain patients’ records and data, then the intentional damage to such data would violate this principle.\nTargeting law also requires a “proportionality” analysis. The Tallinn Manual restates the requirements for proportionality codified in customary international law and in AP I:\nA cyber[-]attack that may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated is prohibited.\nWhile this principle is simply stated, proportionality is entirely subjective given that comparing the value of a military advantage to damage to civilians is tantamount to comparing “apples to oranges.” The analysis becomes case-specific, based on the nature of the target and the national thresholds for collateral damage. As applied, if the United States decides to conduct a DDoS attack against the 13-year-old hacker in Switzerland in a hospital Wi-Fi café, then the United States will have to assess the effects of the DDoS attack on that network and whether the resultant collateral damage can be mitigated by modifying the malware. By comparison, such modifications are consistent with DoD Collateral Damage Estimation Methodologies (CDEM) for\n *Id.* at 108, 113.\n HENDERSON, *supra* note 102, at 7.\n TALLINN MANUAL, *supra* note 5, at 159 (Rule 51).\n KENNETH ANDERSON &amp; MATTHEW WAXMAN, LAW AND ETHICS FOR AUTONOMOUS WEAPON SYSTEMS: WHY A BAN WON’T WORK AND HOW THE LAWS OF WAR CAN 12 (2013), available at http://www.hoover.org/publications/monographs/144241.\n TALLINN MANUAL, *supra* note 5, at 113.\n\nconventional weapons so as to avoid malware collaterally spreading or damaging other users, data, or networks. An analysis of the Stuxnet malware revealed fail-safe features such as code that limited the infection to Siemens systems, the number of devices that each infected device could infect, and the self-destruct code erasing the virus on June 24, 2012. Regardless of the overall effectiveness of the fail-safe measures, they illustrate “the inherent caution” of Stuxnet’s creators as an attempt to prevent further damage to other systems. Nations attempting to develop more sophisticated cyber weapons will need to consider proportionality issues and collateral damage.\n## VI. Practical Responses to Civilians who Directly Participate\nDespite challenges associated with cyber-warfare, States have a right of self-defense against civilians who conduct cyber-attacks during an armed conflict setting. While political and diplomatic measures remain available, the foregoing discussion provides an understanding of the nature of each response to a DPCH scenario assuming the offending civilian is located and attributed to the action. For the purposes of this framework, the U.S.-Iran armed conflict scenario discussed earlier will be utilized again.\n## A. Non-kinetic Responses\nNon-kinetic response can be acknowledged or covert as discussed below. Cyber defenses, for example, can be employed to have a non-kinetic effect depending upon their intended effect and usage. If a hacker attempts to gain access into an otherwise prohibited system, the host system can utilize a defense that can essentially block such access with no further effect. More active cyber defenses include tracking hackers’ computers, hacking back into systems to retrieve data, shutting down systems, sabotaging data, infecting the attacker with malware, taking over the attacker’s botnet, or employing a botnet to track or attack the hacker’s computer. While active defense responses to DPCH seem plausible, LOAC principles must be taken into consideration. For instance, if a DoD system conducts an active defense hack-back or counter-attack using\n CDEM assesses the likelihood of collateral damage for conventional weapons based on several factors, such as types of weapons, employment tactics, proximity of civilian structures.

REV. 1 (2005).\n Michael J.

A more interesting question is how such systems can distinguish between a criminal hacker and a LOAC hacker. At a minimum, in both cases, employing an active defense capable of preserving evidence and intelligence related to this hacker and operation will be critical for potential prosecution or follow-on responses. Offensive cyber capabilities with non-kinetic effects would employ similar effects described for active defenses. The distinction is that offensive capabilities would not necessarily occur as an automatic response from a computer, but rather a directed operation.\n## B. Kinetic Responses\nResponding to a cyber-attack kinetically raises questions regarding escalation. A response can take on two forms: a conventional attack (e.g., a missile) or a cyber-attack with physical effects (e.g., Stuxnet). Due to political and diplomatic considerations, use of force by the United States will require nothing short of Presidential authorization. In the instance of international armed conflict, the legal framework for employing a kinetic attack against a designated hostile force or individual (e.g., via AUMF or “targeted killing”) is well settled. A cyber-attack with kinetic effects directed against designated hostile forces in a theater of combat is legally supportable. Similarly, the targeted killing of a U.S. terrorist in self-defense is also considered consistent with U.S. domestic law, whether conducted with a drone strike or a kinetic cyber-attack. As scholar Hays Parks notes, the targeted killing of a legitimate enemy is not assassination. If a civilian forfeits protection due to DPCH attacks or serves as a cyber-terrorist causing physical harm to U.S. civilians, he or she can be lawfully targeted with a kinetic attack. With this understanding, there will be some additional considerations.\nIf the 13-year-old hacker is in Iran during the U.S.-Iranian conflict, the United States could escalate to kinetic force against the child no differently from an insurgent planting IEDs or shooting at a military convoy. On the other hand, kinetic operations during a cyber-only conflict expand the range of options available to the hostile nation for targeting a civilian cyber-attacker within its borders. In other words, Iran would be able to escalate to kinetic force in self-defense. Thus, in a cyber-only conflict, targeting this hacker kinetically may\n *Id.*\n *US to Outline Legal Backing for ‘Targeted Kill’ Programme*, THE GUARDIAN (Mar. 1, 2012, 2:58 AM), http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/05/us-legal-backing-targeted-kill-programme.\n W. Hays Parks, *Memorandum of Law: Executive Order 12333 and Assassination*, ARMY LAW., Dec. 1989, at 4.\n Herbert Lin, *Escalation Dynamics and Conflict Termination in Cyberspace*, STRAT. STUD. Q. 46, 65 (2012).\n\nundoubtedly escalate the conflict and requires political considerations. These considerations are heightened if kinetic force is applied to or within neutral nations as mentioned in Part IV. A kinetic response to a cyber-attack will require a case-by-case analysis of the nature of the cyber-attack’s operation, intended target(s), and underlying strategic significance. At a minimum, kinetic action, whether conducted through conventional or cyber-attacks, should be limited in scope and duration, consistent with self-defense proportionality principles, in order to avert an unnecessary escalation.\n## C. Covert Action\nIn most cases, the benefit of acknowledged non-kinetic or kinetic cyber-attacks against a neutral nation will be significantly outweighed by the diplomatic, economic, and military backlashes that would occur. Such acts would undoubtedly be perceived as an act of aggression by the United Nations, as interpreted by the ICJ. For these reasons, covert action represents a readily available solution while CIL develops in this area. Responding to non-state actors performing cyber-attacks from neutral states presents complex issues given the potential of affronting neutrality and widening the conflict. The stealthy nature of cyber warfare enables covert action as use of the cyber domain enables anonymity, takes advantage of targeted individuals’ awareness, and utilizes speed that overcomes the ability to readily safeguard against the consequences. Returning to the earlier scenario involving the child hacker located in Switzerland, the United States could consider covert action to thwart this non-state actor. This scenario presumes that Switzerland is uncooperative in extraditing or precluding this child from committing cyber-attacks against the United States.\nFirst, the United States could consider a targeted killing operation against this individual within Swiss borders. The targeting of this child for DPCH in support of Iran would not be considered an assassination as prohibited by Executive Order 12333. Under U.S. domestic law, an Authorization to Use Military Force will be required to authorize targeted killings. This requirement was illustrated in the U.S. campaign against al-Qaeda. Assuming the U.S.-Iranian conflict contains an AUMF, language should be included to at least authorize the killing of supporting parties for DPCH, regardless of location. This\n *Id.* at 61.\n See generally UN Charter, arts. 2(4), 51; see also Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicar. v.

Alternatively, even if an AUMF does not have broader language, a covert targeted killing would still be lawful if it can be established that the killing was required in self-defense consistent with Article 51 of the UN Charter. To prevent attribution of such killing within Swiss borders, the United States could use military means, such as Special Forces operations analogous to those employed during the Osama bin Laden raid.\nSecond, covert action could also be conducted for rendition of the child to prosecute him in the United States. The practice of rendition (also referred to as irregular rendition) is typically defined as the kidnapping or taking of an individual to move that person to the jurisdiction of another country.[124] This is distinguished from extraordinary rendition which involves transferring the individual to a foreign country for the purposes of detention and interrogation by a foreign government.[125] Rendition does not deprive U.S. courts of jurisdiction unless an applicable extradition treaty explicitly calls for that result and that treaty has been given legislative effect within U.S. domestic law.[126] Since the U.S.-Swiss extradition treaty contains no rendition language, the United States would not be barred from exercising jurisdiction and prosecuting this individual.[127] A covert action for rendition would resemble a raid using either special operations or U.S. law enforcement.\nFinally, covert action could be carried out against this individual via cyber means. A cyber-attack could have a non-kinetic or kinetic impact, as discussed earlier, and would be a more tenable solution if the originator of the attack were unknown. A covert operation employing cyber capabilities would require a complex number of variables beyond the scope of this article. Needless to say, such an operation would involve understanding the location of the child, a breakdown of the child's activities (pattern of life), an understanding of the targeted system's architecture, and other variables. A covert, non-kinetic cyberattack could be aimed at locating, tracking, and denying access to the 13-year-old hacker via the child's computer or home internet service provider. This kind of non-kinetic operation could be aimed at developing further intelligence on the child's activities for further planning should the child continue his or her attacks.\n\nA covert kinetic cyber-attack could vary greatly. Malware could be used to destroy the child’s data or to render the child’s computer unusable. On the other hand, if the desired effect is to kill the 13-year-old hacker, then a more elaborate cyber-attack would be required. Should the child need a pacemaker or medical assistance, a potential attack would include using malware or other cyber technique to kill the hacker, provided that the prohibition against unnecessary suffering was enforced. “CyberJacking,” the act of remotely taking control of someone’s vehicle, could be used as cyber means of a targeted killing. In this past summer’s BlackHat conference, two researchers demonstrated how they could control a car using their laptop while within the car. Such capabilities could easily be weaponized to target this 13-year-old hacker, assuming that the killing of the civilian driver or other occupants as collateral damage would be proportionally acceptable under the circumstances.\n## VII. Conclusion\nIn summary, DPCH will remain an ongoing concern in the coming years given the lack of an international consensus on the basic legal principles governing hostilities in the cyber domain. At a minimum, the Tallinn Manual’s DPCH framework provides clear guidance derived from IHL that will enable states to respond to civilian hackers who undertake hostilities in armed conflict while seeking to prevent collateral damage. While developing a cyber-hostilities treaty appears as a readily available solution, the sharp disagreement among states (e.g., the United States, Great Britain, France, China, Russia) on the basic principle of regulating the cyber domain makes such treaty a fleeting prospect. Nevertheless, states always retain the inherent authority of self-defense, regardless of the lack of international consensus concerning cyber hostilities. Thus, IHL provides an immediate legal framework for cyber operations. Over time, these practices will refine and crystalize into customary international law through State practice and opinio juris. Although international consensus seems unattainable, regional or organization practices such as the NATO effort in the Tallinn Manual support the development of CIL in those regions. While the cyber domain requires an analysis of the nature of hostilities, the principles of IHL govern the conduct of these hostilities in order to safeguard against collateral damage while preserving a state’s right of self-defense.\n Scott Schweitzer, *CyberJacking, Sophisticated Assassination*, CYBER WEAPONS &amp; WARFARE (Oct. 6, 2013, 8:55 AM), http://cyberweapons.blogspot.com/.\n *Id.* The BlackHat conference is a yearly event where thousands of security experts gather to discuss information security and expose vulnerabilities at the pertaining to computers, networks and other related digital media.

With the possibility of this trend, governments will need to develop a legal framework for responding to civilians who directly participate in cyber hostilities.\nIn physical warfare settings, the principle of distinction requires belligerents to differentiate between combatants and civilians under the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC). Under LOAC, civilians enjoy protection from being the direct target of armed attack. The notion of Direct Participation in Hostilities (DPH) provides that a civilian loses this protection for undertaking combat operations against military forces in an armed conflict. This concept became relevant in the U.S. campaigns in Iraq, Afghanistan, the Global War on Terror, and other overseas contingency operations. In these conflicts, U.S. forces confronted the problem by positively identifying and engaging a civilian determined to be directly participating in hostilities. Combining the complexity of DPH with the cyber domain presents a conundrum because, unlike traditional warfare, civilians who can directly participate in cyber hostilities need not be physically located within the theater of hostilities. A hacker who undertakes hostilities can attack from any location in the world with a laptop and internet access. Therefore, the issue of direct participation in cyber hostilities (DPCH) has many factors that will require analysis in order to develop a legal framework for response.\nThis article stands for the proposition that a civilian who directly participates in hostilities in the cyber domain forfeits protection and becomes a lawful target. In support, this article will first highlight the background and law applicable to DPCH in general. In particular, this article will discuss the factors that render a civilian targetable by analyzing the traditional framework of DPH as applied through the Tallinn Manual. This discussion will include an understanding of what constitutes an “attack” and provide examples of which hostile roles render civilians targetable. Next, this article will discuss some of the challenges that leaders will confront in responding to issues involving DPCH. These issues include sovereignty and “targeting law” under LOAC. However, this article will provide a framework that contemplates non-kinetic, kinetic, and covert action.\n Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of August 12, 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts art. 51(3), adopted June 8, 1977, 1125 U.N.T.S. 3 [hereinafter Additional Protocol I]; Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts art. 13(3), adopted June 8, 1977, 1125 U.N.T.S. 609 [hereinafter Additional Protocol II].\n TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE (Michael N. Schmitt ed., 2013) [hereinafter TALLINN MANUAL].\n\nPouring New Wine Into Old Bottles\n## II. Background: Direct Participation in Hostilities, Cyber Warfare, and the Law\nCurrently, there is no clear international consensus on many cyber warfare (CW) issues, least of all DPCH. Moreover, customary international law (State practice and opinio juris) has not developed or crystallized as found in other areas of International Humanitarian Law (IHL). The ability to detect and defend against such attacks, whether State-sponsored or not, has become exceedingly difficult given the speed and regularity of occurrences within the cyber domain generally. On the subject of \"imminence\" alone, U.S. Government officials struggle to develop policy that applies traditional concepts to determine whether a strike in self-defense is justified or is preventative war and thus prohibited as an unprovoked act of aggression. Furthermore, unlike traditional combat, IHL applicability to CW has not been tested before the International Court of Justice (ICJ). Therefore, CW does not cleanly fit into the hostilities paradigm for which LOAC was created. It is analogous to pouring a new wine into an old bottle.\nNevertheless, IHL will serve as a baseline to regulate the conduct of CW until greater international consensus is reached. The fact that IHL does not specifically reference cyber operations does not imply that such operations are not subject to IHL, especially given the possibilities of physical harm caused by CW.[11] Thus, as an international cyber warfare legal framework does not currently exist, the applied \"law\" is national policy interpreting and incorporating IHL as a foundation. Given the Frankenstein-like nature of this framework and uncertainties associated with cyber weapons, many national policies will not be readily transparent.[12] For example, many of the U.S. authorities and policies applicable to CW remain classified and withheld at the\n[^6]: Jean-Marie Henckaerts, *Study on Customary International Humanitarian Law: A Contribution to the Understanding and Respect For the Rule of Law in Armed Conflict*, 87 INT'L REV.

At a minimum, the United States has acknowledged IHL’s applicability to CW. Moreover, U.S. policy runs parallel with the experts who authored the Tallinn Manual from NATO’s Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCD COE), who argue that traditional notions of IHL apply to CW. Therefore, this article will analyze DPCH through IHL and the Tallinn Manual as a developmental framework.\nWithin IHL, the principle of distinction between combatants and civilians serves as the starting point for DPCH. While principally derived from customary international law and the 1907 Hague Convention, contemporary notions of distinction are codified in Article 48 of Additional Protocol I (AP I) to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, which provides: “In order to ensure respect for and protection of the civilian population and civilian objects, the Parties to the conflict shall at all times distinguish between the civilian population and combatants and between civilian objects and military objectives and accordingly shall direct their operations only against military objectives.” Thus, civilians enjoy protection from an armed attack as a generally accepted principle under IHL. Under the principle of distinction, parties to a conflict are required to distinguish between the civilian population and objects, and from otherwise lawful targets (e.g., military combatants). The United States and CCD COE acknowledged this requirement of distinction is required in CW.\nThe notion of DPH, derived from Article 51(3) of AP I, provides that civilians shall enjoy protection from armed attack “unless and for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities” for international armed conflicts (IAC). The notion is virtually identical for non-international armed conflicts (NIAC) as\n *Id.*\n Harold H. Koh, *International Law in Cyberspace*, 54 HARV. INT’L.

Thus, civilians who directly participate in hostilities forfeit their protections and can be lawfully targeted. While civilians are subject to lawful targeting while taking direct part in hostilities, they are only lawful targets “for such time as” or while they actually commit hostile acts directly producing harmful effects to an enemy. This preceding language providing for a temporal requirement remains controversial. Institutions such as the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) interpret this section very restrictively to mean that such civilians can only be targeted until he or she has returned to the pre-deployment location. Thus, if a civilian conducts repeated attacks, that civilian will regain protection upon return from each engagement. This remains highly debated among scholars and the ICRC. Other scholars take a broader view, allowing for targeting of a civilian long after he or she has lost protection. For the purposes of cyber-conflict, the CCD COE agreed that the temporal requirement would at least include actions immediately preceding or subsequent to the qualifying act. However, the CCD COE experts were split on the time between repeated attacks. Thus, this issue is unresolved in both physical and cyber domains and will become a policy decision vis-à-vis rules of engagement or operational orders. This article will assume a broad view allowing for targeting in between attacks.\n## III. The Cumulative Factors of DPCH\nWhile the ICRC has not published similar comprehensive guidance on DPCH or CW, the ICRC’s DPH guidance remains helpful as discussed infra. Moreover, the ICRC contributed to the development of the Tallinn Manual and generally agrees with the rules developed with some exceptions. In particular, many of the notions for resolving DPCH issues are derived from the ICRC’s interpretive guidance on DPH. Thus, the Tallinn Manual remains the most comprehensive work that serves as DPCH guidance within the framework of IHL. Rule 35 of the Tallinn Manual provides that an act of direct participation in hostilities by civilians renders them liable to be attacked, by cyber or other\n\nNaval Law Review\nLXIV\nlawful means. Similar to AP I and AP II, Rule 35 describes that civilians are targetable “for such time as he or she is engaged in the qualifying act of direct participation.” Rule 35 sets forth the three cumulative criteria (threshold of harm, direct causation, and belligerent nexus) for qualification of an act as direct participation in cyber hostilities that are derived from the ICRC interpretive guidance. This rule also provides discussion regarding specific nuances within each of the three factors require case-by-case consideration in order for a civilian to be targeted for losing protection as a result of DPCH.\n## A. Understanding an Attack: Threshold of Harm\nPer Article 49(1) of AP I, “attacks” are acts of violence against the adversary, whether in offense or in defense. To illustrate, military convoys in Iraq or Afghanistan would be able to target, in self-defense, a roadside Improvised Explosive Device (IED) bomber or sniper for engaging in a hostile act amounting to an attack. On the other hand, a civilian who simply stands in the middle of the road holding up a sign in protest does not qualify as an attack. Targeting this protestor would be prohibited under IHL unless that civilian committed or attempt to commit an act that amounts to direct participation. By analogy, the aforementioned Stuxnet worm would clearly illustrate a kinetic attack given the resultant physical damage to Iranian centrifuges. Conversely, the same conclusion would not easily be reached for “hacktivists,” who protest by spamming computer networks with protest e-mails. Therefore, to understand the definition of “cyber-attack,” an analysis of the “threshold of harm” associated with it is required. Factors involved in this analysis include: “the context of the event, the actor perpetrating the action (recognizing\n TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 118.\n Id.\n Id.\n Id. at 119-121.\n Additional Protocol I, supra note 4, art. 49(1); see also TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 106. (“[I]t is the use of violence against a target that distinguishes attacks from other military operations. Non-violent operations, such as psychological cyber operations or cyber espionage, do not qualify as attacks. ‘Acts of violence’ should not be understood as limited to activities that release kinetic force. . . . In this regard, note that chemical, biological, or radiological attacks do not usually have a kinetic effect on their designated target, but it is universally agreed that they constitute attacks as a matter of law.”)\n\n Hacktivism is defined as the use of computer hacking to help advance political or social causes. See Mark Manion &amp; Abby Goodrum, Terrorism or Civil Disobedience: Toward a Hacktivist Ethic, 30 COMPUTERS &amp; SOC’Y 14 (2000).\n\nchallenging issues of attribution in cyberspace), the target and location, [and] effects and intent, among other possible issues.”\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) defines “cyber-attack” as:\nA hostile act using computer or related networks or systems, and intended to disrupt and/or destroy an adversary’s critical cyber systems, assets, or functions. The intended effects of cyber-attack are not necessarily limited to the targeted computer systems or data themselves—for instance, attacks on computer systems which are intended to degrade or destroy infrastructure or [command and control] capability. A cyber-attack may use intermediate delivery vehicles including peripheral devices, electronic transmitters, embedded code, or human operators. The activation or effect of a cyber-attack may be widely separated temporally and geographically from the delivery.\nThe U.S. definition provides some inference that a cyber-attack need not physically destroy systems to qualify as an attack. Rather, disruption of these systems will suffice as meeting a threshold of harm.\nBy comparison, the ICRC’s DPH guidance provides some level of amplification on this point, despite not directly speaking about DPCH or CW specifically. The ICRC indicates that the threshold of harm for DPH is satisfied when the civilian’s actions adversely affect military operations or the military capacity of a party to the conflict. The ICRC states that the denial of an adversary’s military use of certain objects, equipment, and territory would reach the required threshold of harm. The ICRC specifically notes that the electronic interference with military computer networks would fall into this category of denial, whether accomplished through computer network attacks (CNA) or computer network exploitation (CNE). As cybersecurity strategist Joshua\n Koh, supra note 14, at 4; see also Schmitt, supra note 14, at 19.\n Memorandum from Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to Chiefs of the Military Services et al., subject: Joint Terminology for Cyberspace Operations (Nov. 2010) [hereinafter “Joint Terminology for Cyberspace Operations”].\n Id.\n ICRC DPH GUIDANCE, supra note 23, at 48.\n Id.\n Id. at 48. CNA is defined as a “category of fires employed for offensive purposes in which actions are taken through the use of computer networks to disrupt, deny, degrade, manipulate, or destroy information resident in the target system or computer networks, or the systems/networks themselves.”; CNE is defined as “[e]nabling operations and intelligence collection capabilities conducted through the use of computer networks to gather data about target or adversary automated\n\nLXIV\nCorman notes, a cyber-attack is essentially no different from electronic warfare where an adversary denies military use of equipment through jamming or interfering with a network. Thus, a civilian who engages in actions tantamount to interference with military communications or operations through CNA (e.g., a Denial of Service operation) or CNE would constitute a DPCH attack in ICRC’s view.\nThe Tallinn Manual thus incorporates the ICRC’s notion by stating that:\n[T]he act (or a closely related series of acts) must have the intended or actual effect of negatively affecting the adversary’s military operations or capabilities, or inflicting death, physical harm, or material destruction on persons or objects protected against direct attack (threshold of harm).\nThe CCD COE experts provide that a cyber-attack that satisfies the “threshold of harm” is an operation that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects. The CCD COE was very specific that this “limitation should not be understood as excluding cyber operations against data (which are non-physical entities) from the ambit of the term attack.” This is especially true if an operation against data upon which the functionality of physical objects relies can sometimes constitute an attack.\nHowever, for the purposes of DPCH against military adversaries, the CCD COE clarifies that there is no requirement for physical damage to objects or harm to individuals so long as a cyber-attack negatively affects enemy military operations. For example, a cyber-attack that disrupts the operation of the military’s command and control network would satisfy the criterion. Disruption in this context does not mean physical damage to servers, data, or computers. Rather, it simply implies interference, no different from radio or radar jamming. This proposition is consistent with the ICRC’s view under DPH. Stated negatively, if these actions were not directed at an adversary’s military capability, the ICRC requires that the “specific act must be likely to cause at\ninformation systems or networks.” See Joint Terminology for Cyberspace Operations, supra note 37, at 3-4.\n Skype Interview with cybersecurity strategist Joshua Corman, Chief Technology Officer at Sonatype (Sept. 23, 2013) (video recordation on file with author).\n TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 119.\n Id. at 107.\n Id. at 107–08.\n Id. at 119.\n Id.\n Id.\n\nPouring New Wine Into Old Bottles\nleast death, injury, or destruction” of property in order to reach this threshold of harm. Thus, the ICRC’s notion as applied to CW means that a civilian hacker interfering with a civilian computer system (e.g., Social Security), instead of the military, would not necessarily lose protection for that purpose unless it can be demonstrated that either the cyber-attack against the non-military network was intended to have an effect on the military in some fashion or that physical harm would otherwise result.\nAs an aside, this notion of physical harm to a non-military network need not be defined in the physical destruction associated with a kinetic strike. An emerging trend is to define physical harm in the cyber domain as the level of effect on the functionality of the targeted object. Some experts argue that if a cyber-attack impairs the functionality such that physical components require replacement, then this would constitute damage as envisaged in the concept of attack. Other experts provide that physical component replacement is not required; loss of functionality through data corruption requiring software reinstallation or network rebooting would constitute “physical damage.” While the physical damage standard is not required for military networks, understanding this disparity is important if cyber-attacks against non-military networks occur as part of greater campaign during an armed conflict.\n## B. Direct Causation\nThe ICRC guidance provides that there must be a direct causation from the civilian act to the harm suffered for the act to potentially constitute DPH. In particular, the ICRC states: “there must be a direct causal link between a specific act and the harm likely to result either from that act, or from a coordinated military operation of which that act constitutes an integral part.” In terms of a physical context, this implies that the harm suffered cannot be the result of an indirect or secondary order effect. The Tallinn Manual aligns with the ICRC’s DPH analysis by requiring the existence of “a direct causal link between the act in question and the harm intended or inflicted.” In CW, this standard appears easier to fulfill than in the physical combat scenario, where “fog of war” tends to complicate the issue. By analogy, if a civilian farmer fires his weapon at another local national to ward off livestock poaching, the sound of gunfire or the physical impact of a bullet may incite a nearby military patrol to\n ICRC DPH GUIDANCE, supra note 23, at 49.\n Droege, supra note 11, at 557–58.\n TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 108.\n Id. at 109.\n ICRC DPH GUIDANCE, supra note 23, at 50–51.\n Id. at 51.\n TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 119.\nNaval Law Review\nLXIV\nengage in self-defense. In some instances, mere possession and public display of personal weapons, could be perceived as a threat without additional accompanying acts.\nOn the other hand, CW will not suffer from the same “fog of war” issue. The use of a cyber-weapon to deny a military’s capability or interfere with a military operation can hardly be seen as incidental or an indirect cause. The Tallinn Manual supports this point through the example of disruption to the enemy’s command and control as being directly caused by a cyber-attack. Therefore, if a civilian hacker gained access into a military network to exploit or disrupt the network, that civilian’s acts would be the direct cause of the harm suffered, rendering him or her targetable. As a counterpoint, this theory should not discount the possibility of accidental cyber-attacks by civilian entities or individuals. There are potential scenarios where technology companies or independent contractors could theoretically accidentally release malware onto a network. However, the Tallinn Manual and ICRC guidance on direct causation does not address the underlying intentions behind the action. Thus, the challenge with these scenarios is that they reinforce the notion of reasonable precautions within IHL (i.e., the obligation to take reasonable precautions to avoid or minimize incidental civilian losses). Therefore, while fog of war is relatively diminished, prior to responding to a cyber-attack premised upon DPCH, reasonable precautions (e.g., reviewing human, electronic, and signals intelligence; verifying the source of the attack; using the least destructive means available to neutralize the threat) should be taken to minimize potentially attacking an otherwise innocent party.\n## C. Belligerent Nexus\nThe ICRC DPH guidance provides that:\nIn order to meet the requirement of belligerent nexus, an act must be specifically designed to directly cause the required threshold of harm in support of a party to the conflict and to the detriment of another.\n Id. at 119–20.\n Id. at 120.\n Additional Protocol I, supra note 4, art. 57(1); see also Customary IHL—Rule 15. Precautions in Attack, INT’L COMM. OF THE RED CROSS, http://www.icrc.org/customary-ibl/eng/docs/v1_cha_chapter5_rule15 (last visited July 30, 2014) (suggesting that Article 13(1) of Additional Protocol II implies this obligation); TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 164–65.\n See generally TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 159–176 (Rules 51–58).\n ICRC DPH GUIDANCE, supra note 23, at 58.\n\nHostile acts such as firing a weapon at an enemy or planting a bomb serve as easy examples. As a qualifying statement, the ICRC notes that acts that do not satisfy the threshold of harm are “non-belligerent . . . and, therefore, must be addressed through law enforcement measures.” 61 A seminal example is the IED maker whose actions contribute to hostilities without necessarily being connected to the conflict. In this example, if the intelligence shows that the IED maker is developing and supplying bombs for the insurgents as a part of an ongoing campaign, then he/she is targetable. This analysis will change if he/she is just selling them to the insurgents. The ICRC also provides that the belligerent nexus element does not require a subjective intent determination, where the state of mind of the person is at issue in committing the act.62 The ICRC posits that a belligerent nexus requires an objective standard expressed in the design of the act or operation which does not depend on the mindset of every participating individual.63 Belligerent nexus is generally not influenced by factors such as personal distress or preferences, or by the mental ability or willingness of persons to assume responsibility for their conduct. Consequently, if an insurgent is forced or coerced in some manner to commit an attack, he/she would still be lawfully targetable under IHL.\nAs applied, the Tallinn Manual expounds on the ICRC’s belligerent nexus notion by stating that cyber acts must be directly related to the hostilities between parties to a conflict.64 By example, if a civilian directs a cyber-attack against a military’s command and control node, his or her actions would satisfy this condition as it impacts a military force to the benefit of the opposition. Equally, if a hacker were coerced to commit this cyber-attack, he or she would lose protection and become lawfully targetable. The Tallinn Manual’s criterion rules out acts of a purely criminal or private nature that occur during an armed conflict.65 For example, hackers, using cyber means to commit a variety of crimes against non-military institutions, would not be targetable even if the victim State were a party to the conflict.66 However, if the criminal actions were conducted to support particular military operations of one party and to the detriment of the military opposition, then the civilian would forfeit protection for DPCH.\n\nLXIV\n## IV. As Applied: Which Civilians are Targetable?\nGiven these cumulative factors, consideration should be given as to the categories of civilians who become lawful targets under DPCH. Up front, government-employed or -contracted computer technicians and related personnel would not be targetable under Geneva Convention III (GC III) as “persons who accompany the armed forces without actually being members thereof,” provided they fulfill more support roles and do not directly participate in hostilities.67 On the other hand, if government contracted personnel were to engage in cyber hostilities, they would lose protection analogous to mercenaries.68 Similarly, civilians who serve a continuous combat function in an organized armed group during an IAC or NIAC are targetable.69 At a minimum, the Tallinn Manual’s guidance provides that members of organized armed groups, whether as levée en masse or not, who directly participate in hostilities, are targetable.70 Such civilians will remain targetable throughout the conflict, including the temporal breaks in between or after attacks mentioned supra. However, the CCD COE experts remain divided over this issue. Some experts argue that a civilian who is simply a member of the group is targetable regardless of their nature, no differently from members of a uniformed armed force (with exception for protected clergy and medical personnel); others follow the ICRC DPH guidance requirement of a “continuous combat function.” Thus, a cook or administrative clerk for a non-state cyber-combat organization would not be targetable under the ICRC standard. This issue remains unresolved in the physical domain and will be resolved through policy or rules of engagement (ROE) decisions by leaders on a fact-specific basis. Nevertheless, civilians will be more readily targetable if they are part of a hostile group actively partaking in the armed conflict.\nNotwithstanding these preliminary categories, identifying a civilian directly participating in cyber hostilities will be fact-specific and require a case-by-case analysis consistent with the principles discussed in Part III. Using these cumulative factors, the examples below illustrate the Tallinn Manual’s principles applied to unaffiliated civilians who directly participate in cyber hostilities. While not exhaustive, these examples serve as possible permutations for illustrating DPCH analysis via the Tallinn Manual and the ICRC’s DPH guidance.\n\n## A. Example One: The Case of the 13-year-old Thrill Seeker\nCivilians who are not parties to an IAC or NIAC may be lawfully targeted where they directly participate in cyber hostilities. Consider the hypothetical situation where, during an IAC between the U.S. and Iran, a 13-year-old child is armed with a laptop and malware. In this scenario, this hacker perpetrates a cyber-attack from Switzerland that is designed to disrupt a U.S. military logistics system related to moving of supplies and personnel for the purposes of disrupting (but not physically damaging) processes. This is especially conceivable given the inexpensive nature of developing or acquiring malicious code.[72] Just recently a 12-year-old pled guilty to charges in Canada for hacking government systems in support of the international network of hacktivists known as Anonymous.[73]\nOnce this hypothetical 13-year-old child conducts a cyber-attack by transmitting malware into this U.S. military logistics system, the child has clearly forfeited protection and is targetable for the following reasons: first, this act qualifies as an attack given that it meets the threshold of harm by disrupting military operations, where physical harm is not required;[74] secondly, the child's act of launching the malware directly causes the subsequent disruption (or attempted disruption);[75] lastly, the child's act satisfies the belligerent nexus element because the hostile act is directed against the U.S. military network and objectively benefits Iran.[76] Thus, the 13-year-old hacker is a lawful military target under a DPCH theory consistent with the ICRC and Tallinn Manual. Assuming the child only gained access to the network to exploit information by posting it to the internet, the child would still be targetable because such an act would exploit a vulnerability to the benefit of Iran. Conversely, if the child's actions were directed at a U.S. banking network, then the child's actions would be considered a criminal matter, unless the intelligence demonstrates that the child's actions were connected to the exploitation of U.S. infrastructure vulnerabilities in support of Iran's military campaign.\n[71] Emily Crawford, *Virtual Battlegrounds: Direct Participation in Cyber Warfare*, 9 ISJLP 1, 15 (2013), available at http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/students/groups/is/files/2013/08/5-Crawford.pdf.\n[72] Daniel Cohen &amp; Aviv Rotbart, *The Use of Code Mutation to Produce Multi-use Cyber Weapons*, THE INSTITUTE FOR NATIONAL SECURITY STUDIES (Jul. 8, 2013), http://www.inss.org.il/index.aspx?id=4538&amp;articleid=5163.\n[73] Lisa Vaas, *12-year-old Canadian Boy Admits to Hacking Police and Government Sites for Anonymous*, NAKED SECURITY (Oct. 26, 2013), http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2013/10/26/12-year-old-canadian-boy-admits-to-hacking-police-and-government-sites-for-anonymous; David Kushner, *The Masked Avengers, How Anonymous Incited Online Vigilantism from Tunisia to Ferguson*, THE NEW YORKER (SEP. 8, 2014), http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/09/08/masked-avengers.\n[74] TALLINN MANUAL, *supra* note 5, at 119.\n[75] Turns, *supra* note 8, at 295.\n[76] *Id.*\n\nLXIV\n## B. Example Two: Hacktivist\nPatriotic hacktivism adds a different dimension to DPCH given that their activities may or may not cross the threshold of harm or have a nexus to the conflict. Russian hacktivists participated in a myriad of activities in Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in 2008. Similar to the above example, a hacktivist, who disrupts military networks through distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, is targetable regardless of his or her subjective underlying intent. However, the analysis will change depending on whether their activities disrupt military operations. Suppose during this U.S.-Iranian conflict, a hacktivist from Anonymous decides to deploy a conspicuous message on a high-traffic, non-DoD, U.S. Government website as a form of cyber-protest of the war. While criminal, these actions will not constitute DPCH if the hacker's actions do not have a belligerent nexus to the conflict, directly cause disruption to military operations, or cause physical harm. This scenario would be true if the hacktivist's actions were targeted against the Affordable Care Act or Department of Justice websites.\nOn a sliding scale, the analysis changes if the hacker leaves a conspicuous message on a DoD information website as a form of \"cyber-protest\" of the war. An analysis of those actions is required to determine if the message interferes or disrupts military operations in order to satisfy the belligerent nexus requirement (supporting Iran). For example, if it could be determined that the message was designed to undermine the morale of DoD users fighting the war or interfere with military members' readiness (e.g., disrupting military members' pay on the Defense Finance and Accounting Service website), the hacktivist is clearly targetable under LOAC. However, if a hacktivist's message or action cannot be readily connected to the conflict, he or she is still \"at risk of being targeted, as their attacks would be difficult to differentiate from attacks being conducted by persons with a connection to the hostilities.\"\n## C. Example Three: Malware Programmer\nOther roles, such as a malware programmer, are more complex to analyze for DPCH purposes because of the question of direct causation, no different from a weapons builder. Returning to the example of the U.S.-Iran conflict, a cyber-weapons programmer could have played a role in developing\n Id. at 293.\n Id. at 293, n.59.\n TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 119–20.\n Crawford, supra note 71, at 17.\n Id. at 16; see Turns, supra note 8, at 295.\n\nand providing the malware to the 13-year-old hacker. Whether the programmer is targetable depends on the nature of his or her involvement in supporting the hacker. According to the Tallinn Manual, if the programmer had specifically designed the malware for exploitation of a DoD vulnerability (e.g., a military logistics or finance website), then the malware programmer can be targeted. In this instance, the malware programmer's acts (designing a code to exploit a DoD vulnerability) directly cause the disruptive harm to the military's operations, directly benefiting Iran. Thus, the programmer can be lawfully engaged in addition to the 13-year-old executing the code. By analogy, an IED developer who designs bombs specifically to exploit U.S. military vehicles (e.g., up-armored HUMVEEs or MRAPs) is targetable under DPH.\nConversely, if the malware programmer's only activity is developing generalized malware made available on a website, then causation would not be satisfied given the remoteness of involvement. This permutation resembles someone ordering firearms from an online vendor. An online vendor of cyber weapons does not become targetable, unless it is demonstrated that this developer is selling specialized malware to undermine DoD systems during an armed conflict. On the other hand, if the programmer designs malware for the 13-year-old, unaware of the intended target, there may be two possible outcomes. The CCD COE members were divided on malware programmers in this scenario. Drawing from the analogy of an IED builder, if military intelligence can establish factors supporting the inference that malware is specifically designed to exploit military weaknesses, then the programmer is targetable, unlike a person developing Trojan Horse viruses downloadable via a website. In short, further targeting decisions of malware programmers will require additional indicia of direct causation.\n## D. Technical Support Personnel\nAs a final example, technical support personnel require consideration under a DPCH analysis. If the 13-year-old hacker solicits technical support, the nature of that individual's involvement will be a determining factor for DPCH. If the hacker contacts technical support to assist with hardware or system software issues pertaining to the computer, then the support personnel will not be targetable as they are neither connected to the conflict nor the direct cause of harm. This result would be the same if the technical personnel assisted with\n Turns, supra note 8, at 295.\n TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 120.\n Id.\n Id.\n Crawford, supra note 71, at 17.\n Id.\n\nLXIV\nhardware and software issues knowing the intentions of the hacker. These personnel are criminally liable for such actions under a domestic framework within the United States, but are not targetable under LOAC. On the other hand, if a malware programmer provides technical assistance or instructive guidance to the child hacker on refining malware to exploit DoD systems, then the programmer (as a technical advisor) would lose their protected status and be targetable consistent with the Tallinn Manual’s view of a DPCH framework.\n## V. Challenges\nThe cumulative criteria mentioned above provide only a starting point for understanding what actions render a civilian targetable under LOAC. The decision to use force against a non-state civilian actor who directly participates in hostilities raises a myriad of other issues that will require consideration by states engaged in armed conflict. Each topic is individually complex and could be explored in elaborate discussions beyond the scope of this article. Nevertheless, the below discussions are limited to understanding how a state should consider these issues prior to considering a response to a civilian who forfeits protection under DPCH. These scenarios assume that the non-state actor’s attacks are not attributable to the state.\n## A. Sovereignty\n“Longstanding notions of sovereignty fall apart when it comes to cyber operations.” This quote foretells of a complex predicament should neutral nations become the staging grounds for non-state actors launching cyber-attacks in either IACs or NIACs. Of equal importance, the manner in which a State responds to civilians participating in CW from outside the theater of hostilities presents a challenging issue given that such neutral States maintain the inherent right of self-defense pursuant to Article 51 of the U.N. Charter. For IACs, LOAC provides that belligerent nations are prohibited from actions that harm a neutral nation and draw it into the conflict in any fashion. Conversely, neutral\n *Id.* at 18.\n Eric Talbot Jensen, *Sovereignty and Neutrality in Cyber Conflict*, 35 FORDHAM INT’L L.J. 815, 816 (2012) (citing David Perera, *Schmidle: Cyber Ops Might Require New Combatant Command Structure*, FIERCEGOVERNMENTIT (May 15, 2011, 4:29 PM), http://www.fiercegovernmentit.com/story/schmidle-cyber-ops-might-require-newcombatant-command-structure/2011-05-15 (quoting Lieutenant General Robert Schmidle, Deputy Commander of US Cyber Command)).\n *Id.*; see also UN Charter art. 51.\n Jensen, *supra* note 89, at 819; see also INT’L COMM.

While it is arguable that the law of neutrality does not extend to NIACs, the international law principle of *sic utere* provides that a state cannot knowingly allow its territory to be used to the detriment of another. Moreover, as illustrated in the *Nicaragua v. United States* case, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) supported the proposition that states engaged in non-international conflict enjoy a right of non-interference from outside parties.\nTo illustrate, suppose the non-state actor sponsored 13-year-old hacker launches a cyber-attack against the United States from Switzerland in support of Iran. Notwithstanding the existence of an extradition treaty, Switzerland has had a history of harboring U.S. fugitives. In this scenario, suppose also that the United States locates and identifies the attacker. If the Swiss preclude this individual from attacking further but refuse to extradite, then the United States would no longer be able to target this individual under the temporal considerations of a LOAC analysis. Alternatively, if the Swiss take no action at all or are unable to prevent harm from occurring, then the United States would find itself in a predicament that theoretically draws a comparison of physical terrorist attacks launched from lawless countries, including (pre-9/11) Afghanistan or Somalia.

The United Nations Charter of 1945 and Security Council decisions based on the Charter may in certain circumstances modify the law of neutrality. For example, Article 2(5) of the Charter requires UN Member States to give the UN every assistance in any action it takes, and Article 25 requires UN members to accept and comply with the decisions of the Security Council; the enforcement measures spelled out in Chapter VII can also have an impact, as they are governed by particular rules which differ from those of the law of neutrality.”).\n Jensen, *supra* note 89, at 819.\n Jutta Brunnée, *Sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas*, in *9 MAX PLANCK ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW* 188 (2012); See also Jack Goldsmith, *Thoughts on the Latest Round of Johnson v.

Moreover, the United States can target the 13-year-old kinetically for committing cyber-attacks against its military consistent with the cumulative factors under the Tallinn Manual's view.\nBoth responses would be proffered as an “unwilling or unable” international law argument. Although scholars support this standard’s incorporation into customary international law, the ICJ rejected it on several occasions and thus, the “unwilling or unable” doctrine remains contentious and unsettled within customary international law (CIL). Should the United States invoke this standard, as in the case of Afghanistan in 2002, a U.S. response without Switzerland’s permission could result in strong political and military repercussions. Unlike Afghanistan before September 2001, Switzerland is not a lawless State, but still bears the responsibility under the *sic utere* doctrine to prevent international cyber-attacks from occurring within its national borders. In response to a U.S. kinetic or non-kinetic attack against the hacker, the Swiss could bring the issue to the ICJ. Switzerland could also respond militarily or in the cyber domain in self-defense against the United States. Given the permutations involved, this scenario illustrates the several considerations the United States would confront in conducting a counter-attack against a hacker located in a neutral State that refuses to cooperate.\n## B. Law of Targeting Considerations\nIf the United States responds to this hacker in the cyber or physical domain, “targeting law” will certainly apply in both cases. “Targeting law” evaluates whether the weapon’s employment (methodology) would violate the general principles of LOAC. The general principles of LOAC involve military necessity, distinction, proportionality, and humanity. For the purposes of kinetic operations using conventional means in the physical domain, targeting law remains well settled. As noted in the Tallinn Manual, these concepts do apply in the cyber domain and will require further examination. “Military necessity may be defined as the principle that justifies the use of all measures needed to defeat the enemy as quickly and efficiently as possible that are not prohibited by the law of war.” Thus, military commanders must act in a manner necessary for advancing military objectives and ensure that their actions\n Goldsmith, *supra* note 93.\n *Id.*\n Jeffrey S. Thurnher, *The Law that Applies to Autonomous Weapon Systems*, 17 AM. SOC’Y INT’L L. INSIGHTS (Jan. 18, 2013), http://www.asil.org/insights/volume/17/issue/4/law-applies-autonomous-weapon-systems.\n U.S. DEP’T. OF DEF., DOD LAW OF WAR MANUAL 50 (JUNE 2015),\n *Id.* at 52. See also IAN HENDERSON, THE CONTEMPORARY LAW OF TARGETING 7 (2009).\n\nare not otherwise prohibited by another principle of LOAC. As a principle, military necessity not only tolerates violence towards the enemy but alternative operations which influence or impede the enemy (e.g. psychological operations, electronic jamming, intelligence operations). As applied, cyber-attacks may be employed against military objectives provide such actions do not violate the principles of proportionality, humanity, and distinction.\n“Humanity” implies that belligerents should not cause unnecessary suffering. The CCD COE posits that “[m]eans and methods of cyber warfare will only in rare cases violate this Rule.” However, the Tallinn Manual illustrates a possible violation of this rule through hacking into a victim’s pacemaker to stop the target’s heart and then reviving him multiple times before finally killing him. An example could include hacking into pharmaceutical records for the purpose of prescribing medications aimed at causing long-term allergic reactions leading to death. Using a cyber-attack to poison or corrupt a military water supply serves as another example as strictly prohibited as a violation of this LOAC principle. Given the ramifications, U.S. policy would exclude attacking this hacker through means that cause unnecessary suffering.\nAs mentioned earlier, “distinction” requires combatants to distinguish between lawful military targets (opposing combatants and their equipment and facilities) and protected persons (e.g., civilians, medical personnel, chaplains, hors de combat) and property. However, in DPH and DPCH targeting contexts, distinction requires discriminating between civilians who have forfeited protection from those civilians and related objects that retain protection. Thus, if the United States were to conduct a non-kinetic cyber-attack against the 13-year-old hacker via a Swiss server, the United States would need to utilize malware that targets the offending computer only with no adverse effect or corruption of the server or other resident users. Similarly, if the 13-year-old hacker were using a Wi-Fi café in a Swiss hospital, the United States would not be able to attack the hospital’s server given that it is protected. If the United States can transmit a response (e.g., a DDoS attack) through the Wi-Fi café router that only impacts the targeted computer, then distinction would be otherwise satisfied. Similarly, targeting servers for non-kinetic (e.g., DDoS) or kinetic (e.g., Stuxnet-type virus) purposes requires verification of the hacker’s location. Therefore, the United States would need intelligence models on the systems’ architects and servers in order to modify malware to distinguish civilian perpetrators from protected persons.\n Id. at 52.\n Id. at 53.\n TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 144.\n Id.\nNaval Law Review\nLXIV\nTraditionally, the term civilian objects implied buildings, utilities (e.g., power lines), and related infrastructure. For cyber considerations, civilian objects would include such items as servers, computers, and related hardware. Data is also considered a protected object, especially if the data on a resident server is owned by a protected civilian. As mentioned, the CCD COE specifically chose not exclude data from the ambit of the term “attack.” This is especially true where malware is directed against data that physical objects rely upon for functionality. Thus, a cyber-attack that damages protected civilian data would violate the rules of distinction. While the data’s restoration via a backup could serve as a test for targeting, this is not the test used for physical property since buildings can be rebuilt, and cars can be remanufactured over time. Thus, this issue remains unsettled and a consideration for distinction. As applied, if the Wi-Fi café shares the same servers which contain patients’ records and data, then the intentional damage to such data would violate this principle.\nTargeting law also requires a “proportionality” analysis. The Tallinn Manual restates the requirements for proportionality codified in customary international law and in AP I:\nA cyber[-]attack that may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated is prohibited.\nWhile this principle is simply stated, proportionality is entirely subjective given that comparing the value of a military advantage to damage to civilians is tantamount to comparing “apples to oranges.” The analysis becomes case-specific, based on the nature of the target and the national thresholds for collateral damage. As applied, if the United States decides to conduct a DDoS attack against the 13-year-old hacker in Switzerland in a hospital Wi-Fi café, then the United States will have to assess the effects of the DDoS attack on that network and whether the resultant collateral damage can be mitigated by modifying the malware. By comparison, such modifications are consistent with DoD Collateral Damage Estimation Methodologies (CDEM) for\n *Id.* at 108, 113.\n HENDERSON, *supra* note 102, at 7.\n TALLINN MANUAL, *supra* note 5, at 159 (Rule 51).\n KENNETH ANDERSON &amp; MATTHEW WAXMAN, LAW AND ETHICS FOR AUTONOMOUS WEAPON SYSTEMS: WHY A BAN WON’T WORK AND HOW THE LAWS OF WAR CAN 12 (2013), available at http://www.hoover.org/publications/monographs/144241.\n TALLINN MANUAL, *supra* note 5, at 113.\n\nconventional weapons so as to avoid malware collaterally spreading or damaging other users, data, or networks. An analysis of the Stuxnet malware revealed fail-safe features such as code that limited the infection to Siemens systems, the number of devices that each infected device could infect, and the self-destruct code erasing the virus on June 24, 2012. Regardless of the overall effectiveness of the fail-safe measures, they illustrate “the inherent caution” of Stuxnet’s creators as an attempt to prevent further damage to other systems. Nations attempting to develop more sophisticated cyber weapons will need to consider proportionality issues and collateral damage.\n## VI. Practical Responses to Civilians who Directly Participate\nDespite challenges associated with cyber-warfare, States have a right of self-defense against civilians who conduct cyber-attacks during an armed conflict setting. While political and diplomatic measures remain available, the foregoing discussion provides an understanding of the nature of each response to a DPCH scenario assuming the offending civilian is located and attributed to the action. For the purposes of this framework, the U.S.-Iran armed conflict scenario discussed earlier will be utilized again.\n## A. Non-kinetic Responses\nNon-kinetic response can be acknowledged or covert as discussed below. Cyber defenses, for example, can be employed to have a non-kinetic effect depending upon their intended effect and usage. If a hacker attempts to gain access into an otherwise prohibited system, the host system can utilize a defense that can essentially block such access with no further effect. More active cyber defenses include tracking hackers’ computers, hacking back into systems to retrieve data, shutting down systems, sabotaging data, infecting the attacker with malware, taking over the attacker’s botnet, or employing a botnet to track or attack the hacker’s computer. While active defense responses to DPCH seem plausible, LOAC principles must be taken into consideration. For instance, if a DoD system conducts an active defense hack-back or counter-attack using\n CDEM assesses the likelihood of collateral damage for conventional weapons based on several factors, such as types of weapons, employment tactics, proximity of civilian structures.

REV. 1 (2005).\n Michael J.

A more interesting question is how such systems can distinguish between a criminal hacker and a LOAC hacker. At a minimum, in both cases, employing an active defense capable of preserving evidence and intelligence related to this hacker and operation will be critical for potential prosecution or follow-on responses. Offensive cyber capabilities with non-kinetic effects would employ similar effects described for active defenses. The distinction is that offensive capabilities would not necessarily occur as an automatic response from a computer, but rather a directed operation.\n## B. Kinetic Responses\nResponding to a cyber-attack kinetically raises questions regarding escalation. A response can take on two forms: a conventional attack (e.g., a missile) or a cyber-attack with physical effects (e.g., Stuxnet). Due to political and diplomatic considerations, use of force by the United States will require nothing short of Presidential authorization. In the instance of international armed conflict, the legal framework for employing a kinetic attack against a designated hostile force or individual (e.g., via AUMF or “targeted killing”) is well settled. A cyber-attack with kinetic effects directed against designated hostile forces in a theater of combat is legally supportable. Similarly, the targeted killing of a U.S. terrorist in self-defense is also considered consistent with U.S. domestic law, whether conducted with a drone strike or a kinetic cyber-attack. As scholar Hays Parks notes, the targeted killing of a legitimate enemy is not assassination. If a civilian forfeits protection due to DPCH attacks or serves as a cyber-terrorist causing physical harm to U.S. civilians, he or she can be lawfully targeted with a kinetic attack. With this understanding, there will be some additional considerations.\nIf the 13-year-old hacker is in Iran during the U.S.-Iranian conflict, the United States could escalate to kinetic force against the child no differently from an insurgent planting IEDs or shooting at a military convoy. On the other hand, kinetic operations during a cyber-only conflict expand the range of options available to the hostile nation for targeting a civilian cyber-attacker within its borders. In other words, Iran would be able to escalate to kinetic force in self-defense. Thus, in a cyber-only conflict, targeting this hacker kinetically may\n *Id.*\n *US to Outline Legal Backing for ‘Targeted Kill’ Programme*, THE GUARDIAN (Mar. 1, 2012, 2:58 AM), http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/05/us-legal-backing-targeted-kill-programme.\n W. Hays Parks, *Memorandum of Law: Executive Order 12333 and Assassination*, ARMY LAW., Dec. 1989, at 4.\n Herbert Lin, *Escalation Dynamics and Conflict Termination in Cyberspace*, STRAT. STUD. Q. 46, 65 (2012).\n\nundoubtedly escalate the conflict and requires political considerations. These considerations are heightened if kinetic force is applied to or within neutral nations as mentioned in Part IV. A kinetic response to a cyber-attack will require a case-by-case analysis of the nature of the cyber-attack’s operation, intended target(s), and underlying strategic significance. At a minimum, kinetic action, whether conducted through conventional or cyber-attacks, should be limited in scope and duration, consistent with self-defense proportionality principles, in order to avert an unnecessary escalation.\n## C. Covert Action\nIn most cases, the benefit of acknowledged non-kinetic or kinetic cyber-attacks against a neutral nation will be significantly outweighed by the diplomatic, economic, and military backlashes that would occur. Such acts would undoubtedly be perceived as an act of aggression by the United Nations, as interpreted by the ICJ. For these reasons, covert action represents a readily available solution while CIL develops in this area. Responding to non-state actors performing cyber-attacks from neutral states presents complex issues given the potential of affronting neutrality and widening the conflict. The stealthy nature of cyber warfare enables covert action as use of the cyber domain enables anonymity, takes advantage of targeted individuals’ awareness, and utilizes speed that overcomes the ability to readily safeguard against the consequences. Returning to the earlier scenario involving the child hacker located in Switzerland, the United States could consider covert action to thwart this non-state actor. This scenario presumes that Switzerland is uncooperative in extraditing or precluding this child from committing cyber-attacks against the United States.\nFirst, the United States could consider a targeted killing operation against this individual within Swiss borders. The targeting of this child for DPCH in support of Iran would not be considered an assassination as prohibited by Executive Order 12333. Under U.S. domestic law, an Authorization to Use Military Force will be required to authorize targeted killings. This requirement was illustrated in the U.S. campaign against al-Qaeda. Assuming the U.S.-Iranian conflict contains an AUMF, language should be included to at least authorize the killing of supporting parties for DPCH, regardless of location. This\n *Id.* at 61.\n See generally UN Charter, arts. 2(4), 51; see also Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicar. v.

Alternatively, even if an AUMF does not have broader language, a covert targeted killing would still be lawful if it can be established that the killing was required in self-defense consistent with Article 51 of the UN Charter. To prevent attribution of such killing within Swiss borders, the United States could use military means, such as Special Forces operations analogous to those employed during the Osama bin Laden raid.\nSecond, covert action could also be conducted for rendition of the child to prosecute him in the United States. The practice of rendition (also referred to as irregular rendition) is typically defined as the kidnapping or taking of an individual to move that person to the jurisdiction of another country.[124] This is distinguished from extraordinary rendition which involves transferring the individual to a foreign country for the purposes of detention and interrogation by a foreign government.[125] Rendition does not deprive U.S. courts of jurisdiction unless an applicable extradition treaty explicitly calls for that result and that treaty has been given legislative effect within U.S. domestic law.[126] Since the U.S.-Swiss extradition treaty contains no rendition language, the United States would not be barred from exercising jurisdiction and prosecuting this individual.[127] A covert action for rendition would resemble a raid using either special operations or U.S. law enforcement.\nFinally, covert action could be carried out against this individual via cyber means. A cyber-attack could have a non-kinetic or kinetic impact, as discussed earlier, and would be a more tenable solution if the originator of the attack were unknown. A covert operation employing cyber capabilities would require a complex number of variables beyond the scope of this article. Needless to say, such an operation would involve understanding the location of the child, a breakdown of the child's activities (pattern of life), an understanding of the targeted system's architecture, and other variables. A covert, non-kinetic cyberattack could be aimed at locating, tracking, and denying access to the 13-year-old hacker via the child's computer or home internet service provider. This kind of non-kinetic operation could be aimed at developing further intelligence on the child's activities for further planning should the child continue his or her attacks.\n\nA covert kinetic cyber-attack could vary greatly. Malware could be used to destroy the child’s data or to render the child’s computer unusable. On the other hand, if the desired effect is to kill the 13-year-old hacker, then a more elaborate cyber-attack would be required. Should the child need a pacemaker or medical assistance, a potential attack would include using malware or other cyber technique to kill the hacker, provided that the prohibition against unnecessary suffering was enforced. “CyberJacking,” the act of remotely taking control of someone’s vehicle, could be used as cyber means of a targeted killing. In this past summer’s BlackHat conference, two researchers demonstrated how they could control a car using their laptop while within the car. Such capabilities could easily be weaponized to target this 13-year-old hacker, assuming that the killing of the civilian driver or other occupants as collateral damage would be proportionally acceptable under the circumstances.\n## VII. Conclusion\nIn summary, DPCH will remain an ongoing concern in the coming years given the lack of an international consensus on the basic legal principles governing hostilities in the cyber domain. At a minimum, the Tallinn Manual’s DPCH framework provides clear guidance derived from IHL that will enable states to respond to civilian hackers who undertake hostilities in armed conflict while seeking to prevent collateral damage. While developing a cyber-hostilities treaty appears as a readily available solution, the sharp disagreement among states (e.g., the United States, Great Britain, France, China, Russia) on the basic principle of regulating the cyber domain makes such treaty a fleeting prospect. Nevertheless, states always retain the inherent authority of self-defense, regardless of the lack of international consensus concerning cyber hostilities. Thus, IHL provides an immediate legal framework for cyber operations. Over time, these practices will refine and crystalize into customary international law through State practice and opinio juris. Although international consensus seems unattainable, regional or organization practices such as the NATO effort in the Tallinn Manual support the development of CIL in those regions. While the cyber domain requires an analysis of the nature of hostilities, the principles of IHL govern the conduct of these hostilities in order to safeguard against collateral damage while preserving a state’s right of self-defense.\n Scott Schweitzer, *CyberJacking, Sophisticated Assassination*, CYBER WEAPONS &amp; WARFARE (Oct. 6, 2013, 8:55 AM), http://cyberweapons.blogspot.com/.\n *Id.* The BlackHat conference is a yearly event where thousands of security experts gather to discuss information security and expose vulnerabilities at the pertaining to computers, networks and other related digital media.

Advancements in technology and the advent of the internet have created new issues that current bodies of law do not directly reference or address. Traditional notions of armed attack and invasion, which were transparent over the course of the twentieth century, are now reconsidered in light of cyber domain. Given an “inability to live at peace,” humanity has already developed and employed weapons vis-à-vis the cyber domain as illustrated through the Stuxnet incident. Through Stuxnet, humanity has demonstrated that computer-originated attacks can result in kinetic effects. Equally concerning, the cyber domain has created a new battlefield where traditional understandings of “combatants” require reexamination.

With the possibility of this trend, governments will need to develop a legal framework for responding to civilians who directly participate in cyber hostilities.\nIn physical warfare settings, the principle of distinction requires belligerents to differentiate between combatants and civilians under the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC). Under LOAC, civilians enjoy protection from being the direct target of armed attack. The notion of Direct Participation in Hostilities (DPH) provides that a civilian loses this protection for undertaking combat operations against military forces in an armed conflict. This concept became relevant in the U.S. campaigns in Iraq, Afghanistan, the Global War on Terror, and other overseas contingency operations. In these conflicts, U.S. forces confronted the problem by positively identifying and engaging a civilian determined to be directly participating in hostilities. Combining the complexity of DPH with the cyber domain presents a conundrum because, unlike traditional warfare, civilians who can directly participate in cyber hostilities need not be physically located within the theater of hostilities. A hacker who undertakes hostilities can attack from any location in the world with a laptop and internet access. Therefore, the issue of direct participation in cyber hostilities (DPCH) has many factors that will require analysis in order to develop a legal framework for response.\nThis article stands for the proposition that a civilian who directly participates in hostilities in the cyber domain forfeits protection and becomes a lawful target. In support, this article will first highlight the background and law applicable to DPCH in general. In particular, this article will discuss the factors that render a civilian targetable by analyzing the traditional framework of DPH as applied through the Tallinn Manual. This discussion will include an understanding of what constitutes an “attack” and provide examples of which hostile roles render civilians targetable. Next, this article will discuss some of the challenges that leaders will confront in responding to issues involving DPCH. These issues include sovereignty and “targeting law” under LOAC. However, this article will provide a framework that contemplates non-kinetic, kinetic, and covert action.\n Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of August 12, 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts art. 51(3), adopted June 8, 1977, 1125 U.N.T.S. 3 [hereinafter Additional Protocol I]; Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts art. 13(3), adopted June 8, 1977, 1125 U.N.T.S. 609 [hereinafter Additional Protocol II].\n TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE (Michael N. Schmitt ed., 2013) [hereinafter TALLINN MANUAL].\n\nPouring New Wine Into Old Bottles\n## II. Background: Direct Participation in Hostilities, Cyber Warfare, and the Law\nCurrently, there is no clear international consensus on many cyber warfare (CW) issues, least of all DPCH. Moreover, customary international law (State practice and opinio juris) has not developed or crystallized as found in other areas of International Humanitarian Law (IHL). The ability to detect and defend against such attacks, whether State-sponsored or not, has become exceedingly difficult given the speed and regularity of occurrences within the cyber domain generally. On the subject of \"imminence\" alone, U.S. Government officials struggle to develop policy that applies traditional concepts to determine whether a strike in self-defense is justified or is preventative war and thus prohibited as an unprovoked act of aggression. Furthermore, unlike traditional combat, IHL applicability to CW has not been tested before the International Court of Justice (ICJ). Therefore, CW does not cleanly fit into the hostilities paradigm for which LOAC was created. It is analogous to pouring a new wine into an old bottle.\nNevertheless, IHL will serve as a baseline to regulate the conduct of CW until greater international consensus is reached. The fact that IHL does not specifically reference cyber operations does not imply that such operations are not subject to IHL, especially given the possibilities of physical harm caused by CW.[11] Thus, as an international cyber warfare legal framework does not currently exist, the applied \"law\" is national policy interpreting and incorporating IHL as a foundation. Given the Frankenstein-like nature of this framework and uncertainties associated with cyber weapons, many national policies will not be readily transparent.[12] For example, many of the U.S. authorities and policies applicable to CW remain classified and withheld at the\n[^6]: Jean-Marie Henckaerts, *Study on Customary International Humanitarian Law: A Contribution to the Understanding and Respect For the Rule of Law in Armed Conflict*, 87 INT'L REV.

At a minimum, the United States has acknowledged IHL’s applicability to CW. Moreover, U.S. policy runs parallel with the experts who authored the Tallinn Manual from NATO’s Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCD COE), who argue that traditional notions of IHL apply to CW. Therefore, this article will analyze DPCH through IHL and the Tallinn Manual as a developmental framework.\nWithin IHL, the principle of distinction between combatants and civilians serves as the starting point for DPCH. While principally derived from customary international law and the 1907 Hague Convention, contemporary notions of distinction are codified in Article 48 of Additional Protocol I (AP I) to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, which provides: “In order to ensure respect for and protection of the civilian population and civilian objects, the Parties to the conflict shall at all times distinguish between the civilian population and combatants and between civilian objects and military objectives and accordingly shall direct their operations only against military objectives.” Thus, civilians enjoy protection from an armed attack as a generally accepted principle under IHL. Under the principle of distinction, parties to a conflict are required to distinguish between the civilian population and objects, and from otherwise lawful targets (e.g., military combatants). The United States and CCD COE acknowledged this requirement of distinction is required in CW.\nThe notion of DPH, derived from Article 51(3) of AP I, provides that civilians shall enjoy protection from armed attack “unless and for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities” for international armed conflicts (IAC). The notion is virtually identical for non-international armed conflicts (NIAC) as\n *Id.*\n Harold H. Koh, *International Law in Cyberspace*, 54 HARV. INT’L.

While civilians are subject to lawful targeting while taking direct part in hostilities, they are only lawful targets “for such time as” or while they actually commit hostile acts directly producing harmful effects to an enemy. This preceding language providing for a temporal requirement remains controversial. Institutions such as the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) interpret this section very restrictively to mean that such civilians can only be targeted until he or she has returned to the pre-deployment location. Thus, if a civilian conducts repeated attacks, that civilian will regain protection upon return from each engagement. This remains highly debated among scholars and the ICRC. Other scholars take a broader view, allowing for targeting of a civilian long after he or she has lost protection. For the purposes of cyber-conflict, the CCD COE agreed that the temporal requirement would at least include actions immediately preceding or subsequent to the qualifying act. However, the CCD COE experts were split on the time between repeated attacks. Thus, this issue is unresolved in both physical and cyber domains and will become a policy decision vis-à-vis rules of engagement or operational orders. This article will assume a broad view allowing for targeting in between attacks.\n## III. The Cumulative Factors of DPCH\nWhile the ICRC has not published similar comprehensive guidance on DPCH or CW, the ICRC’s DPH guidance remains helpful as discussed infra. Moreover, the ICRC contributed to the development of the Tallinn Manual and generally agrees with the rules developed with some exceptions. In particular, many of the notions for resolving DPCH issues are derived from the ICRC’s interpretive guidance on DPH. Thus, the Tallinn Manual remains the most comprehensive work that serves as DPCH guidance within the framework of IHL. Rule 35 of the Tallinn Manual provides that an act of direct participation in hostilities by civilians renders them liable to be attacked, by cyber or other\n\nNaval Law Review\nLXIV\nlawful means. Similar to AP I and AP II, Rule 35 describes that civilians are targetable “for such time as he or she is engaged in the qualifying act of direct participation.” Rule 35 sets forth the three cumulative criteria (threshold of harm, direct causation, and belligerent nexus) for qualification of an act as direct participation in cyber hostilities that are derived from the ICRC interpretive guidance. This rule also provides discussion regarding specific nuances within each of the three factors require case-by-case consideration in order for a civilian to be targeted for losing protection as a result of DPCH.\n## A. Understanding an Attack: Threshold of Harm\nPer Article 49(1) of AP I, “attacks” are acts of violence against the adversary, whether in offense or in defense. To illustrate, military convoys in Iraq or Afghanistan would be able to target, in self-defense, a roadside Improvised Explosive Device (IED) bomber or sniper for engaging in a hostile act amounting to an attack. On the other hand, a civilian who simply stands in the middle of the road holding up a sign in protest does not qualify as an attack. Targeting this protestor would be prohibited under IHL unless that civilian committed or attempt to commit an act that amounts to direct participation. By analogy, the aforementioned Stuxnet worm would clearly illustrate a kinetic attack given the resultant physical damage to Iranian centrifuges. Conversely, the same conclusion would not easily be reached for “hacktivists,” who protest by spamming computer networks with protest e-mails. Therefore, to understand the definition of “cyber-attack,” an analysis of the “threshold of harm” associated with it is required. Factors involved in this analysis include: “the context of the event, the actor perpetrating the action (recognizing\n TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 118.\n Id.\n Id.\n Id. at 119-121.\n Additional Protocol I, supra note 4, art. 49(1); see also TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 106. (“[I]t is the use of violence against a target that distinguishes attacks from other military operations. Non-violent operations, such as psychological cyber operations or cyber espionage, do not qualify as attacks. ‘Acts of violence’ should not be understood as limited to activities that release kinetic force. . . . In this regard, note that chemical, biological, or radiological attacks do not usually have a kinetic effect on their designated target, but it is universally agreed that they constitute attacks as a matter of law.”)\n\n Hacktivism is defined as the use of computer hacking to help advance political or social causes. See Mark Manion &amp; Abby Goodrum, Terrorism or Civil Disobedience: Toward a Hacktivist Ethic, 30 COMPUTERS &amp; SOC’Y 14 (2000).\n\nchallenging issues of attribution in cyberspace), the target and location, [and] effects and intent, among other possible issues.”\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) defines “cyber-attack” as:\nA hostile act using computer or related networks or systems, and intended to disrupt and/or destroy an adversary’s critical cyber systems, assets, or functions. The intended effects of cyber-attack are not necessarily limited to the targeted computer systems or data themselves—for instance, attacks on computer systems which are intended to degrade or destroy infrastructure or [command and control] capability. A cyber-attack may use intermediate delivery vehicles including peripheral devices, electronic transmitters, embedded code, or human operators. The activation or effect of a cyber-attack may be widely separated temporally and geographically from the delivery.\nThe U.S. definition provides some inference that a cyber-attack need not physically destroy systems to qualify as an attack. Rather, disruption of these systems will suffice as meeting a threshold of harm.\nBy comparison, the ICRC’s DPH guidance provides some level of amplification on this point, despite not directly speaking about DPCH or CW specifically. The ICRC indicates that the threshold of harm for DPH is satisfied when the civilian’s actions adversely affect military operations or the military capacity of a party to the conflict. The ICRC states that the denial of an adversary’s military use of certain objects, equipment, and territory would reach the required threshold of harm. The ICRC specifically notes that the electronic interference with military computer networks would fall into this category of denial, whether accomplished through computer network attacks (CNA) or computer network exploitation (CNE). As cybersecurity strategist Joshua\n Koh, supra note 14, at 4; see also Schmitt, supra note 14, at 19.\n Memorandum from Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to Chiefs of the Military Services et al., subject: Joint Terminology for Cyberspace Operations (Nov. 2010) [hereinafter “Joint Terminology for Cyberspace Operations”].\n Id.\n ICRC DPH GUIDANCE, supra note 23, at 48.\n Id.\n Id. at 48. CNA is defined as a “category of fires employed for offensive purposes in which actions are taken through the use of computer networks to disrupt, deny, degrade, manipulate, or destroy information resident in the target system or computer networks, or the systems/networks themselves.”; CNE is defined as “[e]nabling operations and intelligence collection capabilities conducted through the use of computer networks to gather data about target or adversary automated\n\nLXIV\nCorman notes, a cyber-attack is essentially no different from electronic warfare where an adversary denies military use of equipment through jamming or interfering with a network. Thus, a civilian who engages in actions tantamount to interference with military communications or operations through CNA (e.g., a Denial of Service operation) or CNE would constitute a DPCH attack in ICRC’s view.\nThe Tallinn Manual thus incorporates the ICRC’s notion by stating that:\n[T]he act (or a closely related series of acts) must have the intended or actual effect of negatively affecting the adversary’s military operations or capabilities, or inflicting death, physical harm, or material destruction on persons or objects protected against direct attack (threshold of harm).\nThe CCD COE experts provide that a cyber-attack that satisfies the “threshold of harm” is an operation that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects. The CCD COE was very specific that this “limitation should not be understood as excluding cyber operations against data (which are non-physical entities) from the ambit of the term attack.” This is especially true if an operation against data upon which the functionality of physical objects relies can sometimes constitute an attack.\nHowever, for the purposes of DPCH against military adversaries, the CCD COE clarifies that there is no requirement for physical damage to objects or harm to individuals so long as a cyber-attack negatively affects enemy military operations. For example, a cyber-attack that disrupts the operation of the military’s command and control network would satisfy the criterion. Disruption in this context does not mean physical damage to servers, data, or computers. Rather, it simply implies interference, no different from radio or radar jamming. This proposition is consistent with the ICRC’s view under DPH. Stated negatively, if these actions were not directed at an adversary’s military capability, the ICRC requires that the “specific act must be likely to cause at\ninformation systems or networks.” See Joint Terminology for Cyberspace Operations, supra note 37, at 3-4.\n Skype Interview with cybersecurity strategist Joshua Corman, Chief Technology Officer at Sonatype (Sept. 23, 2013) (video recordation on file with author).\n TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 119.\n Id. at 107.\n Id. at 107–08.\n Id. at 119.\n Id.\n Id.\n\nPouring New Wine Into Old Bottles\nleast death, injury, or destruction” of property in order to reach this threshold of harm. Thus, the ICRC’s notion as applied to CW means that a civilian hacker interfering with a civilian computer system (e.g., Social Security), instead of the military, would not necessarily lose protection for that purpose unless it can be demonstrated that either the cyber-attack against the non-military network was intended to have an effect on the military in some fashion or that physical harm would otherwise result.\nAs an aside, this notion of physical harm to a non-military network need not be defined in the physical destruction associated with a kinetic strike. An emerging trend is to define physical harm in the cyber domain as the level of effect on the functionality of the targeted object. Some experts argue that if a cyber-attack impairs the functionality such that physical components require replacement, then this would constitute damage as envisaged in the concept of attack. Other experts provide that physical component replacement is not required; loss of functionality through data corruption requiring software reinstallation or network rebooting would constitute “physical damage.” While the physical damage standard is not required for military networks, understanding this disparity is important if cyber-attacks against non-military networks occur as part of greater campaign during an armed conflict.\n## B. Direct Causation\nThe ICRC guidance provides that there must be a direct causation from the civilian act to the harm suffered for the act to potentially constitute DPH. In particular, the ICRC states: “there must be a direct causal link between a specific act and the harm likely to result either from that act, or from a coordinated military operation of which that act constitutes an integral part.” In terms of a physical context, this implies that the harm suffered cannot be the result of an indirect or secondary order effect. The Tallinn Manual aligns with the ICRC’s DPH analysis by requiring the existence of “a direct causal link between the act in question and the harm intended or inflicted.” In CW, this standard appears easier to fulfill than in the physical combat scenario, where “fog of war” tends to complicate the issue. By analogy, if a civilian farmer fires his weapon at another local national to ward off livestock poaching, the sound of gunfire or the physical impact of a bullet may incite a nearby military patrol to\n ICRC DPH GUIDANCE, supra note 23, at 49.\n Droege, supra note 11, at 557–58.\n TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 108.\n Id. at 109.\n ICRC DPH GUIDANCE, supra note 23, at 50–51.\n Id. at 51.\n TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 119.\nNaval Law Review\nLXIV\nengage in self-defense. In some instances, mere possession and public display of personal weapons, could be perceived as a threat without additional accompanying acts.\nOn the other hand, CW will not suffer from the same “fog of war” issue. The use of a cyber-weapon to deny a military’s capability or interfere with a military operation can hardly be seen as incidental or an indirect cause. The Tallinn Manual supports this point through the example of disruption to the enemy’s command and control as being directly caused by a cyber-attack. Therefore, if a civilian hacker gained access into a military network to exploit or disrupt the network, that civilian’s acts would be the direct cause of the harm suffered, rendering him or her targetable. As a counterpoint, this theory should not discount the possibility of accidental cyber-attacks by civilian entities or individuals. There are potential scenarios where technology companies or independent contractors could theoretically accidentally release malware onto a network. However, the Tallinn Manual and ICRC guidance on direct causation does not address the underlying intentions behind the action. Thus, the challenge with these scenarios is that they reinforce the notion of reasonable precautions within IHL (i.e., the obligation to take reasonable precautions to avoid or minimize incidental civilian losses). Therefore, while fog of war is relatively diminished, prior to responding to a cyber-attack premised upon DPCH, reasonable precautions (e.g., reviewing human, electronic, and signals intelligence; verifying the source of the attack; using the least destructive means available to neutralize the threat) should be taken to minimize potentially attacking an otherwise innocent party.\n## C. Belligerent Nexus\nThe ICRC DPH guidance provides that:\nIn order to meet the requirement of belligerent nexus, an act must be specifically designed to directly cause the required threshold of harm in support of a party to the conflict and to the detriment of another.\n Id. at 119–20.\n Id. at 120.\n Additional Protocol I, supra note 4, art. 57(1); see also Customary IHL—Rule 15. Precautions in Attack, INT’L COMM. OF THE RED CROSS, http://www.icrc.org/customary-ibl/eng/docs/v1_cha_chapter5_rule15 (last visited July 30, 2014) (suggesting that Article 13(1) of Additional Protocol II implies this obligation); TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 164–65.\n See generally TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 159–176 (Rules 51–58).\n ICRC DPH GUIDANCE, supra note 23, at 58.\n\nHostile acts such as firing a weapon at an enemy or planting a bomb serve as easy examples. As a qualifying statement, the ICRC notes that acts that do not satisfy the threshold of harm are “non-belligerent . . . and, therefore, must be addressed through law enforcement measures.” 61 A seminal example is the IED maker whose actions contribute to hostilities without necessarily being connected to the conflict. In this example, if the intelligence shows that the IED maker is developing and supplying bombs for the insurgents as a part of an ongoing campaign, then he/she is targetable. This analysis will change if he/she is just selling them to the insurgents. The ICRC also provides that the belligerent nexus element does not require a subjective intent determination, where the state of mind of the person is at issue in committing the act.62 The ICRC posits that a belligerent nexus requires an objective standard expressed in the design of the act or operation which does not depend on the mindset of every participating individual.63 Belligerent nexus is generally not influenced by factors such as personal distress or preferences, or by the mental ability or willingness of persons to assume responsibility for their conduct. Consequently, if an insurgent is forced or coerced in some manner to commit an attack, he/she would still be lawfully targetable under IHL.\nAs applied, the Tallinn Manual expounds on the ICRC’s belligerent nexus notion by stating that cyber acts must be directly related to the hostilities between parties to a conflict.64 By example, if a civilian directs a cyber-attack against a military’s command and control node, his or her actions would satisfy this condition as it impacts a military force to the benefit of the opposition. Equally, if a hacker were coerced to commit this cyber-attack, he or she would lose protection and become lawfully targetable. The Tallinn Manual’s criterion rules out acts of a purely criminal or private nature that occur during an armed conflict.65 For example, hackers, using cyber means to commit a variety of crimes against non-military institutions, would not be targetable even if the victim State were a party to the conflict.66 However, if the criminal actions were conducted to support particular military operations of one party and to the detriment of the military opposition, then the civilian would forfeit protection for DPCH.\n\nLXIV\n## IV. As Applied: Which Civilians are Targetable?\nGiven these cumulative factors, consideration should be given as to the categories of civilians who become lawful targets under DPCH. Up front, government-employed or -contracted computer technicians and related personnel would not be targetable under Geneva Convention III (GC III) as “persons who accompany the armed forces without actually being members thereof,” provided they fulfill more support roles and do not directly participate in hostilities.67 On the other hand, if government contracted personnel were to engage in cyber hostilities, they would lose protection analogous to mercenaries.68 Similarly, civilians who serve a continuous combat function in an organized armed group during an IAC or NIAC are targetable.69 At a minimum, the Tallinn Manual’s guidance provides that members of organized armed groups, whether as levée en masse or not, who directly participate in hostilities, are targetable.70 Such civilians will remain targetable throughout the conflict, including the temporal breaks in between or after attacks mentioned supra. However, the CCD COE experts remain divided over this issue. Some experts argue that a civilian who is simply a member of the group is targetable regardless of their nature, no differently from members of a uniformed armed force (with exception for protected clergy and medical personnel); others follow the ICRC DPH guidance requirement of a “continuous combat function.” Thus, a cook or administrative clerk for a non-state cyber-combat organization would not be targetable under the ICRC standard. This issue remains unresolved in the physical domain and will be resolved through policy or rules of engagement (ROE) decisions by leaders on a fact-specific basis. Nevertheless, civilians will be more readily targetable if they are part of a hostile group actively partaking in the armed conflict.\nNotwithstanding these preliminary categories, identifying a civilian directly participating in cyber hostilities will be fact-specific and require a case-by-case analysis consistent with the principles discussed in Part III. Using these cumulative factors, the examples below illustrate the Tallinn Manual’s principles applied to unaffiliated civilians who directly participate in cyber hostilities. While not exhaustive, these examples serve as possible permutations for illustrating DPCH analysis via the Tallinn Manual and the ICRC’s DPH guidance.\n\n## A. Example One: The Case of the 13-year-old Thrill Seeker\nCivilians who are not parties to an IAC or NIAC may be lawfully targeted where they directly participate in cyber hostilities. Consider the hypothetical situation where, during an IAC between the U.S. and Iran, a 13-year-old child is armed with a laptop and malware. In this scenario, this hacker perpetrates a cyber-attack from Switzerland that is designed to disrupt a U.S. military logistics system related to moving of supplies and personnel for the purposes of disrupting (but not physically damaging) processes. This is especially conceivable given the inexpensive nature of developing or acquiring malicious code.[72] Just recently a 12-year-old pled guilty to charges in Canada for hacking government systems in support of the international network of hacktivists known as Anonymous.[73]\nOnce this hypothetical 13-year-old child conducts a cyber-attack by transmitting malware into this U.S. military logistics system, the child has clearly forfeited protection and is targetable for the following reasons: first, this act qualifies as an attack given that it meets the threshold of harm by disrupting military operations, where physical harm is not required;[74] secondly, the child's act of launching the malware directly causes the subsequent disruption (or attempted disruption);[75] lastly, the child's act satisfies the belligerent nexus element because the hostile act is directed against the U.S. military network and objectively benefits Iran.[76] Thus, the 13-year-old hacker is a lawful military target under a DPCH theory consistent with the ICRC and Tallinn Manual. Assuming the child only gained access to the network to exploit information by posting it to the internet, the child would still be targetable because such an act would exploit a vulnerability to the benefit of Iran. Conversely, if the child's actions were directed at a U.S. banking network, then the child's actions would be considered a criminal matter, unless the intelligence demonstrates that the child's actions were connected to the exploitation of U.S. infrastructure vulnerabilities in support of Iran's military campaign.\n[71] Emily Crawford, *Virtual Battlegrounds: Direct Participation in Cyber Warfare*, 9 ISJLP 1, 15 (2013), available at http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/students/groups/is/files/2013/08/5-Crawford.pdf.\n[72] Daniel Cohen &amp; Aviv Rotbart, *The Use of Code Mutation to Produce Multi-use Cyber Weapons*, THE INSTITUTE FOR NATIONAL SECURITY STUDIES (Jul. 8, 2013), http://www.inss.org.il/index.aspx?id=4538&amp;articleid=5163.\n[73] Lisa Vaas, *12-year-old Canadian Boy Admits to Hacking Police and Government Sites for Anonymous*, NAKED SECURITY (Oct. 26, 2013), http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2013/10/26/12-year-old-canadian-boy-admits-to-hacking-police-and-government-sites-for-anonymous; David Kushner, *The Masked Avengers, How Anonymous Incited Online Vigilantism from Tunisia to Ferguson*, THE NEW YORKER (SEP. 8, 2014), http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/09/08/masked-avengers.\n[74] TALLINN MANUAL, *supra* note 5, at 119.\n[75] Turns, *supra* note 8, at 295.\n[76] *Id.*\n\nLXIV\n## B. Example Two: Hacktivist\nPatriotic hacktivism adds a different dimension to DPCH given that their activities may or may not cross the threshold of harm or have a nexus to the conflict. Russian hacktivists participated in a myriad of activities in Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in 2008. Similar to the above example, a hacktivist, who disrupts military networks through distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, is targetable regardless of his or her subjective underlying intent. However, the analysis will change depending on whether their activities disrupt military operations. Suppose during this U.S.-Iranian conflict, a hacktivist from Anonymous decides to deploy a conspicuous message on a high-traffic, non-DoD, U.S. Government website as a form of cyber-protest of the war. While criminal, these actions will not constitute DPCH if the hacker's actions do not have a belligerent nexus to the conflict, directly cause disruption to military operations, or cause physical harm. This scenario would be true if the hacktivist's actions were targeted against the Affordable Care Act or Department of Justice websites.\nOn a sliding scale, the analysis changes if the hacker leaves a conspicuous message on a DoD information website as a form of \"cyber-protest\" of the war. An analysis of those actions is required to determine if the message interferes or disrupts military operations in order to satisfy the belligerent nexus requirement (supporting Iran). For example, if it could be determined that the message was designed to undermine the morale of DoD users fighting the war or interfere with military members' readiness (e.g., disrupting military members' pay on the Defense Finance and Accounting Service website), the hacktivist is clearly targetable under LOAC. However, if a hacktivist's message or action cannot be readily connected to the conflict, he or she is still \"at risk of being targeted, as their attacks would be difficult to differentiate from attacks being conducted by persons with a connection to the hostilities.\"\n## C. Example Three: Malware Programmer\nOther roles, such as a malware programmer, are more complex to analyze for DPCH purposes because of the question of direct causation, no different from a weapons builder. Returning to the example of the U.S.-Iran conflict, a cyber-weapons programmer could have played a role in developing\n Id. at 293.\n Id. at 293, n.59.\n TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 119–20.\n Crawford, supra note 71, at 17.\n Id. at 16; see Turns, supra note 8, at 295.\n\nand providing the malware to the 13-year-old hacker. Whether the programmer is targetable depends on the nature of his or her involvement in supporting the hacker. According to the Tallinn Manual, if the programmer had specifically designed the malware for exploitation of a DoD vulnerability (e.g., a military logistics or finance website), then the malware programmer can be targeted. In this instance, the malware programmer's acts (designing a code to exploit a DoD vulnerability) directly cause the disruptive harm to the military's operations, directly benefiting Iran. Thus, the programmer can be lawfully engaged in addition to the 13-year-old executing the code. By analogy, an IED developer who designs bombs specifically to exploit U.S. military vehicles (e.g., up-armored HUMVEEs or MRAPs) is targetable under DPH.\nConversely, if the malware programmer's only activity is developing generalized malware made available on a website, then causation would not be satisfied given the remoteness of involvement. This permutation resembles someone ordering firearms from an online vendor. An online vendor of cyber weapons does not become targetable, unless it is demonstrated that this developer is selling specialized malware to undermine DoD systems during an armed conflict. On the other hand, if the programmer designs malware for the 13-year-old, unaware of the intended target, there may be two possible outcomes. The CCD COE members were divided on malware programmers in this scenario. Drawing from the analogy of an IED builder, if military intelligence can establish factors supporting the inference that malware is specifically designed to exploit military weaknesses, then the programmer is targetable, unlike a person developing Trojan Horse viruses downloadable via a website. In short, further targeting decisions of malware programmers will require additional indicia of direct causation.\n## D. Technical Support Personnel\nAs a final example, technical support personnel require consideration under a DPCH analysis. If the 13-year-old hacker solicits technical support, the nature of that individual's involvement will be a determining factor for DPCH. If the hacker contacts technical support to assist with hardware or system software issues pertaining to the computer, then the support personnel will not be targetable as they are neither connected to the conflict nor the direct cause of harm. This result would be the same if the technical personnel assisted with\n Turns, supra note 8, at 295.\n TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 120.\n Id.\n Id.\n Crawford, supra note 71, at 17.\n Id.\n\nLXIV\nhardware and software issues knowing the intentions of the hacker. These personnel are criminally liable for such actions under a domestic framework within the United States, but are not targetable under LOAC. On the other hand, if a malware programmer provides technical assistance or instructive guidance to the child hacker on refining malware to exploit DoD systems, then the programmer (as a technical advisor) would lose their protected status and be targetable consistent with the Tallinn Manual’s view of a DPCH framework.\n## V. Challenges\nThe cumulative criteria mentioned above provide only a starting point for understanding what actions render a civilian targetable under LOAC. The decision to use force against a non-state civilian actor who directly participates in hostilities raises a myriad of other issues that will require consideration by states engaged in armed conflict. Each topic is individually complex and could be explored in elaborate discussions beyond the scope of this article. Nevertheless, the below discussions are limited to understanding how a state should consider these issues prior to considering a response to a civilian who forfeits protection under DPCH. These scenarios assume that the non-state actor’s attacks are not attributable to the state.\n## A. Sovereignty\n“Longstanding notions of sovereignty fall apart when it comes to cyber operations.” This quote foretells of a complex predicament should neutral nations become the staging grounds for non-state actors launching cyber-attacks in either IACs or NIACs. Of equal importance, the manner in which a State responds to civilians participating in CW from outside the theater of hostilities presents a challenging issue given that such neutral States maintain the inherent right of self-defense pursuant to Article 51 of the U.N. Charter. For IACs, LOAC provides that belligerent nations are prohibited from actions that harm a neutral nation and draw it into the conflict in any fashion. Conversely, neutral\n *Id.* at 18.\n Eric Talbot Jensen, *Sovereignty and Neutrality in Cyber Conflict*, 35 FORDHAM INT’L L.J. 815, 816 (2012) (citing David Perera, *Schmidle: Cyber Ops Might Require New Combatant Command Structure*, FIERCEGOVERNMENTIT (May 15, 2011, 4:29 PM), http://www.fiercegovernmentit.com/story/schmidle-cyber-ops-might-require-newcombatant-command-structure/2011-05-15 (quoting Lieutenant General Robert Schmidle, Deputy Commander of US Cyber Command)).\n *Id.*; see also UN Charter art. 51.\n Jensen, *supra* note 89, at 819; see also INT’L COMM.

While it is arguable that the law of neutrality does not extend to NIACs, the international law principle of *sic utere* provides that a state cannot knowingly allow its territory to be used to the detriment of another. Moreover, as illustrated in the *Nicaragua v. United States* case, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) supported the proposition that states engaged in non-international conflict enjoy a right of non-interference from outside parties.\nTo illustrate, suppose the non-state actor sponsored 13-year-old hacker launches a cyber-attack against the United States from Switzerland in support of Iran. Notwithstanding the existence of an extradition treaty, Switzerland has had a history of harboring U.S. fugitives. In this scenario, suppose also that the United States locates and identifies the attacker. If the Swiss preclude this individual from attacking further but refuse to extradite, then the United States would no longer be able to target this individual under the temporal considerations of a LOAC analysis. Alternatively, if the Swiss take no action at all or are unable to prevent harm from occurring, then the United States would find itself in a predicament that theoretically draws a comparison of physical terrorist attacks launched from lawless countries, including (pre-9/11) Afghanistan or Somalia.

For example, Article 2(5) of the Charter requires UN Member States to give the UN every assistance in any action it takes, and Article 25 requires UN members to accept and comply with the decisions of the Security Council; the enforcement measures spelled out in Chapter VII can also have an impact, as they are governed by particular rules which differ from those of the law of neutrality.”).\n Jensen, *supra* note 89, at 819.\n Jutta Brunnée, *Sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas*, in *9 MAX PLANCK ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW* 188 (2012); See also Jack Goldsmith, *Thoughts on the Latest Round of Johnson v.

Moreover, the United States can target the 13-year-old kinetically for committing cyber-attacks against its military consistent with the cumulative factors under the Tallinn Manual's view.\nBoth responses would be proffered as an “unwilling or unable” international law argument. Although scholars support this standard’s incorporation into customary international law, the ICJ rejected it on several occasions and thus, the “unwilling or unable” doctrine remains contentious and unsettled within customary international law (CIL). Should the United States invoke this standard, as in the case of Afghanistan in 2002, a U.S. response without Switzerland’s permission could result in strong political and military repercussions. Unlike Afghanistan before September 2001, Switzerland is not a lawless State, but still bears the responsibility under the *sic utere* doctrine to prevent international cyber-attacks from occurring within its national borders. In response to a U.S. kinetic or non-kinetic attack against the hacker, the Swiss could bring the issue to the ICJ. Switzerland could also respond militarily or in the cyber domain in self-defense against the United States. Given the permutations involved, this scenario illustrates the several considerations the United States would confront in conducting a counter-attack against a hacker located in a neutral State that refuses to cooperate.\n## B. Law of Targeting Considerations\nIf the United States responds to this hacker in the cyber or physical domain, “targeting law” will certainly apply in both cases. “Targeting law” evaluates whether the weapon’s employment (methodology) would violate the general principles of LOAC. The general principles of LOAC involve military necessity, distinction, proportionality, and humanity. For the purposes of kinetic operations using conventional means in the physical domain, targeting law remains well settled. As noted in the Tallinn Manual, these concepts do apply in the cyber domain and will require further examination. “Military necessity may be defined as the principle that justifies the use of all measures needed to defeat the enemy as quickly and efficiently as possible that are not prohibited by the law of war.” Thus, military commanders must act in a manner necessary for advancing military objectives and ensure that their actions\n Goldsmith, *supra* note 93.\n *Id.*\n Jeffrey S. Thurnher, *The Law that Applies to Autonomous Weapon Systems*, 17 AM. SOC’Y INT’L L.

See also IAN HENDERSON, THE CONTEMPORARY LAW OF TARGETING 7 (2009).\n\nare not otherwise prohibited by another principle of LOAC. As a principle, military necessity not only tolerates violence towards the enemy but alternative operations which influence or impede the enemy (e.g. psychological operations, electronic jamming, intelligence operations). As applied, cyber-attacks may be employed against military objectives provide such actions do not violate the principles of proportionality, humanity, and distinction.\n“Humanity” implies that belligerents should not cause unnecessary suffering. The CCD COE posits that “[m]eans and methods of cyber warfare will only in rare cases violate this Rule.” However, the Tallinn Manual illustrates a possible violation of this rule through hacking into a victim’s pacemaker to stop the target’s heart and then reviving him multiple times before finally killing him. An example could include hacking into pharmaceutical records for the purpose of prescribing medications aimed at causing long-term allergic reactions leading to death. Using a cyber-attack to poison or corrupt a military water supply serves as another example as strictly prohibited as a violation of this LOAC principle. Given the ramifications, U.S. policy would exclude attacking this hacker through means that cause unnecessary suffering.\nAs mentioned earlier, “distinction” requires combatants to distinguish between lawful military targets (opposing combatants and their equipment and facilities) and protected persons (e.g., civilians, medical personnel, chaplains, hors de combat) and property. However, in DPH and DPCH targeting contexts, distinction requires discriminating between civilians who have forfeited protection from those civilians and related objects that retain protection. Thus, if the United States were to conduct a non-kinetic cyber-attack against the 13-year-old hacker via a Swiss server, the United States would need to utilize malware that targets the offending computer only with no adverse effect or corruption of the server or other resident users. Similarly, if the 13-year-old hacker were using a Wi-Fi café in a Swiss hospital, the United States would not be able to attack the hospital’s server given that it is protected. If the United States can transmit a response (e.g., a DDoS attack) through the Wi-Fi café router that only impacts the targeted computer, then distinction would be otherwise satisfied. Similarly, targeting servers for non-kinetic (e.g., DDoS) or kinetic (e.g., Stuxnet-type virus) purposes requires verification of the hacker’s location. Therefore, the United States would need intelligence models on the systems’ architects and servers in order to modify malware to distinguish civilian perpetrators from protected persons.\n Id. at 52.\n Id. at 53.\n TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 144.\n Id.\nNaval Law Review\nLXIV\nTraditionally, the term civilian objects implied buildings, utilities (e.g., power lines), and related infrastructure. For cyber considerations, civilian objects would include such items as servers, computers, and related hardware. Data is also considered a protected object, especially if the data on a resident server is owned by a protected civilian. As mentioned, the CCD COE specifically chose not exclude data from the ambit of the term “attack.” This is especially true where malware is directed against data that physical objects rely upon for functionality. Thus, a cyber-attack that damages protected civilian data would violate the rules of distinction. While the data’s restoration via a backup could serve as a test for targeting, this is not the test used for physical property since buildings can be rebuilt, and cars can be remanufactured over time. Thus, this issue remains unsettled and a consideration for distinction. As applied, if the Wi-Fi café shares the same servers which contain patients’ records and data, then the intentional damage to such data would violate this principle.\nTargeting law also requires a “proportionality” analysis. The Tallinn Manual restates the requirements for proportionality codified in customary international law and in AP I:\nA cyber[-]attack that may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated is prohibited.\nWhile this principle is simply stated, proportionality is entirely subjective given that comparing the value of a military advantage to damage to civilians is tantamount to comparing “apples to oranges.” The analysis becomes case-specific, based on the nature of the target and the national thresholds for collateral damage. As applied, if the United States decides to conduct a DDoS attack against the 13-year-old hacker in Switzerland in a hospital Wi-Fi café, then the United States will have to assess the effects of the DDoS attack on that network and whether the resultant collateral damage can be mitigated by modifying the malware. By comparison, such modifications are consistent with DoD Collateral Damage Estimation Methodologies (CDEM) for\n *Id.* at 108, 113.\n HENDERSON, *supra* note 102, at 7.\n TALLINN MANUAL, *supra* note 5, at 159 (Rule 51).\n KENNETH ANDERSON &amp; MATTHEW WAXMAN, LAW AND ETHICS FOR AUTONOMOUS WEAPON SYSTEMS: WHY A BAN WON’T WORK AND HOW THE LAWS OF WAR CAN 12 (2013), available at http://www.hoover.org/publications/monographs/144241.\n TALLINN MANUAL, *supra* note 5, at 113.\n\nconventional weapons so as to avoid malware collaterally spreading or damaging other users, data, or networks. An analysis of the Stuxnet malware revealed fail-safe features such as code that limited the infection to Siemens systems, the number of devices that each infected device could infect, and the self-destruct code erasing the virus on June 24, 2012. Regardless of the overall effectiveness of the fail-safe measures, they illustrate “the inherent caution” of Stuxnet’s creators as an attempt to prevent further damage to other systems. Nations attempting to develop more sophisticated cyber weapons will need to consider proportionality issues and collateral damage.\n## VI. Practical Responses to Civilians who Directly Participate\nDespite challenges associated with cyber-warfare, States have a right of self-defense against civilians who conduct cyber-attacks during an armed conflict setting. While political and diplomatic measures remain available, the foregoing discussion provides an understanding of the nature of each response to a DPCH scenario assuming the offending civilian is located and attributed to the action. For the purposes of this framework, the U.S.-Iran armed conflict scenario discussed earlier will be utilized again.\n## A. Non-kinetic Responses\nNon-kinetic response can be acknowledged or covert as discussed below. Cyber defenses, for example, can be employed to have a non-kinetic effect depending upon their intended effect and usage. If a hacker attempts to gain access into an otherwise prohibited system, the host system can utilize a defense that can essentially block such access with no further effect. More active cyber defenses include tracking hackers’ computers, hacking back into systems to retrieve data, shutting down systems, sabotaging data, infecting the attacker with malware, taking over the attacker’s botnet, or employing a botnet to track or attack the hacker’s computer. While active defense responses to DPCH seem plausible, LOAC principles must be taken into consideration. For instance, if a DoD system conducts an active defense hack-back or counter-attack using\n CDEM assesses the likelihood of collateral damage for conventional weapons based on several factors, such as types of weapons, employment tactics, proximity of civilian structures.

A more interesting question is how such systems can distinguish between a criminal hacker and a LOAC hacker. At a minimum, in both cases, employing an active defense capable of preserving evidence and intelligence related to this hacker and operation will be critical for potential prosecution or follow-on responses. Offensive cyber capabilities with non-kinetic effects would employ similar effects described for active defenses. The distinction is that offensive capabilities would not necessarily occur as an automatic response from a computer, but rather a directed operation.\n## B. Kinetic Responses\nResponding to a cyber-attack kinetically raises questions regarding escalation. A response can take on two forms: a conventional attack (e.g., a missile) or a cyber-attack with physical effects (e.g., Stuxnet). Due to political and diplomatic considerations, use of force by the United States will require nothing short of Presidential authorization. In the instance of international armed conflict, the legal framework for employing a kinetic attack against a designated hostile force or individual (e.g., via AUMF or “targeted killing”) is well settled. A cyber-attack with kinetic effects directed against designated hostile forces in a theater of combat is legally supportable. Similarly, the targeted killing of a U.S. terrorist in self-defense is also considered consistent with U.S. domestic law, whether conducted with a drone strike or a kinetic cyber-attack. As scholar Hays Parks notes, the targeted killing of a legitimate enemy is not assassination. If a civilian forfeits protection due to DPCH attacks or serves as a cyber-terrorist causing physical harm to U.S. civilians, he or she can be lawfully targeted with a kinetic attack. With this understanding, there will be some additional considerations.\nIf the 13-year-old hacker is in Iran during the U.S.-Iranian conflict, the United States could escalate to kinetic force against the child no differently from an insurgent planting IEDs or shooting at a military convoy. On the other hand, kinetic operations during a cyber-only conflict expand the range of options available to the hostile nation for targeting a civilian cyber-attacker within its borders. In other words, Iran would be able to escalate to kinetic force in self-defense. Thus, in a cyber-only conflict, targeting this hacker kinetically may\n *Id.*\n *US to Outline Legal Backing for ‘Targeted Kill’ Programme*, THE GUARDIAN (Mar. 1, 2012, 2:58 AM), http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/05/us-legal-backing-targeted-kill-programme.\n W. Hays Parks, *Memorandum of Law: Executive Order 12333 and Assassination*, ARMY LAW., Dec. 1989, at 4.\n Herbert Lin, *Escalation Dynamics and Conflict Termination in Cyberspace*, STRAT. STUD. Q. 46, 65 (2012).\n\nundoubtedly escalate the conflict and requires political considerations. These considerations are heightened if kinetic force is applied to or within neutral nations as mentioned in Part IV. A kinetic response to a cyber-attack will require a case-by-case analysis of the nature of the cyber-attack’s operation, intended target(s), and underlying strategic significance. At a minimum, kinetic action, whether conducted through conventional or cyber-attacks, should be limited in scope and duration, consistent with self-defense proportionality principles, in order to avert an unnecessary escalation.\n## C. Covert Action\nIn most cases, the benefit of acknowledged non-kinetic or kinetic cyber-attacks against a neutral nation will be significantly outweighed by the diplomatic, economic, and military backlashes that would occur. Such acts would undoubtedly be perceived as an act of aggression by the United Nations, as interpreted by the ICJ. For these reasons, covert action represents a readily available solution while CIL develops in this area. Responding to non-state actors performing cyber-attacks from neutral states presents complex issues given the potential of affronting neutrality and widening the conflict. The stealthy nature of cyber warfare enables covert action as use of the cyber domain enables anonymity, takes advantage of targeted individuals’ awareness, and utilizes speed that overcomes the ability to readily safeguard against the consequences. Returning to the earlier scenario involving the child hacker located in Switzerland, the United States could consider covert action to thwart this non-state actor. This scenario presumes that Switzerland is uncooperative in extraditing or precluding this child from committing cyber-attacks against the United States.\nFirst, the United States could consider a targeted killing operation against this individual within Swiss borders. The targeting of this child for DPCH in support of Iran would not be considered an assassination as prohibited by Executive Order 12333. Under U.S. domestic law, an Authorization to Use Military Force will be required to authorize targeted killings. This requirement was illustrated in the U.S. campaign against al-Qaeda. Assuming the U.S.-Iranian conflict contains an AUMF, language should be included to at least authorize the killing of supporting parties for DPCH, regardless of location. This\n *Id.* at 61.\n See generally UN Charter, arts. 2(4), 51; see also Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicar. v.

Alternatively, even if an AUMF does not have broader language, a covert targeted killing would still be lawful if it can be established that the killing was required in self-defense consistent with Article 51 of the UN Charter. To prevent attribution of such killing within Swiss borders, the United States could use military means, such as Special Forces operations analogous to those employed during the Osama bin Laden raid.\nSecond, covert action could also be conducted for rendition of the child to prosecute him in the United States. The practice of rendition (also referred to as irregular rendition) is typically defined as the kidnapping or taking of an individual to move that person to the jurisdiction of another country.[124] This is distinguished from extraordinary rendition which involves transferring the individual to a foreign country for the purposes of detention and interrogation by a foreign government.[125] Rendition does not deprive U.S. courts of jurisdiction unless an applicable extradition treaty explicitly calls for that result and that treaty has been given legislative effect within U.S. domestic law.[126] Since the U.S.-Swiss extradition treaty contains no rendition language, the United States would not be barred from exercising jurisdiction and prosecuting this individual.[127] A covert action for rendition would resemble a raid using either special operations or U.S. law enforcement.\nFinally, covert action could be carried out against this individual via cyber means. A cyber-attack could have a non-kinetic or kinetic impact, as discussed earlier, and would be a more tenable solution if the originator of the attack were unknown. A covert operation employing cyber capabilities would require a complex number of variables beyond the scope of this article. Needless to say, such an operation would involve understanding the location of the child, a breakdown of the child's activities (pattern of life), an understanding of the targeted system's architecture, and other variables. A covert, non-kinetic cyberattack could be aimed at locating, tracking, and denying access to the 13-year-old hacker via the child's computer or home internet service provider. This kind of non-kinetic operation could be aimed at developing further intelligence on the child's activities for further planning should the child continue his or her attacks.\n\nA covert kinetic cyber-attack could vary greatly. Malware could be used to destroy the child’s data or to render the child’s computer unusable. On the other hand, if the desired effect is to kill the 13-year-old hacker, then a more elaborate cyber-attack would be required. Should the child need a pacemaker or medical assistance, a potential attack would include using malware or other cyber technique to kill the hacker, provided that the prohibition against unnecessary suffering was enforced. “CyberJacking,” the act of remotely taking control of someone’s vehicle, could be used as cyber means of a targeted killing. In this past summer’s BlackHat conference, two researchers demonstrated how they could control a car using their laptop while within the car. Such capabilities could easily be weaponized to target this 13-year-old hacker, assuming that the killing of the civilian driver or other occupants as collateral damage would be proportionally acceptable under the circumstances.\n## VII. Conclusion\nIn summary, DPCH will remain an ongoing concern in the coming years given the lack of an international consensus on the basic legal principles governing hostilities in the cyber domain. At a minimum, the Tallinn Manual’s DPCH framework provides clear guidance derived from IHL that will enable states to respond to civilian hackers who undertake hostilities in armed conflict while seeking to prevent collateral damage. While developing a cyber-hostilities treaty appears as a readily available solution, the sharp disagreement among states (e.g., the United States, Great Britain, France, China, Russia) on the basic principle of regulating the cyber domain makes such treaty a fleeting prospect. Nevertheless, states always retain the inherent authority of self-defense, regardless of the lack of international consensus concerning cyber hostilities. Thus, IHL provides an immediate legal framework for cyber operations. Over time, these practices will refine and crystalize into customary international law through State practice and opinio juris. Although international consensus seems unattainable, regional or organization practices such as the NATO effort in the Tallinn Manual support the development of CIL in those regions. While the cyber domain requires an analysis of the nature of hostilities, the principles of IHL govern the conduct of these hostilities in order to safeguard against collateral damage while preserving a state’s right of self-defense.\n Scott Schweitzer, *CyberJacking, Sophisticated Assassination*, CYBER WEAPONS &amp; WARFARE (Oct. 6, 2013, 8:55 AM), http://cyberweapons.blogspot.com/.\n *Id.* The BlackHat conference is a yearly event where thousands of security experts gather to discuss information security and expose vulnerabilities at the pertaining to computers, networks and other related digital media.

Within IHL, the principle of distinction between combatants and civilians serves as the starting point for DPCH. While principally derived from customary international law and the 1907 Hague Convention, contemporary notions of distinction are codified in Article 48 of Additional Protocol I (AP I) to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, which provides: “In order to ensure respect for and protection of the civilian population and civilian objects, the Parties to the conflict shall at all times distinguish between the civilian population and combatants and between civilian objects and military objectives and accordingly shall direct their operations only against military objectives.”¹⁶ Thus, civilians enjoy protection from an armed attack as a generally accepted principle under IHL.¹⁷ Under the principle of distinction, parties to a conflict are required to distinguish between the civilian population and objects, and from otherwise lawful targets (e.g., military combatants).¹⁸ The United States and CCD COE acknowledged this requirement of distinction is required in CW.¹⁹ The notion of DPH, derived from Article 51(3) of AP I, provides that civilians shall enjoy protection from armed attack “unless and for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities” for international armed conflicts (IAC).²⁰ The notion is virtually identical for non-international armed conflicts (NIAC) as ¹³ *Id.* ¹⁴ Harold H.

While civilians are subject to lawful targeting while taking direct part in hostilities, they are only lawful targets “for such time as” or while they actually commit hostile acts directly producing harmful effects to an enemy.²² This preceding language providing for a temporal requirement remains controversial. Institutions such as the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) interpret this section very restrictively to mean that such civilians can only be targeted until he or she has returned to the pre-deployment location.²³ Thus, if a civilian conducts repeated attacks, that civilian will regain protection upon return from each engagement.²⁴ This remains highly debated among scholars and the ICRC. Other scholars take a broader view, allowing for targeting of a civilian long after he or she has lost protection.²⁵ For the purposes of cyber-conflict, the CCD COE agreed that the temporal requirement would at least include actions immediately preceding or subsequent to the qualifying act.²⁶ However, the CCD COE experts were split on the time between repeated attacks.²⁷ Thus, this issue is unresolved in both physical and cyber domains and will become a policy decision vis-à-vis rules of engagement or operational orders. This article will assume a broad view allowing for targeting in between attacks. ## III. The Cumulative Factors of DPCH While the ICRC has not published similar comprehensive guidance on DPCH or CW, the ICRC’s DPH guidance remains helpful as discussed infra. Moreover, the ICRC contributed to the development of the Tallinn Manual and generally agrees with the rules developed with some exceptions.²⁸ In particular, many of the notions for resolving DPCH issues are derived from the ICRC’s interpretive guidance on DPH. Thus, the Tallinn Manual remains the most comprehensive work that serves as DPCH guidance within the framework of IHL. Rule 35 of the Tallinn Manual provides that an act of direct participation in hostilities by civilians renders them liable to be attacked, by cyber or other 21 Additional Protocol II, supra note 4, art. 13(3). 22 Id. 23 NILS MELZER, ICRC INTERPRETIVE GUIDANCE ON THE NOTION OF DIRECT PARTICIPATION IN HOSTILITIES UNDER INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW 70–71 (2009), available at http://www.icrc.org/eng/assets/files/other/icrc-002-0990.pdf [hereinafter ICRC DPH GUIDANCE]. 24 Id.

Understanding an Attack: Threshold of Harm Per Article 49(1) of AP I, “attacks” are acts of violence against the adversary, whether in offense or in defense.³³ To illustrate, military convoys in Iraq or Afghanistan would be able to target, in self-defense, a roadside Improvised Explosive Device (IED) bomber or sniper for engaging in a hostile act amounting to an attack. On the other hand, a civilian who simply stands in the middle of the road holding up a sign in protest does not qualify as an attack. Targeting this protestor would be prohibited under IHL unless that civilian committed or attempt to commit an act that amounts to direct participation. By analogy, the aforementioned Stuxnet worm would clearly illustrate a kinetic attack given the resultant physical damage to Iranian centrifuges.³⁴ Conversely, the same conclusion would not easily be reached for “hacktivists,” who protest by spamming computer networks with protest e-mails.³⁵ Therefore, to understand the definition of “cyber-attack,” an analysis of the “threshold of harm” associated with it is required. Factors involved in this analysis include: “the context of the event, the actor perpetrating the action (recognizing ²⁹ TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 118. ³⁰ Id. ³¹ Id. ³² Id. at 119-121. ³³ Additional Protocol I, supra note 4, art. 49(1); see also TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 106.

The intended effects of cyber-attack are not necessarily limited to the targeted computer systems or data themselves—for instance, attacks on computer systems which are intended to degrade or destroy infrastructure or [command and control] capability. A cyber-attack may use intermediate delivery vehicles including peripheral devices, electronic transmitters, embedded code, or human operators. The activation or effect of a cyber-attack may be widely separated temporally and geographically from the delivery.³⁷ The U.S. definition provides some inference that a cyber-attack need not physically destroy systems to qualify as an attack. Rather, disruption of these systems will suffice as meeting a threshold of harm.³⁸ By comparison, the ICRC’s DPH guidance provides some level of amplification on this point, despite not directly speaking about DPCH or CW specifically. The ICRC indicates that the threshold of harm for DPH is satisfied when the civilian’s actions adversely affect military operations or the military capacity of a party to the conflict.³⁹ The ICRC states that the denial of an adversary’s military use of certain objects, equipment, and territory would reach the required threshold of harm.⁴⁰ The ICRC specifically notes that the electronic interference with military computer networks would fall into this category of denial, whether accomplished through computer network attacks (CNA) or computer network exploitation (CNE).⁴¹ As cybersecurity strategist Joshua ³⁶ Koh, supra note 14, at 4; see also Schmitt, supra note 14, at 19. ³⁷ Memorandum from Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to Chiefs of the Military Services et al., subject: Joint Terminology for Cyberspace Operations (Nov. 2010) [hereinafter “Joint Terminology for Cyberspace Operations”]. ³⁸ Id. ³⁹ ICRC DPH GUIDANCE, supra note 23, at 48. ⁴⁰ Id. ⁴¹ Id. at 48. CNA is defined as a “category of fires employed for offensive purposes in which actions are taken through the use of computer networks to disrupt, deny, degrade, manipulate, or destroy information resident in the target system or computer networks, or the systems/networks themselves.”; CNE is defined as “[e]nabling operations and intelligence collection capabilities conducted through the use of computer networks to gather data about target or adversary automated 92 Naval Law Review LXIV Corman notes, a cyber-attack is essentially no different from electronic warfare where an adversary denies military use of equipment through jamming or interfering with a network.⁴² Thus, a civilian who engages in actions tantamount to interference with military communications or operations through CNA (e.g., a Denial of Service operation) or CNE would constitute a DPCH attack in ICRC’s view. The Tallinn Manual thus incorporates the ICRC’s notion by stating that: [T]he act (or a closely related series of acts) must have the intended or actual effect of negatively affecting the adversary’s military operations or capabilities, or inflicting death, physical harm, or material destruction on persons or objects protected against direct attack (threshold of harm).⁴³ The CCD COE experts provide that a cyber-attack that satisfies the “threshold of harm” is an operation that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects.⁴⁴ The CCD COE was very specific that this “limitation should not be understood as excluding cyber operations against data (which are non-physical entities) from the ambit of the term attack.”⁴⁵ This is especially true if an operation against data upon which the functionality of physical objects relies can sometimes constitute an attack.⁴⁶ However, for the purposes of DPCH against military adversaries, the CCD COE clarifies that there is no requirement for physical damage to objects or harm to individuals so long as a cyber-attack negatively affects enemy military operations.⁴⁷ For example, a cyber-attack that disrupts the operation of the military’s command and control network would satisfy the criterion.⁴⁸ Disruption in this context does not mean physical damage to servers, data, or computers. Rather, it simply implies interference, no different from radio or radar jamming. This proposition is consistent with the ICRC’s view under DPH. Stated negatively, if these actions were not directed at an adversary’s military capability, the ICRC requires that the “specific act must be likely to cause at information systems or networks.” See Joint Terminology for Cyberspace Operations, supra note 37, at 3-4. ⁴² Skype Interview with cybersecurity strategist Joshua Corman, Chief Technology Officer at Sonatype (Sept. 23, 2013) (video recordation on file with author). ⁴³ TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 119. ⁴⁴ Id. at 107. ⁴⁵ Id. at 107–08. ⁴⁶ Id. at 119. ⁴⁷ Id. ⁴⁸ Id. 93 2015 Pouring New Wine Into Old Bottles least death, injury, or destruction” of property in order to reach this threshold of harm.⁴⁹ Thus, the ICRC’s notion as applied to CW means that a civilian hacker interfering with a civilian computer system (e.g., Social Security), instead of the military, would not necessarily lose protection for that purpose unless it can be demonstrated that either the cyber-attack against the non-military network was intended to have an effect on the military in some fashion or that physical harm would otherwise result. As an aside, this notion of physical harm to a non-military network need not be defined in the physical destruction associated with a kinetic strike. An emerging trend is to define physical harm in the cyber domain as the level of effect on the functionality of the targeted object.⁵⁰ Some experts argue that if a cyber-attack impairs the functionality such that physical components require replacement, then this would constitute damage as envisaged in the concept of attack.⁵¹ Other experts provide that physical component replacement is not required; loss of functionality through data corruption requiring software reinstallation or network rebooting would constitute “physical damage.”⁵² While the physical damage standard is not required for military networks, understanding this disparity is important if cyber-attacks against non-military networks occur as part of greater campaign during an armed conflict. ## B. Direct Causation The ICRC guidance provides that there must be a direct causation from the civilian act to the harm suffered for the act to potentially constitute DPH.⁵³ In particular, the ICRC states: “there must be a direct causal link between a specific act and the harm likely to result either from that act, or from a coordinated military operation of which that act constitutes an integral part.”⁵⁴ In terms of a physical context, this implies that the harm suffered cannot be the result of an indirect or secondary order effect. The Tallinn Manual aligns with the ICRC’s DPH analysis by requiring the existence of “a direct causal link between the act in question and the harm intended or inflicted.”⁵⁵ In CW, this standard appears easier to fulfill than in the physical combat scenario, where “fog of war” tends to complicate the issue. By analogy, if a civilian farmer fires his weapon at another local national to ward off livestock poaching, the sound of gunfire or the physical impact of a bullet may incite a nearby military patrol to ⁴⁹ ICRC DPH GUIDANCE, supra note 23, at 49. ⁵⁰ Droege, supra note 11, at 557–58. ⁵¹ TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 108. ⁵² Id. at 109. ⁵³ ICRC DPH GUIDANCE, supra note 23, at 50–51. ⁵⁴ Id. at 51. ⁵⁵ TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 119. Naval Law Review LXIV engage in self-defense. In some instances, mere possession and public display of personal weapons, could be perceived as a threat without additional accompanying acts. On the other hand, CW will not suffer from the same “fog of war” issue. The use of a cyber-weapon to deny a military’s capability or interfere with a military operation can hardly be seen as incidental or an indirect cause.⁵⁶ The Tallinn Manual supports this point through the example of disruption to the enemy’s command and control as being directly caused by a cyber-attack.⁵⁷ Therefore, if a civilian hacker gained access into a military network to exploit or disrupt the network, that civilian’s acts would be the direct cause of the harm suffered, rendering him or her targetable. As a counterpoint, this theory should not discount the possibility of accidental cyber-attacks by civilian entities or individuals. There are potential scenarios where technology companies or independent contractors could theoretically accidentally release malware onto a network. However, the Tallinn Manual and ICRC guidance on direct causation does not address the underlying intentions behind the action. Thus, the challenge with these scenarios is that they reinforce the notion of reasonable precautions within IHL (i.e., the obligation to take reasonable precautions to avoid or minimize incidental civilian losses).⁵⁸ Therefore, while fog of war is relatively diminished, prior to responding to a cyber-attack premised upon DPCH, reasonable precautions (e.g., reviewing human, electronic, and signals intelligence; verifying the source of the attack; using the least destructive means available to neutralize the threat) should be taken to minimize potentially attacking an otherwise innocent party.⁵⁹ ## C. Belligerent Nexus The ICRC DPH guidance provides that: In order to meet the requirement of belligerent nexus, an act must be specifically designed to directly cause the required threshold of harm in support of a party to the conflict and to the detriment of another.⁶⁰ ⁵⁶ Id. at 119–20. ⁵⁷ Id. at 120. ⁵⁸ Additional Protocol I, supra note 4, art. 57(1); see also Customary IHL—Rule 15. Precautions in Attack, INT’L COMM. OF THE RED CROSS, http://www.icrc.org/customary-ibl/eng/docs/v1_cha_chapter5_rule15 (last visited July 30, 2014) (suggesting that Article 13(1) of Additional Protocol II implies this obligation); TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 164–65. ⁵⁹ See generally TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 159–176 (Rules 51–58). ⁶⁰ ICRC DPH GUIDANCE, supra note 23, at 58. 2015 Pouring New Wine Into Old Bottles Hostile acts such as firing a weapon at an enemy or planting a bomb serve as easy examples. As a qualifying statement, the ICRC notes that acts that do not satisfy the threshold of harm are “non-belligerent . . . and, therefore, must be addressed through law enforcement measures.” 61 A seminal example is the IED maker whose actions contribute to hostilities without necessarily being connected to the conflict. In this example, if the intelligence shows that the IED maker is developing and supplying bombs for the insurgents as a part of an ongoing campaign, then he/she is targetable. This analysis will change if he/she is just selling them to the insurgents. The ICRC also provides that the belligerent nexus element does not require a subjective intent determination, where the state of mind of the person is at issue in committing the act.62 The ICRC posits that a belligerent nexus requires an objective standard expressed in the design of the act or operation which does not depend on the mindset of every participating individual.63 Belligerent nexus is generally not influenced by factors such as personal distress or preferences, or by the mental ability or willingness of persons to assume responsibility for their conduct. Consequently, if an insurgent is forced or coerced in some manner to commit an attack, he/she would still be lawfully targetable under IHL. As applied, the Tallinn Manual expounds on the ICRC’s belligerent nexus notion by stating that cyber acts must be directly related to the hostilities between parties to a conflict.64 By example, if a civilian directs a cyber-attack against a military’s command and control node, his or her actions would satisfy this condition as it impacts a military force to the benefit of the opposition. Equally, if a hacker were coerced to commit this cyber-attack, he or she would lose protection and become lawfully targetable. The Tallinn Manual’s criterion rules out acts of a purely criminal or private nature that occur during an armed conflict.65 For example, hackers, using cyber means to commit a variety of crimes against non-military institutions, would not be targetable even if the victim State were a party to the conflict.66 However, if the criminal actions were conducted to support particular military operations of one party and to the detriment of the military opposition, then the civilian would forfeit protection for DPCH. 61 Id. at 59. 62 Id. 63 Id. 64 TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 119. 65 Id. at 120. 66 Id. 96 Naval Law Review LXIV ## IV. As Applied: Which Civilians are Targetable? Given these cumulative factors, consideration should be given as to the categories of civilians who become lawful targets under DPCH. Up front, government-employed or -contracted computer technicians and related personnel would not be targetable under Geneva Convention III (GC III) as “persons who accompany the armed forces without actually being members thereof,” provided they fulfill more support roles and do not directly participate in hostilities.67 On the other hand, if government contracted personnel were to engage in cyber hostilities, they would lose protection analogous to mercenaries.68 Similarly, civilians who serve a continuous combat function in an organized armed group during an IAC or NIAC are targetable.69 At a minimum, the Tallinn Manual’s guidance provides that members of organized armed groups, whether as levée en masse or not, who directly participate in hostilities, are targetable.70 Such civilians will remain targetable throughout the conflict, including the temporal breaks in between or after attacks mentioned supra. However, the CCD COE experts remain divided over this issue. Some experts argue that a civilian who is simply a member of the group is targetable regardless of their nature, no differently from members of a uniformed armed force (with exception for protected clergy and medical personnel); others follow the ICRC DPH guidance requirement of a “continuous combat function.” Thus, a cook or administrative clerk for a non-state cyber-combat organization would not be targetable under the ICRC standard. This issue remains unresolved in the physical domain and will be resolved through policy or rules of engagement (ROE) decisions by leaders on a fact-specific basis. Nevertheless, civilians will be more readily targetable if they are part of a hostile group actively partaking in the armed conflict. Notwithstanding these preliminary categories, identifying a civilian directly participating in cyber hostilities will be fact-specific and require a case-by-case analysis consistent with the principles discussed in Part III. Using these cumulative factors, the examples below illustrate the Tallinn Manual’s principles applied to unaffiliated civilians who directly participate in cyber hostilities. While not exhaustive, these examples serve as possible permutations for illustrating DPCH analysis via the Tallinn Manual and the ICRC’s DPH guidance. 67 Art. 4(A)(4), Geneva Convention (III) Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, Aug. 12, 1949, 75 U.N.T.S. 135.

Example One: The Case of the 13-year-old Thrill Seeker Civilians who are not parties to an IAC or NIAC may be lawfully targeted where they directly participate in cyber hostilities. Consider the hypothetical situation where, during an IAC between the U.S. and Iran, a 13-year-old child is armed with a laptop and malware. In this scenario, this hacker perpetrates a cyber-attack from Switzerland that is designed to disrupt a U.S. military logistics system related to moving of supplies and personnel for the purposes of disrupting (but not physically damaging) processes. This is especially conceivable given the inexpensive nature of developing or acquiring malicious code.[72] Just recently a 12-year-old pled guilty to charges in Canada for hacking government systems in support of the international network of hacktivists known as Anonymous.[73] Once this hypothetical 13-year-old child conducts a cyber-attack by transmitting malware into this U.S. military logistics system, the child has clearly forfeited protection and is targetable for the following reasons: first, this act qualifies as an attack given that it meets the threshold of harm by disrupting military operations, where physical harm is not required;[74] secondly, the child's act of launching the malware directly causes the subsequent disruption (or attempted disruption);[75] lastly, the child's act satisfies the belligerent nexus element because the hostile act is directed against the U.S. military network and objectively benefits Iran.[76] Thus, the 13-year-old hacker is a lawful military target under a DPCH theory consistent with the ICRC and Tallinn Manual. Assuming the child only gained access to the network to exploit information by posting it to the internet, the child would still be targetable because such an act would exploit a vulnerability to the benefit of Iran. Conversely, if the child's actions were directed at a U.S. banking network, then the child's actions would be considered a criminal matter, unless the intelligence demonstrates that the child's actions were connected to the exploitation of U.S. infrastructure vulnerabilities in support of Iran's military campaign.

Example Two: Hacktivist⁷⁷ Patriotic hacktivism adds a different dimension to DPCH given that their activities may or may not cross the threshold of harm or have a nexus to the conflict. Russian hacktivists participated in a myriad of activities in Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in 2008.⁷⁸ Similar to the above example, a hacktivist, who disrupts military networks through distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, is targetable regardless of his or her subjective underlying intent. However, the analysis will change depending on whether their activities disrupt military operations. Suppose during this U.S.-Iranian conflict, a hacktivist from Anonymous decides to deploy a conspicuous message on a high-traffic, non-DoD, U.S. Government website as a form of cyber-protest of the war. While criminal, these actions will not constitute DPCH if the hacker's actions do not have a belligerent nexus to the conflict, directly cause disruption to military operations, or cause physical harm. This scenario would be true if the hacktivist's actions were targeted against the Affordable Care Act or Department of Justice websites.⁷⁹ On a sliding scale, the analysis changes if the hacker leaves a conspicuous message on a DoD information website as a form of \"cyber-protest\" of the war. An analysis of those actions is required to determine if the message interferes or disrupts military operations in order to satisfy the belligerent nexus requirement (supporting Iran). For example, if it could be determined that the message was designed to undermine the morale of DoD users fighting the war or interfere with military members' readiness (e.g., disrupting military members' pay on the Defense Finance and Accounting Service website), the hacktivist is clearly targetable under LOAC. However, if a hacktivist's message or action cannot be readily connected to the conflict, he or she is still \"at risk of being targeted, as their attacks would be difficult to differentiate from attacks being conducted by persons with a connection to the hostilities.\"⁸⁰ ## C. Example Three: Malware Programmer⁸¹ Other roles, such as a malware programmer, are more complex to analyze for DPCH purposes because of the question of direct causation, no different from a weapons builder. Returning to the example of the U.S.-Iran conflict, a cyber-weapons programmer could have played a role in developing ⁷⁷ Id. at 293. ⁷⁸ Id. at 293, n.59. ⁷⁹ TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 119–20. ⁸⁰ Crawford, supra note 71, at 17. ⁸¹ Id. at 16; see Turns, supra note 8, at 295. 2015 Pouring New Wine Into Old Bottles and providing the malware to the 13-year-old hacker. Whether the programmer is targetable depends on the nature of his or her involvement in supporting the hacker. According to the Tallinn Manual, if the programmer had specifically designed the malware for exploitation of a DoD vulnerability (e.g., a military logistics or finance website), then the malware programmer can be targeted. In this instance, the malware programmer's acts (designing a code to exploit a DoD vulnerability) directly cause the disruptive harm to the military's operations, directly benefiting Iran. Thus, the programmer can be lawfully engaged in addition to the 13-year-old executing the code.⁸² By analogy, an IED developer who designs bombs specifically to exploit U.S. military vehicles (e.g., up-armored HUMVEEs or MRAPs) is targetable under DPH. Conversely, if the malware programmer's only activity is developing generalized malware made available on a website, then causation would not be satisfied given the remoteness of involvement.⁸³ This permutation resembles someone ordering firearms from an online vendor. An online vendor of cyber weapons does not become targetable, unless it is demonstrated that this developer is selling specialized malware to undermine DoD systems during an armed conflict. On the other hand, if the programmer designs malware for the 13-year-old, unaware of the intended target, there may be two possible outcomes.⁸⁴ The CCD COE members were divided on malware programmers in this scenario.⁸⁵ Drawing from the analogy of an IED builder, if military intelligence can establish factors supporting the inference that malware is specifically designed to exploit military weaknesses, then the programmer is targetable, unlike a person developing Trojan Horse viruses downloadable via a website. In short, further targeting decisions of malware programmers will require additional indicia of direct causation. ## D. Technical Support Personnel⁸⁶ As a final example, technical support personnel require consideration under a DPCH analysis. If the 13-year-old hacker solicits technical support, the nature of that individual's involvement will be a determining factor for DPCH. If the hacker contacts technical support to assist with hardware or system software issues pertaining to the computer, then the support personnel will not be targetable as they are neither connected to the conflict nor the direct cause of harm.⁸⁷ This result would be the same if the technical personnel assisted with ⁸² Turns, supra note 8, at 295. ⁸³ TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 120. ⁸⁴ Id. ⁸⁵ Id. ⁸⁶ Crawford, supra note 71, at 17. ⁸⁷ Id. 100 Naval Law Review LXIV hardware and software issues knowing the intentions of the hacker.⁸⁸ These personnel are criminally liable for such actions under a domestic framework within the United States, but are not targetable under LOAC. On the other hand, if a malware programmer provides technical assistance or instructive guidance to the child hacker on refining malware to exploit DoD systems, then the programmer (as a technical advisor) would lose their protected status and be targetable consistent with the Tallinn Manual’s view of a DPCH framework. ## V. Challenges The cumulative criteria mentioned above provide only a starting point for understanding what actions render a civilian targetable under LOAC. The decision to use force against a non-state civilian actor who directly participates in hostilities raises a myriad of other issues that will require consideration by states engaged in armed conflict. Each topic is individually complex and could be explored in elaborate discussions beyond the scope of this article. Nevertheless, the below discussions are limited to understanding how a state should consider these issues prior to considering a response to a civilian who forfeits protection under DPCH. These scenarios assume that the non-state actor’s attacks are not attributable to the state. ## A. Sovereignty “Longstanding notions of sovereignty fall apart when it comes to cyber operations.”⁸⁹ This quote foretells of a complex predicament should neutral nations become the staging grounds for non-state actors launching cyber-attacks in either IACs or NIACs. Of equal importance, the manner in which a State responds to civilians participating in CW from outside the theater of hostilities presents a challenging issue given that such neutral States maintain the inherent right of self-defense pursuant to Article 51 of the U.N. Charter.⁹⁰ For IACs, LOAC provides that belligerent nations are prohibited from actions that harm a neutral nation and draw it into the conflict in any fashion.⁹¹ Conversely, neutral ⁸⁸ *Id.* at 18. ⁸⁹ Eric Talbot Jensen, *Sovereignty and Neutrality in Cyber Conflict*, 35 FORDHAM INT’L L.J. 815, 816 (2012) (citing David Perera, *Schmidle: Cyber Ops Might Require New Combatant Command Structure*, FIERCEGOVERNMENTIT (May 15, 2011, 4:29 PM), http://www.fiercegovernmentit.com/story/schmidle-cyber-ops-might-require-newcombatant-command-structure/2011-05-15 (quoting Lieutenant General Robert Schmidle, Deputy Commander of US Cyber Command)). ⁹⁰ *Id.*; see also UN Charter art. 51. ⁹¹ Jensen, *supra* note 89, at 819; see also INT’L COMM.

United States*⁹⁴ case, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) supported the proposition that states engaged in non-international conflict enjoy a right of non-interference from outside parties.⁹⁵ To illustrate, suppose the non-state actor sponsored 13-year-old hacker launches a cyber-attack against the United States from Switzerland in support of Iran. Notwithstanding the existence of an extradition treaty, Switzerland has had a history of harboring U.S. fugitives.⁹⁶ In this scenario, suppose also that the United States locates and identifies the attacker. If the Swiss preclude this individual from attacking further but refuse to extradite, then the United States would no longer be able to target this individual under the temporal considerations of a LOAC analysis. Alternatively, if the Swiss take no action at all or are unable to prevent harm from occurring, then the United States would find itself in a predicament that theoretically draws a comparison of physical terrorist attacks launched from lawless countries, including (pre-9/11) Afghanistan or Somalia.⁹⁷ Thus, the United States can launch a non-kinetic and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons in Case of War on Land, the 1907 Hague Convention No. XIII concerning the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers in Naval War, the four 1949 Geneva Conventions[,] and Additional Protocol I of 1977. The United Nations Charter of 1945 and Security Council decisions based on the Charter may in certain circumstances modify the law of neutrality. For example, Article 2(5) of the Charter requires UN Member States to give the UN every assistance in any action it takes, and Article 25 requires UN members to accept and comply with the decisions of the Security Council; the enforcement measures spelled out in Chapter VII can also have an impact, as they are governed by particular rules which differ from those of the law of neutrality.”). ⁹² Jensen, *supra* note 89, at 819. ⁹³ Jutta Brunnée, *Sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas*, in *9 MAX PLANCK ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW* 188 (2012); See also Jack Goldsmith, *Thoughts on the Latest Round of Johnson v.

Moreover, the United States can target the 13-year-old kinetically for committing cyber-attacks against its military consistent with the cumulative factors under the Tallinn Manual's view. Both responses would be proffered as an “unwilling or unable” international law argument.⁹⁸ Although scholars support this standard’s incorporation into customary international law, the ICJ rejected it on several occasions and thus, the “unwilling or unable” doctrine remains contentious and unsettled within customary international law (CIL).⁹⁹ Should the United States invoke this standard, as in the case of Afghanistan in 2002, a U.S. response without Switzerland’s permission could result in strong political and military repercussions. Unlike Afghanistan before September 2001, Switzerland is not a lawless State, but still bears the responsibility under the *sic utere* doctrine to prevent international cyber-attacks from occurring within its national borders. In response to a U.S. kinetic or non-kinetic attack against the hacker, the Swiss could bring the issue to the ICJ. Switzerland could also respond militarily or in the cyber domain in self-defense against the United States. Given the permutations involved, this scenario illustrates the several considerations the United States would confront in conducting a counter-attack against a hacker located in a neutral State that refuses to cooperate. ## B. Law of Targeting Considerations If the United States responds to this hacker in the cyber or physical domain, “targeting law” will certainly apply in both cases. “Targeting law” evaluates whether the weapon’s employment (methodology) would violate the general principles of LOAC.¹⁰⁰ The general principles of LOAC involve military necessity, distinction, proportionality, and humanity.¹⁰¹ For the purposes of kinetic operations using conventional means in the physical domain, targeting law remains well settled. As noted in the Tallinn Manual, these concepts do apply in the cyber domain and will require further examination. “Military necessity may be defined as the principle that justifies the use of all measures needed to defeat the enemy as quickly and efficiently as possible that are not prohibited by the law of war.”¹⁰² Thus, military commanders must act in a manner necessary for advancing military objectives and ensure that their actions ⁹⁸ Goldsmith, *supra* note 93. ⁹⁹ *Id.* ¹⁰⁰ Jeffrey S.

The CCD COE posits that “[m]eans and methods of cyber warfare will only in rare cases violate this Rule.”¹⁰⁵ However, the Tallinn Manual illustrates a possible violation of this rule through hacking into a victim’s pacemaker to stop the target’s heart and then reviving him multiple times before finally killing him.¹⁰⁶ An example could include hacking into pharmaceutical records for the purpose of prescribing medications aimed at causing long-term allergic reactions leading to death. Using a cyber-attack to poison or corrupt a military water supply serves as another example as strictly prohibited as a violation of this LOAC principle. Given the ramifications, U.S. policy would exclude attacking this hacker through means that cause unnecessary suffering. As mentioned earlier, “distinction” requires combatants to distinguish between lawful military targets (opposing combatants and their equipment and facilities) and protected persons (e.g., civilians, medical personnel, chaplains, hors de combat) and property. However, in DPH and DPCH targeting contexts, distinction requires discriminating between civilians who have forfeited protection from those civilians and related objects that retain protection. Thus, if the United States were to conduct a non-kinetic cyber-attack against the 13-year-old hacker via a Swiss server, the United States would need to utilize malware that targets the offending computer only with no adverse effect or corruption of the server or other resident users. Similarly, if the 13-year-old hacker were using a Wi-Fi café in a Swiss hospital, the United States would not be able to attack the hospital’s server given that it is protected. If the United States can transmit a response (e.g., a DDoS attack) through the Wi-Fi café router that only impacts the targeted computer, then distinction would be otherwise satisfied. Similarly, targeting servers for non-kinetic (e.g., DDoS) or kinetic (e.g., Stuxnet-type virus) purposes requires verification of the hacker’s location. Therefore, the United States would need intelligence models on the systems’ architects and servers in order to modify malware to distinguish civilian perpetrators from protected persons. ¹⁰³ Id. at 52. ¹⁰⁴ Id. at 53. ¹⁰⁵ TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 144. ¹⁰⁶ Id. Naval Law Review LXIV Traditionally, the term civilian objects implied buildings, utilities (e.g., power lines), and related infrastructure. For cyber considerations, civilian objects would include such items as servers, computers, and related hardware. Data is also considered a protected object, especially if the data on a resident server is owned by a protected civilian. As mentioned, the CCD COE specifically chose not exclude data from the ambit of the term “attack.” This is especially true where malware is directed against data that physical objects rely upon for functionality.¹⁰⁷ Thus, a cyber-attack that damages protected civilian data would violate the rules of distinction. While the data’s restoration via a backup could serve as a test for targeting, this is not the test used for physical property since buildings can be rebuilt, and cars can be remanufactured over time. Thus, this issue remains unsettled and a consideration for distinction. As applied, if the Wi-Fi café shares the same servers which contain patients’ records and data, then the intentional damage to such data would violate this principle. Targeting law also requires a “proportionality” analysis.¹⁰⁸ The Tallinn Manual restates the requirements for proportionality codified in customary international law and in AP I: A cyber[-]attack that may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated is prohibited.¹⁰⁹ While this principle is simply stated, proportionality is entirely subjective given that comparing the value of a military advantage to damage to civilians is tantamount to comparing “apples to oranges.”¹¹⁰ The analysis becomes case-specific, based on the nature of the target and the national thresholds for collateral damage. As applied, if the United States decides to conduct a DDoS attack against the 13-year-old hacker in Switzerland in a hospital Wi-Fi café, then the United States will have to assess the effects of the DDoS attack on that network and whether the resultant collateral damage can be mitigated by modifying the malware.¹¹¹ By comparison, such modifications are consistent with DoD Collateral Damage Estimation Methodologies (CDEM) for ¹⁰⁷ *Id.* at 108, 113. ¹⁰⁸ HENDERSON, *supra* note 102, at 7. ¹⁰⁹ TALLINN MANUAL, *supra* note 5, at 159 (Rule 51). ¹¹⁰ KENNETH ANDERSON &amp; MATTHEW WAXMAN, LAW AND ETHICS FOR AUTONOMOUS WEAPON SYSTEMS: WHY A BAN WON’T WORK AND HOW THE LAWS OF WAR CAN 12 (2013), available at http://www.hoover.org/publications/monographs/144241. ¹¹¹ TALLINN MANUAL, *supra* note 5, at 113. 2015 Pouring New Wine Into Old Bottles conventional weapons so as to avoid malware collaterally spreading or damaging other users, data, or networks.¹¹² An analysis of the Stuxnet malware revealed fail-safe features such as code that limited the infection to Siemens systems, the number of devices that each infected device could infect, and the self-destruct code erasing the virus on June 24, 2012.¹¹³ Regardless of the overall effectiveness of the fail-safe measures, they illustrate “the inherent caution” of Stuxnet’s creators as an attempt to prevent further damage to other systems.¹¹⁴ Nations attempting to develop more sophisticated cyber weapons will need to consider proportionality issues and collateral damage. ## VI. Practical Responses to Civilians who Directly Participate Despite challenges associated with cyber-warfare, States have a right of self-defense against civilians who conduct cyber-attacks during an armed conflict setting. While political and diplomatic measures remain available, the foregoing discussion provides an understanding of the nature of each response to a DPCH scenario assuming the offending civilian is located and attributed to the action. For the purposes of this framework, the U.S.-Iran armed conflict scenario discussed earlier will be utilized again. ## A. Non-kinetic Responses Non-kinetic response can be acknowledged or covert as discussed below. Cyber defenses, for example, can be employed to have a non-kinetic effect depending upon their intended effect and usage. If a hacker attempts to gain access into an otherwise prohibited system, the host system can utilize a defense that can essentially block such access with no further effect. More active cyber defenses include tracking hackers’ computers, hacking back into systems to retrieve data, shutting down systems, sabotaging data, infecting the attacker with malware, taking over the attacker’s botnet, or employing a botnet to track or attack the hacker’s computer.¹¹⁵ While active defense responses to DPCH seem plausible, LOAC principles must be taken into consideration. For instance, if a DoD system conducts an active defense hack-back or counter-attack using ¹¹² CDEM assesses the likelihood of collateral damage for conventional weapons based on several factors, such as types of weapons, employment tactics, proximity of civilian structures. See generally Major Jefferson D. Reynolds, *Collateral Damage on the 21st Century Battlefield: Enemy Exploitation of the Law of Armed Conflict, and the Struggle for a Moral High Ground*, 56 A.F. L. REV. 1 (2005). ¹¹³ Michael J. Gross, *Stuxnet Worm: A Declaration of Cyber-War*, VANITY FAIR (Apr. 2011), http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2011/04/stuxnet-201104. ¹¹⁴ *Id.* ¹¹⁵ Jody Westby, *Caution: Active Response to Cyber Attacks Has High Risk*, FORBES (Nov. 29, 2012, 10:52 AM), http://www.forbes.com/sites/jodywestby/2012/11/29/caution-active-response-to-cyber-attacks-has-high-risk/. 106 Naval Law Review LXIV malware, such programs must be capable of limited or no effects on innocent users or servers. A more interesting question is how such systems can distinguish between a criminal hacker and a LOAC hacker. At a minimum, in both cases, employing an active defense capable of preserving evidence and intelligence related to this hacker and operation will be critical for potential prosecution or follow-on responses.¹¹⁶ Offensive cyber capabilities with non-kinetic effects would employ similar effects described for active defenses. The distinction is that offensive capabilities would not necessarily occur as an automatic response from a computer, but rather a directed operation. ## B. Kinetic Responses Responding to a cyber-attack kinetically raises questions regarding escalation. A response can take on two forms: a conventional attack (e.g., a missile) or a cyber-attack with physical effects (e.g., Stuxnet). Due to political and diplomatic considerations, use of force by the United States will require nothing short of Presidential authorization. In the instance of international armed conflict, the legal framework for employing a kinetic attack against a designated hostile force or individual (e.g., via AUMF or “targeted killing”) is well settled.¹¹⁷ A cyber-attack with kinetic effects directed against designated hostile forces in a theater of combat is legally supportable. Similarly, the targeted killing of a U.S. terrorist in self-defense is also considered consistent with U.S. domestic law, whether conducted with a drone strike or a kinetic cyber-attack. As scholar Hays Parks notes, the targeted killing of a legitimate enemy is not assassination.¹¹⁸ If a civilian forfeits protection due to DPCH attacks or serves as a cyber-terrorist causing physical harm to U.S. civilians, he or she can be lawfully targeted with a kinetic attack. With this understanding, there will be some additional considerations. If the 13-year-old hacker is in Iran during the U.S.-Iranian conflict, the United States could escalate to kinetic force against the child no differently from an insurgent planting IEDs or shooting at a military convoy. On the other hand, kinetic operations during a cyber-only conflict expand the range of options available to the hostile nation for targeting a civilian cyber-attacker within its borders.¹¹⁹ In other words, Iran would be able to escalate to kinetic force in self-defense. Thus, in a cyber-only conflict, targeting this hacker kinetically may ¹¹⁶ *Id.* ¹¹⁷ *US to Outline Legal Backing for ‘Targeted Kill’ Programme*, THE GUARDIAN (Mar. 1, 2012, 2:58 AM), http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/05/us-legal-backing-targeted-kill-programme. ¹¹⁸ W. Hays Parks, *Memorandum of Law: Executive Order 12333 and Assassination*, ARMY LAW., Dec. 1989, at 4. ¹¹⁹ Herbert Lin, *Escalation Dynamics and Conflict Termination in Cyberspace*, STRAT. STUD. Q. 46, 65 (2012). 2015 Pouring New Wine Into Old Bottles undoubtedly escalate the conflict and requires political considerations. These considerations are heightened if kinetic force is applied to or within neutral nations as mentioned in Part IV. A kinetic response to a cyber-attack will require a case-by-case analysis of the nature of the cyber-attack’s operation, intended target(s), and underlying strategic significance.¹²⁰ At a minimum, kinetic action, whether conducted through conventional or cyber-attacks, should be limited in scope and duration, consistent with self-defense proportionality principles, in order to avert an unnecessary escalation. ## C. Covert Action In most cases, the benefit of acknowledged non-kinetic or kinetic cyber-attacks against a neutral nation will be significantly outweighed by the diplomatic, economic, and military backlashes that would occur. Such acts would undoubtedly be perceived as an act of aggression by the United Nations, as interpreted by the ICJ.¹²¹ For these reasons, covert action represents a readily available solution while CIL develops in this area. Responding to non-state actors performing cyber-attacks from neutral states presents complex issues given the potential of affronting neutrality and widening the conflict. The stealthy nature of cyber warfare enables covert action as use of the cyber domain enables anonymity, takes advantage of targeted individuals’ awareness, and utilizes speed that overcomes the ability to readily safeguard against the consequences.¹²² Returning to the earlier scenario involving the child hacker located in Switzerland, the United States could consider covert action to thwart this non-state actor. This scenario presumes that Switzerland is uncooperative in extraditing or precluding this child from committing cyber-attacks against the United States. First, the United States could consider a targeted killing operation against this individual within Swiss borders. The targeting of this child for DPCH in support of Iran would not be considered an assassination as prohibited by Executive Order 12333.¹²³ Under U.S. domestic law, an Authorization to Use Military Force will be required to authorize targeted killings. This requirement was illustrated in the U.S. campaign against al-Qaeda. Assuming the U.S.-Iranian conflict contains an AUMF, language should be included to at least authorize the killing of supporting parties for DPCH, regardless of location. This ¹²⁰ *Id.* at 61. ¹²¹ See generally UN Charter, arts. 2(4), 51; see also Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicar. v. U.S.), 1986 I.C.J. 14, 181 (June 27) (separate opinion of Judge Ago); Jensen, *supra* note 89, at 821. ¹²² Ellyne Phneah, *Cyber Warfare Not Theoretical, Can Actually Kill*, ZDNET (Nov. 17, 2011, 5:26 AM), http://www.zdnet.com/cyber-warfare-not-theoretical-can-actually-kill-2062302921/. ¹²³ Parks, *supra* note 118. Naval Law Review LXIV proposition would provide legal credibility since Executive Order 12333 prohibits the unlawful, politically-motivated killing of a person who is not a legitimate target. Alternatively, even if an AUMF does not have broader language, a covert targeted killing would still be lawful if it can be established that the killing was required in self-defense consistent with Article 51 of the UN Charter. To prevent attribution of such killing within Swiss borders, the United States could use military means, such as Special Forces operations analogous to those employed during the Osama bin Laden raid. Second, covert action could also be conducted for rendition of the child to prosecute him in the United States. The practice of rendition (also referred to as irregular rendition) is typically defined as the kidnapping or taking of an individual to move that person to the jurisdiction of another country.[124] This is distinguished from extraordinary rendition which involves transferring the individual to a foreign country for the purposes of detention and interrogation by a foreign government.[125] Rendition does not deprive U.S. courts of jurisdiction unless an applicable extradition treaty explicitly calls for that result and that treaty has been given legislative effect within U.S. domestic law.[126] Since the U.S.-Swiss extradition treaty contains no rendition language, the United States would not be barred from exercising jurisdiction and prosecuting this individual.[127] A covert action for rendition would resemble a raid using either special operations or U.S. law enforcement. Finally, covert action could be carried out against this individual via cyber means. A cyber-attack could have a non-kinetic or kinetic impact, as discussed earlier, and would be a more tenable solution if the originator of the attack were unknown. A covert operation employing cyber capabilities would require a complex number of variables beyond the scope of this article. Needless to say, such an operation would involve understanding the location of the child, a breakdown of the child's activities (pattern of life), an understanding of the targeted system's architecture, and other variables. A covert, non-kinetic cyberattack could be aimed at locating, tracking, and denying access to the 13-year-old hacker via the child's computer or home internet service provider. This kind of non-kinetic operation could be aimed at developing further intelligence on the child's activities for further planning should the child continue his or her attacks. 124 BARRY E.

Malware could be used to destroy the child’s data or to render the child’s computer unusable. On the other hand, if the desired effect is to kill the 13-year-old hacker, then a more elaborate cyber-attack would be required. Should the child need a pacemaker or medical assistance, a potential attack would include using malware or other cyber technique to kill the hacker, provided that the prohibition against unnecessary suffering was enforced. “CyberJacking,” the act of remotely taking control of someone’s vehicle, could be used as cyber means of a targeted killing.¹²⁸ In this past summer’s BlackHat conference, two researchers demonstrated how they could control a car using their laptop while within the car.¹²⁹ Such capabilities could easily be weaponized to target this 13-year-old hacker, assuming that the killing of the civilian driver or other occupants as collateral damage would be proportionally acceptable under the circumstances. ## VII. Conclusion In summary, DPCH will remain an ongoing concern in the coming years given the lack of an international consensus on the basic legal principles governing hostilities in the cyber domain. At a minimum, the Tallinn Manual’s DPCH framework provides clear guidance derived from IHL that will enable states to respond to civilian hackers who undertake hostilities in armed conflict while seeking to prevent collateral damage. While developing a cyber-hostilities treaty appears as a readily available solution, the sharp disagreement among states (e.g., the United States, Great Britain, France, China, Russia) on the basic principle of regulating the cyber domain makes such treaty a fleeting prospect. Nevertheless, states always retain the inherent authority of self-defense, regardless of the lack of international consensus concerning cyber hostilities. Thus, IHL provides an immediate legal framework for cyber operations. Over time, these practices will refine and crystalize into customary international law through State practice and opinio juris. Although international consensus seems unattainable, regional or organization practices such as the NATO effort in the Tallinn Manual support the development of CIL in those regions. While the cyber domain requires an analysis of the nature of hostilities, the principles of IHL govern the conduct of these hostilities in order to safeguard against collateral damage while preserving a state’s right of self-defense. ¹²⁸ Scott Schweitzer, *CyberJacking, Sophisticated Assassination*, CYBER WEAPONS &amp; WARFARE (Oct. 6, 2013, 8:55 AM), http://cyberweapons.blogspot.com/. ¹²⁹ *Id.* The BlackHat conference is a yearly event where thousands of security experts gather to discuss information security and expose vulnerabilities at the pertaining to computers, networks and other related digital media.

Under LOAC, civilians enjoy protection from being the direct target of armed attack. The notion of Direct Participation in Hostilities (DPH) provides that a civilian loses this protection for undertaking combat operations against military forces in an armed conflict.⁴ This concept became relevant in the U.S. campaigns in Iraq, Afghanistan, the Global War on Terror, and other overseas contingency operations. In these conflicts, U.S. forces confronted the problem by positively identifying and engaging a civilian determined to be directly participating in hostilities. Combining the complexity of DPH with the cyber domain presents a conundrum because, unlike traditional warfare, civilians who can directly participate in cyber hostilities need not be physically located within the theater of hostilities. A hacker who undertakes hostilities can attack from any location in the world with a laptop and internet access. Therefore, the issue of direct participation in cyber hostilities (DPCH) has many factors that will require analysis in order to develop a legal framework for response.\nThis article stands for the proposition that a civilian who directly participates in hostilities in the cyber domain forfeits protection and becomes a lawful target.

Moreover, customary international law (State practice and opinio juris) has not developed or crystallized as found in other areas of International Humanitarian Law (IHL). The ability to detect and defend against such attacks, whether State-sponsored or not, has become exceedingly difficult given the speed and regularity of occurrences within the cyber domain generally. On the subject of \"imminence\" alone, U.S. Government officials struggle to develop policy that applies traditional concepts to determine whether a strike in self-defense is justified or is preventative war and thus prohibited as an unprovoked act of aggression. Furthermore, unlike traditional combat, IHL applicability to CW has not been tested before the International Court of Justice (ICJ). Therefore, CW does not cleanly fit into the hostilities paradigm for which LOAC was created. It is analogous to pouring a new wine into an old bottle.\nNevertheless, IHL will serve as a baseline to regulate the conduct of CW until greater international consensus is reached. The fact that IHL does not specifically reference cyber operations does not imply that such operations are not subject to IHL, especially given the possibilities of physical harm caused by CW. Thus, as an international cyber warfare legal framework does not currently exist, the applied \"law\" is national policy interpreting and incorporating IHL as a foundation. Given the Frankenstein-like nature of this framework and uncertainties associated with cyber weapons, many national policies will not be readily transparent.

Furthermore, unlike traditional combat, IHL applicability to CW has not been tested before the International Court of Justice (ICJ). Therefore, CW does not cleanly fit into the hostilities paradigm for which LOAC was created. It is analogous to pouring a new wine into an old bottle.\nNevertheless, IHL will serve as a baseline to regulate the conduct of CW until greater international consensus is reached. The fact that IHL does not specifically reference cyber operations does not imply that such operations are not subject to IHL, especially given the possibilities of physical harm caused by CW.[11] Thus, as an international cyber warfare legal framework does not currently exist, the applied\"law\"is national policy interpreting and incorporating IHL as a foundation. Given the Frankenstein-like nature of this framework and uncertainties associated with cyber weapons, many national policies will not be readily transparent.[12] For example, many of the U.S. authorities and policies applicable to CW remain classified and withheld at the Jean-Marie Henckaerts, *Study on Customary International Humanitarian Law: A Contribution to the Understanding and Respect For the Rule of Law in Armed Conflict*, 87 INT'L REV.

While principally derived from customary international law and the 1907 Hague Convention, contemporary notions of distinction are codified in Article 48 of Additional Protocol I (AP I) to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, which provides: “In order to ensure respect for and protection of the civilian population and civilian objects, the Parties to the conflict shall at all times distinguish between the civilian population and combatants and between civilian objects and military objectives and accordingly shall direct their operations only against military objectives.”¹⁶ Thus, civilians enjoy protection from an armed attack as a generally accepted principle under IHL.¹⁷ Under the principle of distinction, parties to a conflict are required to distinguish between the civilian population and objects, and from otherwise lawful targets (e.g., military combatants).¹⁸ The United States and CCD COE acknowledged this requirement of distinction is required in CW.¹⁹ The notion of DPH, derived from Article 51(3) of AP I, provides that civilians shall enjoy protection from armed attack “unless and for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities” for international armed conflicts (IAC).²⁰ The notion is virtually identical for non-international armed conflicts (NIAC) as ¹³ *Id.* ¹⁴ Harold H.

While civilians are subject to lawful targeting while taking direct part in hostilities, they are only lawful targets “for such time as” or while they actually commit hostile acts directly producing harmful effects to an enemy.²² This preceding language providing for a temporal requirement remains controversial. Institutions such as the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) interpret this section very restrictively to mean that such civilians can only be targeted until he or she has returned to the pre-deployment location.²³ Thus, if a civilian conducts repeated attacks, that civilian will regain protection upon return from each engagement.²⁴ This remains highly debated among scholars and the ICRC. Other scholars take a broader view, allowing for targeting of a civilian long after he or she has lost protection.²⁵ For the purposes of cyber-conflict, the CCD COE agreed that the temporal requirement would at least include actions immediately preceding or subsequent to the qualifying act.²⁶ However, the CCD COE experts were split on the time between repeated attacks.²⁷ Thus, this issue is unresolved in both physical and cyber domains and will become a policy decision vis-à-vis rules of engagement or operational orders. This article will assume a broad view allowing for targeting in between attacks.\n## III. The Cumulative Factors of DPCH While the ICRC has not published similar comprehensive guidance on DPCH or CW, the ICRC’s DPH guidance remains helpful as discussed infra. Moreover, the ICRC contributed to the development of the Tallinn Manual and generally agrees with the rules developed with some exceptions.²⁸ In particular, many of the notions for resolving DPCH issues are derived from the ICRC’s interpretive guidance on DPH. Thus, the Tallinn Manual remains the most comprehensive work that serves as DPCH guidance within the framework of IHL. Rule 35 of the Tallinn Manual provides that an act of direct participation in hostilities by civilians renders them liable to be attacked, by cyber or other Naval Law Review LXIV lawful means.²⁹ Similar to AP I and AP II, Rule 35 describes that civilians are targetable “for such time as he or she is engaged in the qualifying act of direct participation.”³⁰ Rule 35 sets forth the three cumulative criteria (threshold of harm, direct causation, and belligerent nexus) for qualification of an act as direct participation in cyber hostilities that are derived from the ICRC interpretive guidance.³¹ This rule also provides discussion regarding specific nuances within each of the three factors require case-by-case consideration in order for a civilian to be targeted for losing protection as a result of DPCH.³² ## A. Understanding an Attack: Threshold of Harm Per Article 49(1) of AP I, “attacks” are acts of violence against the adversary, whether in offense or in defense.³³ To illustrate, military convoys in Iraq or Afghanistan would be able to target, in self-defense, a roadside Improvised Explosive Device (IED) bomber or sniper for engaging in a hostile act amounting to an attack. On the other hand, a civilian who simply stands in the middle of the road holding up a sign in protest does not qualify as an attack. Targeting this protestor would be prohibited under IHL unless that civilian committed or attempt to commit an act that amounts to direct participation. By analogy, the aforementioned Stuxnet worm would clearly illustrate a kinetic attack given the resultant physical damage to Iranian centrifuges.³⁴ Conversely, the same conclusion would not easily be reached for “hacktivists,” who protest by spamming computer networks with protest e-mails.³⁵ Therefore, to understand the definition of “cyber-attack,” an analysis of the “threshold of harm” associated with it is required. Factors involved in this analysis include: “the context of the event, the actor perpetrating the action (recognizing ²⁹ TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 118.\n³⁰ Id.\n³¹ Id.\n³² Id. at 119-121.\n³³ Additional Protocol I, supra note 4, art. 49(1); see also TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 106. (“[I]t is the use of violence against a target that distinguishes attacks from other military operations. Non-violent operations, such as psychological cyber operations or cyber espionage, do not qualify as attacks. ‘Acts of violence’ should not be understood as limited to activities that release kinetic force.... In this regard, note that chemical, biological, or radiological attacks do not usually have a kinetic effect on their designated target, but it is universally agreed that they constitute attacks as a matter of law.”)\n³⁴ 60 Minutes: Stuxnet: Computer Worm Opens New Era of Warfare (CBS television broadcast Jul. 1, 2012), available at http://www.cbsnews.com/news/stuxnet-computer-worm-opens-new-era-of-warfare-01-07-2012/.\n³⁵ Hacktivism is defined as the use of computer hacking to help advance political or social causes. See Mark Manion &amp; Abby Goodrum, Terrorism or Civil Disobedience: Toward a Hacktivist Ethic, 30 COMPUTERS &amp; SOC’Y 14 (2000).\n\nchallenging issues of attribution in cyberspace), the target and location, [and] effects and intent, among other possible issues.”³⁶ The Department of Defense (DoD) defines “cyber-attack” as: A hostile act using computer or related networks or systems, and intended to disrupt and/or destroy an adversary’s critical cyber systems, assets, or functions. The intended effects of cyber-attack are not necessarily limited to the targeted computer systems or data themselves—for instance, attacks on computer systems which are intended to degrade or destroy infrastructure or [command and control] capability. A cyber-attack may use intermediate delivery vehicles including peripheral devices, electronic transmitters, embedded code, or human operators. The activation or effect of a cyber-attack may be widely separated temporally and geographically from the delivery.³⁷ The U.S. definition provides some inference that a cyber-attack need not physically destroy systems to qualify as an attack. Rather, disruption of these systems will suffice as meeting a threshold of harm.³⁸ By comparison, the ICRC’s DPH guidance provides some level of amplification on this point, despite not directly speaking about DPCH or CW specifically. The ICRC indicates that the threshold of harm for DPH is satisfied when the civilian’s actions adversely affect military operations or the military capacity of a party to the conflict.³⁹ The ICRC states that the denial of an adversary’s military use of certain objects, equipment, and territory would reach the required threshold of harm.⁴⁰ The ICRC specifically notes that the electronic interference with military computer networks would fall into this category of denial, whether accomplished through computer network attacks (CNA) or computer network exploitation (CNE).⁴¹ As cybersecurity strategist Joshua ³⁶ Koh, supra note 14, at 4; see also Schmitt, supra note 14, at 19.\n³⁷ Memorandum from Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to Chiefs of the Military Services et al., subject: Joint Terminology for Cyberspace Operations (Nov. 2010) [hereinafter “Joint Terminology for Cyberspace Operations”].\n³⁸ Id.\n³⁹ ICRC DPH GUIDANCE, supra note 23, at 48.\n⁴⁰ Id.\n⁴¹ Id. at 48. CNA is defined as a “category of fires employed for offensive purposes in which actions are taken through the use of computer networks to disrupt, deny, degrade, manipulate, or destroy information resident in the target system or computer networks, or the systems/networks themselves.”; CNE is defined as “[e]nabling operations and intelligence collection capabilities conducted through the use of computer networks to gather data about target or adversary automated LXIV Corman notes, a cyber-attack is essentially no different from electronic warfare where an adversary denies military use of equipment through jamming or interfering with a network.⁴² Thus, a civilian who engages in actions tantamount to interference with military communications or operations through CNA (e.g., a Denial of Service operation) or CNE would constitute a DPCH attack in ICRC’s view.\nThe Tallinn Manual thus incorporates the ICRC’s notion by stating that: [T]he act (or a closely related series of acts) must have the intended or actual effect of negatively affecting the adversary’s military operations or capabilities, or inflicting death, physical harm, or material destruction on persons or objects protected against direct attack (threshold of harm).⁴³ The CCD COE experts provide that a cyber-attack that satisfies the “threshold of harm” is an operation that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects.⁴⁴ The CCD COE was very specific that this “limitation should not be understood as excluding cyber operations against data (which are non-physical entities) from the ambit of the term attack.”⁴⁵ This is especially true if an operation against data upon which the functionality of physical objects relies can sometimes constitute an attack.⁴⁶ However, for the purposes of DPCH against military adversaries, the CCD COE clarifies that there is no requirement for physical damage to objects or harm to individuals so long as a cyber-attack negatively affects enemy military operations.⁴⁷ For example, a cyber-attack that disrupts the operation of the military’s command and control network would satisfy the criterion.⁴⁸ Disruption in this context does not mean physical damage to servers, data, or computers. Rather, it simply implies interference, no different from radio or radar jamming. This proposition is consistent with the ICRC’s view under DPH. Stated negatively, if these actions were not directed at an adversary’s military capability, the ICRC requires that the “specific act must be likely to cause at information systems or networks.” See Joint Terminology for Cyberspace Operations, supra note 37, at 3-4.\n⁴² Skype Interview with cybersecurity strategist Joshua Corman, Chief Technology Officer at Sonatype (Sept. 23, 2013) (video recordation on file with author).\n⁴³ TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 119.\n⁴⁴ Id. at 107.\n⁴⁵ Id. at 107–08.\n⁴⁶ Id. at 119.\n⁴⁷ Id.\n⁴⁸ Id.\n\nPouring New Wine Into Old Bottles least death, injury, or destruction” of property in order to reach this threshold of harm.⁴⁹ Thus, the ICRC’s notion as applied to CW means that a civilian hacker interfering with a civilian computer system (e.g., Social Security), instead of the military, would not necessarily lose protection for that purpose unless it can be demonstrated that either the cyber-attack against the non-military network was intended to have an effect on the military in some fashion or that physical harm would otherwise result.\nAs an aside, this notion of physical harm to a non-military network need not be defined in the physical destruction associated with a kinetic strike. An emerging trend is to define physical harm in the cyber domain as the level of effect on the functionality of the targeted object.⁵⁰ Some experts argue that if a cyber-attack impairs the functionality such that physical components require replacement, then this would constitute damage as envisaged in the concept of attack.⁵¹ Other experts provide that physical component replacement is not required; loss of functionality through data corruption requiring software reinstallation or network rebooting would constitute “physical damage.”⁵² While the physical damage standard is not required for military networks, understanding this disparity is important if cyber-attacks against non-military networks occur as part of greater campaign during an armed conflict.\n## B. Direct Causation The ICRC guidance provides that there must be a direct causation from the civilian act to the harm suffered for the act to potentially constitute DPH.⁵³ In particular, the ICRC states: “there must be a direct causal link between a specific act and the harm likely to result either from that act, or from a coordinated military operation of which that act constitutes an integral part.”⁵⁴ In terms of a physical context, this implies that the harm suffered cannot be the result of an indirect or secondary order effect. The Tallinn Manual aligns with the ICRC’s DPH analysis by requiring the existence of “a direct causal link between the act in question and the harm intended or inflicted.”⁵⁵ In CW, this standard appears easier to fulfill than in the physical combat scenario, where “fog of war” tends to complicate the issue. By analogy, if a civilian farmer fires his weapon at another local national to ward off livestock poaching, the sound of gunfire or the physical impact of a bullet may incite a nearby military patrol to ⁴⁹ ICRC DPH GUIDANCE, supra note 23, at 49.\n⁵⁰ Droege, supra note 11, at 557–58.\n⁵¹ TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 108.\n⁵² Id. at 109.\n⁵³ ICRC DPH GUIDANCE, supra note 23, at 50–51.\n⁵⁴ Id. at 51.\n⁵⁵ TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 119.\nNaval Law Review LXIV engage in self-defense. In some instances, mere possession and public display of personal weapons, could be perceived as a threat without additional accompanying acts.\nOn the other hand, CW will not suffer from the same “fog of war” issue. The use of a cyber-weapon to deny a military’s capability or interfere with a military operation can hardly be seen as incidental or an indirect cause.⁵⁶ The Tallinn Manual supports this point through the example of disruption to the enemy’s command and control as being directly caused by a cyber-attack.⁵⁷ Therefore, if a civilian hacker gained access into a military network to exploit or disrupt the network, that civilian’s acts would be the direct cause of the harm suffered, rendering him or her targetable. As a counterpoint, this theory should not discount the possibility of accidental cyber-attacks by civilian entities or individuals. There are potential scenarios where technology companies or independent contractors could theoretically accidentally release malware onto a network. However, the Tallinn Manual and ICRC guidance on direct causation does not address the underlying intentions behind the action. Thus, the challenge with these scenarios is that they reinforce the notion of reasonable precautions within IHL (i.e., the obligation to take reasonable precautions to avoid or minimize incidental civilian losses).⁵⁸ Therefore, while fog of war is relatively diminished, prior to responding to a cyber-attack premised upon DPCH, reasonable precautions (e.g., reviewing human, electronic, and signals intelligence; verifying the source of the attack; using the least destructive means available to neutralize the threat) should be taken to minimize potentially attacking an otherwise innocent party.⁵⁹ ## C. Belligerent Nexus The ICRC DPH guidance provides that: In order to meet the requirement of belligerent nexus, an act must be specifically designed to directly cause the required threshold of harm in support of a party to the conflict and to the detriment of another.⁶⁰ ⁵⁶ Id. at 119–20.\n⁵⁷ Id. at 120.\n⁵⁸ Additional Protocol I, supra note 4, art. 57(1); see also Customary IHL—Rule 15. Precautions in Attack, INT’L COMM. OF THE RED CROSS, http://www.icrc.org/customary-ibl/eng/docs/v1_cha_chapter5_rule15 (last visited July 30, 2014) (suggesting that Article 13(1) of Additional Protocol II implies this obligation); TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 164–65.\n⁵⁹ See generally TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 159–176 (Rules 51–58).\n⁶⁰ ICRC DPH GUIDANCE, supra note 23, at 58.\n\nHostile acts such as firing a weapon at an enemy or planting a bomb serve as easy examples. As a qualifying statement, the ICRC notes that acts that do not satisfy the threshold of harm are “non-belligerent... and, therefore, must be addressed through law enforcement measures.” 61 A seminal example is the IED maker whose actions contribute to hostilities without necessarily being connected to the conflict. In this example, if the intelligence shows that the IED maker is developing and supplying bombs for the insurgents as a part of an ongoing campaign, then he/she is targetable. This analysis will change if he/she is just selling them to the insurgents. The ICRC also provides that the belligerent nexus element does not require a subjective intent determination, where the state of mind of the person is at issue in committing the act.62 The ICRC posits that a belligerent nexus requires an objective standard expressed in the design of the act or operation which does not depend on the mindset of every participating individual.63 Belligerent nexus is generally not influenced by factors such as personal distress or preferences, or by the mental ability or willingness of persons to assume responsibility for their conduct. Consequently, if an insurgent is forced or coerced in some manner to commit an attack, he/she would still be lawfully targetable under IHL.\nAs applied, the Tallinn Manual expounds on the ICRC’s belligerent nexus notion by stating that cyber acts must be directly related to the hostilities between parties to a conflict.64 By example, if a civilian directs a cyber-attack against a military’s command and control node, his or her actions would satisfy this condition as it impacts a military force to the benefit of the opposition. Equally, if a hacker were coerced to commit this cyber-attack, he or she would lose protection and become lawfully targetable. The Tallinn Manual’s criterion rules out acts of a purely criminal or private nature that occur during an armed conflict.65 For example, hackers, using cyber means to commit a variety of crimes against non-military institutions, would not be targetable even if the victim State were a party to the conflict.66 However, if the criminal actions were conducted to support particular military operations of one party and to the detriment of the military opposition, then the civilian would forfeit protection for DPCH.\n\nLXIV ## IV. As Applied: Which Civilians are Targetable?\nGiven these cumulative factors, consideration should be given as to the categories of civilians who become lawful targets under DPCH. Up front, government-employed or -contracted computer technicians and related personnel would not be targetable under Geneva Convention III (GC III) as “persons who accompany the armed forces without actually being members thereof,” provided they fulfill more support roles and do not directly participate in hostilities.67 On the other hand, if government contracted personnel were to engage in cyber hostilities, they would lose protection analogous to mercenaries.68 Similarly, civilians who serve a continuous combat function in an organized armed group during an IAC or NIAC are targetable.69 At a minimum, the Tallinn Manual’s guidance provides that members of organized armed groups, whether as levée en masse or not, who directly participate in hostilities, are targetable.70 Such civilians will remain targetable throughout the conflict, including the temporal breaks in between or after attacks mentioned supra. However, the CCD COE experts remain divided over this issue. Some experts argue that a civilian who is simply a member of the group is targetable regardless of their nature, no differently from members of a uniformed armed force (with exception for protected clergy and medical personnel); others follow the ICRC DPH guidance requirement of a “continuous combat function.” Thus, a cook or administrative clerk for a non-state cyber-combat organization would not be targetable under the ICRC standard. This issue remains unresolved in the physical domain and will be resolved through policy or rules of engagement (ROE) decisions by leaders on a fact-specific basis. Nevertheless, civilians will be more readily targetable if they are part of a hostile group actively partaking in the armed conflict.\nNotwithstanding these preliminary categories, identifying a civilian directly participating in cyber hostilities will be fact-specific and require a case-by-case analysis consistent with the principles discussed in Part III. Using these cumulative factors, the examples below illustrate the Tallinn Manual’s principles applied to unaffiliated civilians who directly participate in cyber hostilities. While not exhaustive, these examples serve as possible permutations for illustrating DPCH analysis via the Tallinn Manual and the ICRC’s DPH guidance.\n\n## A. Example One: The Case of the 13-year-old Thrill Seeker\nCivilians who are not parties to an IAC or NIAC may be lawfully targeted where they directly participate in cyber hostilities. Consider the hypothetical situation where, during an IAC between the U.S. and Iran, a 13-year-old child is armed with a laptop and malware. In this scenario, this hacker perpetrates a cyber-attack from Switzerland that is designed to disrupt a U.S. military logistics system related to moving of supplies and personnel for the purposes of disrupting (but not physically damaging) processes. This is especially conceivable given the inexpensive nature of developing or acquiring malicious code.[72] Just recently a 12-year-old pled guilty to charges in Canada for hacking government systems in support of the international network of hacktivists known as Anonymous.[73]\nOnce this hypothetical 13-year-old child conducts a cyber-attack by transmitting malware into this U.S. military logistics system, the child has clearly forfeited protection and is targetable for the following reasons: first, this act qualifies as an attack given that it meets the threshold of harm by disrupting military operations, where physical harm is not required;[74] secondly, the child's act of launching the malware directly causes the subsequent disruption (or attempted disruption);[75] lastly, the child's act satisfies the belligerent nexus element because the hostile act is directed against the U.S. military network and objectively benefits Iran.[76] Thus, the 13-year-old hacker is a lawful military target under a DPCH theory consistent with the ICRC and Tallinn Manual. Assuming the child only gained access to the network to exploit information by posting it to the internet, the child would still be targetable because such an act would exploit a vulnerability to the benefit of Iran. Conversely, if the child's actions were directed at a U.S. banking network, then the child's actions would be considered a criminal matter, unless the intelligence demonstrates that the child's actions were connected to the exploitation of U.S. infrastructure vulnerabilities in support of Iran's military campaign.\n[71] Emily Crawford, *Virtual Battlegrounds: Direct Participation in Cyber Warfare*, 9 ISJLP 1, 15 (2013), available at http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/students/groups/is/files/2013/08/5-Crawford.pdf.\n[72] Daniel Cohen &amp; Aviv Rotbart, *The Use of Code Mutation to Produce Multi-use Cyber Weapons*, THE INSTITUTE FOR NATIONAL SECURITY STUDIES (Jul. 8, 2013), http://www.inss.org.il/index.aspx?id=4538&amp;articleid=5163.\n[73] Lisa Vaas, *12-year-old Canadian Boy Admits to Hacking Police and Government Sites for Anonymous*, NAKED SECURITY (Oct. 26, 2013), http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2013/10/26/12-year-old-canadian-boy-admits-to-hacking-police-and-government-sites-for-anonymous; David Kushner, *The Masked Avengers, How Anonymous Incited Online Vigilantism from Tunisia to Ferguson*, THE NEW YORKER (SEP. 8, 2014), http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/09/08/masked-avengers.\n[74] TALLINN MANUAL, *supra* note 5, at 119.\n[75] Turns, *supra* note 8, at 295.\n[76] *Id.*\n\nLXIV ## B. Example Two: Hacktivist⁷⁷ Patriotic hacktivism adds a different dimension to DPCH given that their activities may or may not cross the threshold of harm or have a nexus to the conflict. Russian hacktivists participated in a myriad of activities in Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in 2008.⁷⁸ Similar to the above example, a hacktivist, who disrupts military networks through distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, is targetable regardless of his or her subjective underlying intent. However, the analysis will change depending on whether their activities disrupt military operations. Suppose during this U.S.-Iranian conflict, a hacktivist from Anonymous decides to deploy a conspicuous message on a high-traffic, non-DoD, U.S. Government website as a form of cyber-protest of the war. While criminal, these actions will not constitute DPCH if the hacker's actions do not have a belligerent nexus to the conflict, directly cause disruption to military operations, or cause physical harm. This scenario would be true if the hacktivist's actions were targeted against the Affordable Care Act or Department of Justice websites.⁷⁹ On a sliding scale, the analysis changes if the hacker leaves a conspicuous message on a DoD information website as a form of\"cyber-protest\"of the war. An analysis of those actions is required to determine if the message interferes or disrupts military operations in order to satisfy the belligerent nexus requirement (supporting Iran). For example, if it could be determined that the message was designed to undermine the morale of DoD users fighting the war or interfere with military members' readiness (e.g., disrupting military members' pay on the Defense Finance and Accounting Service website), the hacktivist is clearly targetable under LOAC. However, if a hacktivist's message or action cannot be readily connected to the conflict, he or she is still\"at risk of being targeted, as their attacks would be difficult to differentiate from attacks being conducted by persons with a connection to the hostilities.\"⁸⁰ ## C. Example Three: Malware Programmer⁸¹ Other roles, such as a malware programmer, are more complex to analyze for DPCH purposes because of the question of direct causation, no different from a weapons builder. Returning to the example of the U.S.-Iran conflict, a cyber-weapons programmer could have played a role in developing ⁷⁷ Id. at 293.\n⁷⁸ Id. at 293, n.59.\n⁷⁹ TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 119–20.\n⁸⁰ Crawford, supra note 71, at 17.\n⁸¹ Id. at 16; see Turns, supra note 8, at 295.\n\nand providing the malware to the 13-year-old hacker. Whether the programmer is targetable depends on the nature of his or her involvement in supporting the hacker. According to the Tallinn Manual, if the programmer had specifically designed the malware for exploitation of a DoD vulnerability (e.g., a military logistics or finance website), then the malware programmer can be targeted. In this instance, the malware programmer's acts (designing a code to exploit a DoD vulnerability) directly cause the disruptive harm to the military's operations, directly benefiting Iran. Thus, the programmer can be lawfully engaged in addition to the 13-year-old executing the code.⁸² By analogy, an IED developer who designs bombs specifically to exploit U.S. military vehicles (e.g., up-armored HUMVEEs or MRAPs) is targetable under DPH.\nConversely, if the malware programmer's only activity is developing generalized malware made available on a website, then causation would not be satisfied given the remoteness of involvement.⁸³ This permutation resembles someone ordering firearms from an online vendor. An online vendor of cyber weapons does not become targetable, unless it is demonstrated that this developer is selling specialized malware to undermine DoD systems during an armed conflict. On the other hand, if the programmer designs malware for the 13-year-old, unaware of the intended target, there may be two possible outcomes.⁸⁴ The CCD COE members were divided on malware programmers in this scenario.⁸⁵ Drawing from the analogy of an IED builder, if military intelligence can establish factors supporting the inference that malware is specifically designed to exploit military weaknesses, then the programmer is targetable, unlike a person developing Trojan Horse viruses downloadable via a website. In short, further targeting decisions of malware programmers will require additional indicia of direct causation.\n## D. Technical Support Personnel⁸⁶ As a final example, technical support personnel require consideration under a DPCH analysis. If the 13-year-old hacker solicits technical support, the nature of that individual's involvement will be a determining factor for DPCH. If the hacker contacts technical support to assist with hardware or system software issues pertaining to the computer, then the support personnel will not be targetable as they are neither connected to the conflict nor the direct cause of harm.⁸⁷ This result would be the same if the technical personnel assisted with ⁸² Turns, supra note 8, at 295.\n⁸³ TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 120.\n⁸⁴ Id.\n⁸⁵ Id.\n⁸⁶ Crawford, supra note 71, at 17.\n⁸⁷ Id.\n\nLXIV hardware and software issues knowing the intentions of the hacker.⁸⁸ These personnel are criminally liable for such actions under a domestic framework within the United States, but are not targetable under LOAC. On the other hand, if a malware programmer provides technical assistance or instructive guidance to the child hacker on refining malware to exploit DoD systems, then the programmer (as a technical advisor) would lose their protected status and be targetable consistent with the Tallinn Manual’s view of a DPCH framework.\n## V. Challenges The cumulative criteria mentioned above provide only a starting point for understanding what actions render a civilian targetable under LOAC. The decision to use force against a non-state civilian actor who directly participates in hostilities raises a myriad of other issues that will require consideration by states engaged in armed conflict. Each topic is individually complex and could be explored in elaborate discussions beyond the scope of this article. Nevertheless, the below discussions are limited to understanding how a state should consider these issues prior to considering a response to a civilian who forfeits protection under DPCH. These scenarios assume that the non-state actor’s attacks are not attributable to the state.\n## A. Sovereignty “Longstanding notions of sovereignty fall apart when it comes to cyber operations.”⁸⁹ This quote foretells of a complex predicament should neutral nations become the staging grounds for non-state actors launching cyber-attacks in either IACs or NIACs. Of equal importance, the manner in which a State responds to civilians participating in CW from outside the theater of hostilities presents a challenging issue given that such neutral States maintain the inherent right of self-defense pursuant to Article 51 of the U.N. Charter.⁹⁰ For IACs, LOAC provides that belligerent nations are prohibited from actions that harm a neutral nation and draw it into the conflict in any fashion.⁹¹ Conversely, neutral ⁸⁸ *Id.* at 18.\n⁸⁹ Eric Talbot Jensen, *Sovereignty and Neutrality in Cyber Conflict*, 35 FORDHAM INT’L L.J. 815, 816 (2012) (citing David Perera, *Schmidle: Cyber Ops Might Require New Combatant Command Structure*, FIERCEGOVERNMENTIT (May 15, 2011, 4:29 PM), http://www.fiercegovernmentit.com/story/schmidle-cyber-ops-might-require-newcombatant-command-structure/2011-05-15 (quoting Lieutenant General Robert Schmidle, Deputy Commander of US Cyber Command)).\n⁹⁰ *Id.*; see also UN Charter art. 51.\n⁹¹ Jensen, *supra* note 89, at 819; see also INT’L COMM. OF THE RED CROSS, *THE LAW OF ARMED CONFLICT: LESSON 8: NEUTRALITY* (2002), available at http://www.icrc.org/eng/assets/files/other/law8_final.pdf (“The sources of the international law of neutrality are customary international law and, for certain questions, international treaties, in particular the Paris Declaration of 1856, the 1907 Hague Convention No. V respecting the Rights Pouring New Wine Into Old Bottles nations have an obligation to maintain neutrality by preventing actions within their territories that cause harm to a party to a conflict.⁹² While it is arguable that the law of neutrality does not extend to NIACs, the international law principle of *sic utere* provides that a state cannot knowingly allow its territory to be used to the detriment of another.⁹³ Moreover, as illustrated in the *Nicaragua v. United States*⁹⁴ case, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) supported the proposition that states engaged in non-international conflict enjoy a right of non-interference from outside parties.⁹⁵ To illustrate, suppose the non-state actor sponsored 13-year-old hacker launches a cyber-attack against the United States from Switzerland in support of Iran. Notwithstanding the existence of an extradition treaty, Switzerland has had a history of harboring U.S. fugitives.⁹⁶ In this scenario, suppose also that the United States locates and identifies the attacker. If the Swiss preclude this individual from attacking further but refuse to extradite, then the United States would no longer be able to target this individual under the temporal considerations of a LOAC analysis. Alternatively, if the Swiss take no action at all or are unable to prevent harm from occurring, then the United States would find itself in a predicament that theoretically draws a comparison of physical terrorist attacks launched from lawless countries, including (pre-9/11) Afghanistan or Somalia.⁹⁷ Thus, the United States can launch a non-kinetic and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons in Case of War on Land, the 1907 Hague Convention No. XIII concerning the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers in Naval War, the four 1949 Geneva Conventions[,] and Additional Protocol I of 1977. The United Nations Charter of 1945 and Security Council decisions based on the Charter may in certain circumstances modify the law of neutrality. For example, Article 2(5) of the Charter requires UN Member States to give the UN every assistance in any action it takes, and Article 25 requires UN members to accept and comply with the decisions of the Security Council; the enforcement measures spelled out in Chapter VII can also have an impact, as they are governed by particular rules which differ from those of the law of neutrality.”).\n⁹² Jensen, *supra* note 89, at 819.\n⁹³ Jutta Brunnée, *Sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas*, in *9 MAX PLANCK ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW* 188 (2012); See also Jack Goldsmith, *Thoughts on the Latest Round of Johnson v.

Moreover, the United States can target the 13-year-old kinetically for committing cyber-attacks against its military consistent with the cumulative factors under the Tallinn Manual's view.\nBoth responses would be proffered as an “unwilling or unable” international law argument.⁹⁸ Although scholars support this standard’s incorporation into customary international law, the ICJ rejected it on several occasions and thus, the “unwilling or unable” doctrine remains contentious and unsettled within customary international law (CIL).⁹⁹ Should the United States invoke this standard, as in the case of Afghanistan in 2002, a U.S. response without Switzerland’s permission could result in strong political and military repercussions. Unlike Afghanistan before September 2001, Switzerland is not a lawless State, but still bears the responsibility under the *sic utere* doctrine to prevent international cyber-attacks from occurring within its national borders. In response to a U.S. kinetic or non-kinetic attack against the hacker, the Swiss could bring the issue to the ICJ. Switzerland could also respond militarily or in the cyber domain in self-defense against the United States. Given the permutations involved, this scenario illustrates the several considerations the United States would confront in conducting a counter-attack against a hacker located in a neutral State that refuses to cooperate.\n## B. Law of Targeting Considerations If the United States responds to this hacker in the cyber or physical domain, “targeting law” will certainly apply in both cases. “Targeting law” evaluates whether the weapon’s employment (methodology) would violate the general principles of LOAC.¹⁰⁰ The general principles of LOAC involve military necessity, distinction, proportionality, and humanity.¹⁰¹ For the purposes of kinetic operations using conventional means in the physical domain, targeting law remains well settled. As noted in the Tallinn Manual, these concepts do apply in the cyber domain and will require further examination. “Military necessity may be defined as the principle that justifies the use of all measures needed to defeat the enemy as quickly and efficiently as possible that are not prohibited by the law of war.”¹⁰² Thus, military commanders must act in a manner necessary for advancing military objectives and ensure that their actions ⁹⁸ Goldsmith, *supra* note 93.\n⁹⁹ *Id.* ¹⁰⁰ Jeffrey S. Thurnher, *The Law that Applies to Autonomous Weapon Systems*, 17 AM. SOC’Y INT’L L. INSIGHTS (Jan. 18, 2013), http://www.asil.org/insights/volume/17/issue/4/law-applies-autonomous-weapon-systems.\n¹⁰¹ U.S. DEP’T. OF DEF., DOD LAW OF WAR MANUAL 50, ¹⁰² *Id.* at 52. See also IAN HENDERSON, THE CONTEMPORARY LAW OF TARGETING 7 (2009).\n\nare not otherwise prohibited by another principle of LOAC.¹⁰³ As a principle, military necessity not only tolerates violence towards the enemy but alternative operations which influence or impede the enemy (e.g. psychological operations, electronic jamming, intelligence operations).¹⁰⁴ As applied, cyber-attacks may be employed against military objectives provide such actions do not violate the principles of proportionality, humanity, and distinction.\n“Humanity” implies that belligerents should not cause unnecessary suffering. The CCD COE posits that “[m]eans and methods of cyber warfare will only in rare cases violate this Rule.”¹⁰⁵ However, the Tallinn Manual illustrates a possible violation of this rule through hacking into a victim’s pacemaker to stop the target’s heart and then reviving him multiple times before finally killing him.¹⁰⁶ An example could include hacking into pharmaceutical records for the purpose of prescribing medications aimed at causing long-term allergic reactions leading to death. Using a cyber-attack to poison or corrupt a military water supply serves as another example as strictly prohibited as a violation of this LOAC principle. Given the ramifications, U.S. policy would exclude attacking this hacker through means that cause unnecessary suffering.\nAs mentioned earlier, “distinction” requires combatants to distinguish between lawful military targets (opposing combatants and their equipment and facilities) and protected persons (e.g., civilians, medical personnel, chaplains, hors de combat) and property. However, in DPH and DPCH targeting contexts, distinction requires discriminating between civilians who have forfeited protection from those civilians and related objects that retain protection. Thus, if the United States were to conduct a non-kinetic cyber-attack against the 13-year-old hacker via a Swiss server, the United States would need to utilize malware that targets the offending computer only with no adverse effect or corruption of the server or other resident users. Similarly, if the 13-year-old hacker were using a Wi-Fi café in a Swiss hospital, the United States would not be able to attack the hospital’s server given that it is protected. If the United States can transmit a response (e.g., a DDoS attack) through the Wi-Fi café router that only impacts the targeted computer, then distinction would be otherwise satisfied. Similarly, targeting servers for non-kinetic (e.g., DDoS) or kinetic (e.g., Stuxnet-type virus) purposes requires verification of the hacker’s location. Therefore, the United States would need intelligence models on the systems’ architects and servers in order to modify malware to distinguish civilian perpetrators from protected persons.\n¹⁰³ Id. at 52.\n¹⁰⁴ Id. at 53.\n¹⁰⁵ TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 5, at 144.\n¹⁰⁶ Id.\nNaval Law Review LXIV Traditionally, the term civilian objects implied buildings, utilities (e.g., power lines), and related infrastructure. For cyber considerations, civilian objects would include such items as servers, computers, and related hardware. Data is also considered a protected object, especially if the data on a resident server is owned by a protected civilian. As mentioned, the CCD COE specifically chose not exclude data from the ambit of the term “attack.” This is especially true where malware is directed against data that physical objects rely upon for functionality.¹⁰⁷ Thus, a cyber-attack that damages protected civilian data would violate the rules of distinction. While the data’s restoration via a backup could serve as a test for targeting, this is not the test used for physical property since buildings can be rebuilt, and cars can be remanufactured over time. Thus, this issue remains unsettled and a consideration for distinction. As applied, if the Wi-Fi café shares the same servers which contain patients’ records and data, then the intentional damage to such data would violate this principle.\nTargeting law also requires a “proportionality” analysis.¹⁰⁸ The Tallinn Manual restates the requirements for proportionality codified in customary international law and in AP I: A cyber[-]attack that may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated is prohibited.¹⁰⁹ While this principle is simply stated, proportionality is entirely subjective given that comparing the value of a military advantage to damage to civilians is tantamount to comparing “apples to oranges.”¹¹⁰ The analysis becomes case-specific, based on the nature of the target and the national thresholds for collateral damage. As applied, if the United States decides to conduct a DDoS attack against the 13-year-old hacker in Switzerland in a hospital Wi-Fi café, then the United States will have to assess the effects of the DDoS attack on that network and whether the resultant collateral damage can be mitigated by modifying the malware.¹¹¹ By comparison, such modifications are consistent with DoD Collateral Damage Estimation Methodologies (CDEM) for ¹⁰⁷ *Id.* at 108, 113.\n¹⁰⁸ HENDERSON, *supra* note 102, at 7.\n¹⁰⁹ TALLINN MANUAL, *supra* note 5, at 159 (Rule 51).\n¹¹⁰ KENNETH ANDERSON &amp; MATTHEW WAXMAN, LAW AND ETHICS FOR AUTONOMOUS WEAPON SYSTEMS: WHY A BAN WON’T WORK AND HOW THE LAWS OF WAR CAN 12 (2013), available at http://www.hoover.org/publications/monographs/144241.\n¹¹¹ TALLINN MANUAL, *supra* note 5, at 113.\n\nconventional weapons so as to avoid malware collaterally spreading or damaging other users, data, or networks.¹¹² An analysis of the Stuxnet malware revealed fail-safe features such as code that limited the infection to Siemens systems, the number of devices that each infected device could infect, and the self-destruct code erasing the virus on June 24, 2012.¹¹³ Regardless of the overall effectiveness of the fail-safe measures, they illustrate “the inherent caution” of Stuxnet’s creators as an attempt to prevent further damage to other systems.¹¹⁴ Nations attempting to develop more sophisticated cyber weapons will need to consider proportionality issues and collateral damage.\n## VI. Practical Responses to Civilians who Directly Participate Despite challenges associated with cyber-warfare, States have a right of self-defense against civilians who conduct cyber-attacks during an armed conflict setting. While political and diplomatic measures remain available, the foregoing discussion provides an understanding of the nature of each response to a DPCH scenario assuming the offending civilian is located and attributed to the action. For the purposes of this framework, the U.S.-Iran armed conflict scenario discussed earlier will be utilized again.\n## A. Non-kinetic Responses Non-kinetic response can be acknowledged or covert as discussed below. Cyber defenses, for example, can be employed to have a non-kinetic effect depending upon their intended effect and usage. If a hacker attempts to gain access into an otherwise prohibited system, the host system can utilize a defense that can essentially block such access with no further effect. More active cyber defenses include tracking hackers’ computers, hacking back into systems to retrieve data, shutting down systems, sabotaging data, infecting the attacker with malware, taking over the attacker’s botnet, or employing a botnet to track or attack the hacker’s computer.¹¹⁵ While active defense responses to DPCH seem plausible, LOAC principles must be taken into consideration. For instance, if a DoD system conducts an active defense hack-back or counter-attack using ¹¹² CDEM assesses the likelihood of collateral damage for conventional weapons based on several factors, such as types of weapons, employment tactics, proximity of civilian structures. See generally Major Jefferson D. Reynolds, *Collateral Damage on the 21st Century Battlefield: Enemy Exploitation of the Law of Armed Conflict, and the Struggle for a Moral High Ground*, 56 A.F. L. REV. 1 (2005).\n¹¹³ Michael J. Gross, *Stuxnet Worm: A Declaration of Cyber-War*, VANITY FAIR (Apr. 2011), http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2011/04/stuxnet-201104.\n¹¹⁴ *Id.* ¹¹⁵ Jody Westby, *Caution: Active Response to Cyber Attacks Has High Risk*, FORBES (Nov. 29, 2012, 10:52 AM), http://www.forbes.com/sites/jodywestby/2012/11/29/caution-active-response-to-cyber-attacks-has-high-risk/.\n\nLXIV malware, such programs must be capable of limited or no effects on innocent users or servers. A more interesting question is how such systems can distinguish between a criminal hacker and a LOAC hacker. At a minimum, in both cases, employing an active defense capable of preserving evidence and intelligence related to this hacker and operation will be critical for potential prosecution or follow-on responses.¹¹⁶ Offensive cyber capabilities with non-kinetic effects would employ similar effects described for active defenses. The distinction is that offensive capabilities would not necessarily occur as an automatic response from a computer, but rather a directed operation.\n## B. Kinetic Responses Responding to a cyber-attack kinetically raises questions regarding escalation. A response can take on two forms: a conventional attack (e.g., a missile) or a cyber-attack with physical effects (e.g., Stuxnet). Due to political and diplomatic considerations, use of force by the United States will require nothing short of Presidential authorization. In the instance of international armed conflict, the legal framework for employing a kinetic attack against a designated hostile force or individual (e.g., via AUMF or “targeted killing”) is well settled.¹¹⁷ A cyber-attack with kinetic effects directed against designated hostile forces in a theater of combat is legally supportable. Similarly, the targeted killing of a U.S. terrorist in self-defense is also considered consistent with U.S. domestic law, whether conducted with a drone strike or a kinetic cyber-attack. As scholar Hays Parks notes, the targeted killing of a legitimate enemy is not assassination.¹¹⁸ If a civilian forfeits protection due to DPCH attacks or serves as a cyber-terrorist causing physical harm to U.S. civilians, he or she can be lawfully targeted with a kinetic attack. With this understanding, there will be some additional considerations.\nIf the 13-year-old hacker is in Iran during the U.S.-Iranian conflict, the United States could escalate to kinetic force against the child no differently from an insurgent planting IEDs or shooting at a military convoy. On the other hand, kinetic operations during a cyber-only conflict expand the range of options available to the hostile nation for targeting a civilian cyber-attacker within its borders.¹¹⁹ In other words, Iran would be able to escalate to kinetic force in self-defense. Thus, in a cyber-only conflict, targeting this hacker kinetically may ¹¹⁶ *Id.* ¹¹⁷ *US to Outline Legal Backing for ‘Targeted Kill’ Programme*, THE GUARDIAN (Mar. 1, 2012, 2:58 AM), http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/05/us-legal-backing-targeted-kill-programme.\n¹¹⁸ W. Hays Parks, *Memorandum of Law: Executive Order 12333 and Assassination*, ARMY LAW., Dec. 1989, at 4.\n¹¹⁹ Herbert Lin, *Escalation Dynamics and Conflict Termination in Cyberspace*, STRAT. STUD. Q. 46, 65 (2012).\n\nundoubtedly escalate the conflict and requires political considerations. These considerations are heightened if kinetic force is applied to or within neutral nations as mentioned in Part IV. A kinetic response to a cyber-attack will require a case-by-case analysis of the nature of the cyber-attack’s operation, intended target(s), and underlying strategic significance.¹²⁰ At a minimum, kinetic action, whether conducted through conventional or cyber-attacks, should be limited in scope and duration, consistent with self-defense proportionality principles, in order to avert an unnecessary escalation.\n## C. Covert Action In most cases, the benefit of acknowledged non-kinetic or kinetic cyber-attacks against a neutral nation will be significantly outweighed by the diplomatic, economic, and military backlashes that would occur. Such acts would undoubtedly be perceived as an act of aggression by the United Nations, as interpreted by the ICJ.¹²¹ For these reasons, covert action represents a readily available solution while CIL develops in this area. Responding to non-state actors performing cyber-attacks from neutral states presents complex issues given the potential of affronting neutrality and widening the conflict. The stealthy nature of cyber warfare enables covert action as use of the cyber domain enables anonymity, takes advantage of targeted individuals’ awareness, and utilizes speed that overcomes the ability to readily safeguard against the consequences.¹²² Returning to the earlier scenario involving the child hacker located in Switzerland, the United States could consider covert action to thwart this non-state actor. This scenario presumes that Switzerland is uncooperative in extraditing or precluding this child from committing cyber-attacks against the United States.\nFirst, the United States could consider a targeted killing operation against this individual within Swiss borders. The targeting of this child for DPCH in support of Iran would not be considered an assassination as prohibited by Executive Order 12333.¹²³ Under U.S. domestic law, an Authorization to Use Military Force will be required to authorize targeted killings. This requirement was illustrated in the U.S. campaign against al-Qaeda. Assuming the U.S.-Iranian conflict contains an AUMF, language should be included to at least authorize the killing of supporting parties for DPCH, regardless of location. This ¹²⁰ *Id.* at 61.\n¹²¹ See generally UN Charter, arts. 2(4), 51; see also Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicar. v. U.S.), 1986 I.C.J. 14, 181 (June 27) (separate opinion of Judge Ago); Jensen, *supra* note 89, at 821.\n¹²² Ellyne Phneah, *Cyber Warfare Not Theoretical, Can Actually Kill*, ZDNET (Nov. 17, 2011, 5:26 AM), http://www.zdnet.com/cyber-warfare-not-theoretical-can-actually-kill-2062302921/.\n¹²³ Parks, *supra* note 118.\nNaval Law Review LXIV proposition would provide legal credibility since Executive Order 12333 prohibits the unlawful, politically-motivated killing of a person who is not a legitimate target. Alternatively, even if an AUMF does not have broader language, a covert targeted killing would still be lawful if it can be established that the killing was required in self-defense consistent with Article 51 of the UN Charter. To prevent attribution of such killing within Swiss borders, the United States could use military means, such as Special Forces operations analogous to those employed during the Osama bin Laden raid.\nSecond, covert action could also be conducted for rendition of the child to prosecute him in the United States. The practice of rendition (also referred to as irregular rendition) is typically defined as the kidnapping or taking of an individual to move that person to the jurisdiction of another country.[124] This is distinguished from extraordinary rendition which involves transferring the individual to a foreign country for the purposes of detention and interrogation by a foreign government.[125] Rendition does not deprive U.S. courts of jurisdiction unless an applicable extradition treaty explicitly calls for that result and that treaty has been given legislative effect within U.S. domestic law.[126] Since the U.S.-Swiss extradition treaty contains no rendition language, the United States would not be barred from exercising jurisdiction and prosecuting this individual.[127] A covert action for rendition would resemble a raid using either special operations or U.S. law enforcement.\nFinally, covert action could be carried out against this individual via cyber means. A cyber-attack could have a non-kinetic or kinetic impact, as discussed earlier, and would be a more tenable solution if the originator of the attack were unknown. A covert operation employing cyber capabilities would require a complex number of variables beyond the scope of this article. Needless to say, such an operation would involve understanding the location of the child, a breakdown of the child's activities (pattern of life), an understanding of the targeted system's architecture, and other variables. A covert, non-kinetic cyberattack could be aimed at locating, tracking, and denying access to the 13-year-old hacker via the child's computer or home internet service provider. This kind of non-kinetic operation could be aimed at developing further intelligence on the child's activities for further planning should the child continue his or her attacks.\n\nA covert kinetic cyber-attack could vary greatly. Malware could be used to destroy the child’s data or to render the child’s computer unusable. On the other hand, if the desired effect is to kill the 13-year-old hacker, then a more elaborate cyber-attack would be required. Should the child need a pacemaker or medical assistance, a potential attack would include using malware or other cyber technique to kill the hacker, provided that the prohibition against unnecessary suffering was enforced. “CyberJacking,” the act of remotely taking control of someone’s vehicle, could be used as cyber means of a targeted killing.¹²⁸ In this past summer’s BlackHat conference, two researchers demonstrated how they could control a car using their laptop while within the car.¹²⁹ Such capabilities could easily be weaponized to target this 13-year-old hacker, assuming that the killing of the civilian driver or other occupants as collateral damage would be proportionally acceptable under the circumstances.\n## VII. Conclusion In summary, DPCH will remain an ongoing concern in the coming years given the lack of an international consensus on the basic legal principles governing hostilities in the cyber domain. At a minimum, the Tallinn Manual’s DPCH framework provides clear guidance derived from IHL that will enable states to respond to civilian hackers who undertake hostilities in armed conflict while seeking to prevent collateral damage. While developing a cyber-hostilities treaty appears as a readily available solution, the sharp disagreement among states (e.g., the United States, Great Britain, France, China, Russia) on the basic principle of regulating the cyber domain makes such treaty a fleeting prospect. Nevertheless, states always retain the inherent authority of self-defense, regardless of the lack of international consensus concerning cyber hostilities. Thus, IHL provides an immediate legal framework for cyber operations. Over time, these practices will refine and crystalize into customary international law through State practice and opinio juris. Although international consensus seems unattainable, regional or organization practices such as the NATO effort in the Tallinn Manual support the development of CIL in those regions. While the cyber domain requires an analysis of the nature of hostilities, the principles of IHL govern the conduct of these hostilities in order to safeguard against collateral damage while preserving a state’s right of self-defense.\n¹²⁸ Scott Schweitzer, *CyberJacking, Sophisticated Assassination*, CYBER WEAPONS &amp; WARFARE (Oct. 6, 2013, 8:55 AM), http://cyberweapons.blogspot.com/.\n¹²⁹ *Id.* The BlackHat conference is a yearly event where thousands of security experts gather to discuss information security and expose vulnerabilities at the pertaining to computers, networks and other related digital media.
