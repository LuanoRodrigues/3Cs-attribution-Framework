Based on an analysis of deterrence theory and application and prior arms control regimes, the study presents a toolkit of policies and actions for national governments based on elements of deterrence and arms control that analysis demonstrates are potentially applicable to cyber conflict. The study illustrates how these could be prospectively applied in a treaty framework to facilitate attribution of hostile cyber actions.\n\nKeywords: Cyber Deterrence, Cyber Stability, Cyber Conflict, Strategic Stability, Arms Control, Strategic Deterrence\n\n# Introduction\n\nThroughout the latter half of the 20th century, deterrence and arms control served as pillars of strategic stability between the nuclear superpowers. As the 21st century proceeds, however, the emergence of cyber conflict has gradually but steadily undermined that equilibrium. Challenges in policing malicious cyber activity, obfuscation, and uncertainty of consequences in the cyber realm embolden states to test boundaries with ever more aggressive actions. While modern state cyber conflict is markedly different from the Cold War, traditional deterrence theory and international agreements to reduce the potential for conflict from that era offer various lessons that can be applied to manage cyber conflict.\n\nThe section below titled \"Defining Deterrence, Cyber Deterrence, and Cyber Stability\" explains the difference between traditional or kinetic conflict and cyber conflict; and defines the crucial concepts of cyber deterrence and cyber stability, including their relevance to international stability. The \"Promoting Cyber Deterrence\" section explores how states could adopt deterrence concepts developed under traditional deterrence theory and apply them in the cyber realm, including the use of international agreements and arms control regimes.

The final section concludes that while cyber and kinetic warfare—and the means for deterring them—differ, Cold War deterrence and arms control, viewed through an appropriate analytic prism, can nonetheless assist in constructing meaningful paradigms for achieving cyber deterrence and stability.\n\n## Defining Deterrence, Cyber Deterrence, and Cyber Stability\n\nHistorically, states waged wars with the expectation that the spoils of victory would outweigh the costs, but nuclear weapons fundamentally altered that expectation. The unprecedented destructive potential of nuclear weapons compelled states to focus on preventing conflict before it started, which they achieved in part through deterrence, by creating a threshold of conflict that no one dared cross. The emergence of the cyber domain and cyber operations presents a concerning new pathway for conflict and escalation, threatening anything that relies on computers, which are now ubiquitous. Particularly considering the seriousness of recent hostile state cyber operations against one another, understanding whether and how deterrence might be meaningfully applied to prevent such escalation is an urgent task (Goychayev et al. 2017, at 1.17). This section briefly explains what deterrence is, particularly as it applied during the Cold War, then defines cyber deterrence and cyber stability. Next, this section examines how hostile cyber actions differ from kinetic warfare, which makes it difficult to apply traditional deterrence theory. The \"Promoting Cyber Deterrence\" and \"Promoting Cyber Stability\" sections apply deterrence theory and international arms control concepts to the cyber realm.\n\nTo illustrate deterrence, Henry Kissinger developed this equation:\n\n$$\nD = C \\times R \\times B\n$$\n\nDeterrence (D) is the product of the capability (C) of the deterring party to carry out a threatened act, multiplied by the resolve (R) of the deterring party to carry out the act, multiplied by the belief (B) of the party to be deterred that the deterring party will carry out the threatened act. If capability, resolve, or belief is ever zero, then the deterrence value is also zero; and, thus, deterrence will have failed (Kissinger 1961). Capability refers to the technical ability to act—that is, does the deterring party have the weapons, infrastructure, and delivery systems to carry out the promised retaliation? Resolve is whether the deterring party would be willing to carry out the threat. Belief refers to whether the adversary finds the threat from the deterring party credible, including the technical ability and willingness to act (Kissinger 1961).\n\nTo deter malicious actions, a state must ensure that any would-be attacker believes that the costs of the attack will likely outweigh the benefits. This posture can be achieved through demonstrating to an adversary that its attacks are unlikely to achieve its objectives, or that the consequences for an attack (even a failed one) will be unacceptably high. Figure 1 illustrates a successful cyber deterrence posture, where the adversary's perceived cost of undertaking a hostile cyber action outweighs its perceived benefit. The components of that representation are determined through an examination of their potential implementation in a coherent cyber deterrence policy.\n\nJournal of Information Warfare",

The threshold for its application, that of an 'armed attack' (for example, Koh 2012; Schmitt 2017), has arisen rarely and, in any case, states have proven reluctant to recognise cyber acts giving rise to hostilities or constituting aggression in the traditional meanings of those terms. At the same time, states have regularly engaged and continue to engage in a wide variety of concerning, hostile conduct with serious, albeit generally non-kinetic, consequences, with potential to set states on an escalatory path that could spill over into kinetic conflict (Department of Defense 2018). The terms 'cyberattack' relative to 'armed attack' are understood in international law, so this study instead focuses on a broad spectrum of lower-order conduct 'hostile cyber actions', which may be defined as \"cyber attack, use or deployment of cyber weaponry, cyber espionage, or cyber information warfare operations directed against a state, its nationals, or its interests, typically by another state or at another state's direction\" (Goychayev et al. 2017, at A.3).\n\nThis study defined the concept of 'cyber deterrence' as a set of conditions under which a state communicates, either explicitly or implicitly, a credible intention and capability to accurately attribute and impose substantial consequences for certain hostile cyber actions directed against it, and that communication dissuades other actors from undertaking such actions (Goychayev et al. 2017, at A.2).

Cold-War-type deterrence generally applied (and applies) to extremely costly, high-consequence scenarios (such as nuclear or large-scale conventional war between the superpowers) with relatively high general confidence of attribution and capabilities for retaliation that were relatively well-known among the competing adversaries. By contrast, countries usually do not display or publicly test their cyber weapons, as doing so would give adversaries opportunities to develop countermeasures that would render the weapons ineffectual. In addition, the cost of cyber conflict is typically significantly lower than the costs of establishing, maintaining, or using kinetic forces (Clapper 2016). The consequences of cyberattacks can vary from negligible to severe, but most cases do not result in physical injury, loss of life, or destruction of property (and do not inherently present that risk in any way comparable to nuclear weapons or large-scale conventional forces). Finally, states can frequently obscure their involvement in hostile cyber actions through various techniques, such as masking the point of origin or generating false signature data. Cyber conflict, thus, differs from Cold War competition in part because it offers a low-cost, potentially low-consequence, and often non-attributable means for weakening an adversary. These differing cost-benefit outlooks presumably help to explain the relative frequencies of the different types of attacks. Nevertheless, applications of specific concepts from Cold War deterrence and stabilising frameworks can be applied to the cyber realm.\n\n## Promoting Cyber Deterrence: A Technical and Policy Toolkit\n\nThis section summarises tools available to states to achieve cyber deterrence and promote cyber stability. Some tools are based on 20th-century arms control and deterrence concepts, while others are not (Goychayev et al. 2017, at 1.60). As an overarching framework, considering the polycentric threat environment that states confront in the cyber realm (in contrast to the bipolar environment of the Cold War), states would be better served to adopt ‘tailored deterrence’ postures; that is, they should adopt deterrence strategies tailored to the specific states (or sets of states) and actions they seek to deter. States must consider that their adversaries have varying vulnerabilities, capabilities, and intentions, and will respond to stimuli accordingly. For example, what motivates actors in more open, pluralistic states will differ from what motivates actors in more closed, authoritarian ones. Further, states reliant on cyberspace are different from states lacking widespread Internet penetration and adoption, or where these are rigidly monitored and controlled by the state. Based on that tailored assessment, states should apply a selection of appropriate deterrence tools. An effective deterrence policy will likely not be limited to actions in the cyber realm but will rely on a coherent, coordinated application of a variety of tools at a state’s disposal.\n\nJournal of Information Warfare",

The better protected a target, the costlier it is to attack and the less attractive it becomes. One way to improve defence could be to expand efforts within the government and the technology industry to establish a system and network architectures that incorporate appropriate security considerations. Defensible architectures present a smaller attack surface, limit the access of an attacker who does manage to infiltrate, and can operate despite interference or damage. This defence effort simultaneously lessens the impact of a successful attack while increasing the cost to accomplish it. Laudable efforts along these lines include the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework and associated documents (NIST 2014).\n\nStates could undertake educational campaigns both to teach technology users about cyber threats and to groom the next generation of cyber security experts. In addition, states could seek to implement systems that incorporate more active defence and security measures. Architectures and processes could be put in place to actively interrogate systems to ensure that performance and functionality are uncompromised, proper, and authentic. Further, states could adopt strategies and develop capabilities to discover, define, analyse, and mitigate cyber threats and vulnerabilities in a more real-time mode, and direct these capabilities to defend critical infrastructure or other national security assets (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency 2018; Denning &amp; Strawser 2017).\n\n# Tool 2 – Resilience, reconstitution\n\nBuilding resilient systems that may succumb to attacks but can quickly be reconstituted and at little cost represents another paradigm for reducing the perceived potential benefits the adversary would gain from carrying out attacks. States could consider establishing or adopting standards for system architecture related to recovery and reconstitution. Innovative technological research and development to improve cyber defences and critical infrastructure resilience could have a deterrent effect as well. Microgrid technology, for example, could be helpful in bolstering resiliency by decentralising electricity generation and transmission, and dispersing accompanying risks (U.S. Department of Energy website 2017).\n\n# Tool 3 – Declarations of thresholds for action, reaction\n\nA low-cost step states can take to promote cyber stability is to unilaterally declare types of cyberattacks that will trigger their response and, in general terms, the spectrum of activities the response will entail. For example, President Obama’s Executive Order 13694 (2015) clearly delineated what malicious cyber acts the United States perceives as threats to national security, including attacks against critical infrastructure. States participating in the United Nation’s 2015 Group of Government Experts similarly recommend that states cooperate to prevent harmful information and communication technology practices and that states should not conduct or support such activity that damages or impairs critical infrastructure (United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research 2016). Clear statements about what are unacceptable targets of hostile cyber acts such as these indicate that states will view these types of activities as very grave. States could be even more explicit, though. For example, a state could issue public and private statements about what specific cyber acts by specific countries will prompt a response. In July 2016, the North Atlantic\n\nJournal of Information Warfare",

It remains unclear how individual member states will respond to specific acts of cyber aggression against NATO allies. The United States has indicated it is concerned with protecting its allies from cyber aggression (Executive Order 13694 2015, at 152). Clearer communication by a country about its perception of and likely responses to threats could also reduce risks of miscalculation and escalation. Similarly, states could clarify their positions on cyber norms and possible responses to specific adversaries using direct, private communications, which might allow a message to be tailored more specifically and effectively for the states in question.\n\n## Tool 4 – Improving detection and attribution capabilities\n\nDetection of an attack is essential for attribution and retaliation. In contrast to a typical kinetic attack, malicious cyberattacks might not be detected until after they have been initiated or completed. Improving detection of cyberattacks could, therefore, enhance deterrence but presents a formidable challenge. While in kinetic war, there are robust early warning systems and clear evidence of attack (for example, bullet holes or bomb craters), there is no obvious analogue for many types of hostile cyber acts. The variety of malicious cyberattack vectors is tremendous and growing at a rapid pace together with technology, making attacks hard to predict and difficult to identify. One of the most reliable forms of cyberattack detection is reports of attacks by victims, but victims such as large financial institutions, hospitals, or power companies are often hesitant to report attacks due to fears they might trigger adverse liability rules or suffer reputational harm. Streamlining the means for victims to report attacks to authorities, perhaps with enhanced confidentiality or leniency for the victims’ liability, could incentivise more thorough and timely reporting. Detection can also be facilitated by active monitoring of known hostile actors.\n\nIn addition, the lack of generally recognised means for high-confidence attribution of cyberattacks remains a critical barrier to achieving deterrence of hostile cyber actions. If an attacker is confident that it cannot be identified, it will not be deterred by threats of retaliation by its target. Even where attribution can proceed, timeliness is a major problem, as a cyber-attacking state has various means to obfuscate its involvement and place in the path of investigators obstacles that take time to overcome. This problem can likely be mitigated with heavy investments in international law enforcement capabilities and coordination; however, even with such investments, there will likely remain some persistent level of attacks that cannot be attributed in time for a meaningful response.\n\nEven when a state can trace an attack to its origin, further difficulties arise. Disclosure of the fact of attribution can prompt an adversary to change its methods and render the technique for detection and attribution obsolete. Failure to disclose the full grounds for an accusation (for instance, sources, methods) can lead to questioning the motives and authenticity of attribution, but such full disclosure might compromise sensitive or classified information. Some balance must be struck. In the recent attribution to Russia of interference in the 2016 United States presidential election, the approach was taken of issuing a statement on the attribution conclusion together with some generally recognised and publicly available specific evidence, some newly declassified information, and some indication that other classified sources were used (Office of the Director of National Intelligence 2017). States would likely benefit from establishing disclosure policies in anticipation\n\nJournal of Information Warfare",

Specific retaliatory measures are explored in greater detail under tools 6 through 10. When a state declares planned retaliation, threatened retaliatory measures must be linked to the declaring state’s capabilities to be credible and must hold at risk something the adversary values enough to likely outweigh the benefit the adversary hopes to gain through the attack. Where possible, to reinforce the credibility of the declared threat, the state threatening retaliation should exercise or otherwise display these measures to demonstrate capability and readiness.\n\n## Tool 6 – Public attribution, stigma\n\nWhen states can attribute cyberattacks against them with a high degree of confidence, they can publicly expose and condemn the perpetrators. By publicly identifying aggressors who commit hostile cyber actions, states can build international coalitions against the aggressors and their behaviour. For example, the Obama Administration publicly accused North Korea of an attack on Sony Corporation (White House 2014). This public condemnation supported international efforts to tighten sanctions on North Korea. This ‘naming and shaming’ tactic has been executed in several other instances, notably in response to Russia’s aggressive conduct during and after 2014, which has proved instrumental in securing and then maintaining the European Union’s broad and punishing sanctions regime (White House 2016; US Department of Justice 2014). Such denunciations can have cascading effects: damaging an attacking state’s reputation, limiting its ability to bargain and persuade, helping to sway general opinion against the state and the offending conduct, and hastening the formation of coalitions to counteract such aggression. Such statements can also contribute to the development of customary international law against cyberattacks.\n\n## Tool 7 – Enhanced, coordinated use of national criminal laws\n\nGiven the difficulty of attributing hostile cyber acts to states, one alternative to directly invoking or proving state responsibility is to deter the individual actors upon which states must rely to execute attacks. The acts comprising hostile cyber actions typically constitute generally recognised cybercrimes under national criminal laws; hence, the individuals who perpetrate the acts can be prosecuted for crimes (when states do not invoke sovereign immunity, see below) (Council of Europe 2004). By implementing and enforcing strong cybercrime laws in concert with their overall national defence and deterrence postures, states might deter the individuals who act on behalf of states in cyberspace and, by extension, the states themselves. As an example of this type of approach, the United States recently invoked its primary federal computer crime statutes to indict Russian Federal Security Service officers and criminal conspirators in connection with the hacking of Yahoo email accounts, which allegedly included email accounts for United States and Russian government officials (US Department of Justice 2017); similar indictments have been issued in response to prominent cases of Chinese-government-sponsored cyber intrusions (US Department of Justice 2014).\n\nJournal of Information Warfare",

            "markdown": "A Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\n\nSimply indicting foreign nationals for crimes can be ineffective if the indicting state lacks immediate physical jurisdiction over the accused. To assist in the apprehension of criminals and in investigation and prosecution of cybercrime, states often rely on mutual legal assistance treaties, extradition treaties, and other frameworks for coordinating and facilitating international criminal prosecution (Council of Europe 2017). States can leverage such international architecture to enhance deterrence against would-be state proxy cybercriminals. When obtaining physical jurisdiction is unlikely (for example, when a criminal actor is in a state unwilling or unable to cooperate in a prosecution), states can arrange forfeiture (confiscation) of instrumentalities and proceeds of crime or even criminals’ assets located in states that will cooperate. International arrest warrants can significantly constrain criminals’ freedom to travel. Such measures may substantially degrade the ability of states to recruit proxies to carry out acts of cyber aggression.\n\nStates could develop credible and consistent cybercrime prosecution policies to serve national security interests. Investigative and prosecutorial independence is important for ensuring public trust in law enforcement agencies and is best preserved when prosecutors publicly establish their own prioritisation of policies beforehand, rather than appearing to react to events that might be politically charged. The United States, for instance, has in the past established clear prosecutorial policies on such matters as counterterrorism and transnational organised crime (Presidential Archives 2011). A similar approach could be developed and applied for likely state hostile cyber actions.\n\nA strong national criminal law approach offers one additional benefit: it places pressure on the criminals and states to assert sovereign immunity for protection (US Department of State 2017). Such assertions may substantially aid in making the case for a state’s responsibility for the cyber-attack in question.\n\n## Tool 8 – International sanctions\n\nAmong tools for coercion and retaliation, economic sanctions have significantly increased in prominence over the last three decades. The U.S. president, for example, has considerable powers, both inherent and legislatively authorised, to unilaterally impose sanctions at various levels against various subjects, from natural and juridical persons, to economic sectors, to countries. While comprehensive overviews of sanctions powers have been produced by numerous authors, for example, Corn, Gurule &amp; Kahn (2016), these sanctions powers can be deployed in a tailored cyber deterrence framework. The basic concept is the same as that already described for deterrence generally: a state would signal that it is willing to bring its sanctions powers to bear in response to certain serious hostile cyber actions in a manner that would target what potential adversaries value and sketch elements of how a response would proceed in such a way as to make the threat credible.\n\nRecent history indicates that sanctions can be made more effective in certain circumstances (Goychayev et al. 2017, at 8.67-68). In considering use of sanctions to retaliate or deter hostile cyber actions, states should consider the following:\n\n- Sanctions are likely to be more effective tools of deterrence when they have a relatively broad scope (the sanctioned actors cannot simply reregister under a new corporate name and continue operating as they previously had been) and have multilateral participation.\n- The more robust the evidence in demonstrating an actor has carried out a particular series\n\nJournal of Information Warfare",

A loud cyberattack leaves no question as to its perpetrator and is intended to be as much communication as attack. Such actions can be undertaken publicly or tailored for notice by a specific agency or leader. Loud attacks might be undertaken in response to other cyber acts to demonstrate the state is aware of the adversary’s cyber action and to serve as a warning to cease and desist (Goychayev et al. 2017, p. 1.68). Where such retaliations are open, this enhances general deterrence and demonstrates resolve to respond.\n\n# Tool 10 – Kinetic response\n\nThe United States has issued statements that it reserves the right to respond to cyberattacks using appropriate, proportionate kinetic force (Department of Defense 2011). Such attacks are authorised under international law in only very specific circumstances and otherwise might constitute a serious breach of international law, potentially including the international crime of aggression. States should likely refrain from undertaking this type of response to a cyberattack unless they have supreme confidence in the attribution of the attack. Considering the risk involved, the threshold of seriousness for a cyberattack to merit a kinetic response would likely also be quite high, such as causing loss of life.\n\n# Tool 11 – International partnership and collaboration\n\nStates can significantly enhance the effectiveness of their cyber deterrence postures by leveraging alliances and international institutions. One of the strongest elements of United-States-backed deterrence in the Cold War was the establishment and maintenance of largely unified international blocs, underpinned by principles of free trade, democratic values, and mutual defence (for example, Holbrooke 1995; Murphy 2016). These included the mutual defence arrangements with Europe via NATO as well as with Japan and the Republic of Korea. Some argue it would not have been possible without the high degree of complementary economic and political cooperation engendered in such institutions as the European Community (and then European Union), the Council of Europe, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and bilateral arrangements with Japan and Korea (Holbrooke 1995). This web of strong alliances and interlinkages amplified adversaries’ perceptions that there would be consequences for aggressive conduct and that they would be serious. It is likely no accident that a focus of recent Russian cyber disinformation campaigns appears to have been to stoke nationalist sentiment in United States’ allies and to foment cynicism about and scepticism toward international institutions, particularly the European Union (Office of the Director of National Security 2017).

Wherever feasible, the United States should look to undertake its cyber deterrence actions together with allies, which will both isolate and increase the costs for would-be adversaries.\n\n## Tool 12 – Treaties and arms control\n\nWhile a set of credible hard power policies and capabilities would likely serve as the foundation for managing cyber conflict, mutually agreed-upon norms and rules can solidify and reinforce a deterrence framework to achieve greater stability. Numerous treaties, agreements, and international norms have reinforced deterrence and enhanced international stability with respect to other types of forces in certain contexts, particularly during the Cold War. The next section further elaborates this concept and explores potential applications of this tool.\n\n## Promoting Cyber Stability: Prior Principles, Future Applications\n\nIn view of the arguably constructive role that arms control frameworks played in reinforcing deterrence and stability during the Cold War noted above, the authors conducted a systematic analysis of several arms control or stabilising regimes with the potential to offer lessons for managing cyber conflict. They found that, given the differences between the cyber and kinetic realms, no single past arms control treaty regime offers a singularly strong analogue for regulating hostile cyber activities. Nonetheless, numerous distinct principles from past treaty regimes have the potential to be applied to regulate state hostile cyber actions. These are presented below.\n\n## Cross-applicability of prior treaty principles to cyber conflict\n\nSeveral arms control and stabilising treaty regimes were analysed to assess their potential cross-applicability to managing cyber conflict (Goychayev et al. 2107, Sec. 5, pp. 5.24-5.50). Regimes were selected for analysis if they were considered to have worked in terms of stabilising nuclear arms races; to have dealt with categories of arms (such as chemical and biological weapons or piracy) that seemed analogous in some regard to cyber weaponry in their verification and monitoring challenges; to have regulated issues relevant to hostile cyber activity such as incident prevention, escalation management, and reducing disinformation; and/or to have regulated state behaviour in ungoverned or poorly governed spaces. The specific regimes analysed are presented below. The discussion includes a brief summary of the study's findings with respect to the principles employed in each regime and their potential for cross-applicability in the cyber realm.\n\n- The Strategic Arms Limitation and Reduction Treaties (SALT, ABM, and START) helped to regulate the nuclear arms race, but have limited applicability as a model for cyber stability given their emphasis on numerical limitations of warheads and delivery vehicles, verification through inspection, and reliance on a bipolar structure of international relations. Nevertheless, some verification modalities applied in these treaties might be incorporated in a cyber control regime, such as managed access where verification inspectors could have tightly controlled access to sites, and information barriers that could facilitate international information sharing and cooperation on attack attribution (US Department of State 1972c; 1972d; 1979; 1991; 1993b; 2002; 2011).\n- The Nuclear Test Ban Treaties lack a direct analogue to the cyber realm, as there is no\n\nJournal of Information Warfare",

However, these treaties demonstrate both a path for establishing multilateral norms against unacceptable state behaviour as well as multilateral technical forensic approaches to verification (vested in the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization's International Monitoring System) that may have potential to be cross-applied to the cyber realm. Additionally, information exchanges like those used in nuclear test ban treaties, if applied to cyber capabilities, might help to ease the secrecy that currently exacerbates cyber conflict (US Department of State 1963; 1974; 1996).\n\n- The Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) and the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) have various shared aspects that have strong potential applicability in managing cyber conflict. They establish open-ended definitions for the weaponry they control, with analysis of prohibition often hinging on state intent. This approach is potentially highly applicable to regulating cyber conflict as cyber weaponry is highly context-dependent, and its attributes cannot be definitively described. The conventions' definitions of prohibited items in terms of state intent, internationalised post-incident investigations of alleged violations, and use of confidence-building measures may offer useful analogues for promoting stability in the cyber realm (US Department of State 1972b; 1993a).\n\n- United States-Soviet Union Incidents at Sea Agreement has limited application in cyber stability, in part due to differences between the nature of international waters (where no state has jurisdiction) and cyber infrastructure (where different states have jurisdiction over various elements). However, the Incidents at Sea Agreement defined and prohibited a set of actions and manoeuvres that the parties jointly understood presented risks of accident, misinterpretation, and unintended escalation. A treaty regime employing similar principles might be useful in the cyber realm (US Department of State 1972a).\n\n- The Helsinki Process demonstrated how a sufficiently broad negotiations framework (covering territorial disputes, political-military relations, trade, and human rights) can yield breakthroughs. The human rights aspects of that framework additionally helped to dispel propaganda and disinformation, which have renewed relevance today. The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, a product of the Helsinki Process, now has a dedicated cyber security branch that might be expanded or used as a model for a multilateral cyber security forum (Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe 2017).\n\n- The History of Regulation of Piracy and Privateering demonstrates that international agreements which expedite criminal prosecution of state proxies and individual criminals have some potential to contribute to deterrence of hostile state cyber actions; however, historical analysis suggests the salient factors contributing to agreements in these areas are not strongly analogous to present-day cyber conflict (for example, Egloff 2015; UN Convention 1982; Guilfoyle 2014).\n\nFigure 2, below, indicates the types of agreement attributes found in the various treaties and regimes the authors reviewed. The attributes include whether the treaty was bilateral or multilateral; banned types of weapons or placed numerical limits on weapons or delivery systems; limited certain types of destabilising actions and declared that such actions, if taken in violation of the treaty, could be reasonably interpreted by other parties as acts of aggression; required declaration of an accountable number of arms; had verification measures through inspections or of suspected violations; limited tests of specific types of weapons; established communication and informa\n\nJournal of Information Warfare",

These might offer means to enhance both state participation in such a regime as well as the effectiveness of attribution that it could achieve.\n- Such a regime might be bolstered by vesting additional functions in the verification body, such as a forum for transparency, confidence-building measures, and technical exchanges.\n\nFurther technical and institutional options for international cooperation on the attribution of hostile cyber actions could be a valuable topic for future research.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWeaponisation of the cyber realm is already undermining international cyber stability. Nevertheless, states have a variety of tools available to deter hostile cyber actions and increase stability. Though neither 20th century deterrence nor historic arms control approaches offer simple, direct analogues for cyber stability, various elements from these areas, particularly when synthesised, offer considerable potential for managing cyber conflict. States should carefully consider their potential adversaries, their desired outcomes, and the tools at their disposal to impose operational, retaliatory, and normative and reputational costs against their adversaries. In addition, detailed analysis of prior arms control and stabilising treaty regimes demonstrates there are several principles having considerable potential to be cross-applied to manage cyber conflict.\n\n## References\n\nClapper, JR 2016, Statement by U.S. Director of National Intelligence James R.

Based on an analysis of deterrence theory and application and prior arms control regimes, the study presents a toolkit of policies and actions for national governments based on elements of deterrence and arms control that analysis demonstrates are potentially applicable to cyber conflict. The study illustrates how these could be prospectively applied in a treaty framework to facilitate attribution of hostile cyber actions.\nKeywords: Cyber Deterrence, Cyber Stability, Cyber Conflict, Strategic Stability, Arms Control, Strategic Deterrence\n# Introduction\nThroughout the latter half of the 20th century, deterrence and arms control served as pillars of strategic stability between the nuclear superpowers. As the 21st century proceeds, however, the emergence of cyber conflict has gradually but steadily undermined that equilibrium. Challenges in policing malicious cyber activity, obfuscation, and uncertainty of consequences in the cyber realm embolden states to test boundaries with ever more aggressive actions. While modern state cyber conflict is markedly different from the Cold War, traditional deterrence theory and international agreements to reduce the potential for conflict from that era offer various lessons that can be applied to manage cyber conflict.\nThe section below titled \"Defining Deterrence, Cyber Deterrence, and Cyber Stability\" explains the difference between traditional or kinetic conflict and cyber conflict; and defines the crucial concepts of cyber deterrence and cyber stability, including their relevance to international stability. The \"Promoting Cyber Deterrence\" section explores how states could adopt deterrence concepts developed under traditional deterrence theory and apply them in the cyber realm, including the use of international agreements and arms control regimes. The \"Promoting Cyber Stability\" sec\nJournal of Information Warfare (2019) 18.3: 53-69\nISSN 1445-3312 Print/ISSN 1445-3347 Online\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\ntion more closely examines those various agreements and regimes to see which elements might be applicable to cyber deterrence and stability. The final section concludes that while cyber and kinetic warfare—and the means for deterring them—differ, Cold War deterrence and arms control, viewed through an appropriate analytic prism, can nonetheless assist in constructing meaningful paradigms for achieving cyber deterrence and stability.\n## Defining Deterrence, Cyber Deterrence, and Cyber Stability\nHistorically, states waged wars with the expectation that the spoils of victory would outweigh the costs, but nuclear weapons fundamentally altered that expectation. The unprecedented destructive potential of nuclear weapons compelled states to focus on preventing conflict before it started, which they achieved in part through deterrence, by creating a threshold of conflict that no one dared cross. The emergence of the cyber domain and cyber operations presents a concerning new pathway for conflict and escalation, threatening anything that relies on computers, which are now ubiquitous. Particularly considering the seriousness of recent hostile state cyber operations against one another, understanding whether and how deterrence might be meaningfully applied to prevent such escalation is an urgent task (Goychayev et al. 2017, at 1.17). This section briefly explains what deterrence is, particularly as it applied during the Cold War, then defines cyber deterrence and cyber stability. Next, this section examines how hostile cyber actions differ from kinetic warfare, which makes it difficult to apply traditional deterrence theory. The \"Promoting Cyber Deterrence\" and \"Promoting Cyber Stability\" sections apply deterrence theory and international arms control concepts to the cyber realm.\nTo illustrate deterrence, Henry Kissinger developed this equation:\n$$\nD = C \\times R \\times B\n$$\nDeterrence (D) is the product of the capability (C) of the deterring party to carry out a threatened act, multiplied by the resolve (R) of the deterring party to carry out the act, multiplied by the belief (B) of the party to be deterred that the deterring party will carry out the threatened act. If capability, resolve, or belief is ever zero, then the deterrence value is also zero; and, thus, deterrence will have failed (Kissinger 1961). Capability refers to the technical ability to act—that is, does the deterring party have the weapons, infrastructure, and delivery systems to carry out the promised retaliation? Resolve is whether the deterring party would be willing to carry out the threat. Belief refers to whether the adversary finds the threat from the deterring party credible, including the technical ability and willingness to act (Kissinger 1961).\nTo deter malicious actions, a state must ensure that any would-be attacker believes that the costs of the attack will likely outweigh the benefits. This posture can be achieved through demonstrating to an adversary that its attacks are unlikely to achieve its objectives, or that the consequences for an attack (even a failed one) will be unacceptably high. Figure 1 illustrates a successful cyber deterrence posture, where the adversary's perceived cost of undertaking a hostile cyber action outweighs its perceived benefit. The components of that representation are determined through an examination of their potential implementation in a coherent cyber deterrence policy.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\nFigure 1: Visualisation of successful cyber deterrence: A theoretical model (Goychayev et al. 2017, at 1.52)\n# Defining Cyber Hostile Actions, Cyber Deterrence, and Cyber Stability\nThis paper adopts the premise that the law of armed conflict has thus far proved of limited use in regulating hostile state cyber actions, so does not treat the law of armed conflict in detail. The threshold for its application, that of an 'armed attack' (for example, Koh 2012; Schmitt 2017), has arisen rarely and, in any case, states have proven reluctant to recognise cyber acts giving rise to hostilities or constituting aggression in the traditional meanings of those terms. At the same time, states have regularly engaged and continue to engage in a wide variety of concerning, hostile conduct with serious, albeit generally non-kinetic, consequences, with potential to set states on an escalatory path that could spill over into kinetic conflict (Department of Defense 2018). The terms 'cyberattack' relative to 'armed attack' are understood in international law, so this study instead focuses on a broad spectrum of lower-order conduct 'hostile cyber actions', which may be defined as \"cyber attack, use or deployment of cyber weaponry, cyber espionage, or cyber information warfare operations directed against a state, its nationals, or its interests, typically by another state or at another state's direction\" (Goychayev et al. 2017, at A.3).\nThis study defined the concept of 'cyber deterrence' as a set of conditions under which a state communicates, either explicitly or implicitly, a credible intention and capability to accurately attribute and impose substantial consequences for certain hostile cyber actions directed against it, and that communication dissuades other actors from undertaking such actions (Goychayev et al. 2017, at A.2). While Cold War deterrence and cyber deterrence have in common a basic emphasis\nJournal of Information Warfare\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\non cost-benefit calculus, effective deterrence of hostile cyber actions is likely to assume different forms than nuclear or conventional deterrence in the Cold War, as will be explained in greater detail below. ‘Cyber stability’ describes relations between states characterised by the absence of serious hostile cyber actions against one another, where the states have a sufficient common understanding of each other’s capabilities and intentions so as to be inclined generally to avoid such actions, likely associated with a common belief that the costs of such conduct would outweigh the benefits (Goychayev et al. 2017, at 3.16).\n## Cold War Deterrence versus Cyber Deterrence\nTraditional deterrence theory does not translate smoothly or simply to cyber conflict, given how cyber conflict differs from its conventional and nuclear counterparts. Cold-War-type deterrence generally applied (and applies) to extremely costly, high-consequence scenarios (such as nuclear or large-scale conventional war between the superpowers) with relatively high general confidence of attribution and capabilities for retaliation that were relatively well-known among the competing adversaries. By contrast, countries usually do not display or publicly test their cyber weapons, as doing so would give adversaries opportunities to develop countermeasures that would render the weapons ineffectual. In addition, the cost of cyber conflict is typically significantly lower than the costs of establishing, maintaining, or using kinetic forces (Clapper 2016). The consequences of cyberattacks can vary from negligible to severe, but most cases do not result in physical injury, loss of life, or destruction of property (and do not inherently present that risk in any way comparable to nuclear weapons or large-scale conventional forces). Finally, states can frequently obscure their involvement in hostile cyber actions through various techniques, such as masking the point of origin or generating false signature data. Cyber conflict, thus, differs from Cold War competition in part because it offers a low-cost, potentially low-consequence, and often non-attributable means for weakening an adversary. These differing cost-benefit outlooks presumably help to explain the relative frequencies of the different types of attacks. Nevertheless, applications of specific concepts from Cold War deterrence and stabilising frameworks can be applied to the cyber realm.\n## Promoting Cyber Deterrence: A Technical and Policy Toolkit\nThis section summarises tools available to states to achieve cyber deterrence and promote cyber stability. Some tools are based on 20th-century arms control and deterrence concepts, while others are not (Goychayev et al. 2017, at 1.60). As an overarching framework, considering the polycentric threat environment that states confront in the cyber realm (in contrast to the bipolar environment of the Cold War), states would be better served to adopt ‘tailored deterrence’ postures; that is, they should adopt deterrence strategies tailored to the specific states (or sets of states) and actions they seek to deter. States must consider that their adversaries have varying vulnerabilities, capabilities, and intentions, and will respond to stimuli accordingly. For example, what motivates actors in more open, pluralistic states will differ from what motivates actors in more closed, authoritarian ones. Further, states reliant on cyberspace are different from states lacking widespread Internet penetration and adoption, or where these are rigidly monitored and controlled by the state. Based on that tailored assessment, states should apply a selection of appropriate deterrence tools. An effective deterrence policy will likely not be limited to actions in the cyber realm but will rely on a coherent, coordinated application of a variety of tools at a state’s disposal.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\n# Tool 1 – Enhanced, active defence\nTo help deter would-be cyber adversaries, states could improve the cyber security posture of their critical systems and infrastructure. The better protected a target, the costlier it is to attack and the less attractive it becomes. One way to improve defence could be to expand efforts within the government and the technology industry to establish a system and network architectures that incorporate appropriate security considerations. Defensible architectures present a smaller attack surface, limit the access of an attacker who does manage to infiltrate, and can operate despite interference or damage. This defence effort simultaneously lessens the impact of a successful attack while increasing the cost to accomplish it. Laudable efforts along these lines include the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework and associated documents (NIST 2014).\nStates could undertake educational campaigns both to teach technology users about cyber threats and to groom the next generation of cyber security experts. In addition, states could seek to implement systems that incorporate more active defence and security measures. Architectures and processes could be put in place to actively interrogate systems to ensure that performance and functionality are uncompromised, proper, and authentic. Further, states could adopt strategies and develop capabilities to discover, define, analyse, and mitigate cyber threats and vulnerabilities in a more real-time mode, and direct these capabilities to defend critical infrastructure or other national security assets (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency 2018; Denning &amp; Strawser 2017).\n# Tool 2 – Resilience, reconstitution\nBuilding resilient systems that may succumb to attacks but can quickly be reconstituted and at little cost represents another paradigm for reducing the perceived potential benefits the adversary would gain from carrying out attacks. States could consider establishing or adopting standards for system architecture related to recovery and reconstitution. Innovative technological research and development to improve cyber defences and critical infrastructure resilience could have a deterrent effect as well. Microgrid technology, for example, could be helpful in bolstering resiliency by decentralising electricity generation and transmission, and dispersing accompanying risks (U.S. Department of Energy website 2017).\n# Tool 3 – Declarations of thresholds for action, reaction\nA low-cost step states can take to promote cyber stability is to unilaterally declare types of cyberattacks that will trigger their response and, in general terms, the spectrum of activities the response will entail. For example, President Obama’s Executive Order 13694 (2015) clearly delineated what malicious cyber acts the United States perceives as threats to national security, including attacks against critical infrastructure. States participating in the United Nation’s 2015 Group of Government Experts similarly recommend that states cooperate to prevent harmful information and communication technology practices and that states should not conduct or support such activity that damages or impairs critical infrastructure (United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research 2016). Clear statements about what are unacceptable targets of hostile cyber acts such as these indicate that states will view these types of activities as very grave. States could be even more explicit, though. For example, a state could issue public and private statements about what specific cyber acts by specific countries will prompt a response. In July 2016, the North Atlantic\nJournal of Information Warfare\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\nTreaty Organization (NATO) recognised cyberspace “as a domain of operations in which NATO must defend itself as effectively as it does in the air, on land, and at sea” (NATO 2016). It remains unclear how individual member states will respond to specific acts of cyber aggression against NATO allies. The United States has indicated it is concerned with protecting its allies from cyber aggression (Executive Order 13694 2015, at 152). Clearer communication by a country about its perception of and likely responses to threats could also reduce risks of miscalculation and escalation. Similarly, states could clarify their positions on cyber norms and possible responses to specific adversaries using direct, private communications, which might allow a message to be tailored more specifically and effectively for the states in question.\n## Tool 4 – Improving detection and attribution capabilities\nDetection of an attack is essential for attribution and retaliation. In contrast to a typical kinetic attack, malicious cyberattacks might not be detected until after they have been initiated or completed. Improving detection of cyberattacks could, therefore, enhance deterrence but presents a formidable challenge. While in kinetic war, there are robust early warning systems and clear evidence of attack (for example, bullet holes or bomb craters), there is no obvious analogue for many types of hostile cyber acts. The variety of malicious cyberattack vectors is tremendous and growing at a rapid pace together with technology, making attacks hard to predict and difficult to identify. One of the most reliable forms of cyberattack detection is reports of attacks by victims, but victims such as large financial institutions, hospitals, or power companies are often hesitant to report attacks due to fears they might trigger adverse liability rules or suffer reputational harm. Streamlining the means for victims to report attacks to authorities, perhaps with enhanced confidentiality or leniency for the victims’ liability, could incentivise more thorough and timely reporting. Detection can also be facilitated by active monitoring of known hostile actors.\nIn addition, the lack of generally recognised means for high-confidence attribution of cyberattacks remains a critical barrier to achieving deterrence of hostile cyber actions. If an attacker is confident that it cannot be identified, it will not be deterred by threats of retaliation by its target. Even where attribution can proceed, timeliness is a major problem, as a cyber-attacking state has various means to obfuscate its involvement and place in the path of investigators obstacles that take time to overcome. This problem can likely be mitigated with heavy investments in international law enforcement capabilities and coordination; however, even with such investments, there will likely remain some persistent level of attacks that cannot be attributed in time for a meaningful response.\nEven when a state can trace an attack to its origin, further difficulties arise. Disclosure of the fact of attribution can prompt an adversary to change its methods and render the technique for detection and attribution obsolete. Failure to disclose the full grounds for an accusation (for instance, sources, methods) can lead to questioning the motives and authenticity of attribution, but such full disclosure might compromise sensitive or classified information. Some balance must be struck. In the recent attribution to Russia of interference in the 2016 United States presidential election, the approach was taken of issuing a statement on the attribution conclusion together with some generally recognised and publicly available specific evidence, some newly declassified information, and some indication that other classified sources were used (Office of the Director of National Intelligence 2017). States would likely benefit from establishing disclosure policies in anticipation\nJournal of Information Warfare\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\nof this need for public assessments of state responsibility for cyberattacks, rather than to scramble and grapple with these questions reactively or repeatedly.\n## Tool 5 – Declaration of planned retaliatory measures\nRetaliation has been a principal focus of deterrence theory for centuries, and deterrence through the threat of punishment will remain a key factor in cyber space. Specific retaliatory measures are explored in greater detail under tools 6 through 10. When a state declares planned retaliation, threatened retaliatory measures must be linked to the declaring state’s capabilities to be credible and must hold at risk something the adversary values enough to likely outweigh the benefit the adversary hopes to gain through the attack. Where possible, to reinforce the credibility of the declared threat, the state threatening retaliation should exercise or otherwise display these measures to demonstrate capability and readiness.\n## Tool 6 – Public attribution, stigma\nWhen states can attribute cyberattacks against them with a high degree of confidence, they can publicly expose and condemn the perpetrators. By publicly identifying aggressors who commit hostile cyber actions, states can build international coalitions against the aggressors and their behaviour. For example, the Obama Administration publicly accused North Korea of an attack on Sony Corporation (White House 2014). This public condemnation supported international efforts to tighten sanctions on North Korea. This ‘naming and shaming’ tactic has been executed in several other instances, notably in response to Russia’s aggressive conduct during and after 2014, which has proved instrumental in securing and then maintaining the European Union’s broad and punishing sanctions regime (White House 2016; US Department of Justice 2014). Such denunciations can have cascading effects: damaging an attacking state’s reputation, limiting its ability to bargain and persuade, helping to sway general opinion against the state and the offending conduct, and hastening the formation of coalitions to counteract such aggression. Such statements can also contribute to the development of customary international law against cyberattacks.\n## Tool 7 – Enhanced, coordinated use of national criminal laws\nGiven the difficulty of attributing hostile cyber acts to states, one alternative to directly invoking or proving state responsibility is to deter the individual actors upon which states must rely to execute attacks. The acts comprising hostile cyber actions typically constitute generally recognised cybercrimes under national criminal laws; hence, the individuals who perpetrate the acts can be prosecuted for crimes (when states do not invoke sovereign immunity, see below) (Council of Europe 2004). By implementing and enforcing strong cybercrime laws in concert with their overall national defence and deterrence postures, states might deter the individuals who act on behalf of states in cyberspace and, by extension, the states themselves. As an example of this type of approach, the United States recently invoked its primary federal computer crime statutes to indict Russian Federal Security Service officers and criminal conspirators in connection with the hacking of Yahoo email accounts, which allegedly included email accounts for United States and Russian government officials (US Department of Justice 2017); similar indictments have been issued in response to prominent cases of Chinese-government-sponsored cyber intrusions (US Department of Justice 2014).\nJournal of Information Warfare\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\nSimply indicting foreign nationals for crimes can be ineffective if the indicting state lacks immediate physical jurisdiction over the accused. To assist in the apprehension of criminals and in investigation and prosecution of cybercrime, states often rely on mutual legal assistance treaties, extradition treaties, and other frameworks for coordinating and facilitating international criminal prosecution (Council of Europe 2017). States can leverage such international architecture to enhance deterrence against would-be state proxy cybercriminals. When obtaining physical jurisdiction is unlikely (for example, when a criminal actor is in a state unwilling or unable to cooperate in a prosecution), states can arrange forfeiture (confiscation) of instrumentalities and proceeds of crime or even criminals’ assets located in states that will cooperate. International arrest warrants can significantly constrain criminals’ freedom to travel. Such measures may substantially degrade the ability of states to recruit proxies to carry out acts of cyber aggression.\nStates could develop credible and consistent cybercrime prosecution policies to serve national security interests. Investigative and prosecutorial independence is important for ensuring public trust in law enforcement agencies and is best preserved when prosecutors publicly establish their own prioritisation of policies beforehand, rather than appearing to react to events that might be politically charged. The United States, for instance, has in the past established clear prosecutorial policies on such matters as counterterrorism and transnational organised crime (Presidential Archives 2011). A similar approach could be developed and applied for likely state hostile cyber actions.\nA strong national criminal law approach offers one additional benefit: it places pressure on the criminals and states to assert sovereign immunity for protection (US Department of State 2017). Such assertions may substantially aid in making the case for a state’s responsibility for the cyber-attack in question.\n## Tool 8 – International sanctions\nAmong tools for coercion and retaliation, economic sanctions have significantly increased in prominence over the last three decades. The U.S. president, for example, has considerable powers, both inherent and legislatively authorised, to unilaterally impose sanctions at various levels against various subjects, from natural and juridical persons, to economic sectors, to countries. While comprehensive overviews of sanctions powers have been produced by numerous authors, for example, Corn, Gurule &amp; Kahn (2016), these sanctions powers can be deployed in a tailored cyber deterrence framework. The basic concept is the same as that already described for deterrence generally: a state would signal that it is willing to bring its sanctions powers to bear in response to certain serious hostile cyber actions in a manner that would target what potential adversaries value and sketch elements of how a response would proceed in such a way as to make the threat credible.\nRecent history indicates that sanctions can be made more effective in certain circumstances (Goychayev et al. 2017, at 8.67-68). In considering use of sanctions to retaliate or deter hostile cyber actions, states should consider the following:\n- Sanctions are likely to be more effective tools of deterrence when they have a relatively broad scope (the sanctioned actors cannot simply reregister under a new corporate name and continue operating as they previously had been) and have multilateral participation.\n- The more robust the evidence in demonstrating an actor has carried out a particular series\nJournal of Information Warfare\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\nof hostile cyber actions, the more likely the international community is to join a multilateral sanctions regime.\n- Sanctions have more impact against states with at least moderately effective channels for influence by the general population of a country over its government and where the target country has a relatively vulnerable, export-oriented economy.\n- Sanctions are more likely to be effective when accompanied by a comprehensive negotiation strategy coupled with other tools of pressure and influence, such as diplomatic engagement of all stakeholders and the targeted and complementary deployment of hard power.\n# Tool 9 – Loud cyber responses\nIn contrast to most cyber activity in which stealth is paramount, ‘loud’ cyber retaliations deliberately broadcast their presence and origin. A loud cyberattack leaves no question as to its perpetrator and is intended to be as much communication as attack. Such actions can be undertaken publicly or tailored for notice by a specific agency or leader. Loud attacks might be undertaken in response to other cyber acts to demonstrate the state is aware of the adversary’s cyber action and to serve as a warning to cease and desist (Goychayev et al. 2017, p. 1.68). Where such retaliations are open, this enhances general deterrence and demonstrates resolve to respond.\n# Tool 10 – Kinetic response\nThe United States has issued statements that it reserves the right to respond to cyberattacks using appropriate, proportionate kinetic force (Department of Defense 2011). Such attacks are authorised under international law in only very specific circumstances and otherwise might constitute a serious breach of international law, potentially including the international crime of aggression. States should likely refrain from undertaking this type of response to a cyberattack unless they have supreme confidence in the attribution of the attack. Considering the risk involved, the threshold of seriousness for a cyberattack to merit a kinetic response would likely also be quite high, such as causing loss of life.\n# Tool 11 – International partnership and collaboration\nStates can significantly enhance the effectiveness of their cyber deterrence postures by leveraging alliances and international institutions. One of the strongest elements of United-States-backed deterrence in the Cold War was the establishment and maintenance of largely unified international blocs, underpinned by principles of free trade, democratic values, and mutual defence (for example, Holbrooke 1995; Murphy 2016). These included the mutual defence arrangements with Europe via NATO as well as with Japan and the Republic of Korea. Some argue it would not have been possible without the high degree of complementary economic and political cooperation engendered in such institutions as the European Community (and then European Union), the Council of Europe, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and bilateral arrangements with Japan and Korea (Holbrooke 1995). This web of strong alliances and interlinkages amplified adversaries’ perceptions that there would be consequences for aggressive conduct and that they would be serious. It is likely no accident that a focus of recent Russian cyber disinformation campaigns appears to have been to stoke nationalist sentiment in United States’ allies and to foment cynicism about and scepticism toward international institutions, particularly the European Union (Office of the Director of National Security 2017). A logical countermeasure to present-day cyber\nJournal of Information Warfare\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\naggression, therefore, would be to reinvest in these institutions and integrate into them robust counter-cyber arrangements and capabilities. Wherever feasible, the United States should look to undertake its cyber deterrence actions together with allies, which will both isolate and increase the costs for would-be adversaries.\n## Tool 12 – Treaties and arms control\nWhile a set of credible hard power policies and capabilities would likely serve as the foundation for managing cyber conflict, mutually agreed-upon norms and rules can solidify and reinforce a deterrence framework to achieve greater stability. Numerous treaties, agreements, and international norms have reinforced deterrence and enhanced international stability with respect to other types of forces in certain contexts, particularly during the Cold War. The next section further elaborates this concept and explores potential applications of this tool.\n## Promoting Cyber Stability: Prior Principles, Future Applications\nIn view of the arguably constructive role that arms control frameworks played in reinforcing deterrence and stability during the Cold War noted above, the authors conducted a systematic analysis of several arms control or stabilising regimes with the potential to offer lessons for managing cyber conflict. They found that, given the differences between the cyber and kinetic realms, no single past arms control treaty regime offers a singularly strong analogue for regulating hostile cyber activities. Nonetheless, numerous distinct principles from past treaty regimes have the potential to be applied to regulate state hostile cyber actions. These are presented below.\n## Cross-applicability of prior treaty principles to cyber conflict\nSeveral arms control and stabilising treaty regimes were analysed to assess their potential cross-applicability to managing cyber conflict (Goychayev et al. 2107, Sec. 5, pp. 5.24-5.50). Regimes were selected for analysis if they were considered to have worked in terms of stabilising nuclear arms races; to have dealt with categories of arms (such as chemical and biological weapons or piracy) that seemed analogous in some regard to cyber weaponry in their verification and monitoring challenges; to have regulated issues relevant to hostile cyber activity such as incident prevention, escalation management, and reducing disinformation; and/or to have regulated state behaviour in ungoverned or poorly governed spaces. The specific regimes analysed are presented below. The discussion includes a brief summary of the study's findings with respect to the principles employed in each regime and their potential for cross-applicability in the cyber realm.\n- The Strategic Arms Limitation and Reduction Treaties (SALT, ABM, and START) helped to regulate the nuclear arms race, but have limited applicability as a model for cyber stability given their emphasis on numerical limitations of warheads and delivery vehicles, verification through inspection, and reliance on a bipolar structure of international relations. Nevertheless, some verification modalities applied in these treaties might be incorporated in a cyber control regime, such as managed access where verification inspectors could have tightly controlled access to sites, and information barriers that could facilitate international information sharing and cooperation on attack attribution (US Department of State 1972c; 1972d; 1979; 1991; 1993b; 2002; 2011).\n- The Nuclear Test Ban Treaties lack a direct analogue to the cyber realm, as there is no\nJournal of Information Warfare\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\nequivalent, verifiable way to limit testing of a cyber weapon. However, these treaties demonstrate both a path for establishing multilateral norms against unacceptable state behaviour as well as multilateral technical forensic approaches to verification (vested in the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization's International Monitoring System) that may have potential to be cross-applied to the cyber realm. Additionally, information exchanges like those used in nuclear test ban treaties, if applied to cyber capabilities, might help to ease the secrecy that currently exacerbates cyber conflict (US Department of State 1963; 1974; 1996).\n- The Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) and the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) have various shared aspects that have strong potential applicability in managing cyber conflict. They establish open-ended definitions for the weaponry they control, with analysis of prohibition often hinging on state intent. This approach is potentially highly applicable to regulating cyber conflict as cyber weaponry is highly context-dependent, and its attributes cannot be definitively described. The conventions' definitions of prohibited items in terms of state intent, internationalised post-incident investigations of alleged violations, and use of confidence-building measures may offer useful analogues for promoting stability in the cyber realm (US Department of State 1972b; 1993a).\n- United States-Soviet Union Incidents at Sea Agreement has limited application in cyber stability, in part due to differences between the nature of international waters (where no state has jurisdiction) and cyber infrastructure (where different states have jurisdiction over various elements). However, the Incidents at Sea Agreement defined and prohibited a set of actions and manoeuvres that the parties jointly understood presented risks of accident, misinterpretation, and unintended escalation. A treaty regime employing similar principles might be useful in the cyber realm (US Department of State 1972a).\n- The Helsinki Process demonstrated how a sufficiently broad negotiations framework (covering territorial disputes, political-military relations, trade, and human rights) can yield breakthroughs. The human rights aspects of that framework additionally helped to dispel propaganda and disinformation, which have renewed relevance today. The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, a product of the Helsinki Process, now has a dedicated cyber security branch that might be expanded or used as a model for a multilateral cyber security forum (Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe 2017).\n- The History of Regulation of Piracy and Privateering demonstrates that international agreements which expedite criminal prosecution of state proxies and individual criminals have some potential to contribute to deterrence of hostile state cyber actions; however, historical analysis suggests the salient factors contributing to agreements in these areas are not strongly analogous to present-day cyber conflict (for example, Egloff 2015; UN Convention 1982; Guilfoyle 2014).\nFigure 2, below, indicates the types of agreement attributes found in the various treaties and regimes the authors reviewed. The attributes include whether the treaty was bilateral or multilateral; banned types of weapons or placed numerical limits on weapons or delivery systems; limited certain types of destabilising actions and declared that such actions, if taken in violation of the treaty, could be reasonably interpreted by other parties as acts of aggression; required declaration of an accountable number of arms; had verification measures through inspections or of suspected violations; limited tests of specific types of weapons; established communication and informa\nJournal of Information Warfare\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\ntion-sharing mechanisms; established confidence-building measures; facilitated criminal prosecution; or allowed certain types of materials/activities so long as there was no indication that the state intended to use those materials/activities for prohibited purposes. Where an item on this list was not a feature of a treaty, it was left blank. Where an item on this list was a feature of the treaty, it was marked in the corresponding column, either as a concept assessed as applicable to cyber conflict or not believed applicable. Patterns emerged about the types of attributes in a treaty that might be useful for cyber stability.\nFigure 2: Summary of findings on applicability of prior treaty regimes and instruments to managing cyber conflict (Goychayev et al. 2017, p. 1.25)\nApplication of treaty-derived principles in a notional regime for managing cyber conflict Based on the analyses of these treaties, the principles highlighted above might notionally be applied in an agreed framework for managing cyber conflict.\n- Given the difficulties of meaningfully defining, describing, disclosing, accounting, or verifying cyber weaponry, states should eschew a cyber-weapons-focused approach.\n- States should focus on defining a set of prohibited conduct, likely actions that present either\nJournal of Information Warfare\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\nrisks to civilian populations or special risks of provocation or conflict escalation.\n- States could make a binding commitment not to engage in attacks against other states’ critical infrastructure, consistent with emerging consensus positions of the Group of Government Experts, or against certain sensitive defence-related facilities or armed forces, like the escalation-avoidance framework of the Incidents at Sea Agreement.\n- States could vest a shared function for verifying compliance with this prohibition in a neutral international body like the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons or the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization, which could emphasise technical attribution forensics.\n- If a state declares it has been the victim of a treaty-prohibited attack, to allow for more effective forensic attribution, the victim state(s) would be subject to commitments to provide certain onsite access and share certain information with this verification body.\n- The scope of access could be subject to certain managed access or information barrier modalities to ensure the protection of sensitive information, like the various treaty regimes with onsite verification.\n- Like the Budapest Convention, participating states could be affirmatively obligated to render assistance in forensic verification and attribution investigations, for instance in designating central authorities for interfacing on investigations, preserving computer data, and the like. These might offer means to enhance both state participation in such a regime as well as the effectiveness of attribution that it could achieve.\n- Such a regime might be bolstered by vesting additional functions in the verification body, such as a forum for transparency, confidence-building measures, and technical exchanges.\nFurther technical and institutional options for international cooperation on the attribution of hostile cyber actions could be a valuable topic for future research.\n## Conclusion\nWeaponisation of the cyber realm is already undermining international cyber stability. Nevertheless, states have a variety of tools available to deter hostile cyber actions and increase stability. Though neither 20th century deterrence nor historic arms control approaches offer simple, direct analogues for cyber stability, various elements from these areas, particularly when synthesised, offer considerable potential for managing cyber conflict. States should carefully consider their potential adversaries, their desired outcomes, and the tools at their disposal to impose operational, retaliatory, and normative and reputational costs against their adversaries. In addition, detailed analysis of prior arms control and stabilising treaty regimes demonstrates there are several principles having considerable potential to be cross-applied to manage cyber conflict.",

Based on an analysis of deterrence theory and application and prior arms control regimes, the study presents a toolkit of policies and actions for national governments based on elements of deterrence and arms control that analysis demonstrates are potentially applicable to cyber conflict. The study illustrates how these could be prospectively applied in a treaty framework to facilitate attribution of hostile cyber actions.\nKeywords: Cyber Deterrence, Cyber Stability, Cyber Conflict, Strategic Stability, Arms Control, Strategic Deterrence\n# Introduction\nThroughout the latter half of the 20th century, deterrence and arms control served as pillars of strategic stability between the nuclear superpowers. As the 21st century proceeds, however, the emergence of cyber conflict has gradually but steadily undermined that equilibrium. Challenges in policing malicious cyber activity, obfuscation, and uncertainty of consequences in the cyber realm embolden states to test boundaries with ever more aggressive actions. While modern state cyber conflict is markedly different from the Cold War, traditional deterrence theory and international agreements to reduce the potential for conflict from that era offer various lessons that can be applied to manage cyber conflict.\nThe section below titled \"Defining Deterrence, Cyber Deterrence, and Cyber Stability\" explains the difference between traditional or kinetic conflict and cyber conflict; and defines the crucial concepts of cyber deterrence and cyber stability, including their relevance to international stability. The \"Promoting Cyber Deterrence\" section explores how states could adopt deterrence concepts developed under traditional deterrence theory and apply them in the cyber realm, including the use of international agreements and arms control regimes. The \"Promoting Cyber Stability\" sec\nJournal of Information Warfare (2019) 18.3: 53-69\nISSN 1445-3312 Print/ISSN 1445-3347 Online\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\ntion more closely examines those various agreements and regimes to see which elements might be applicable to cyber deterrence and stability. The final section concludes that while cyber and kinetic warfare—and the means for deterring them—differ, Cold War deterrence and arms control, viewed through an appropriate analytic prism, can nonetheless assist in constructing meaningful paradigms for achieving cyber deterrence and stability.\n## Defining Deterrence, Cyber Deterrence, and Cyber Stability\nHistorically, states waged wars with the expectation that the spoils of victory would outweigh the costs, but nuclear weapons fundamentally altered that expectation. The unprecedented destructive potential of nuclear weapons compelled states to focus on preventing conflict before it started, which they achieved in part through deterrence, by creating a threshold of conflict that no one dared cross. The emergence of the cyber domain and cyber operations presents a concerning new pathway for conflict and escalation, threatening anything that relies on computers, which are now ubiquitous. Particularly considering the seriousness of recent hostile state cyber operations against one another, understanding whether and how deterrence might be meaningfully applied to prevent such escalation is an urgent task . This section briefly explains what deterrence is, particularly as it applied during the Cold War, then defines cyber deterrence and cyber stability. Next, this section examines how hostile cyber actions differ from kinetic warfare, which makes it difficult to apply traditional deterrence theory. The \"Promoting Cyber Deterrence\" and \"Promoting Cyber Stability\" sections apply deterrence theory and international arms control concepts to the cyber realm.\nTo illustrate deterrence, Henry Kissinger developed this equation:\n$$\nD = C \\times R \\times B\n$$\nDeterrence (D) is the product of the capability (C) of the deterring party to carry out a threatened act, multiplied by the resolve (R) of the deterring party to carry out the act, multiplied by the belief (B) of the party to be deterred that the deterring party will carry out the threatened act. If capability, resolve, or belief is ever zero, then the deterrence value is also zero; and, thus, deterrence will have failed . Capability refers to the technical ability to act—that is, does the deterring party have the weapons, infrastructure, and delivery systems to carry out the promised retaliation? Resolve is whether the deterring party would be willing to carry out the threat. Belief refers to whether the adversary finds the threat from the deterring party credible, including the technical ability and willingness to act .\nTo deter malicious actions, a state must ensure that any would-be attacker believes that the costs of the attack will likely outweigh the benefits. This posture can be achieved through demonstrating to an adversary that its attacks are unlikely to achieve its objectives, or that the consequences for an attack (even a failed one) will be unacceptably high. Figure 1 illustrates a successful cyber deterrence posture, where the adversary's perceived cost of undertaking a hostile cyber action outweighs its perceived benefit. The components of that representation are determined through an examination of their potential implementation in a coherent cyber deterrence policy.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\nFigure 1: Visualisation of successful cyber deterrence: A theoretical model # Defining Cyber Hostile Actions, Cyber Deterrence, and Cyber Stability\nThis paper adopts the premise that the law of armed conflict has thus far proved of limited use in regulating hostile state cyber actions, so does not treat the law of armed conflict in detail. The threshold for its application, that of an 'armed attack' (for example, Koh 2012; Schmitt 2017), has arisen rarely and, in any case, states have proven reluctant to recognise cyber acts giving rise to hostilities or constituting aggression in the traditional meanings of those terms. At the same time, states have regularly engaged and continue to engage in a wide variety of concerning, hostile conduct with serious, albeit generally non-kinetic, consequences, with potential to set states on an escalatory path that could spill over into kinetic conflict (Department of Defense 2018). The terms 'cyberattack' relative to 'armed attack' are understood in international law, so this study instead focuses on a broad spectrum of lower-order conduct 'hostile cyber actions', which may be defined as \"cyber attack, use or deployment of cyber weaponry, cyber espionage, or cyber information warfare operations directed against a state, its nationals, or its interests, typically by another state or at another state's direction\" .\nThis study defined the concept of 'cyber deterrence' as a set of conditions under which a state communicates, either explicitly or implicitly, a credible intention and capability to accurately attribute and impose substantial consequences for certain hostile cyber actions directed against it, and that communication dissuades other actors from undertaking such actions . While Cold War deterrence and cyber deterrence have in common a basic emphasis\nJournal of Information Warfare\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\non cost-benefit calculus, effective deterrence of hostile cyber actions is likely to assume different forms than nuclear or conventional deterrence in the Cold War, as will be explained in greater detail below. ‘Cyber stability’ describes relations between states characterised by the absence of serious hostile cyber actions against one another, where the states have a sufficient common understanding of each other’s capabilities and intentions so as to be inclined generally to avoid such actions, likely associated with a common belief that the costs of such conduct would outweigh the benefits .\n## Cold War Deterrence versus Cyber Deterrence\nTraditional deterrence theory does not translate smoothly or simply to cyber conflict, given how cyber conflict differs from its conventional and nuclear counterparts. Cold-War-type deterrence generally applied (and applies) to extremely costly, high-consequence scenarios (such as nuclear or large-scale conventional war between the superpowers) with relatively high general confidence of attribution and capabilities for retaliation that were relatively well-known among the competing adversaries. By contrast, countries usually do not display or publicly test their cyber weapons, as doing so would give adversaries opportunities to develop countermeasures that would render the weapons ineffectual. In addition, the cost of cyber conflict is typically significantly lower than the costs of establishing, maintaining, or using kinetic forces . The consequences of cyberattacks can vary from negligible to severe, but most cases do not result in physical injury, loss of life, or destruction of property (and do not inherently present that risk in any way comparable to nuclear weapons or large-scale conventional forces). Finally, states can frequently obscure their involvement in hostile cyber actions through various techniques, such as masking the point of origin or generating false signature data. Cyber conflict, thus, differs from Cold War competition in part because it offers a low-cost, potentially low-consequence, and often non-attributable means for weakening an adversary. These differing cost-benefit outlooks presumably help to explain the relative frequencies of the different types of attacks. Nevertheless, applications of specific concepts from Cold War deterrence and stabilising frameworks can be applied to the cyber realm.\n## Promoting Cyber Deterrence: A Technical and Policy Toolkit\nThis section summarises tools available to states to achieve cyber deterrence and promote cyber stability. Some tools are based on 20th-century arms control and deterrence concepts, while others are not . As an overarching framework, considering the polycentric threat environment that states confront in the cyber realm (in contrast to the bipolar environment of the Cold War), states would be better served to adopt ‘tailored deterrence’ postures; that is, they should adopt deterrence strategies tailored to the specific states (or sets of states) and actions they seek to deter. States must consider that their adversaries have varying vulnerabilities, capabilities, and intentions, and will respond to stimuli accordingly. For example, what motivates actors in more open, pluralistic states will differ from what motivates actors in more closed, authoritarian ones. Further, states reliant on cyberspace are different from states lacking widespread Internet penetration and adoption, or where these are rigidly monitored and controlled by the state. Based on that tailored assessment, states should apply a selection of appropriate deterrence tools. An effective deterrence policy will likely not be limited to actions in the cyber realm but will rely on a coherent, coordinated application of a variety of tools at a state’s disposal.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\n# Tool 1 – Enhanced, active defence\nTo help deter would-be cyber adversaries, states could improve the cyber security posture of their critical systems and infrastructure. The better protected a target, the costlier it is to attack and the less attractive it becomes. One way to improve defence could be to expand efforts within the government and the technology industry to establish a system and network architectures that incorporate appropriate security considerations. Defensible architectures present a smaller attack surface, limit the access of an attacker who does manage to infiltrate, and can operate despite interference or damage. This defence effort simultaneously lessens the impact of a successful attack while increasing the cost to accomplish it. Laudable efforts along these lines include the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework and associated documents .\nStates could undertake educational campaigns both to teach technology users about cyber threats and to groom the next generation of cyber security experts. In addition, states could seek to implement systems that incorporate more active defence and security measures. Architectures and processes could be put in place to actively interrogate systems to ensure that performance and functionality are uncompromised, proper, and authentic. Further, states could adopt strategies and develop capabilities to discover, define, analyse, and mitigate cyber threats and vulnerabilities in a more real-time mode, and direct these capabilities to defend critical infrastructure or other national security assets (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency 2018; Denning &amp; Strawser 2017).\n# Tool 2 – Resilience, reconstitution\nBuilding resilient systems that may succumb to attacks but can quickly be reconstituted and at little cost represents another paradigm for reducing the perceived potential benefits the adversary would gain from carrying out attacks. States could consider establishing or adopting standards for system architecture related to recovery and reconstitution. Innovative technological research and development to improve cyber defences and critical infrastructure resilience could have a deterrent effect as well. Microgrid technology, for example, could be helpful in bolstering resiliency by decentralising electricity generation and transmission, and dispersing accompanying risks (U.S. Department of Energy website 2017).\n# Tool 3 – Declarations of thresholds for action, reaction\nA low-cost step states can take to promote cyber stability is to unilaterally declare types of cyberattacks that will trigger their response and, in general terms, the spectrum of activities the response will entail. For example, President Obama’s Executive Order 13694 (2015) clearly delineated what malicious cyber acts the United States perceives as threats to national security, including attacks against critical infrastructure. States participating in the United Nation’s 2015 Group of Government Experts similarly recommend that states cooperate to prevent harmful information and communication technology practices and that states should not conduct or support such activity that damages or impairs critical infrastructure (United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research 2016). Clear statements about what are unacceptable targets of hostile cyber acts such as these indicate that states will view these types of activities as very grave. States could be even more explicit, though. For example, a state could issue public and private statements about what specific cyber acts by specific countries will prompt a response. In July 2016, the North Atlantic\nJournal of Information Warfare\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\nTreaty Organization (NATO) recognised cyberspace “as a domain of operations in which NATO must defend itself as effectively as it does in the air, on land, and at sea” . It remains unclear how individual member states will respond to specific acts of cyber aggression against NATO allies. The United States has indicated it is concerned with protecting its allies from cyber aggression (Executive Order 13694 2015, at 152). Clearer communication by a country about its perception of and likely responses to threats could also reduce risks of miscalculation and escalation. Similarly, states could clarify their positions on cyber norms and possible responses to specific adversaries using direct, private communications, which might allow a message to be tailored more specifically and effectively for the states in question.\n## Tool 4 – Improving detection and attribution capabilities\nDetection of an attack is essential for attribution and retaliation. In contrast to a typical kinetic attack, malicious cyberattacks might not be detected until after they have been initiated or completed. Improving detection of cyberattacks could, therefore, enhance deterrence but presents a formidable challenge. While in kinetic war, there are robust early warning systems and clear evidence of attack (for example, bullet holes or bomb craters), there is no obvious analogue for many types of hostile cyber acts. The variety of malicious cyberattack vectors is tremendous and growing at a rapid pace together with technology, making attacks hard to predict and difficult to identify. One of the most reliable forms of cyberattack detection is reports of attacks by victims, but victims such as large financial institutions, hospitals, or power companies are often hesitant to report attacks due to fears they might trigger adverse liability rules or suffer reputational harm. Streamlining the means for victims to report attacks to authorities, perhaps with enhanced confidentiality or leniency for the victims’ liability, could incentivise more thorough and timely reporting. Detection can also be facilitated by active monitoring of known hostile actors.\nIn addition, the lack of generally recognised means for high-confidence attribution of cyberattacks remains a critical barrier to achieving deterrence of hostile cyber actions. If an attacker is confident that it cannot be identified, it will not be deterred by threats of retaliation by its target. Even where attribution can proceed, timeliness is a major problem, as a cyber-attacking state has various means to obfuscate its involvement and place in the path of investigators obstacles that take time to overcome. This problem can likely be mitigated with heavy investments in international law enforcement capabilities and coordination; however, even with such investments, there will likely remain some persistent level of attacks that cannot be attributed in time for a meaningful response.\nEven when a state can trace an attack to its origin, further difficulties arise. Disclosure of the fact of attribution can prompt an adversary to change its methods and render the technique for detection and attribution obsolete. Failure to disclose the full grounds for an accusation (for instance, sources, methods) can lead to questioning the motives and authenticity of attribution, but such full disclosure might compromise sensitive or classified information. Some balance must be struck. In the recent attribution to Russia of interference in the 2016 United States presidential election, the approach was taken of issuing a statement on the attribution conclusion together with some generally recognised and publicly available specific evidence, some newly declassified information, and some indication that other classified sources were used (Office of the Director of National Intelligence 2017). States would likely benefit from establishing disclosure policies in anticipation\nJournal of Information Warfare\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\nof this need for public assessments of state responsibility for cyberattacks, rather than to scramble and grapple with these questions reactively or repeatedly.\n## Tool 5 – Declaration of planned retaliatory measures\nRetaliation has been a principal focus of deterrence theory for centuries, and deterrence through the threat of punishment will remain a key factor in cyber space. Specific retaliatory measures are explored in greater detail under tools 6 through 10. When a state declares planned retaliation, threatened retaliatory measures must be linked to the declaring state’s capabilities to be credible and must hold at risk something the adversary values enough to likely outweigh the benefit the adversary hopes to gain through the attack. Where possible, to reinforce the credibility of the declared threat, the state threatening retaliation should exercise or otherwise display these measures to demonstrate capability and readiness.\n## Tool 6 – Public attribution, stigma\nWhen states can attribute cyberattacks against them with a high degree of confidence, they can publicly expose and condemn the perpetrators. By publicly identifying aggressors who commit hostile cyber actions, states can build international coalitions against the aggressors and their behaviour. For example, the Obama Administration publicly accused North Korea of an attack on Sony Corporation (White House 2014). This public condemnation supported international efforts to tighten sanctions on North Korea. This ‘naming and shaming’ tactic has been executed in several other instances, notably in response to Russia’s aggressive conduct during and after 2014, which has proved instrumental in securing and then maintaining the European Union’s broad and punishing sanctions regime (White House 2016; US Department of Justice 2014). Such denunciations can have cascading effects: damaging an attacking state’s reputation, limiting its ability to bargain and persuade, helping to sway general opinion against the state and the offending conduct, and hastening the formation of coalitions to counteract such aggression. Such statements can also contribute to the development of customary international law against cyberattacks.\n## Tool 7 – Enhanced, coordinated use of national criminal laws\nGiven the difficulty of attributing hostile cyber acts to states, one alternative to directly invoking or proving state responsibility is to deter the individual actors upon which states must rely to execute attacks. The acts comprising hostile cyber actions typically constitute generally recognised cybercrimes under national criminal laws; hence, the individuals who perpetrate the acts can be prosecuted for crimes (when states do not invoke sovereign immunity, see below) (Council of Europe 2004). By implementing and enforcing strong cybercrime laws in concert with their overall national defence and deterrence postures, states might deter the individuals who act on behalf of states in cyberspace and, by extension, the states themselves. As an example of this type of approach, the United States recently invoked its primary federal computer crime statutes to indict Russian Federal Security Service officers and criminal conspirators in connection with the hacking of Yahoo email accounts, which allegedly included email accounts for United States and Russian government officials (US Department of Justice 2017); similar indictments have been issued in response to prominent cases of Chinese-government-sponsored cyber intrusions (US Department of Justice 2014).\nJournal of Information Warfare\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\nSimply indicting foreign nationals for crimes can be ineffective if the indicting state lacks immediate physical jurisdiction over the accused. To assist in the apprehension of criminals and in investigation and prosecution of cybercrime, states often rely on mutual legal assistance treaties, extradition treaties, and other frameworks for coordinating and facilitating international criminal prosecution (Council of Europe 2017). States can leverage such international architecture to enhance deterrence against would-be state proxy cybercriminals. When obtaining physical jurisdiction is unlikely (for example, when a criminal actor is in a state unwilling or unable to cooperate in a prosecution), states can arrange forfeiture (confiscation) of instrumentalities and proceeds of crime or even criminals’ assets located in states that will cooperate. International arrest warrants can significantly constrain criminals’ freedom to travel. Such measures may substantially degrade the ability of states to recruit proxies to carry out acts of cyber aggression.\nStates could develop credible and consistent cybercrime prosecution policies to serve national security interests. Investigative and prosecutorial independence is important for ensuring public trust in law enforcement agencies and is best preserved when prosecutors publicly establish their own prioritisation of policies beforehand, rather than appearing to react to events that might be politically charged. The United States, for instance, has in the past established clear prosecutorial policies on such matters as counterterrorism and transnational organised crime (Presidential Archives 2011). A similar approach could be developed and applied for likely state hostile cyber actions.\nA strong national criminal law approach offers one additional benefit: it places pressure on the criminals and states to assert sovereign immunity for protection (US Department of State 2017). Such assertions may substantially aid in making the case for a state’s responsibility for the cyber-attack in question.\n## Tool 8 – International sanctions\nAmong tools for coercion and retaliation, economic sanctions have significantly increased in prominence over the last three decades. The U.S. president, for example, has considerable powers, both inherent and legislatively authorised, to unilaterally impose sanctions at various levels against various subjects, from natural and juridical persons, to economic sectors, to countries. While comprehensive overviews of sanctions powers have been produced by numerous authors, for example, Corn, Gurule &amp; Kahn (2016), these sanctions powers can be deployed in a tailored cyber deterrence framework. The basic concept is the same as that already described for deterrence generally: a state would signal that it is willing to bring its sanctions powers to bear in response to certain serious hostile cyber actions in a manner that would target what potential adversaries value and sketch elements of how a response would proceed in such a way as to make the threat credible.\nRecent history indicates that sanctions can be made more effective in certain circumstances . In considering use of sanctions to retaliate or deter hostile cyber actions, states should consider the following:\n- Sanctions are likely to be more effective tools of deterrence when they have a relatively broad scope (the sanctioned actors cannot simply reregister under a new corporate name and continue operating as they previously had been) and have multilateral participation.\n- The more robust the evidence in demonstrating an actor has carried out a particular series\nJournal of Information Warfare\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\nof hostile cyber actions, the more likely the international community is to join a multilateral sanctions regime.\n- Sanctions have more impact against states with at least moderately effective channels for influence by the general population of a country over its government and where the target country has a relatively vulnerable, export-oriented economy.\n- Sanctions are more likely to be effective when accompanied by a comprehensive negotiation strategy coupled with other tools of pressure and influence, such as diplomatic engagement of all stakeholders and the targeted and complementary deployment of hard power.\n# Tool 9 – Loud cyber responses\nIn contrast to most cyber activity in which stealth is paramount, ‘loud’ cyber retaliations deliberately broadcast their presence and origin. A loud cyberattack leaves no question as to its perpetrator and is intended to be as much communication as attack. Such actions can be undertaken publicly or tailored for notice by a specific agency or leader. Loud attacks might be undertaken in response to other cyber acts to demonstrate the state is aware of the adversary’s cyber action and to serve as a warning to cease and desist . Where such retaliations are open, this enhances general deterrence and demonstrates resolve to respond.\n# Tool 10 – Kinetic response\nThe United States has issued statements that it reserves the right to respond to cyberattacks using appropriate, proportionate kinetic force (Department of Defense 2011). Such attacks are authorised under international law in only very specific circumstances and otherwise might constitute a serious breach of international law, potentially including the international crime of aggression. States should likely refrain from undertaking this type of response to a cyberattack unless they have supreme confidence in the attribution of the attack. Considering the risk involved, the threshold of seriousness for a cyberattack to merit a kinetic response would likely also be quite high, such as causing loss of life.\n# Tool 11 – International partnership and collaboration\nStates can significantly enhance the effectiveness of their cyber deterrence postures by leveraging alliances and international institutions. One of the strongest elements of United-States-backed deterrence in the Cold War was the establishment and maintenance of largely unified international blocs, underpinned by principles of free trade, democratic values, and mutual defence (for example, Holbrooke 1995; Murphy 2016). These included the mutual defence arrangements with Europe via NATO as well as with Japan and the Republic of Korea. Some argue it would not have been possible without the high degree of complementary economic and political cooperation engendered in such institutions as the European Community (and then European Union), the Council of Europe, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and bilateral arrangements with Japan and Korea . This web of strong alliances and interlinkages amplified adversaries’ perceptions that there would be consequences for aggressive conduct and that they would be serious. It is likely no accident that a focus of recent Russian cyber disinformation campaigns appears to have been to stoke nationalist sentiment in United States’ allies and to foment cynicism about and scepticism toward international institutions, particularly the European Union (Office of the Director of National Security 2017). A logical countermeasure to present-day cyber\nJournal of Information Warfare\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\naggression, therefore, would be to reinvest in these institutions and integrate into them robust counter-cyber arrangements and capabilities. Wherever feasible, the United States should look to undertake its cyber deterrence actions together with allies, which will both isolate and increase the costs for would-be adversaries.\n## Tool 12 – Treaties and arms control\nWhile a set of credible hard power policies and capabilities would likely serve as the foundation for managing cyber conflict, mutually agreed-upon norms and rules can solidify and reinforce a deterrence framework to achieve greater stability. Numerous treaties, agreements, and international norms have reinforced deterrence and enhanced international stability with respect to other types of forces in certain contexts, particularly during the Cold War. The next section further elaborates this concept and explores potential applications of this tool.\n## Promoting Cyber Stability: Prior Principles, Future Applications\nIn view of the arguably constructive role that arms control frameworks played in reinforcing deterrence and stability during the Cold War noted above, the authors conducted a systematic analysis of several arms control or stabilising regimes with the potential to offer lessons for managing cyber conflict. They found that, given the differences between the cyber and kinetic realms, no single past arms control treaty regime offers a singularly strong analogue for regulating hostile cyber activities. Nonetheless, numerous distinct principles from past treaty regimes have the potential to be applied to regulate state hostile cyber actions. These are presented below.\n## Cross-applicability of prior treaty principles to cyber conflict\nSeveral arms control and stabilising treaty regimes were analysed to assess their potential cross-applicability to managing cyber conflict . Regimes were selected for analysis if they were considered to have worked in terms of stabilising nuclear arms races; to have dealt with categories of arms (such as chemical and biological weapons or piracy) that seemed analogous in some regard to cyber weaponry in their verification and monitoring challenges; to have regulated issues relevant to hostile cyber activity such as incident prevention, escalation management, and reducing disinformation; and/or to have regulated state behaviour in ungoverned or poorly governed spaces. The specific regimes analysed are presented below. The discussion includes a brief summary of the study's findings with respect to the principles employed in each regime and their potential for cross-applicability in the cyber realm.\n- The Strategic Arms Limitation and Reduction Treaties (SALT, ABM, and START) helped to regulate the nuclear arms race, but have limited applicability as a model for cyber stability given their emphasis on numerical limitations of warheads and delivery vehicles, verification through inspection, and reliance on a bipolar structure of international relations. Nevertheless, some verification modalities applied in these treaties might be incorporated in a cyber control regime, such as managed access where verification inspectors could have tightly controlled access to sites, and information barriers that could facilitate international information sharing and cooperation on attack attribution (US Department of State 1972c; 1972d; 1979; 1991; 1993b; 2002; 2011).\n- The Nuclear Test Ban Treaties lack a direct analogue to the cyber realm, as there is no\nJournal of Information Warfare\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\nequivalent, verifiable way to limit testing of a cyber weapon. However, these treaties demonstrate both a path for establishing multilateral norms against unacceptable state behaviour as well as multilateral technical forensic approaches to verification (vested in the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization's International Monitoring System) that may have potential to be cross-applied to the cyber realm. Additionally, information exchanges like those used in nuclear test ban treaties, if applied to cyber capabilities, might help to ease the secrecy that currently exacerbates cyber conflict (US Department of State 1963; 1974; 1996).\n- The Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) and the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) have various shared aspects that have strong potential applicability in managing cyber conflict. They establish open-ended definitions for the weaponry they control, with analysis of prohibition often hinging on state intent. This approach is potentially highly applicable to regulating cyber conflict as cyber weaponry is highly context-dependent, and its attributes cannot be definitively described. The conventions' definitions of prohibited items in terms of state intent, internationalised post-incident investigations of alleged violations, and use of confidence-building measures may offer useful analogues for promoting stability in the cyber realm (US Department of State 1972b; 1993a).\n- United States-Soviet Union Incidents at Sea Agreement has limited application in cyber stability, in part due to differences between the nature of international waters (where no state has jurisdiction) and cyber infrastructure (where different states have jurisdiction over various elements). However, the Incidents at Sea Agreement defined and prohibited a set of actions and manoeuvres that the parties jointly understood presented risks of accident, misinterpretation, and unintended escalation. A treaty regime employing similar principles might be useful in the cyber realm (US Department of State 1972a).\n- The Helsinki Process demonstrated how a sufficiently broad negotiations framework (covering territorial disputes, political-military relations, trade, and human rights) can yield breakthroughs. The human rights aspects of that framework additionally helped to dispel propaganda and disinformation, which have renewed relevance today. The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, a product of the Helsinki Process, now has a dedicated cyber security branch that might be expanded or used as a model for a multilateral cyber security forum (Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe 2017).\n- The History of Regulation of Piracy and Privateering demonstrates that international agreements which expedite criminal prosecution of state proxies and individual criminals have some potential to contribute to deterrence of hostile state cyber actions; however, historical analysis suggests the salient factors contributing to agreements in these areas are not strongly analogous to present-day cyber conflict (for example, Egloff 2015; UN Convention 1982; Guilfoyle 2014).\nFigure 2, below, indicates the types of agreement attributes found in the various treaties and regimes the authors reviewed. The attributes include whether the treaty was bilateral or multilateral; banned types of weapons or placed numerical limits on weapons or delivery systems; limited certain types of destabilising actions and declared that such actions, if taken in violation of the treaty, could be reasonably interpreted by other parties as acts of aggression; required declaration of an accountable number of arms; had verification measures through inspections or of suspected violations; limited tests of specific types of weapons; established communication and informa\nJournal of Information Warfare\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\ntion-sharing mechanisms; established confidence-building measures; facilitated criminal prosecution; or allowed certain types of materials/activities so long as there was no indication that the state intended to use those materials/activities for prohibited purposes. Where an item on this list was not a feature of a treaty, it was left blank. Where an item on this list was a feature of the treaty, it was marked in the corresponding column, either as a concept assessed as applicable to cyber conflict or not believed applicable. Patterns emerged about the types of attributes in a treaty that might be useful for cyber stability.\nFigure 2: Summary of findings on applicability of prior treaty regimes and instruments to managing cyber conflict Application of treaty-derived principles in a notional regime for managing cyber conflict Based on the analyses of these treaties, the principles highlighted above might notionally be applied in an agreed framework for managing cyber conflict.\n- Given the difficulties of meaningfully defining, describing, disclosing, accounting, or verifying cyber weaponry, states should eschew a cyber-weapons-focused approach.\n- States should focus on defining a set of prohibited conduct, likely actions that present either\nJournal of Information Warfare\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\nrisks to civilian populations or special risks of provocation or conflict escalation.\n- States could make a binding commitment not to engage in attacks against other states’ critical infrastructure, consistent with emerging consensus positions of the Group of Government Experts, or against certain sensitive defence-related facilities or armed forces, like the escalation-avoidance framework of the Incidents at Sea Agreement.\n- States could vest a shared function for verifying compliance with this prohibition in a neutral international body like the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons or the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization, which could emphasise technical attribution forensics.\n- If a state declares it has been the victim of a treaty-prohibited attack, to allow for more effective forensic attribution, the victim state(s) would be subject to commitments to provide certain onsite access and share certain information with this verification body.\n- The scope of access could be subject to certain managed access or information barrier modalities to ensure the protection of sensitive information, like the various treaty regimes with onsite verification.\n- Like the Budapest Convention, participating states could be affirmatively obligated to render assistance in forensic verification and attribution investigations, for instance in designating central authorities for interfacing on investigations, preserving computer data, and the like. These might offer means to enhance both state participation in such a regime as well as the effectiveness of attribution that it could achieve.\n- Such a regime might be bolstered by vesting additional functions in the verification body, such as a forum for transparency, confidence-building measures, and technical exchanges.\nFurther technical and institutional options for international cooperation on the attribution of hostile cyber actions could be a valuable topic for future research.\n## Conclusion\nWeaponisation of the cyber realm is already undermining international cyber stability. Nevertheless, states have a variety of tools available to deter hostile cyber actions and increase stability. Though neither 20th century deterrence nor historic arms control approaches offer simple, direct analogues for cyber stability, various elements from these areas, particularly when synthesised, offer considerable potential for managing cyber conflict. States should carefully consider their potential adversaries, their desired outcomes, and the tools at their disposal to impose operational, retaliatory, and normative and reputational costs against their adversaries. In addition, detailed analysis of prior arms control and stabilising treaty regimes demonstrates there are several principles having considerable potential to be cross-applied to manage cyber conflict.",

Based on an analysis of deterrence theory and application and prior arms control regimes, the study presents a toolkit of policies and actions for national governments based on elements of deterrence and arms control that analysis demonstrates are potentially applicable to cyber conflict. The study illustrates how these could be prospectively applied in a treaty framework to facilitate attribution of hostile cyber actions.\nKeywords: Cyber Deterrence, Cyber Stability, Cyber Conflict, Strategic Stability, Arms Control, Strategic Deterrence\n# Introduction\nThroughout the latter half of the 20th century, deterrence and arms control served as pillars of strategic stability between the nuclear superpowers. As the 21st century proceeds, however, the emergence of cyber conflict has gradually but steadily undermined that equilibrium. Challenges in policing malicious cyber activity, obfuscation, and uncertainty of consequences in the cyber realm embolden states to test boundaries with ever more aggressive actions. While modern state cyber conflict is markedly different from the Cold War, traditional deterrence theory and international agreements to reduce the potential for conflict from that era offer various lessons that can be applied to manage cyber conflict.\nThe section below titled \"Defining Deterrence, Cyber Deterrence, and Cyber Stability\" explains the difference between traditional or kinetic conflict and cyber conflict; and defines the crucial concepts of cyber deterrence and cyber stability, including their relevance to international stability. The \"Promoting Cyber Deterrence\" section explores how states could adopt deterrence concepts developed under traditional deterrence theory and apply them in the cyber realm, including the use of international agreements and arms control regimes. The \"Promoting Cyber Stability\" sec\nJournal of Information Warfare (2019) 18.3: 53-69\nISSN 1445-3312 Print/ISSN 1445-3347 Online\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\ntion more closely examines those various agreements and regimes to see which elements might be applicable to cyber deterrence and stability. The final section concludes that while cyber and kinetic warfare—and the means for deterring them—differ, Cold War deterrence and arms control, viewed through an appropriate analytic prism, can nonetheless assist in constructing meaningful paradigms for achieving cyber deterrence and stability.\n## Defining Deterrence, Cyber Deterrence, and Cyber Stability\nHistorically, states waged wars with the expectation that the spoils of victory would outweigh the costs, but nuclear weapons fundamentally altered that expectation. The unprecedented destructive potential of nuclear weapons compelled states to focus on preventing conflict before it started, which they achieved in part through deterrence, by creating a threshold of conflict that no one dared cross. The emergence of the cyber domain and cyber operations presents a concerning new pathway for conflict and escalation, threatening anything that relies on computers, which are now ubiquitous. Particularly considering the seriousness of recent hostile state cyber operations against one another, understanding whether and how deterrence might be meaningfully applied to prevent such escalation is an urgent task . This section briefly explains what deterrence is, particularly as it applied during the Cold War, then defines cyber deterrence and cyber stability. Next, this section examines how hostile cyber actions differ from kinetic warfare, which makes it difficult to apply traditional deterrence theory. The \"Promoting Cyber Deterrence\" and \"Promoting Cyber Stability\" sections apply deterrence theory and international arms control concepts to the cyber realm.\nTo illustrate deterrence, Henry Kissinger developed this equation:\n$$\nD = C \\times R \\times B\n$$\nDeterrence (D) is the product of the capability (C) of the deterring party to carry out a threatened act, multiplied by the resolve (R) of the deterring party to carry out the act, multiplied by the belief (B) of the party to be deterred that the deterring party will carry out the threatened act. If capability, resolve, or belief is ever zero, then the deterrence value is also zero; and, thus, deterrence will have failed . Capability refers to the technical ability to act—that is, does the deterring party have the weapons, infrastructure, and delivery systems to carry out the promised retaliation? Resolve is whether the deterring party would be willing to carry out the threat. Belief refers to whether the adversary finds the threat from the deterring party credible, including the technical ability and willingness to act .\nTo deter malicious actions, a state must ensure that any would-be attacker believes that the costs of the attack will likely outweigh the benefits. This posture can be achieved through demonstrating to an adversary that its attacks are unlikely to achieve its objectives, or that the consequences for an attack (even a failed one) will be unacceptably high. Figure 1 illustrates a successful cyber deterrence posture, where the adversary's perceived cost of undertaking a hostile cyber action outweighs its perceived benefit. The components of that representation are determined through an examination of their potential implementation in a coherent cyber deterrence policy.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\nFigure 1: Visualisation of successful cyber deterrence: A theoretical model # Defining Cyber Hostile Actions, Cyber Deterrence, and Cyber Stability\nThis paper adopts the premise that the law of armed conflict has thus far proved of limited use in regulating hostile state cyber actions, so does not treat the law of armed conflict in detail. The threshold for its application, that of an 'armed attack' (for example, Koh 2012; Schmitt 2017), has arisen rarely and, in any case, states have proven reluctant to recognise cyber acts giving rise to hostilities or constituting aggression in the traditional meanings of those terms. At the same time, states have regularly engaged and continue to engage in a wide variety of concerning, hostile conduct with serious, albeit generally non-kinetic, consequences, with potential to set states on an escalatory path that could spill over into kinetic conflict (Department of Defense 2018). The terms 'cyberattack' relative to 'armed attack' are understood in international law, so this study instead focuses on a broad spectrum of lower-order conduct 'hostile cyber actions', which may be defined as \"cyber attack, use or deployment of cyber weaponry, cyber espionage, or cyber information warfare operations directed against a state, its nationals, or its interests, typically by another state or at another state's direction\" .\nThis study defined the concept of 'cyber deterrence' as a set of conditions under which a state communicates, either explicitly or implicitly, a credible intention and capability to accurately attribute and impose substantial consequences for certain hostile cyber actions directed against it, and that communication dissuades other actors from undertaking such actions . While Cold War deterrence and cyber deterrence have in common a basic emphasis\nJournal of Information Warfare\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\non cost-benefit calculus, effective deterrence of hostile cyber actions is likely to assume different forms than nuclear or conventional deterrence in the Cold War, as will be explained in greater detail below. ‘Cyber stability’ describes relations between states characterised by the absence of serious hostile cyber actions against one another, where the states have a sufficient common understanding of each other’s capabilities and intentions so as to be inclined generally to avoid such actions, likely associated with a common belief that the costs of such conduct would outweigh the benefits .\n## Cold War Deterrence versus Cyber Deterrence\nTraditional deterrence theory does not translate smoothly or simply to cyber conflict, given how cyber conflict differs from its conventional and nuclear counterparts. Cold-War-type deterrence generally applied (and applies) to extremely costly, high-consequence scenarios (such as nuclear or large-scale conventional war between the superpowers) with relatively high general confidence of attribution and capabilities for retaliation that were relatively well-known among the competing adversaries. By contrast, countries usually do not display or publicly test their cyber weapons, as doing so would give adversaries opportunities to develop countermeasures that would render the weapons ineffectual. In addition, the cost of cyber conflict is typically significantly lower than the costs of establishing, maintaining, or using kinetic forces . The consequences of cyberattacks can vary from negligible to severe, but most cases do not result in physical injury, loss of life, or destruction of property (and do not inherently present that risk in any way comparable to nuclear weapons or large-scale conventional forces). Finally, states can frequently obscure their involvement in hostile cyber actions through various techniques, such as masking the point of origin or generating false signature data. Cyber conflict, thus, differs from Cold War competition in part because it offers a low-cost, potentially low-consequence, and often non-attributable means for weakening an adversary. These differing cost-benefit outlooks presumably help to explain the relative frequencies of the different types of attacks. Nevertheless, applications of specific concepts from Cold War deterrence and stabilising frameworks can be applied to the cyber realm.\n## Promoting Cyber Deterrence: A Technical and Policy Toolkit\nThis section summarises tools available to states to achieve cyber deterrence and promote cyber stability. Some tools are based on 20th-century arms control and deterrence concepts, while others are not . As an overarching framework, considering the polycentric threat environment that states confront in the cyber realm (in contrast to the bipolar environment of the Cold War), states would be better served to adopt ‘tailored deterrence’ postures; that is, they should adopt deterrence strategies tailored to the specific states (or sets of states) and actions they seek to deter. States must consider that their adversaries have varying vulnerabilities, capabilities, and intentions, and will respond to stimuli accordingly. For example, what motivates actors in more open, pluralistic states will differ from what motivates actors in more closed, authoritarian ones. Further, states reliant on cyberspace are different from states lacking widespread Internet penetration and adoption, or where these are rigidly monitored and controlled by the state. Based on that tailored assessment, states should apply a selection of appropriate deterrence tools. An effective deterrence policy will likely not be limited to actions in the cyber realm but will rely on a coherent, coordinated application of a variety of tools at a state’s disposal.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\n# Tool 1 – Enhanced, active defence\nTo help deter would-be cyber adversaries, states could improve the cyber security posture of their critical systems and infrastructure. The better protected a target, the costlier it is to attack and the less attractive it becomes. One way to improve defence could be to expand efforts within the government and the technology industry to establish a system and network architectures that incorporate appropriate security considerations. Defensible architectures present a smaller attack surface, limit the access of an attacker who does manage to infiltrate, and can operate despite interference or damage. This defence effort simultaneously lessens the impact of a successful attack while increasing the cost to accomplish it. Laudable efforts along these lines include the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework and associated documents .\nStates could undertake educational campaigns both to teach technology users about cyber threats and to groom the next generation of cyber security experts. In addition, states could seek to implement systems that incorporate more active defence and security measures. Architectures and processes could be put in place to actively interrogate systems to ensure that performance and functionality are uncompromised, proper, and authentic. Further, states could adopt strategies and develop capabilities to discover, define, analyse, and mitigate cyber threats and vulnerabilities in a more real-time mode, and direct these capabilities to defend critical infrastructure or other national security assets (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency 2018; Denning &amp; Strawser 2017).\n# Tool 2 – Resilience, reconstitution\nBuilding resilient systems that may succumb to attacks but can quickly be reconstituted and at little cost represents another paradigm for reducing the perceived potential benefits the adversary would gain from carrying out attacks. States could consider establishing or adopting standards for system architecture related to recovery and reconstitution. Innovative technological research and development to improve cyber defences and critical infrastructure resilience could have a deterrent effect as well. Microgrid technology, for example, could be helpful in bolstering resiliency by decentralising electricity generation and transmission, and dispersing accompanying risks (U.S. Department of Energy website 2017).\n# Tool 3 – Declarations of thresholds for action, reaction\nA low-cost step states can take to promote cyber stability is to unilaterally declare types of cyberattacks that will trigger their response and, in general terms, the spectrum of activities the response will entail. For example, President Obama’s Executive Order 13694 (2015) clearly delineated what malicious cyber acts the United States perceives as threats to national security, including attacks against critical infrastructure. States participating in the United Nation’s 2015 Group of Government Experts similarly recommend that states cooperate to prevent harmful information and communication technology practices and that states should not conduct or support such activity that damages or impairs critical infrastructure (United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research 2016). Clear statements about what are unacceptable targets of hostile cyber acts such as these indicate that states will view these types of activities as very grave. States could be even more explicit, though. For example, a state could issue public and private statements about what specific cyber acts by specific countries will prompt a response. In July 2016, the North Atlantic\nJournal of Information Warfare\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\nTreaty Organization (NATO) recognised cyberspace “as a domain of operations in which NATO must defend itself as effectively as it does in the air, on land, and at sea” . It remains unclear how individual member states will respond to specific acts of cyber aggression against NATO allies. The United States has indicated it is concerned with protecting its allies from cyber aggression (Executive Order 13694 2015, at 152). Clearer communication by a country about its perception of and likely responses to threats could also reduce risks of miscalculation and escalation. Similarly, states could clarify their positions on cyber norms and possible responses to specific adversaries using direct, private communications, which might allow a message to be tailored more specifically and effectively for the states in question.\n## Tool 4 – Improving detection and attribution capabilities\nDetection of an attack is essential for attribution and retaliation. In contrast to a typical kinetic attack, malicious cyberattacks might not be detected until after they have been initiated or completed. Improving detection of cyberattacks could, therefore, enhance deterrence but presents a formidable challenge. While in kinetic war, there are robust early warning systems and clear evidence of attack (for example, bullet holes or bomb craters), there is no obvious analogue for many types of hostile cyber acts. The variety of malicious cyberattack vectors is tremendous and growing at a rapid pace together with technology, making attacks hard to predict and difficult to identify. One of the most reliable forms of cyberattack detection is reports of attacks by victims, but victims such as large financial institutions, hospitals, or power companies are often hesitant to report attacks due to fears they might trigger adverse liability rules or suffer reputational harm. Streamlining the means for victims to report attacks to authorities, perhaps with enhanced confidentiality or leniency for the victims’ liability, could incentivise more thorough and timely reporting. Detection can also be facilitated by active monitoring of known hostile actors.\nIn addition, the lack of generally recognised means for high-confidence attribution of cyberattacks remains a critical barrier to achieving deterrence of hostile cyber actions. If an attacker is confident that it cannot be identified, it will not be deterred by threats of retaliation by its target. Even where attribution can proceed, timeliness is a major problem, as a cyber-attacking state has various means to obfuscate its involvement and place in the path of investigators obstacles that take time to overcome. This problem can likely be mitigated with heavy investments in international law enforcement capabilities and coordination; however, even with such investments, there will likely remain some persistent level of attacks that cannot be attributed in time for a meaningful response.\nEven when a state can trace an attack to its origin, further difficulties arise. Disclosure of the fact of attribution can prompt an adversary to change its methods and render the technique for detection and attribution obsolete. Failure to disclose the full grounds for an accusation (for instance, sources, methods) can lead to questioning the motives and authenticity of attribution, but such full disclosure might compromise sensitive or classified information. Some balance must be struck. In the recent attribution to Russia of interference in the 2016 United States presidential election, the approach was taken of issuing a statement on the attribution conclusion together with some generally recognised and publicly available specific evidence, some newly declassified information, and some indication that other classified sources were used (Office of the Director of National Intelligence 2017). States would likely benefit from establishing disclosure policies in anticipation\nJournal of Information Warfare\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\nof this need for public assessments of state responsibility for cyberattacks, rather than to scramble and grapple with these questions reactively or repeatedly.\n## Tool 5 – Declaration of planned retaliatory measures\nRetaliation has been a principal focus of deterrence theory for centuries, and deterrence through the threat of punishment will remain a key factor in cyber space. Specific retaliatory measures are explored in greater detail under tools 6 through 10. When a state declares planned retaliation, threatened retaliatory measures must be linked to the declaring state’s capabilities to be credible and must hold at risk something the adversary values enough to likely outweigh the benefit the adversary hopes to gain through the attack. Where possible, to reinforce the credibility of the declared threat, the state threatening retaliation should exercise or otherwise display these measures to demonstrate capability and readiness.\n## Tool 6 – Public attribution, stigma\nWhen states can attribute cyberattacks against them with a high degree of confidence, they can publicly expose and condemn the perpetrators. By publicly identifying aggressors who commit hostile cyber actions, states can build international coalitions against the aggressors and their behaviour. For example, the Obama Administration publicly accused North Korea of an attack on Sony Corporation (White House 2014). This public condemnation supported international efforts to tighten sanctions on North Korea. This ‘naming and shaming’ tactic has been executed in several other instances, notably in response to Russia’s aggressive conduct during and after 2014, which has proved instrumental in securing and then maintaining the European Union’s broad and punishing sanctions regime (White House 2016; US Department of Justice 2014). Such denunciations can have cascading effects: damaging an attacking state’s reputation, limiting its ability to bargain and persuade, helping to sway general opinion against the state and the offending conduct, and hastening the formation of coalitions to counteract such aggression. Such statements can also contribute to the development of customary international law against cyberattacks.\n## Tool 7 – Enhanced, coordinated use of national criminal laws\nGiven the difficulty of attributing hostile cyber acts to states, one alternative to directly invoking or proving state responsibility is to deter the individual actors upon which states must rely to execute attacks. The acts comprising hostile cyber actions typically constitute generally recognised cybercrimes under national criminal laws; hence, the individuals who perpetrate the acts can be prosecuted for crimes (when states do not invoke sovereign immunity, see below) (Council of Europe 2004). By implementing and enforcing strong cybercrime laws in concert with their overall national defence and deterrence postures, states might deter the individuals who act on behalf of states in cyberspace and, by extension, the states themselves. As an example of this type of approach, the United States recently invoked its primary federal computer crime statutes to indict Russian Federal Security Service officers and criminal conspirators in connection with the hacking of Yahoo email accounts, which allegedly included email accounts for United States and Russian government officials (US Department of Justice 2017); similar indictments have been issued in response to prominent cases of Chinese-government-sponsored cyber intrusions (US Department of Justice 2014).\nJournal of Information Warfare\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\nSimply indicting foreign nationals for crimes can be ineffective if the indicting state lacks immediate physical jurisdiction over the accused. To assist in the apprehension of criminals and in investigation and prosecution of cybercrime, states often rely on mutual legal assistance treaties, extradition treaties, and other frameworks for coordinating and facilitating international criminal prosecution (Council of Europe 2017). States can leverage such international architecture to enhance deterrence against would-be state proxy cybercriminals. When obtaining physical jurisdiction is unlikely (for example, when a criminal actor is in a state unwilling or unable to cooperate in a prosecution), states can arrange forfeiture (confiscation) of instrumentalities and proceeds of crime or even criminals’ assets located in states that will cooperate. International arrest warrants can significantly constrain criminals’ freedom to travel. Such measures may substantially degrade the ability of states to recruit proxies to carry out acts of cyber aggression.\nStates could develop credible and consistent cybercrime prosecution policies to serve national security interests. Investigative and prosecutorial independence is important for ensuring public trust in law enforcement agencies and is best preserved when prosecutors publicly establish their own prioritisation of policies beforehand, rather than appearing to react to events that might be politically charged. The United States, for instance, has in the past established clear prosecutorial policies on such matters as counterterrorism and transnational organised crime (Presidential Archives 2011). A similar approach could be developed and applied for likely state hostile cyber actions.\nA strong national criminal law approach offers one additional benefit: it places pressure on the criminals and states to assert sovereign immunity for protection (US Department of State 2017). Such assertions may substantially aid in making the case for a state’s responsibility for the cyber-attack in question.\n## Tool 8 – International sanctions\nAmong tools for coercion and retaliation, economic sanctions have significantly increased in prominence over the last three decades. The U.S. president, for example, has considerable powers, both inherent and legislatively authorised, to unilaterally impose sanctions at various levels against various subjects, from natural and juridical persons, to economic sectors, to countries. While comprehensive overviews of sanctions powers have been produced by numerous authors, for example, Corn, Gurule &amp; Kahn (2016), these sanctions powers can be deployed in a tailored cyber deterrence framework. The basic concept is the same as that already described for deterrence generally: a state would signal that it is willing to bring its sanctions powers to bear in response to certain serious hostile cyber actions in a manner that would target what potential adversaries value and sketch elements of how a response would proceed in such a way as to make the threat credible.\nRecent history indicates that sanctions can be made more effective in certain circumstances . In considering use of sanctions to retaliate or deter hostile cyber actions, states should consider the following:\n- Sanctions are likely to be more effective tools of deterrence when they have a relatively broad scope (the sanctioned actors cannot simply reregister under a new corporate name and continue operating as they previously had been) and have multilateral participation.\n- The more robust the evidence in demonstrating an actor has carried out a particular series\nJournal of Information Warfare\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\nof hostile cyber actions, the more likely the international community is to join a multilateral sanctions regime.\n- Sanctions have more impact against states with at least moderately effective channels for influence by the general population of a country over its government and where the target country has a relatively vulnerable, export-oriented economy.\n- Sanctions are more likely to be effective when accompanied by a comprehensive negotiation strategy coupled with other tools of pressure and influence, such as diplomatic engagement of all stakeholders and the targeted and complementary deployment of hard power.\n# Tool 9 – Loud cyber responses\nIn contrast to most cyber activity in which stealth is paramount, ‘loud’ cyber retaliations deliberately broadcast their presence and origin. A loud cyberattack leaves no question as to its perpetrator and is intended to be as much communication as attack. Such actions can be undertaken publicly or tailored for notice by a specific agency or leader. Loud attacks might be undertaken in response to other cyber acts to demonstrate the state is aware of the adversary’s cyber action and to serve as a warning to cease and desist . Where such retaliations are open, this enhances general deterrence and demonstrates resolve to respond.\n# Tool 10 – Kinetic response\nThe United States has issued statements that it reserves the right to respond to cyberattacks using appropriate, proportionate kinetic force (Department of Defense 2011). Such attacks are authorised under international law in only very specific circumstances and otherwise might constitute a serious breach of international law, potentially including the international crime of aggression. States should likely refrain from undertaking this type of response to a cyberattack unless they have supreme confidence in the attribution of the attack. Considering the risk involved, the threshold of seriousness for a cyberattack to merit a kinetic response would likely also be quite high, such as causing loss of life.\n# Tool 11 – International partnership and collaboration\nStates can significantly enhance the effectiveness of their cyber deterrence postures by leveraging alliances and international institutions. One of the strongest elements of United-States-backed deterrence in the Cold War was the establishment and maintenance of largely unified international blocs, underpinned by principles of free trade, democratic values, and mutual defence (for example, Holbrooke 1995; Murphy 2016). These included the mutual defence arrangements with Europe via NATO as well as with Japan and the Republic of Korea. Some argue it would not have been possible without the high degree of complementary economic and political cooperation engendered in such institutions as the European Community (and then European Union), the Council of Europe, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and bilateral arrangements with Japan and Korea . This web of strong alliances and interlinkages amplified adversaries’ perceptions that there would be consequences for aggressive conduct and that they would be serious. It is likely no accident that a focus of recent Russian cyber disinformation campaigns appears to have been to stoke nationalist sentiment in United States’ allies and to foment cynicism about and scepticism toward international institutions, particularly the European Union (Office of the Director of National Security 2017). A logical countermeasure to present-day cyber\nJournal of Information Warfare\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\naggression, therefore, would be to reinvest in these institutions and integrate into them robust counter-cyber arrangements and capabilities. Wherever feasible, the United States should look to undertake its cyber deterrence actions together with allies, which will both isolate and increase the costs for would-be adversaries.\n## Tool 12 – Treaties and arms control\nWhile a set of credible hard power policies and capabilities would likely serve as the foundation for managing cyber conflict, mutually agreed-upon norms and rules can solidify and reinforce a deterrence framework to achieve greater stability. Numerous treaties, agreements, and international norms have reinforced deterrence and enhanced international stability with respect to other types of forces in certain contexts, particularly during the Cold War. The next section further elaborates this concept and explores potential applications of this tool.\n## Promoting Cyber Stability: Prior Principles, Future Applications\nIn view of the arguably constructive role that arms control frameworks played in reinforcing deterrence and stability during the Cold War noted above, the authors conducted a systematic analysis of several arms control or stabilising regimes with the potential to offer lessons for managing cyber conflict. They found that, given the differences between the cyber and kinetic realms, no single past arms control treaty regime offers a singularly strong analogue for regulating hostile cyber activities. Nonetheless, numerous distinct principles from past treaty regimes have the potential to be applied to regulate state hostile cyber actions. These are presented below.\n## Cross-applicability of prior treaty principles to cyber conflict\nSeveral arms control and stabilising treaty regimes were analysed to assess their potential cross-applicability to managing cyber conflict . Regimes were selected for analysis if they were considered to have worked in terms of stabilising nuclear arms races; to have dealt with categories of arms (such as chemical and biological weapons or piracy) that seemed analogous in some regard to cyber weaponry in their verification and monitoring challenges; to have regulated issues relevant to hostile cyber activity such as incident prevention, escalation management, and reducing disinformation; and/or to have regulated state behaviour in ungoverned or poorly governed spaces. The specific regimes analysed are presented below. The discussion includes a brief summary of the study's findings with respect to the principles employed in each regime and their potential for cross-applicability in the cyber realm.\n- The Strategic Arms Limitation and Reduction Treaties (SALT, ABM, and START) helped to regulate the nuclear arms race, but have limited applicability as a model for cyber stability given their emphasis on numerical limitations of warheads and delivery vehicles, verification through inspection, and reliance on a bipolar structure of international relations. Nevertheless, some verification modalities applied in these treaties might be incorporated in a cyber control regime, such as managed access where verification inspectors could have tightly controlled access to sites, and information barriers that could facilitate international information sharing and cooperation on attack attribution (US Department of State 1972c; 1972d; 1979; 1991; 1993b; 2002; 2011).\n- The Nuclear Test Ban Treaties lack a direct analogue to the cyber realm, as there is no\nJournal of Information Warfare\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\nequivalent, verifiable way to limit testing of a cyber weapon. However, these treaties demonstrate both a path for establishing multilateral norms against unacceptable state behaviour as well as multilateral technical forensic approaches to verification (vested in the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization's International Monitoring System) that may have potential to be cross-applied to the cyber realm. Additionally, information exchanges like those used in nuclear test ban treaties, if applied to cyber capabilities, might help to ease the secrecy that currently exacerbates cyber conflict (US Department of State 1963; 1974; 1996).\n- The Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) and the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) have various shared aspects that have strong potential applicability in managing cyber conflict. They establish open-ended definitions for the weaponry they control, with analysis of prohibition often hinging on state intent. This approach is potentially highly applicable to regulating cyber conflict as cyber weaponry is highly context-dependent, and its attributes cannot be definitively described. The conventions' definitions of prohibited items in terms of state intent, internationalised post-incident investigations of alleged violations, and use of confidence-building measures may offer useful analogues for promoting stability in the cyber realm (US Department of State 1972b; 1993a).\n- United States-Soviet Union Incidents at Sea Agreement has limited application in cyber stability, in part due to differences between the nature of international waters (where no state has jurisdiction) and cyber infrastructure (where different states have jurisdiction over various elements). However, the Incidents at Sea Agreement defined and prohibited a set of actions and manoeuvres that the parties jointly understood presented risks of accident, misinterpretation, and unintended escalation. A treaty regime employing similar principles might be useful in the cyber realm (US Department of State 1972a).\n- The Helsinki Process demonstrated how a sufficiently broad negotiations framework (covering territorial disputes, political-military relations, trade, and human rights) can yield breakthroughs. The human rights aspects of that framework additionally helped to dispel propaganda and disinformation, which have renewed relevance today. The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, a product of the Helsinki Process, now has a dedicated cyber security branch that might be expanded or used as a model for a multilateral cyber security forum (Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe 2017).\n- The History of Regulation of Piracy and Privateering demonstrates that international agreements which expedite criminal prosecution of state proxies and individual criminals have some potential to contribute to deterrence of hostile state cyber actions; however, historical analysis suggests the salient factors contributing to agreements in these areas are not strongly analogous to present-day cyber conflict (for example, Egloff 2015; UN Convention 1982; Guilfoyle 2014).\nFigure 2, below, indicates the types of agreement attributes found in the various treaties and regimes the authors reviewed. The attributes include whether the treaty was bilateral or multilateral; banned types of weapons or placed numerical limits on weapons or delivery systems; limited certain types of destabilising actions and declared that such actions, if taken in violation of the treaty, could be reasonably interpreted by other parties as acts of aggression; required declaration of an accountable number of arms; had verification measures through inspections or of suspected violations; limited tests of specific types of weapons; established communication and informa\nJournal of Information Warfare\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\ntion-sharing mechanisms; established confidence-building measures; facilitated criminal prosecution; or allowed certain types of materials/activities so long as there was no indication that the state intended to use those materials/activities for prohibited purposes. Where an item on this list was not a feature of a treaty, it was left blank. Where an item on this list was a feature of the treaty, it was marked in the corresponding column, either as a concept assessed as applicable to cyber conflict or not believed applicable. Patterns emerged about the types of attributes in a treaty that might be useful for cyber stability.\nFigure 2: Summary of findings on applicability of prior treaty regimes and instruments to managing cyber conflict Application of treaty-derived principles in a notional regime for managing cyber conflict Based on the analyses of these treaties, the principles highlighted above might notionally be applied in an agreed framework for managing cyber conflict.\n- Given the difficulties of meaningfully defining, describing, disclosing, accounting, or verifying cyber weaponry, states should eschew a cyber-weapons-focused approach.\n- States should focus on defining a set of prohibited conduct, likely actions that present either\nJournal of Information Warfare\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\nrisks to civilian populations or special risks of provocation or conflict escalation.\n- States could make a binding commitment not to engage in attacks against other states’ critical infrastructure, consistent with emerging consensus positions of the Group of Government Experts, or against certain sensitive defence-related facilities or armed forces, like the escalation-avoidance framework of the Incidents at Sea Agreement.\n- States could vest a shared function for verifying compliance with this prohibition in a neutral international body like the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons or the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization, which could emphasise technical attribution forensics.\n- If a state declares it has been the victim of a treaty-prohibited attack, to allow for more effective forensic attribution, the victim state(s) would be subject to commitments to provide certain onsite access and share certain information with this verification body.\n- The scope of access could be subject to certain managed access or information barrier modalities to ensure the protection of sensitive information, like the various treaty regimes with onsite verification.\n- Like the Budapest Convention, participating states could be affirmatively obligated to render assistance in forensic verification and attribution investigations, for instance in designating central authorities for interfacing on investigations, preserving computer data, and the like. These might offer means to enhance both state participation in such a regime as well as the effectiveness of attribution that it could achieve.\n- Such a regime might be bolstered by vesting additional functions in the verification body, such as a forum for transparency, confidence-building measures, and technical exchanges.\nFurther technical and institutional options for international cooperation on the attribution of hostile cyber actions could be a valuable topic for future research.\n## Conclusion\nWeaponisation of the cyber realm is already undermining international cyber stability. Nevertheless, states have a variety of tools available to deter hostile cyber actions and increase stability. Though neither 20th century deterrence nor historic arms control approaches offer simple, direct analogues for cyber stability, various elements from these areas, particularly when synthesised, offer considerable potential for managing cyber conflict. States should carefully consider their potential adversaries, their desired outcomes, and the tools at their disposal to impose operational, retaliatory, and normative and reputational costs against their adversaries. In addition, detailed analysis of prior arms control and stabilising treaty regimes demonstrates there are several principles having considerable potential to be cross-applied to manage cyber conflict.",

Based on an analysis of deterrence theory and application and prior arms control regimes, the study presents a toolkit of policies and actions for national governments based on elements of deterrence and arms control that analysis demonstrates are potentially applicable to cyber conflict. The study illustrates how these could be prospectively applied in a treaty framework to facilitate attribution of hostile cyber actions.\nKeywords: Cyber Deterrence, Cyber Stability, Cyber Conflict, Strategic Stability, Arms Control, Strategic Deterrence\n# Introduction\nThroughout the latter half of the 20th century, deterrence and arms control served as pillars of strategic stability between the nuclear superpowers. As the 21st century proceeds, however, the emergence of cyber conflict has gradually but steadily undermined that equilibrium. Challenges in policing malicious cyber activity, obfuscation, and uncertainty of consequences in the cyber realm embolden states to test boundaries with ever more aggressive actions. While modern state cyber conflict is markedly different from the Cold War, traditional deterrence theory and international agreements to reduce the potential for conflict from that era offer various lessons that can be applied to manage cyber conflict.\nThe section below titled \"Defining Deterrence, Cyber Deterrence, and Cyber Stability\" explains the difference between traditional or kinetic conflict and cyber conflict; and defines the crucial concepts of cyber deterrence and cyber stability, including their relevance to international stability. The \"Promoting Cyber Deterrence\" section explores how states could adopt deterrence concepts developed under traditional deterrence theory and apply them in the cyber realm, including the use of international agreements and arms control regimes. The \"Promoting Cyber Stability\" sec\nJournal of Information Warfare (2019) 18.3: 53-69\nISSN 1445-3312 Print/ISSN 1445-3347 Online\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\ntion more closely examines those various agreements and regimes to see which elements might be applicable to cyber deterrence and stability. The final section concludes that while cyber and kinetic warfare—and the means for deterring them—differ, Cold War deterrence and arms control, viewed through an appropriate analytic prism, can nonetheless assist in constructing meaningful paradigms for achieving cyber deterrence and stability.\n## Defining Deterrence, Cyber Deterrence, and Cyber Stability\nHistorically, states waged wars with the expectation that the spoils of victory would outweigh the costs, but nuclear weapons fundamentally altered that expectation. The unprecedented destructive potential of nuclear weapons compelled states to focus on preventing conflict before it started, which they achieved in part through deterrence, by creating a threshold of conflict that no one dared cross. The emergence of the cyber domain and cyber operations presents a concerning new pathway for conflict and escalation, threatening anything that relies on computers, which are now ubiquitous. Particularly considering the seriousness of recent hostile state cyber operations against one another, understanding whether and how deterrence might be meaningfully applied to prevent such escalation is an urgent task (Goychayev et al. 2017, at 1.17). This section briefly explains what deterrence is, particularly as it applied during the Cold War, then defines cyber deterrence and cyber stability. Next, this section examines how hostile cyber actions differ from kinetic warfare, which makes it difficult to apply traditional deterrence theory. The \"Promoting Cyber Deterrence\" and \"Promoting Cyber Stability\" sections apply deterrence theory and international arms control concepts to the cyber realm.\nTo illustrate deterrence, Henry Kissinger developed this equation:\n$$\nD = C \\times R \\times B\n$$\nDeterrence (D) is the product of the capability (C) of the deterring party to carry out a threatened act, multiplied by the resolve (R) of the deterring party to carry out the act, multiplied by the belief (B) of the party to be deterred that the deterring party will carry out the threatened act. If capability, resolve, or belief is ever zero, then the deterrence value is also zero; and, thus, deterrence will have failed (Kissinger 1961). Capability refers to the technical ability to act—that is, does the deterring party have the weapons, infrastructure, and delivery systems to carry out the promised retaliation? Resolve is whether the deterring party would be willing to carry out the threat. Belief refers to whether the adversary finds the threat from the deterring party credible, including the technical ability and willingness to act (Kissinger 1961).\nTo deter malicious actions, a state must ensure that any would-be attacker believes that the costs of the attack will likely outweigh the benefits. This posture can be achieved through demonstrating to an adversary that its attacks are unlikely to achieve its objectives, or that the consequences for an attack (even a failed one) will be unacceptably high. Figure 1 illustrates a successful cyber deterrence posture, where the adversary's perceived cost of undertaking a hostile cyber action outweighs its perceived benefit. The components of that representation are determined through an examination of their potential implementation in a coherent cyber deterrence policy.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\nFigure 1: Visualisation of successful cyber deterrence: A theoretical model (Goychayev et al. 2017, at 1.52)\n# Defining Cyber Hostile Actions, Cyber Deterrence, and Cyber Stability\nThis paper adopts the premise that the law of armed conflict has thus far proved of limited use in regulating hostile state cyber actions, so does not treat the law of armed conflict in detail. The threshold for its application, that of an 'armed attack' (for example, Koh 2012; Schmitt 2017), has arisen rarely and, in any case, states have proven reluctant to recognise cyber acts giving rise to hostilities or constituting aggression in the traditional meanings of those terms. At the same time, states have regularly engaged and continue to engage in a wide variety of concerning, hostile conduct with serious, albeit generally non-kinetic, consequences, with potential to set states on an escalatory path that could spill over into kinetic conflict (Department of Defense 2018). The terms 'cyberattack' relative to 'armed attack' are understood in international law, so this study instead focuses on a broad spectrum of lower-order conduct 'hostile cyber actions', which may be defined as \"cyber attack, use or deployment of cyber weaponry, cyber espionage, or cyber information warfare operations directed against a state, its nationals, or its interests, typically by another state or at another state's direction\" (Goychayev et al. 2017, at A.3).\nThis study defined the concept of 'cyber deterrence' as a set of conditions under which a state communicates, either explicitly or implicitly, a credible intention and capability to accurately attribute and impose substantial consequences for certain hostile cyber actions directed against it, and that communication dissuades other actors from undertaking such actions (Goychayev et al. 2017, at A.2). While Cold War deterrence and cyber deterrence have in common a basic emphasis\nJournal of Information Warfare\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\non cost-benefit calculus, effective deterrence of hostile cyber actions is likely to assume different forms than nuclear or conventional deterrence in the Cold War, as will be explained in greater detail below. ‘Cyber stability’ describes relations between states characterised by the absence of serious hostile cyber actions against one another, where the states have a sufficient common understanding of each other’s capabilities and intentions so as to be inclined generally to avoid such actions, likely associated with a common belief that the costs of such conduct would outweigh the benefits (Goychayev et al. 2017, at 3.16).\n## Cold War Deterrence versus Cyber Deterrence\nTraditional deterrence theory does not translate smoothly or simply to cyber conflict, given how cyber conflict differs from its conventional and nuclear counterparts. Cold-War-type deterrence generally applied (and applies) to extremely costly, high-consequence scenarios (such as nuclear or large-scale conventional war between the superpowers) with relatively high general confidence of attribution and capabilities for retaliation that were relatively well-known among the competing adversaries. By contrast, countries usually do not display or publicly test their cyber weapons, as doing so would give adversaries opportunities to develop countermeasures that would render the weapons ineffectual. In addition, the cost of cyber conflict is typically significantly lower than the costs of establishing, maintaining, or using kinetic forces (Clapper 2016). The consequences of cyberattacks can vary from negligible to severe, but most cases do not result in physical injury, loss of life, or destruction of property (and do not inherently present that risk in any way comparable to nuclear weapons or large-scale conventional forces). Finally, states can frequently obscure their involvement in hostile cyber actions through various techniques, such as masking the point of origin or generating false signature data. Cyber conflict, thus, differs from Cold War competition in part because it offers a low-cost, potentially low-consequence, and often non-attributable means for weakening an adversary. These differing cost-benefit outlooks presumably help to explain the relative frequencies of the different types of attacks. Nevertheless, applications of specific concepts from Cold War deterrence and stabilising frameworks can be applied to the cyber realm.\n## Promoting Cyber Deterrence: A Technical and Policy Toolkit\nThis section summarises tools available to states to achieve cyber deterrence and promote cyber stability. Some tools are based on 20th-century arms control and deterrence concepts, while others are not (Goychayev et al. 2017, at 1.60). As an overarching framework, considering the polycentric threat environment that states confront in the cyber realm (in contrast to the bipolar environment of the Cold War), states would be better served to adopt ‘tailored deterrence’ postures; that is, they should adopt deterrence strategies tailored to the specific states (or sets of states) and actions they seek to deter. States must consider that their adversaries have varying vulnerabilities, capabilities, and intentions, and will respond to stimuli accordingly. For example, what motivates actors in more open, pluralistic states will differ from what motivates actors in more closed, authoritarian ones. Further, states reliant on cyberspace are different from states lacking widespread Internet penetration and adoption, or where these are rigidly monitored and controlled by the state. Based on that tailored assessment, states should apply a selection of appropriate deterrence tools. An effective deterrence policy will likely not be limited to actions in the cyber realm but will rely on a coherent, coordinated application of a variety of tools at a state’s disposal.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\n# Tool 1 – Enhanced, active defence\nTo help deter would-be cyber adversaries, states could improve the cyber security posture of their critical systems and infrastructure. The better protected a target, the costlier it is to attack and the less attractive it becomes. One way to improve defence could be to expand efforts within the government and the technology industry to establish a system and network architectures that incorporate appropriate security considerations. Defensible architectures present a smaller attack surface, limit the access of an attacker who does manage to infiltrate, and can operate despite interference or damage. This defence effort simultaneously lessens the impact of a successful attack while increasing the cost to accomplish it. Laudable efforts along these lines include the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework and associated documents (NIST 2014).\nStates could undertake educational campaigns both to teach technology users about cyber threats and to groom the next generation of cyber security experts. In addition, states could seek to implement systems that incorporate more active defence and security measures. Architectures and processes could be put in place to actively interrogate systems to ensure that performance and functionality are uncompromised, proper, and authentic. Further, states could adopt strategies and develop capabilities to discover, define, analyse, and mitigate cyber threats and vulnerabilities in a more real-time mode, and direct these capabilities to defend critical infrastructure or other national security assets (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency 2018; Denning &amp; Strawser 2017).\n# Tool 2 – Resilience, reconstitution\nBuilding resilient systems that may succumb to attacks but can quickly be reconstituted and at little cost represents another paradigm for reducing the perceived potential benefits the adversary would gain from carrying out attacks. States could consider establishing or adopting standards for system architecture related to recovery and reconstitution. Innovative technological research and development to improve cyber defences and critical infrastructure resilience could have a deterrent effect as well. Microgrid technology, for example, could be helpful in bolstering resiliency by decentralising electricity generation and transmission, and dispersing accompanying risks (U.S. Department of Energy website 2017).\n# Tool 3 – Declarations of thresholds for action, reaction\nA low-cost step states can take to promote cyber stability is to unilaterally declare types of cyberattacks that will trigger their response and, in general terms, the spectrum of activities the response will entail. For example, President Obama’s Executive Order 13694 (2015) clearly delineated what malicious cyber acts the United States perceives as threats to national security, including attacks against critical infrastructure. States participating in the United Nation’s 2015 Group of Government Experts similarly recommend that states cooperate to prevent harmful information and communication technology practices and that states should not conduct or support such activity that damages or impairs critical infrastructure (United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research 2016). Clear statements about what are unacceptable targets of hostile cyber acts such as these indicate that states will view these types of activities as very grave. States could be even more explicit, though. For example, a state could issue public and private statements about what specific cyber acts by specific countries will prompt a response. In July 2016, the North Atlantic\nJournal of Information Warfare\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\nTreaty Organization (NATO) recognised cyberspace “as a domain of operations in which NATO must defend itself as effectively as it does in the air, on land, and at sea” (NATO 2016). It remains unclear how individual member states will respond to specific acts of cyber aggression against NATO allies. The United States has indicated it is concerned with protecting its allies from cyber aggression (Executive Order 13694 2015, at 152). Clearer communication by a country about its perception of and likely responses to threats could also reduce risks of miscalculation and escalation. Similarly, states could clarify their positions on cyber norms and possible responses to specific adversaries using direct, private communications, which might allow a message to be tailored more specifically and effectively for the states in question.\n## Tool 4 – Improving detection and attribution capabilities\nDetection of an attack is essential for attribution and retaliation. In contrast to a typical kinetic attack, malicious cyberattacks might not be detected until after they have been initiated or completed. Improving detection of cyberattacks could, therefore, enhance deterrence but presents a formidable challenge. While in kinetic war, there are robust early warning systems and clear evidence of attack (for example, bullet holes or bomb craters), there is no obvious analogue for many types of hostile cyber acts. The variety of malicious cyberattack vectors is tremendous and growing at a rapid pace together with technology, making attacks hard to predict and difficult to identify. One of the most reliable forms of cyberattack detection is reports of attacks by victims, but victims such as large financial institutions, hospitals, or power companies are often hesitant to report attacks due to fears they might trigger adverse liability rules or suffer reputational harm. Streamlining the means for victims to report attacks to authorities, perhaps with enhanced confidentiality or leniency for the victims’ liability, could incentivise more thorough and timely reporting. Detection can also be facilitated by active monitoring of known hostile actors.\nIn addition, the lack of generally recognised means for high-confidence attribution of cyberattacks remains a critical barrier to achieving deterrence of hostile cyber actions. If an attacker is confident that it cannot be identified, it will not be deterred by threats of retaliation by its target. Even where attribution can proceed, timeliness is a major problem, as a cyber-attacking state has various means to obfuscate its involvement and place in the path of investigators obstacles that take time to overcome. This problem can likely be mitigated with heavy investments in international law enforcement capabilities and coordination; however, even with such investments, there will likely remain some persistent level of attacks that cannot be attributed in time for a meaningful response.\nEven when a state can trace an attack to its origin, further difficulties arise. Disclosure of the fact of attribution can prompt an adversary to change its methods and render the technique for detection and attribution obsolete. Failure to disclose the full grounds for an accusation (for instance, sources, methods) can lead to questioning the motives and authenticity of attribution, but such full disclosure might compromise sensitive or classified information. Some balance must be struck. In the recent attribution to Russia of interference in the 2016 United States presidential election, the approach was taken of issuing a statement on the attribution conclusion together with some generally recognised and publicly available specific evidence, some newly declassified information, and some indication that other classified sources were used (Office of the Director of National Intelligence 2017). States would likely benefit from establishing disclosure policies in anticipation\nJournal of Information Warfare\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\nof this need for public assessments of state responsibility for cyberattacks, rather than to scramble and grapple with these questions reactively or repeatedly.\n## Tool 5 – Declaration of planned retaliatory measures\nRetaliation has been a principal focus of deterrence theory for centuries, and deterrence through the threat of punishment will remain a key factor in cyber space. Specific retaliatory measures are explored in greater detail under tools 6 through 10. When a state declares planned retaliation, threatened retaliatory measures must be linked to the declaring state’s capabilities to be credible and must hold at risk something the adversary values enough to likely outweigh the benefit the adversary hopes to gain through the attack. Where possible, to reinforce the credibility of the declared threat, the state threatening retaliation should exercise or otherwise display these measures to demonstrate capability and readiness.\n## Tool 6 – Public attribution, stigma\nWhen states can attribute cyberattacks against them with a high degree of confidence, they can publicly expose and condemn the perpetrators. By publicly identifying aggressors who commit hostile cyber actions, states can build international coalitions against the aggressors and their behaviour. For example, the Obama Administration publicly accused North Korea of an attack on Sony Corporation (White House 2014). This public condemnation supported international efforts to tighten sanctions on North Korea. This ‘naming and shaming’ tactic has been executed in several other instances, notably in response to Russia’s aggressive conduct during and after 2014, which has proved instrumental in securing and then maintaining the European Union’s broad and punishing sanctions regime (White House 2016; US Department of Justice 2014). Such denunciations can have cascading effects: damaging an attacking state’s reputation, limiting its ability to bargain and persuade, helping to sway general opinion against the state and the offending conduct, and hastening the formation of coalitions to counteract such aggression. Such statements can also contribute to the development of customary international law against cyberattacks.\n## Tool 7 – Enhanced, coordinated use of national criminal laws\nGiven the difficulty of attributing hostile cyber acts to states, one alternative to directly invoking or proving state responsibility is to deter the individual actors upon which states must rely to execute attacks. The acts comprising hostile cyber actions typically constitute generally recognised cybercrimes under national criminal laws; hence, the individuals who perpetrate the acts can be prosecuted for crimes (when states do not invoke sovereign immunity, see below) (Council of Europe 2004). By implementing and enforcing strong cybercrime laws in concert with their overall national defence and deterrence postures, states might deter the individuals who act on behalf of states in cyberspace and, by extension, the states themselves. As an example of this type of approach, the United States recently invoked its primary federal computer crime statutes to indict Russian Federal Security Service officers and criminal conspirators in connection with the hacking of Yahoo email accounts, which allegedly included email accounts for United States and Russian government officials (US Department of Justice 2017); similar indictments have been issued in response to prominent cases of Chinese-government-sponsored cyber intrusions (US Department of Justice 2014).\nJournal of Information Warfare\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\nSimply indicting foreign nationals for crimes can be ineffective if the indicting state lacks immediate physical jurisdiction over the accused. To assist in the apprehension of criminals and in investigation and prosecution of cybercrime, states often rely on mutual legal assistance treaties, extradition treaties, and other frameworks for coordinating and facilitating international criminal prosecution (Council of Europe 2017). States can leverage such international architecture to enhance deterrence against would-be state proxy cybercriminals. When obtaining physical jurisdiction is unlikely (for example, when a criminal actor is in a state unwilling or unable to cooperate in a prosecution), states can arrange forfeiture (confiscation) of instrumentalities and proceeds of crime or even criminals’ assets located in states that will cooperate. International arrest warrants can significantly constrain criminals’ freedom to travel. Such measures may substantially degrade the ability of states to recruit proxies to carry out acts of cyber aggression.\nStates could develop credible and consistent cybercrime prosecution policies to serve national security interests. Investigative and prosecutorial independence is important for ensuring public trust in law enforcement agencies and is best preserved when prosecutors publicly establish their own prioritisation of policies beforehand, rather than appearing to react to events that might be politically charged. The United States, for instance, has in the past established clear prosecutorial policies on such matters as counterterrorism and transnational organised crime (Presidential Archives 2011). A similar approach could be developed and applied for likely state hostile cyber actions.\nA strong national criminal law approach offers one additional benefit: it places pressure on the criminals and states to assert sovereign immunity for protection (US Department of State 2017). Such assertions may substantially aid in making the case for a state’s responsibility for the cyber-attack in question.\n## Tool 8 – International sanctions\nAmong tools for coercion and retaliation, economic sanctions have significantly increased in prominence over the last three decades. The U.S. president, for example, has considerable powers, both inherent and legislatively authorised, to unilaterally impose sanctions at various levels against various subjects, from natural and juridical persons, to economic sectors, to countries. While comprehensive overviews of sanctions powers have been produced by numerous authors, for example, Corn, Gurule &amp; Kahn (2016), these sanctions powers can be deployed in a tailored cyber deterrence framework. The basic concept is the same as that already described for deterrence generally: a state would signal that it is willing to bring its sanctions powers to bear in response to certain serious hostile cyber actions in a manner that would target what potential adversaries value and sketch elements of how a response would proceed in such a way as to make the threat credible.\nRecent history indicates that sanctions can be made more effective in certain circumstances (Goychayev et al. 2017, at 8.67-68). In considering use of sanctions to retaliate or deter hostile cyber actions, states should consider the following:\n- Sanctions are likely to be more effective tools of deterrence when they have a relatively broad scope (the sanctioned actors cannot simply reregister under a new corporate name and continue operating as they previously had been) and have multilateral participation.\n- The more robust the evidence in demonstrating an actor has carried out a particular series\nJournal of Information Warfare\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\nof hostile cyber actions, the more likely the international community is to join a multilateral sanctions regime.\n- Sanctions have more impact against states with at least moderately effective channels for influence by the general population of a country over its government and where the target country has a relatively vulnerable, export-oriented economy.\n- Sanctions are more likely to be effective when accompanied by a comprehensive negotiation strategy coupled with other tools of pressure and influence, such as diplomatic engagement of all stakeholders and the targeted and complementary deployment of hard power.\n# Tool 9 – Loud cyber responses\nIn contrast to most cyber activity in which stealth is paramount, ‘loud’ cyber retaliations deliberately broadcast their presence and origin. A loud cyberattack leaves no question as to its perpetrator and is intended to be as much communication as attack. Such actions can be undertaken publicly or tailored for notice by a specific agency or leader. Loud attacks might be undertaken in response to other cyber acts to demonstrate the state is aware of the adversary’s cyber action and to serve as a warning to cease and desist (Goychayev et al. 2017, p. 1.68). Where such retaliations are open, this enhances general deterrence and demonstrates resolve to respond.\n# Tool 10 – Kinetic response\nThe United States has issued statements that it reserves the right to respond to cyberattacks using appropriate, proportionate kinetic force (Department of Defense 2011). Such attacks are authorised under international law in only very specific circumstances and otherwise might constitute a serious breach of international law, potentially including the international crime of aggression. States should likely refrain from undertaking this type of response to a cyberattack unless they have supreme confidence in the attribution of the attack. Considering the risk involved, the threshold of seriousness for a cyberattack to merit a kinetic response would likely also be quite high, such as causing loss of life.\n# Tool 11 – International partnership and collaboration\nStates can significantly enhance the effectiveness of their cyber deterrence postures by leveraging alliances and international institutions. One of the strongest elements of United-States-backed deterrence in the Cold War was the establishment and maintenance of largely unified international blocs, underpinned by principles of free trade, democratic values, and mutual defence (for example, Holbrooke 1995; Murphy 2016). These included the mutual defence arrangements with Europe via NATO as well as with Japan and the Republic of Korea. Some argue it would not have been possible without the high degree of complementary economic and political cooperation engendered in such institutions as the European Community (and then European Union), the Council of Europe, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and bilateral arrangements with Japan and Korea (Holbrooke 1995). This web of strong alliances and interlinkages amplified adversaries’ perceptions that there would be consequences for aggressive conduct and that they would be serious. It is likely no accident that a focus of recent Russian cyber disinformation campaigns appears to have been to stoke nationalist sentiment in United States’ allies and to foment cynicism about and scepticism toward international institutions, particularly the European Union (Office of the Director of National Security 2017). A logical countermeasure to present-day cyber\nJournal of Information Warfare\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\naggression, therefore, would be to reinvest in these institutions and integrate into them robust counter-cyber arrangements and capabilities. Wherever feasible, the United States should look to undertake its cyber deterrence actions together with allies, which will both isolate and increase the costs for would-be adversaries.\n## Tool 12 – Treaties and arms control\nWhile a set of credible hard power policies and capabilities would likely serve as the foundation for managing cyber conflict, mutually agreed-upon norms and rules can solidify and reinforce a deterrence framework to achieve greater stability. Numerous treaties, agreements, and international norms have reinforced deterrence and enhanced international stability with respect to other types of forces in certain contexts, particularly during the Cold War. The next section further elaborates this concept and explores potential applications of this tool.\n## Promoting Cyber Stability: Prior Principles, Future Applications\nIn view of the arguably constructive role that arms control frameworks played in reinforcing deterrence and stability during the Cold War noted above, the authors conducted a systematic analysis of several arms control or stabilising regimes with the potential to offer lessons for managing cyber conflict. They found that, given the differences between the cyber and kinetic realms, no single past arms control treaty regime offers a singularly strong analogue for regulating hostile cyber activities. Nonetheless, numerous distinct principles from past treaty regimes have the potential to be applied to regulate state hostile cyber actions. These are presented below.\n## Cross-applicability of prior treaty principles to cyber conflict\nSeveral arms control and stabilising treaty regimes were analysed to assess their potential cross-applicability to managing cyber conflict (Goychayev et al. 2107, Sec. 5, pp. 5.24-5.50). Regimes were selected for analysis if they were considered to have worked in terms of stabilising nuclear arms races; to have dealt with categories of arms (such as chemical and biological weapons or piracy) that seemed analogous in some regard to cyber weaponry in their verification and monitoring challenges; to have regulated issues relevant to hostile cyber activity such as incident prevention, escalation management, and reducing disinformation; and/or to have regulated state behaviour in ungoverned or poorly governed spaces. The specific regimes analysed are presented below. The discussion includes a brief summary of the study's findings with respect to the principles employed in each regime and their potential for cross-applicability in the cyber realm.\n- The Strategic Arms Limitation and Reduction Treaties (SALT, ABM, and START) helped to regulate the nuclear arms race, but have limited applicability as a model for cyber stability given their emphasis on numerical limitations of warheads and delivery vehicles, verification through inspection, and reliance on a bipolar structure of international relations. Nevertheless, some verification modalities applied in these treaties might be incorporated in a cyber control regime, such as managed access where verification inspectors could have tightly controlled access to sites, and information barriers that could facilitate international information sharing and cooperation on attack attribution (US Department of State 1972c; 1972d; 1979; 1991; 1993b; 2002; 2011).\n- The Nuclear Test Ban Treaties lack a direct analogue to the cyber realm, as there is no\nJournal of Information Warfare\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\nequivalent, verifiable way to limit testing of a cyber weapon. However, these treaties demonstrate both a path for establishing multilateral norms against unacceptable state behaviour as well as multilateral technical forensic approaches to verification (vested in the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization's International Monitoring System) that may have potential to be cross-applied to the cyber realm. Additionally, information exchanges like those used in nuclear test ban treaties, if applied to cyber capabilities, might help to ease the secrecy that currently exacerbates cyber conflict (US Department of State 1963; 1974; 1996).\n- The Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) and the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) have various shared aspects that have strong potential applicability in managing cyber conflict. They establish open-ended definitions for the weaponry they control, with analysis of prohibition often hinging on state intent. This approach is potentially highly applicable to regulating cyber conflict as cyber weaponry is highly context-dependent, and its attributes cannot be definitively described. The conventions' definitions of prohibited items in terms of state intent, internationalised post-incident investigations of alleged violations, and use of confidence-building measures may offer useful analogues for promoting stability in the cyber realm (US Department of State 1972b; 1993a).\n- United States-Soviet Union Incidents at Sea Agreement has limited application in cyber stability, in part due to differences between the nature of international waters (where no state has jurisdiction) and cyber infrastructure (where different states have jurisdiction over various elements). However, the Incidents at Sea Agreement defined and prohibited a set of actions and manoeuvres that the parties jointly understood presented risks of accident, misinterpretation, and unintended escalation. A treaty regime employing similar principles might be useful in the cyber realm (US Department of State 1972a).\n- The Helsinki Process demonstrated how a sufficiently broad negotiations framework (covering territorial disputes, political-military relations, trade, and human rights) can yield breakthroughs. The human rights aspects of that framework additionally helped to dispel propaganda and disinformation, which have renewed relevance today. The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, a product of the Helsinki Process, now has a dedicated cyber security branch that might be expanded or used as a model for a multilateral cyber security forum (Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe 2017).\n- The History of Regulation of Piracy and Privateering demonstrates that international agreements which expedite criminal prosecution of state proxies and individual criminals have some potential to contribute to deterrence of hostile state cyber actions; however, historical analysis suggests the salient factors contributing to agreements in these areas are not strongly analogous to present-day cyber conflict (for example, Egloff 2015; UN Convention 1982; Guilfoyle 2014).\nFigure 2, below, indicates the types of agreement attributes found in the various treaties and regimes the authors reviewed. The attributes include whether the treaty was bilateral or multilateral; banned types of weapons or placed numerical limits on weapons or delivery systems; limited certain types of destabilising actions and declared that such actions, if taken in violation of the treaty, could be reasonably interpreted by other parties as acts of aggression; required declaration of an accountable number of arms; had verification measures through inspections or of suspected violations; limited tests of specific types of weapons; established communication and informa\nJournal of Information Warfare\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\ntion-sharing mechanisms; established confidence-building measures; facilitated criminal prosecution; or allowed certain types of materials/activities so long as there was no indication that the state intended to use those materials/activities for prohibited purposes. Where an item on this list was not a feature of a treaty, it was left blank. Where an item on this list was a feature of the treaty, it was marked in the corresponding column, either as a concept assessed as applicable to cyber conflict or not believed applicable. Patterns emerged about the types of attributes in a treaty that might be useful for cyber stability.\nFigure 2: Summary of findings on applicability of prior treaty regimes and instruments to managing cyber conflict (Goychayev et al. 2017, p. 1.25)\nApplication of treaty-derived principles in a notional regime for managing cyber conflict Based on the analyses of these treaties, the principles highlighted above might notionally be applied in an agreed framework for managing cyber conflict.\n- Given the difficulties of meaningfully defining, describing, disclosing, accounting, or verifying cyber weaponry, states should eschew a cyber-weapons-focused approach.\n- States should focus on defining a set of prohibited conduct, likely actions that present either\nJournal of Information Warfare\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\nrisks to civilian populations or special risks of provocation or conflict escalation.\n- States could make a binding commitment not to engage in attacks against other states’ critical infrastructure, consistent with emerging consensus positions of the Group of Government Experts, or against certain sensitive defence-related facilities or armed forces, like the escalation-avoidance framework of the Incidents at Sea Agreement.\n- States could vest a shared function for verifying compliance with this prohibition in a neutral international body like the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons or the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization, which could emphasise technical attribution forensics.\n- If a state declares it has been the victim of a treaty-prohibited attack, to allow for more effective forensic attribution, the victim state(s) would be subject to commitments to provide certain onsite access and share certain information with this verification body.\n- The scope of access could be subject to certain managed access or information barrier modalities to ensure the protection of sensitive information, like the various treaty regimes with onsite verification.\n- Like the Budapest Convention, participating states could be affirmatively obligated to render assistance in forensic verification and attribution investigations, for instance in designating central authorities for interfacing on investigations, preserving computer data, and the like. These might offer means to enhance both state participation in such a regime as well as the effectiveness of attribution that it could achieve.\n- Such a regime might be bolstered by vesting additional functions in the verification body, such as a forum for transparency, confidence-building measures, and technical exchanges.\nFurther technical and institutional options for international cooperation on the attribution of hostile cyber actions could be a valuable topic for future research.\n## Conclusion\nWeaponisation of the cyber realm is already undermining international cyber stability. Nevertheless, states have a variety of tools available to deter hostile cyber actions and increase stability. Though neither 20th century deterrence nor historic arms control approaches offer simple, direct analogues for cyber stability, various elements from these areas, particularly when synthesised, offer considerable potential for managing cyber conflict. States should carefully consider their potential adversaries, their desired outcomes, and the tools at their disposal to impose operational, retaliatory, and normative and reputational costs against their adversaries. In addition, detailed analysis of prior arms control and stabilising treaty regimes demonstrates there are several principles having considerable potential to be cross-applied to manage cyber conflict."

Based on an analysis of deterrence theory and application and prior arms control regimes, the study presents a toolkit of policies and actions for national governments based on elements of deterrence and arms control that analysis demonstrates are potentially applicable to cyber conflict. The study illustrates how these could be prospectively applied in a treaty framework to facilitate attribution of hostile cyber actions.\nKeywords: Cyber Deterrence, Cyber Stability, Cyber Conflict, Strategic Stability, Arms Control, Strategic Deterrence\n# Introduction\nThroughout the latter half of the 20th century, deterrence and arms control served as pillars of strategic stability between the nuclear superpowers. As the 21st century proceeds, however, the emergence of cyber conflict has gradually but steadily undermined that equilibrium. Challenges in policing malicious cyber activity, obfuscation, and uncertainty of consequences in the cyber realm embolden states to test boundaries with ever more aggressive actions. While modern state cyber conflict is markedly different from the Cold War, traditional deterrence theory and international agreements to reduce the potential for conflict from that era offer various lessons that can be applied to manage cyber conflict.\nThe section below titled \"Defining Deterrence, Cyber Deterrence, and Cyber Stability\" explains the difference between traditional or kinetic conflict and cyber conflict; and defines the crucial concepts of cyber deterrence and cyber stability, including their relevance to international stability. The \"Promoting Cyber Deterrence\" section explores how states could adopt deterrence concepts developed under traditional deterrence theory and apply them in the cyber realm, including the use of international agreements and arms control regimes. The \"Promoting Cyber Stability\" sec\nJournal of Information Warfare (2019) 18.3: 53-69\nISSN 1445-3312 Print/ISSN 1445-3347 Online\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\ntion more closely examines those various agreements and regimes to see which elements might be applicable to cyber deterrence and stability. The final section concludes that while cyber and kinetic warfare—and the means for deterring them—differ, Cold War deterrence and arms control, viewed through an appropriate analytic prism, can nonetheless assist in constructing meaningful paradigms for achieving cyber deterrence and stability.\n## Defining Deterrence, Cyber Deterrence, and Cyber Stability\nHistorically, states waged wars with the expectation that the spoils of victory would outweigh the costs, but nuclear weapons fundamentally altered that expectation. The unprecedented destructive potential of nuclear weapons compelled states to focus on preventing conflict before it started, which they achieved in part through deterrence, by creating a threshold of conflict that no one dared cross. The emergence of the cyber domain and cyber operations presents a concerning new pathway for conflict and escalation, threatening anything that relies on computers, which are now ubiquitous. Particularly considering the seriousness of recent hostile state cyber operations against one another, understanding whether and how deterrence might be meaningfully applied to prevent such escalation is an urgent task (Goychayev et al. 2017, at 1.17). This section briefly explains what deterrence is, particularly as it applied during the Cold War, then defines cyber deterrence and cyber stability. Next, this section examines how hostile cyber actions differ from kinetic warfare, which makes it difficult to apply traditional deterrence theory. The \"Promoting Cyber Deterrence\" and \"Promoting Cyber Stability\" sections apply deterrence theory and international arms control concepts to the cyber realm.\nTo illustrate deterrence, Henry Kissinger developed this equation:\n$$\nD = C \\times R \\times B\n$$\nDeterrence (D) is the product of the capability (C) of the deterring party to carry out a threatened act, multiplied by the resolve (R) of the deterring party to carry out the act, multiplied by the belief (B) of the party to be deterred that the deterring party will carry out the threatened act. If capability, resolve, or belief is ever zero, then the deterrence value is also zero; and, thus, deterrence will have failed (Kissinger 1961). Capability refers to the technical ability to act—that is, does the deterring party have the weapons, infrastructure, and delivery systems to carry out the promised retaliation? Resolve is whether the deterring party would be willing to carry out the threat. Belief refers to whether the adversary finds the threat from the deterring party credible, including the technical ability and willingness to act (Kissinger 1961).\nTo deter malicious actions, a state must ensure that any would-be attacker believes that the costs of the attack will likely outweigh the benefits. This posture can be achieved through demonstrating to an adversary that its attacks are unlikely to achieve its objectives, or that the consequences for an attack (even a failed one) will be unacceptably high. Figure 1 illustrates a successful cyber deterrence posture, where the adversary's perceived cost of undertaking a hostile cyber action outweighs its perceived benefit. The components of that representation are determined through an examination of their potential implementation in a coherent cyber deterrence policy.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\nFigure 1: Visualisation of successful cyber deterrence: A theoretical model (Goychayev et al. 2017, at 1.52)\n# Defining Cyber Hostile Actions, Cyber Deterrence, and Cyber Stability\nThis paper adopts the premise that the law of armed conflict has thus far proved of limited use in regulating hostile state cyber actions, so does not treat the law of armed conflict in detail. The threshold for its application, that of an 'armed attack' (for example, Koh 2012; Schmitt 2017), has arisen rarely and, in any case, states have proven reluctant to recognise cyber acts giving rise to hostilities or constituting aggression in the traditional meanings of those terms. At the same time, states have regularly engaged and continue to engage in a wide variety of concerning, hostile conduct with serious, albeit generally non-kinetic, consequences, with potential to set states on an escalatory path that could spill over into kinetic conflict (Department of Defense 2018). The terms 'cyberattack' relative to 'armed attack' are understood in international law, so this study instead focuses on a broad spectrum of lower-order conduct 'hostile cyber actions', which may be defined as \"cyber attack, use or deployment of cyber weaponry, cyber espionage, or cyber information warfare operations directed against a state, its nationals, or its interests, typically by another state or at another state's direction\" (Goychayev et al. 2017, at A.3).\nThis study defined the concept of 'cyber deterrence' as a set of conditions under which a state communicates, either explicitly or implicitly, a credible intention and capability to accurately attribute and impose substantial consequences for certain hostile cyber actions directed against it, and that communication dissuades other actors from undertaking such actions (Goychayev et al. 2017, at A.2). While Cold War deterrence and cyber deterrence have in common a basic emphasis\nJournal of Information Warfare\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\non cost-benefit calculus, effective deterrence of hostile cyber actions is likely to assume different forms than nuclear or conventional deterrence in the Cold War, as will be explained in greater detail below. ‘Cyber stability’ describes relations between states characterised by the absence of serious hostile cyber actions against one another, where the states have a sufficient common understanding of each other’s capabilities and intentions so as to be inclined generally to avoid such actions, likely associated with a common belief that the costs of such conduct would outweigh the benefits (Goychayev et al. 2017, at 3.16).\n## Cold War Deterrence versus Cyber Deterrence\nTraditional deterrence theory does not translate smoothly or simply to cyber conflict, given how cyber conflict differs from its conventional and nuclear counterparts. Cold-War-type deterrence generally applied (and applies) to extremely costly, high-consequence scenarios (such as nuclear or large-scale conventional war between the superpowers) with relatively high general confidence of attribution and capabilities for retaliation that were relatively well-known among the competing adversaries. By contrast, countries usually do not display or publicly test their cyber weapons, as doing so would give adversaries opportunities to develop countermeasures that would render the weapons ineffectual. In addition, the cost of cyber conflict is typically significantly lower than the costs of establishing, maintaining, or using kinetic forces (Clapper 2016). The consequences of cyberattacks can vary from negligible to severe, but most cases do not result in physical injury, loss of life, or destruction of property (and do not inherently present that risk in any way comparable to nuclear weapons or large-scale conventional forces). Finally, states can frequently obscure their involvement in hostile cyber actions through various techniques, such as masking the point of origin or generating false signature data. Cyber conflict, thus, differs from Cold War competition in part because it offers a low-cost, potentially low-consequence, and often non-attributable means for weakening an adversary. These differing cost-benefit outlooks presumably help to explain the relative frequencies of the different types of attacks. Nevertheless, applications of specific concepts from Cold War deterrence and stabilising frameworks can be applied to the cyber realm.\n## Promoting Cyber Deterrence: A Technical and Policy Toolkit\nThis section summarises tools available to states to achieve cyber deterrence and promote cyber stability. Some tools are based on 20th-century arms control and deterrence concepts, while others are not (Goychayev et al. 2017, at 1.60). As an overarching framework, considering the polycentric threat environment that states confront in the cyber realm (in contrast to the bipolar environment of the Cold War), states would be better served to adopt ‘tailored deterrence’ postures; that is, they should adopt deterrence strategies tailored to the specific states (or sets of states) and actions they seek to deter. States must consider that their adversaries have varying vulnerabilities, capabilities, and intentions, and will respond to stimuli accordingly. For example, what motivates actors in more open, pluralistic states will differ from what motivates actors in more closed, authoritarian ones. Further, states reliant on cyberspace are different from states lacking widespread Internet penetration and adoption, or where these are rigidly monitored and controlled by the state. Based on that tailored assessment, states should apply a selection of appropriate deterrence tools. An effective deterrence policy will likely not be limited to actions in the cyber realm but will rely on a coherent, coordinated application of a variety of tools at a state’s disposal.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\n# Tool 1 – Enhanced, active defence\nTo help deter would-be cyber adversaries, states could improve the cyber security posture of their critical systems and infrastructure. The better protected a target, the costlier it is to attack and the less attractive it becomes. One way to improve defence could be to expand efforts within the government and the technology industry to establish a system and network architectures that incorporate appropriate security considerations. Defensible architectures present a smaller attack surface, limit the access of an attacker who does manage to infiltrate, and can operate despite interference or damage. This defence effort simultaneously lessens the impact of a successful attack while increasing the cost to accomplish it. Laudable efforts along these lines include the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework and associated documents (NIST 2014).\nStates could undertake educational campaigns both to teach technology users about cyber threats and to groom the next generation of cyber security experts. In addition, states could seek to implement systems that incorporate more active defence and security measures. Architectures and processes could be put in place to actively interrogate systems to ensure that performance and functionality are uncompromised, proper, and authentic. Further, states could adopt strategies and develop capabilities to discover, define, analyse, and mitigate cyber threats and vulnerabilities in a more real-time mode, and direct these capabilities to defend critical infrastructure or other national security assets (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency 2018; Denning &amp; Strawser 2017).\n# Tool 2 – Resilience, reconstitution\nBuilding resilient systems that may succumb to attacks but can quickly be reconstituted and at little cost represents another paradigm for reducing the perceived potential benefits the adversary would gain from carrying out attacks. States could consider establishing or adopting standards for system architecture related to recovery and reconstitution. Innovative technological research and development to improve cyber defences and critical infrastructure resilience could have a deterrent effect as well. Microgrid technology, for example, could be helpful in bolstering resiliency by decentralising electricity generation and transmission, and dispersing accompanying risks (U.S. Department of Energy website 2017).\n# Tool 3 – Declarations of thresholds for action, reaction\nA low-cost step states can take to promote cyber stability is to unilaterally declare types of cyberattacks that will trigger their response and, in general terms, the spectrum of activities the response will entail. For example, President Obama’s Executive Order 13694 (2015) clearly delineated what malicious cyber acts the United States perceives as threats to national security, including attacks against critical infrastructure. States participating in the United Nation’s 2015 Group of Government Experts similarly recommend that states cooperate to prevent harmful information and communication technology practices and that states should not conduct or support such activity that damages or impairs critical infrastructure (United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research 2016). Clear statements about what are unacceptable targets of hostile cyber acts such as these indicate that states will view these types of activities as very grave. States could be even more explicit, though. For example, a state could issue public and private statements about what specific cyber acts by specific countries will prompt a response. In July 2016, the North Atlantic\nJournal of Information Warfare\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\nTreaty Organization (NATO) recognised cyberspace “as a domain of operations in which NATO must defend itself as effectively as it does in the air, on land, and at sea” (NATO 2016). It remains unclear how individual member states will respond to specific acts of cyber aggression against NATO allies. The United States has indicated it is concerned with protecting its allies from cyber aggression (Executive Order 13694 2015, at 152). Clearer communication by a country about its perception of and likely responses to threats could also reduce risks of miscalculation and escalation. Similarly, states could clarify their positions on cyber norms and possible responses to specific adversaries using direct, private communications, which might allow a message to be tailored more specifically and effectively for the states in question.\n## Tool 4 – Improving detection and attribution capabilities\nDetection of an attack is essential for attribution and retaliation. In contrast to a typical kinetic attack, malicious cyberattacks might not be detected until after they have been initiated or completed. Improving detection of cyberattacks could, therefore, enhance deterrence but presents a formidable challenge. While in kinetic war, there are robust early warning systems and clear evidence of attack (for example, bullet holes or bomb craters), there is no obvious analogue for many types of hostile cyber acts. The variety of malicious cyberattack vectors is tremendous and growing at a rapid pace together with technology, making attacks hard to predict and difficult to identify. One of the most reliable forms of cyberattack detection is reports of attacks by victims, but victims such as large financial institutions, hospitals, or power companies are often hesitant to report attacks due to fears they might trigger adverse liability rules or suffer reputational harm. Streamlining the means for victims to report attacks to authorities, perhaps with enhanced confidentiality or leniency for the victims’ liability, could incentivise more thorough and timely reporting. Detection can also be facilitated by active monitoring of known hostile actors.\nIn addition, the lack of generally recognised means for high-confidence attribution of cyberattacks remains a critical barrier to achieving deterrence of hostile cyber actions. If an attacker is confident that it cannot be identified, it will not be deterred by threats of retaliation by its target. Even where attribution can proceed, timeliness is a major problem, as a cyber-attacking state has various means to obfuscate its involvement and place in the path of investigators obstacles that take time to overcome. This problem can likely be mitigated with heavy investments in international law enforcement capabilities and coordination; however, even with such investments, there will likely remain some persistent level of attacks that cannot be attributed in time for a meaningful response.\nEven when a state can trace an attack to its origin, further difficulties arise. Disclosure of the fact of attribution can prompt an adversary to change its methods and render the technique for detection and attribution obsolete. Failure to disclose the full grounds for an accusation (for instance, sources, methods) can lead to questioning the motives and authenticity of attribution, but such full disclosure might compromise sensitive or classified information. Some balance must be struck. In the recent attribution to Russia of interference in the 2016 United States presidential election, the approach was taken of issuing a statement on the attribution conclusion together with some generally recognised and publicly available specific evidence, some newly declassified information, and some indication that other classified sources were used (Office of the Director of National Intelligence 2017). States would likely benefit from establishing disclosure policies in anticipation\nJournal of Information Warfare\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\nof this need for public assessments of state responsibility for cyberattacks, rather than to scramble and grapple with these questions reactively or repeatedly.\n## Tool 5 – Declaration of planned retaliatory measures\nRetaliation has been a principal focus of deterrence theory for centuries, and deterrence through the threat of punishment will remain a key factor in cyber space. Specific retaliatory measures are explored in greater detail under tools 6 through 10. When a state declares planned retaliation, threatened retaliatory measures must be linked to the declaring state’s capabilities to be credible and must hold at risk something the adversary values enough to likely outweigh the benefit the adversary hopes to gain through the attack. Where possible, to reinforce the credibility of the declared threat, the state threatening retaliation should exercise or otherwise display these measures to demonstrate capability and readiness.\n## Tool 6 – Public attribution, stigma\nWhen states can attribute cyberattacks against them with a high degree of confidence, they can publicly expose and condemn the perpetrators. By publicly identifying aggressors who commit hostile cyber actions, states can build international coalitions against the aggressors and their behaviour. For example, the Obama Administration publicly accused North Korea of an attack on Sony Corporation (White House 2014). This public condemnation supported international efforts to tighten sanctions on North Korea. This ‘naming and shaming’ tactic has been executed in several other instances, notably in response to Russia’s aggressive conduct during and after 2014, which has proved instrumental in securing and then maintaining the European Union’s broad and punishing sanctions regime (White House 2016; US Department of Justice 2014). Such denunciations can have cascading effects: damaging an attacking state’s reputation, limiting its ability to bargain and persuade, helping to sway general opinion against the state and the offending conduct, and hastening the formation of coalitions to counteract such aggression. Such statements can also contribute to the development of customary international law against cyberattacks.\n## Tool 7 – Enhanced, coordinated use of national criminal laws\nGiven the difficulty of attributing hostile cyber acts to states, one alternative to directly invoking or proving state responsibility is to deter the individual actors upon which states must rely to execute attacks. The acts comprising hostile cyber actions typically constitute generally recognised cybercrimes under national criminal laws; hence, the individuals who perpetrate the acts can be prosecuted for crimes (when states do not invoke sovereign immunity, see below) (Council of Europe 2004). By implementing and enforcing strong cybercrime laws in concert with their overall national defence and deterrence postures, states might deter the individuals who act on behalf of states in cyberspace and, by extension, the states themselves. As an example of this type of approach, the United States recently invoked its primary federal computer crime statutes to indict Russian Federal Security Service officers and criminal conspirators in connection with the hacking of Yahoo email accounts, which allegedly included email accounts for United States and Russian government officials (US Department of Justice 2017); similar indictments have been issued in response to prominent cases of Chinese-government-sponsored cyber intrusions (US Department of Justice 2014).\nJournal of Information Warfare\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\nSimply indicting foreign nationals for crimes can be ineffective if the indicting state lacks immediate physical jurisdiction over the accused. To assist in the apprehension of criminals and in investigation and prosecution of cybercrime, states often rely on mutual legal assistance treaties, extradition treaties, and other frameworks for coordinating and facilitating international criminal prosecution (Council of Europe 2017). States can leverage such international architecture to enhance deterrence against would-be state proxy cybercriminals. When obtaining physical jurisdiction is unlikely (for example, when a criminal actor is in a state unwilling or unable to cooperate in a prosecution), states can arrange forfeiture (confiscation) of instrumentalities and proceeds of crime or even criminals’ assets located in states that will cooperate. International arrest warrants can significantly constrain criminals’ freedom to travel. Such measures may substantially degrade the ability of states to recruit proxies to carry out acts of cyber aggression.\nStates could develop credible and consistent cybercrime prosecution policies to serve national security interests. Investigative and prosecutorial independence is important for ensuring public trust in law enforcement agencies and is best preserved when prosecutors publicly establish their own prioritisation of policies beforehand, rather than appearing to react to events that might be politically charged. The United States, for instance, has in the past established clear prosecutorial policies on such matters as counterterrorism and transnational organised crime (Presidential Archives 2011). A similar approach could be developed and applied for likely state hostile cyber actions.\nA strong national criminal law approach offers one additional benefit: it places pressure on the criminals and states to assert sovereign immunity for protection (US Department of State 2017). Such assertions may substantially aid in making the case for a state’s responsibility for the cyber-attack in question.\n## Tool 8 – International sanctions\nAmong tools for coercion and retaliation, economic sanctions have significantly increased in prominence over the last three decades. The U.S. president, for example, has considerable powers, both inherent and legislatively authorised, to unilaterally impose sanctions at various levels against various subjects, from natural and juridical persons, to economic sectors, to countries. While comprehensive overviews of sanctions powers have been produced by numerous authors, for example, Corn, Gurule &amp; Kahn (2016), these sanctions powers can be deployed in a tailored cyber deterrence framework. The basic concept is the same as that already described for deterrence generally: a state would signal that it is willing to bring its sanctions powers to bear in response to certain serious hostile cyber actions in a manner that would target what potential adversaries value and sketch elements of how a response would proceed in such a way as to make the threat credible.\nRecent history indicates that sanctions can be made more effective in certain circumstances (Goychayev et al. 2017, at 8.67-68). In considering use of sanctions to retaliate or deter hostile cyber actions, states should consider the following:\n- Sanctions are likely to be more effective tools of deterrence when they have a relatively broad scope (the sanctioned actors cannot simply reregister under a new corporate name and continue operating as they previously had been) and have multilateral participation.\n- The more robust the evidence in demonstrating an actor has carried out a particular series\nJournal of Information Warfare\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\nof hostile cyber actions, the more likely the international community is to join a multilateral sanctions regime.\n- Sanctions have more impact against states with at least moderately effective channels for influence by the general population of a country over its government and where the target country has a relatively vulnerable, export-oriented economy.\n- Sanctions are more likely to be effective when accompanied by a comprehensive negotiation strategy coupled with other tools of pressure and influence, such as diplomatic engagement of all stakeholders and the targeted and complementary deployment of hard power.\n# Tool 9 – Loud cyber responses\nIn contrast to most cyber activity in which stealth is paramount, ‘loud’ cyber retaliations deliberately broadcast their presence and origin. A loud cyberattack leaves no question as to its perpetrator and is intended to be as much communication as attack. Such actions can be undertaken publicly or tailored for notice by a specific agency or leader. Loud attacks might be undertaken in response to other cyber acts to demonstrate the state is aware of the adversary’s cyber action and to serve as a warning to cease and desist (Goychayev et al. 2017, p. 1.68). Where such retaliations are open, this enhances general deterrence and demonstrates resolve to respond.\n# Tool 10 – Kinetic response\nThe United States has issued statements that it reserves the right to respond to cyberattacks using appropriate, proportionate kinetic force (Department of Defense 2011). Such attacks are authorised under international law in only very specific circumstances and otherwise might constitute a serious breach of international law, potentially including the international crime of aggression. States should likely refrain from undertaking this type of response to a cyberattack unless they have supreme confidence in the attribution of the attack. Considering the risk involved, the threshold of seriousness for a cyberattack to merit a kinetic response would likely also be quite high, such as causing loss of life.\n# Tool 11 – International partnership and collaboration\nStates can significantly enhance the effectiveness of their cyber deterrence postures by leveraging alliances and international institutions. One of the strongest elements of United-States-backed deterrence in the Cold War was the establishment and maintenance of largely unified international blocs, underpinned by principles of free trade, democratic values, and mutual defence (for example, Holbrooke 1995; Murphy 2016). These included the mutual defence arrangements with Europe via NATO as well as with Japan and the Republic of Korea. Some argue it would not have been possible without the high degree of complementary economic and political cooperation engendered in such institutions as the European Community (and then European Union), the Council of Europe, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and bilateral arrangements with Japan and Korea (Holbrooke 1995). This web of strong alliances and interlinkages amplified adversaries’ perceptions that there would be consequences for aggressive conduct and that they would be serious. It is likely no accident that a focus of recent Russian cyber disinformation campaigns appears to have been to stoke nationalist sentiment in United States’ allies and to foment cynicism about and scepticism toward international institutions, particularly the European Union (Office of the Director of National Security 2017). A logical countermeasure to present-day cyber\nJournal of Information Warfare\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\naggression, therefore, would be to reinvest in these institutions and integrate into them robust counter-cyber arrangements and capabilities. Wherever feasible, the United States should look to undertake its cyber deterrence actions together with allies, which will both isolate and increase the costs for would-be adversaries.\n## Tool 12 – Treaties and arms control\nWhile a set of credible hard power policies and capabilities would likely serve as the foundation for managing cyber conflict, mutually agreed-upon norms and rules can solidify and reinforce a deterrence framework to achieve greater stability. Numerous treaties, agreements, and international norms have reinforced deterrence and enhanced international stability with respect to other types of forces in certain contexts, particularly during the Cold War. The next section further elaborates this concept and explores potential applications of this tool.\n## Promoting Cyber Stability: Prior Principles, Future Applications\nIn view of the arguably constructive role that arms control frameworks played in reinforcing deterrence and stability during the Cold War noted above, the authors conducted a systematic analysis of several arms control or stabilising regimes with the potential to offer lessons for managing cyber conflict. They found that, given the differences between the cyber and kinetic realms, no single past arms control treaty regime offers a singularly strong analogue for regulating hostile cyber activities. Nonetheless, numerous distinct principles from past treaty regimes have the potential to be applied to regulate state hostile cyber actions. These are presented below.\n## Cross-applicability of prior treaty principles to cyber conflict\nSeveral arms control and stabilising treaty regimes were analysed to assess their potential cross-applicability to managing cyber conflict (Goychayev et al. 2107, Sec. 5, pp. 5.24-5.50). Regimes were selected for analysis if they were considered to have worked in terms of stabilising nuclear arms races; to have dealt with categories of arms (such as chemical and biological weapons or piracy) that seemed analogous in some regard to cyber weaponry in their verification and monitoring challenges; to have regulated issues relevant to hostile cyber activity such as incident prevention, escalation management, and reducing disinformation; and/or to have regulated state behaviour in ungoverned or poorly governed spaces. The specific regimes analysed are presented below. The discussion includes a brief summary of the study's findings with respect to the principles employed in each regime and their potential for cross-applicability in the cyber realm.\n- The Strategic Arms Limitation and Reduction Treaties (SALT, ABM, and START) helped to regulate the nuclear arms race, but have limited applicability as a model for cyber stability given their emphasis on numerical limitations of warheads and delivery vehicles, verification through inspection, and reliance on a bipolar structure of international relations. Nevertheless, some verification modalities applied in these treaties might be incorporated in a cyber control regime, such as managed access where verification inspectors could have tightly controlled access to sites, and information barriers that could facilitate international information sharing and cooperation on attack attribution (US Department of State 1972c; 1972d; 1979; 1991; 1993b; 2002; 2011).\n- The Nuclear Test Ban Treaties lack a direct analogue to the cyber realm, as there is no\nJournal of Information Warfare\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\nequivalent, verifiable way to limit testing of a cyber weapon. However, these treaties demonstrate both a path for establishing multilateral norms against unacceptable state behaviour as well as multilateral technical forensic approaches to verification (vested in the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization's International Monitoring System) that may have potential to be cross-applied to the cyber realm. Additionally, information exchanges like those used in nuclear test ban treaties, if applied to cyber capabilities, might help to ease the secrecy that currently exacerbates cyber conflict (US Department of State 1963; 1974; 1996).\n- The Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) and the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) have various shared aspects that have strong potential applicability in managing cyber conflict. They establish open-ended definitions for the weaponry they control, with analysis of prohibition often hinging on state intent. This approach is potentially highly applicable to regulating cyber conflict as cyber weaponry is highly context-dependent, and its attributes cannot be definitively described. The conventions' definitions of prohibited items in terms of state intent, internationalised post-incident investigations of alleged violations, and use of confidence-building measures may offer useful analogues for promoting stability in the cyber realm (US Department of State 1972b; 1993a).\n- United States-Soviet Union Incidents at Sea Agreement has limited application in cyber stability, in part due to differences between the nature of international waters (where no state has jurisdiction) and cyber infrastructure (where different states have jurisdiction over various elements). However, the Incidents at Sea Agreement defined and prohibited a set of actions and manoeuvres that the parties jointly understood presented risks of accident, misinterpretation, and unintended escalation. A treaty regime employing similar principles might be useful in the cyber realm (US Department of State 1972a).\n- The Helsinki Process demonstrated how a sufficiently broad negotiations framework (covering territorial disputes, political-military relations, trade, and human rights) can yield breakthroughs. The human rights aspects of that framework additionally helped to dispel propaganda and disinformation, which have renewed relevance today. The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, a product of the Helsinki Process, now has a dedicated cyber security branch that might be expanded or used as a model for a multilateral cyber security forum (Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe 2017).\n- The History of Regulation of Piracy and Privateering demonstrates that international agreements which expedite criminal prosecution of state proxies and individual criminals have some potential to contribute to deterrence of hostile state cyber actions; however, historical analysis suggests the salient factors contributing to agreements in these areas are not strongly analogous to present-day cyber conflict (for example, Egloff 2015; UN Convention 1982; Guilfoyle 2014).\nFigure 2, below, indicates the types of agreement attributes found in the various treaties and regimes the authors reviewed. The attributes include whether the treaty was bilateral or multilateral; banned types of weapons or placed numerical limits on weapons or delivery systems; limited certain types of destabilising actions and declared that such actions, if taken in violation of the treaty, could be reasonably interpreted by other parties as acts of aggression; required declaration of an accountable number of arms; had verification measures through inspections or of suspected violations; limited tests of specific types of weapons; established communication and informa\nJournal of Information Warfare\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\ntion-sharing mechanisms; established confidence-building measures; facilitated criminal prosecution; or allowed certain types of materials/activities so long as there was no indication that the state intended to use those materials/activities for prohibited purposes. Where an item on this list was not a feature of a treaty, it was left blank. Where an item on this list was a feature of the treaty, it was marked in the corresponding column, either as a concept assessed as applicable to cyber conflict or not believed applicable. Patterns emerged about the types of attributes in a treaty that might be useful for cyber stability.\nFigure 2: Summary of findings on applicability of prior treaty regimes and instruments to managing cyber conflict (Goychayev et al. 2017, p. 1.25)\nApplication of treaty-derived principles in a notional regime for managing cyber conflict Based on the analyses of these treaties, the principles highlighted above might notionally be applied in an agreed framework for managing cyber conflict.\n- Given the difficulties of meaningfully defining, describing, disclosing, accounting, or verifying cyber weaponry, states should eschew a cyber-weapons-focused approach.\n- States should focus on defining a set of prohibited conduct, likely actions that present either\nJournal of Information Warfare\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\nrisks to civilian populations or special risks of provocation or conflict escalation.\n- States could make a binding commitment not to engage in attacks against other states’ critical infrastructure, consistent with emerging consensus positions of the Group of Government Experts, or against certain sensitive defence-related facilities or armed forces, like the escalation-avoidance framework of the Incidents at Sea Agreement.\n- States could vest a shared function for verifying compliance with this prohibition in a neutral international body like the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons or the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization, which could emphasise technical attribution forensics.\n- If a state declares it has been the victim of a treaty-prohibited attack, to allow for more effective forensic attribution, the victim state(s) would be subject to commitments to provide certain onsite access and share certain information with this verification body.\n- The scope of access could be subject to certain managed access or information barrier modalities to ensure the protection of sensitive information, like the various treaty regimes with onsite verification.\n- Like the Budapest Convention, participating states could be affirmatively obligated to render assistance in forensic verification and attribution investigations, for instance in designating central authorities for interfacing on investigations, preserving computer data, and the like. These might offer means to enhance both state participation in such a regime as well as the effectiveness of attribution that it could achieve.\n- Such a regime might be bolstered by vesting additional functions in the verification body, such as a forum for transparency, confidence-building measures, and technical exchanges.\nFurther technical and institutional options for international cooperation on the attribution of hostile cyber actions could be a valuable topic for future research.\n## Conclusion\nWeaponisation of the cyber realm is already undermining international cyber stability. Nevertheless, states have a variety of tools available to deter hostile cyber actions and increase stability. Though neither 20th century deterrence nor historic arms control approaches offer simple, direct analogues for cyber stability, various elements from these areas, particularly when synthesised, offer considerable potential for managing cyber conflict. States should carefully consider their potential adversaries, their desired outcomes, and the tools at their disposal to impose operational, retaliatory, and normative and reputational costs against their adversaries. In addition, detailed analysis of prior arms control and stabilising treaty regimes demonstrates there are several principles having considerable potential to be cross-applied to manage cyber conflict."

Based on an analysis of deterrence theory and application and prior arms control regimes, the study presents a toolkit of policies and actions for national governments based on elements of deterrence and arms control that analysis demonstrates are potentially applicable to cyber conflict. The study illustrates how these could be prospectively applied in a treaty framework to facilitate attribution of hostile cyber actions.\nKeywords: Cyber Deterrence, Cyber Stability, Cyber Conflict, Strategic Stability, Arms Control, Strategic Deterrence\n# Introduction\nThroughout the latter half of the 20th century, deterrence and arms control served as pillars of strategic stability between the nuclear superpowers. As the 21st century proceeds, however, the emergence of cyber conflict has gradually but steadily undermined that equilibrium. Challenges in policing malicious cyber activity, obfuscation, and uncertainty of consequences in the cyber realm embolden states to test boundaries with ever more aggressive actions. While modern state cyber conflict is markedly different from the Cold War, traditional deterrence theory and international agreements to reduce the potential for conflict from that era offer various lessons that can be applied to manage cyber conflict.\nThe section below titled \"Defining Deterrence, Cyber Deterrence, and Cyber Stability\" explains the difference between traditional or kinetic conflict and cyber conflict; and defines the crucial concepts of cyber deterrence and cyber stability, including their relevance to international stability. The \"Promoting Cyber Deterrence\" section explores how states could adopt deterrence concepts developed under traditional deterrence theory and apply them in the cyber realm, including the use of international agreements and arms control regimes. The \"Promoting Cyber Stability\" sec\nJournal of Information Warfare (2019) 18.3: 53-69\nISSN 1445-3312 Print/ISSN 1445-3347 Online\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\ntion more closely examines those various agreements and regimes to see which elements might be applicable to cyber deterrence and stability. The final section concludes that while cyber and kinetic warfare—and the means for deterring them—differ, Cold War deterrence and arms control, viewed through an appropriate analytic prism, can nonetheless assist in constructing meaningful paradigms for achieving cyber deterrence and stability.\n## Defining Deterrence, Cyber Deterrence, and Cyber Stability\nHistorically, states waged wars with the expectation that the spoils of victory would outweigh the costs, but nuclear weapons fundamentally altered that expectation. The unprecedented destructive potential of nuclear weapons compelled states to focus on preventing conflict before it started, which they achieved in part through deterrence, by creating a threshold of conflict that no one dared cross. The emergence of the cyber domain and cyber operations presents a concerning new pathway for conflict and escalation, threatening anything that relies on computers, which are now ubiquitous. Particularly considering the seriousness of recent hostile state cyber operations against one another, understanding whether and how deterrence might be meaningfully applied to prevent such escalation is an urgent task . This section briefly explains what deterrence is, particularly as it applied during the Cold War, then defines cyber deterrence and cyber stability. Next, this section examines how hostile cyber actions differ from kinetic warfare, which makes it difficult to apply traditional deterrence theory. The \"Promoting Cyber Deterrence\" and \"Promoting Cyber Stability\" sections apply deterrence theory and international arms control concepts to the cyber realm.\nTo illustrate deterrence, Henry Kissinger developed this equation:\n$$\nD = C \\times R \\times B\n$$\nDeterrence (D) is the product of the capability (C) of the deterring party to carry out a threatened act, multiplied by the resolve (R) of the deterring party to carry out the act, multiplied by the belief (B) of the party to be deterred that the deterring party will carry out the threatened act. If capability, resolve, or belief is ever zero, then the deterrence value is also zero; and, thus, deterrence will have failed . Capability refers to the technical ability to act—that is, does the deterring party have the weapons, infrastructure, and delivery systems to carry out the promised retaliation? Resolve is whether the deterring party would be willing to carry out the threat. Belief refers to whether the adversary finds the threat from the deterring party credible, including the technical ability and willingness to act .\nTo deter malicious actions, a state must ensure that any would-be attacker believes that the costs of the attack will likely outweigh the benefits. This posture can be achieved through demonstrating to an adversary that its attacks are unlikely to achieve its objectives, or that the consequences for an attack (even a failed one) will be unacceptably high. Figure 1 illustrates a successful cyber deterrence posture, where the adversary's perceived cost of undertaking a hostile cyber action outweighs its perceived benefit. The components of that representation are determined through an examination of their potential implementation in a coherent cyber deterrence policy.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\nFigure 1: Visualisation of successful cyber deterrence: A theoretical model # Defining Cyber Hostile Actions, Cyber Deterrence, and Cyber Stability\nThis paper adopts the premise that the law of armed conflict has thus far proved of limited use in regulating hostile state cyber actions, so does not treat the law of armed conflict in detail. The threshold for its application, that of an 'armed attack' (for example, Koh 2012; Schmitt 2017), has arisen rarely and, in any case, states have proven reluctant to recognise cyber acts giving rise to hostilities or constituting aggression in the traditional meanings of those terms. At the same time, states have regularly engaged and continue to engage in a wide variety of concerning, hostile conduct with serious, albeit generally non-kinetic, consequences, with potential to set states on an escalatory path that could spill over into kinetic conflict (Department of Defense 2018). The terms 'cyberattack' relative to 'armed attack' are understood in international law, so this study instead focuses on a broad spectrum of lower-order conduct 'hostile cyber actions', which may be defined as \"cyber attack, use or deployment of cyber weaponry, cyber espionage, or cyber information warfare operations directed against a state, its nationals, or its interests, typically by another state or at another state's direction\" .\nThis study defined the concept of 'cyber deterrence' as a set of conditions under which a state communicates, either explicitly or implicitly, a credible intention and capability to accurately attribute and impose substantial consequences for certain hostile cyber actions directed against it, and that communication dissuades other actors from undertaking such actions . While Cold War deterrence and cyber deterrence have in common a basic emphasis\nJournal of Information Warfare\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\non cost-benefit calculus, effective deterrence of hostile cyber actions is likely to assume different forms than nuclear or conventional deterrence in the Cold War, as will be explained in greater detail below. ‘Cyber stability’ describes relations between states characterised by the absence of serious hostile cyber actions against one another, where the states have a sufficient common understanding of each other’s capabilities and intentions so as to be inclined generally to avoid such actions, likely associated with a common belief that the costs of such conduct would outweigh the benefits .\n## Cold War Deterrence versus Cyber Deterrence\nTraditional deterrence theory does not translate smoothly or simply to cyber conflict, given how cyber conflict differs from its conventional and nuclear counterparts. Cold-War-type deterrence generally applied (and applies) to extremely costly, high-consequence scenarios (such as nuclear or large-scale conventional war between the superpowers) with relatively high general confidence of attribution and capabilities for retaliation that were relatively well-known among the competing adversaries. By contrast, countries usually do not display or publicly test their cyber weapons, as doing so would give adversaries opportunities to develop countermeasures that would render the weapons ineffectual. In addition, the cost of cyber conflict is typically significantly lower than the costs of establishing, maintaining, or using kinetic forces . The consequences of cyberattacks can vary from negligible to severe, but most cases do not result in physical injury, loss of life, or destruction of property (and do not inherently present that risk in any way comparable to nuclear weapons or large-scale conventional forces). Finally, states can frequently obscure their involvement in hostile cyber actions through various techniques, such as masking the point of origin or generating false signature data. Cyber conflict, thus, differs from Cold War competition in part because it offers a low-cost, potentially low-consequence, and often non-attributable means for weakening an adversary. These differing cost-benefit outlooks presumably help to explain the relative frequencies of the different types of attacks. Nevertheless, applications of specific concepts from Cold War deterrence and stabilising frameworks can be applied to the cyber realm.\n## Promoting Cyber Deterrence: A Technical and Policy Toolkit\nThis section summarises tools available to states to achieve cyber deterrence and promote cyber stability. Some tools are based on 20th-century arms control and deterrence concepts, while others are not . As an overarching framework, considering the polycentric threat environment that states confront in the cyber realm (in contrast to the bipolar environment of the Cold War), states would be better served to adopt ‘tailored deterrence’ postures; that is, they should adopt deterrence strategies tailored to the specific states (or sets of states) and actions they seek to deter. States must consider that their adversaries have varying vulnerabilities, capabilities, and intentions, and will respond to stimuli accordingly. For example, what motivates actors in more open, pluralistic states will differ from what motivates actors in more closed, authoritarian ones. Further, states reliant on cyberspace are different from states lacking widespread Internet penetration and adoption, or where these are rigidly monitored and controlled by the state. Based on that tailored assessment, states should apply a selection of appropriate deterrence tools. An effective deterrence policy will likely not be limited to actions in the cyber realm but will rely on a coherent, coordinated application of a variety of tools at a state’s disposal.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\n# Tool 1 – Enhanced, active defence\nTo help deter would-be cyber adversaries, states could improve the cyber security posture of their critical systems and infrastructure. The better protected a target, the costlier it is to attack and the less attractive it becomes. One way to improve defence could be to expand efforts within the government and the technology industry to establish a system and network architectures that incorporate appropriate security considerations. Defensible architectures present a smaller attack surface, limit the access of an attacker who does manage to infiltrate, and can operate despite interference or damage. This defence effort simultaneously lessens the impact of a successful attack while increasing the cost to accomplish it. Laudable efforts along these lines include the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework and associated documents .\nStates could undertake educational campaigns both to teach technology users about cyber threats and to groom the next generation of cyber security experts. In addition, states could seek to implement systems that incorporate more active defence and security measures. Architectures and processes could be put in place to actively interrogate systems to ensure that performance and functionality are uncompromised, proper, and authentic. Further, states could adopt strategies and develop capabilities to discover, define, analyse, and mitigate cyber threats and vulnerabilities in a more real-time mode, and direct these capabilities to defend critical infrastructure or other national security assets (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency 2018; Denning &amp; Strawser 2017).\n# Tool 2 – Resilience, reconstitution\nBuilding resilient systems that may succumb to attacks but can quickly be reconstituted and at little cost represents another paradigm for reducing the perceived potential benefits the adversary would gain from carrying out attacks. States could consider establishing or adopting standards for system architecture related to recovery and reconstitution. Innovative technological research and development to improve cyber defences and critical infrastructure resilience could have a deterrent effect as well. Microgrid technology, for example, could be helpful in bolstering resiliency by decentralising electricity generation and transmission, and dispersing accompanying risks (U.S. Department of Energy website 2017).\n# Tool 3 – Declarations of thresholds for action, reaction\nA low-cost step states can take to promote cyber stability is to unilaterally declare types of cyberattacks that will trigger their response and, in general terms, the spectrum of activities the response will entail. For example, President Obama’s Executive Order 13694 (2015) clearly delineated what malicious cyber acts the United States perceives as threats to national security, including attacks against critical infrastructure. States participating in the United Nation’s 2015 Group of Government Experts similarly recommend that states cooperate to prevent harmful information and communication technology practices and that states should not conduct or support such activity that damages or impairs critical infrastructure (United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research 2016). Clear statements about what are unacceptable targets of hostile cyber acts such as these indicate that states will view these types of activities as very grave. States could be even more explicit, though. For example, a state could issue public and private statements about what specific cyber acts by specific countries will prompt a response. In July 2016, the North Atlantic\nJournal of Information Warfare\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\nTreaty Organization (NATO) recognised cyberspace “as a domain of operations in which NATO must defend itself as effectively as it does in the air, on land, and at sea” . It remains unclear how individual member states will respond to specific acts of cyber aggression against NATO allies. The United States has indicated it is concerned with protecting its allies from cyber aggression (Executive Order 13694 2015, at 152). Clearer communication by a country about its perception of and likely responses to threats could also reduce risks of miscalculation and escalation. Similarly, states could clarify their positions on cyber norms and possible responses to specific adversaries using direct, private communications, which might allow a message to be tailored more specifically and effectively for the states in question.\n## Tool 4 – Improving detection and attribution capabilities\nDetection of an attack is essential for attribution and retaliation. In contrast to a typical kinetic attack, malicious cyberattacks might not be detected until after they have been initiated or completed. Improving detection of cyberattacks could, therefore, enhance deterrence but presents a formidable challenge. While in kinetic war, there are robust early warning systems and clear evidence of attack (for example, bullet holes or bomb craters), there is no obvious analogue for many types of hostile cyber acts. The variety of malicious cyberattack vectors is tremendous and growing at a rapid pace together with technology, making attacks hard to predict and difficult to identify. One of the most reliable forms of cyberattack detection is reports of attacks by victims, but victims such as large financial institutions, hospitals, or power companies are often hesitant to report attacks due to fears they might trigger adverse liability rules or suffer reputational harm. Streamlining the means for victims to report attacks to authorities, perhaps with enhanced confidentiality or leniency for the victims’ liability, could incentivise more thorough and timely reporting. Detection can also be facilitated by active monitoring of known hostile actors.\nIn addition, the lack of generally recognised means for high-confidence attribution of cyberattacks remains a critical barrier to achieving deterrence of hostile cyber actions. If an attacker is confident that it cannot be identified, it will not be deterred by threats of retaliation by its target. Even where attribution can proceed, timeliness is a major problem, as a cyber-attacking state has various means to obfuscate its involvement and place in the path of investigators obstacles that take time to overcome. This problem can likely be mitigated with heavy investments in international law enforcement capabilities and coordination; however, even with such investments, there will likely remain some persistent level of attacks that cannot be attributed in time for a meaningful response.\nEven when a state can trace an attack to its origin, further difficulties arise. Disclosure of the fact of attribution can prompt an adversary to change its methods and render the technique for detection and attribution obsolete. Failure to disclose the full grounds for an accusation (for instance, sources, methods) can lead to questioning the motives and authenticity of attribution, but such full disclosure might compromise sensitive or classified information. Some balance must be struck. In the recent attribution to Russia of interference in the 2016 United States presidential election, the approach was taken of issuing a statement on the attribution conclusion together with some generally recognised and publicly available specific evidence, some newly declassified information, and some indication that other classified sources were used (Office of the Director of National Intelligence 2017). States would likely benefit from establishing disclosure policies in anticipation\nJournal of Information Warfare\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\nof this need for public assessments of state responsibility for cyberattacks, rather than to scramble and grapple with these questions reactively or repeatedly.\n## Tool 5 – Declaration of planned retaliatory measures\nRetaliation has been a principal focus of deterrence theory for centuries, and deterrence through the threat of punishment will remain a key factor in cyber space. Specific retaliatory measures are explored in greater detail under tools 6 through 10. When a state declares planned retaliation, threatened retaliatory measures must be linked to the declaring state’s capabilities to be credible and must hold at risk something the adversary values enough to likely outweigh the benefit the adversary hopes to gain through the attack. Where possible, to reinforce the credibility of the declared threat, the state threatening retaliation should exercise or otherwise display these measures to demonstrate capability and readiness.\n## Tool 6 – Public attribution, stigma\nWhen states can attribute cyberattacks against them with a high degree of confidence, they can publicly expose and condemn the perpetrators. By publicly identifying aggressors who commit hostile cyber actions, states can build international coalitions against the aggressors and their behaviour. For example, the Obama Administration publicly accused North Korea of an attack on Sony Corporation (White House 2014). This public condemnation supported international efforts to tighten sanctions on North Korea. This ‘naming and shaming’ tactic has been executed in several other instances, notably in response to Russia’s aggressive conduct during and after 2014, which has proved instrumental in securing and then maintaining the European Union’s broad and punishing sanctions regime (White House 2016; US Department of Justice 2014). Such denunciations can have cascading effects: damaging an attacking state’s reputation, limiting its ability to bargain and persuade, helping to sway general opinion against the state and the offending conduct, and hastening the formation of coalitions to counteract such aggression. Such statements can also contribute to the development of customary international law against cyberattacks.\n## Tool 7 – Enhanced, coordinated use of national criminal laws\nGiven the difficulty of attributing hostile cyber acts to states, one alternative to directly invoking or proving state responsibility is to deter the individual actors upon which states must rely to execute attacks. The acts comprising hostile cyber actions typically constitute generally recognised cybercrimes under national criminal laws; hence, the individuals who perpetrate the acts can be prosecuted for crimes (when states do not invoke sovereign immunity, see below) (Council of Europe 2004). By implementing and enforcing strong cybercrime laws in concert with their overall national defence and deterrence postures, states might deter the individuals who act on behalf of states in cyberspace and, by extension, the states themselves. As an example of this type of approach, the United States recently invoked its primary federal computer crime statutes to indict Russian Federal Security Service officers and criminal conspirators in connection with the hacking of Yahoo email accounts, which allegedly included email accounts for United States and Russian government officials (US Department of Justice 2017); similar indictments have been issued in response to prominent cases of Chinese-government-sponsored cyber intrusions (US Department of Justice 2014).\nJournal of Information Warfare\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\nSimply indicting foreign nationals for crimes can be ineffective if the indicting state lacks immediate physical jurisdiction over the accused. To assist in the apprehension of criminals and in investigation and prosecution of cybercrime, states often rely on mutual legal assistance treaties, extradition treaties, and other frameworks for coordinating and facilitating international criminal prosecution (Council of Europe 2017). States can leverage such international architecture to enhance deterrence against would-be state proxy cybercriminals. When obtaining physical jurisdiction is unlikely (for example, when a criminal actor is in a state unwilling or unable to cooperate in a prosecution), states can arrange forfeiture (confiscation) of instrumentalities and proceeds of crime or even criminals’ assets located in states that will cooperate. International arrest warrants can significantly constrain criminals’ freedom to travel. Such measures may substantially degrade the ability of states to recruit proxies to carry out acts of cyber aggression.\nStates could develop credible and consistent cybercrime prosecution policies to serve national security interests. Investigative and prosecutorial independence is important for ensuring public trust in law enforcement agencies and is best preserved when prosecutors publicly establish their own prioritisation of policies beforehand, rather than appearing to react to events that might be politically charged. The United States, for instance, has in the past established clear prosecutorial policies on such matters as counterterrorism and transnational organised crime (Presidential Archives 2011). A similar approach could be developed and applied for likely state hostile cyber actions.\nA strong national criminal law approach offers one additional benefit: it places pressure on the criminals and states to assert sovereign immunity for protection (US Department of State 2017). Such assertions may substantially aid in making the case for a state’s responsibility for the cyber-attack in question.\n## Tool 8 – International sanctions\nAmong tools for coercion and retaliation, economic sanctions have significantly increased in prominence over the last three decades. The U.S. president, for example, has considerable powers, both inherent and legislatively authorised, to unilaterally impose sanctions at various levels against various subjects, from natural and juridical persons, to economic sectors, to countries. While comprehensive overviews of sanctions powers have been produced by numerous authors, for example, Corn, Gurule &amp; Kahn (2016), these sanctions powers can be deployed in a tailored cyber deterrence framework. The basic concept is the same as that already described for deterrence generally: a state would signal that it is willing to bring its sanctions powers to bear in response to certain serious hostile cyber actions in a manner that would target what potential adversaries value and sketch elements of how a response would proceed in such a way as to make the threat credible.\nRecent history indicates that sanctions can be made more effective in certain circumstances . In considering use of sanctions to retaliate or deter hostile cyber actions, states should consider the following:\n- Sanctions are likely to be more effective tools of deterrence when they have a relatively broad scope (the sanctioned actors cannot simply reregister under a new corporate name and continue operating as they previously had been) and have multilateral participation.\n- The more robust the evidence in demonstrating an actor has carried out a particular series\nJournal of Information Warfare\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\nof hostile cyber actions, the more likely the international community is to join a multilateral sanctions regime.\n- Sanctions have more impact against states with at least moderately effective channels for influence by the general population of a country over its government and where the target country has a relatively vulnerable, export-oriented economy.\n- Sanctions are more likely to be effective when accompanied by a comprehensive negotiation strategy coupled with other tools of pressure and influence, such as diplomatic engagement of all stakeholders and the targeted and complementary deployment of hard power.\n# Tool 9 – Loud cyber responses\nIn contrast to most cyber activity in which stealth is paramount, ‘loud’ cyber retaliations deliberately broadcast their presence and origin. A loud cyberattack leaves no question as to its perpetrator and is intended to be as much communication as attack. Such actions can be undertaken publicly or tailored for notice by a specific agency or leader. Loud attacks might be undertaken in response to other cyber acts to demonstrate the state is aware of the adversary’s cyber action and to serve as a warning to cease and desist . Where such retaliations are open, this enhances general deterrence and demonstrates resolve to respond.\n# Tool 10 – Kinetic response\nThe United States has issued statements that it reserves the right to respond to cyberattacks using appropriate, proportionate kinetic force (Department of Defense 2011). Such attacks are authorised under international law in only very specific circumstances and otherwise might constitute a serious breach of international law, potentially including the international crime of aggression. States should likely refrain from undertaking this type of response to a cyberattack unless they have supreme confidence in the attribution of the attack. Considering the risk involved, the threshold of seriousness for a cyberattack to merit a kinetic response would likely also be quite high, such as causing loss of life.\n# Tool 11 – International partnership and collaboration\nStates can significantly enhance the effectiveness of their cyber deterrence postures by leveraging alliances and international institutions. One of the strongest elements of United-States-backed deterrence in the Cold War was the establishment and maintenance of largely unified international blocs, underpinned by principles of free trade, democratic values, and mutual defence (for example, Holbrooke 1995; Murphy 2016). These included the mutual defence arrangements with Europe via NATO as well as with Japan and the Republic of Korea. Some argue it would not have been possible without the high degree of complementary economic and political cooperation engendered in such institutions as the European Community (and then European Union), the Council of Europe, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and bilateral arrangements with Japan and Korea . This web of strong alliances and interlinkages amplified adversaries’ perceptions that there would be consequences for aggressive conduct and that they would be serious. It is likely no accident that a focus of recent Russian cyber disinformation campaigns appears to have been to stoke nationalist sentiment in United States’ allies and to foment cynicism about and scepticism toward international institutions, particularly the European Union (Office of the Director of National Security 2017). A logical countermeasure to present-day cyber\nJournal of Information Warfare\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\naggression, therefore, would be to reinvest in these institutions and integrate into them robust counter-cyber arrangements and capabilities. Wherever feasible, the United States should look to undertake its cyber deterrence actions together with allies, which will both isolate and increase the costs for would-be adversaries.\n## Tool 12 – Treaties and arms control\nWhile a set of credible hard power policies and capabilities would likely serve as the foundation for managing cyber conflict, mutually agreed-upon norms and rules can solidify and reinforce a deterrence framework to achieve greater stability. Numerous treaties, agreements, and international norms have reinforced deterrence and enhanced international stability with respect to other types of forces in certain contexts, particularly during the Cold War. The next section further elaborates this concept and explores potential applications of this tool.\n## Promoting Cyber Stability: Prior Principles, Future Applications\nIn view of the arguably constructive role that arms control frameworks played in reinforcing deterrence and stability during the Cold War noted above, the authors conducted a systematic analysis of several arms control or stabilising regimes with the potential to offer lessons for managing cyber conflict. They found that, given the differences between the cyber and kinetic realms, no single past arms control treaty regime offers a singularly strong analogue for regulating hostile cyber activities. Nonetheless, numerous distinct principles from past treaty regimes have the potential to be applied to regulate state hostile cyber actions. These are presented below.\n## Cross-applicability of prior treaty principles to cyber conflict\nSeveral arms control and stabilising treaty regimes were analysed to assess their potential cross-applicability to managing cyber conflict . Regimes were selected for analysis if they were considered to have worked in terms of stabilising nuclear arms races; to have dealt with categories of arms (such as chemical and biological weapons or piracy) that seemed analogous in some regard to cyber weaponry in their verification and monitoring challenges; to have regulated issues relevant to hostile cyber activity such as incident prevention, escalation management, and reducing disinformation; and/or to have regulated state behaviour in ungoverned or poorly governed spaces. The specific regimes analysed are presented below. The discussion includes a brief summary of the study's findings with respect to the principles employed in each regime and their potential for cross-applicability in the cyber realm.\n- The Strategic Arms Limitation and Reduction Treaties (SALT, ABM, and START) helped to regulate the nuclear arms race, but have limited applicability as a model for cyber stability given their emphasis on numerical limitations of warheads and delivery vehicles, verification through inspection, and reliance on a bipolar structure of international relations. Nevertheless, some verification modalities applied in these treaties might be incorporated in a cyber control regime, such as managed access where verification inspectors could have tightly controlled access to sites, and information barriers that could facilitate international information sharing and cooperation on attack attribution (US Department of State 1972c; 1972d; 1979; 1991; 1993b; 2002; 2011).\n- The Nuclear Test Ban Treaties lack a direct analogue to the cyber realm, as there is no\nJournal of Information Warfare\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\nequivalent, verifiable way to limit testing of a cyber weapon. However, these treaties demonstrate both a path for establishing multilateral norms against unacceptable state behaviour as well as multilateral technical forensic approaches to verification (vested in the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization's International Monitoring System) that may have potential to be cross-applied to the cyber realm. Additionally, information exchanges like those used in nuclear test ban treaties, if applied to cyber capabilities, might help to ease the secrecy that currently exacerbates cyber conflict (US Department of State 1963; 1974; 1996).\n- The Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) and the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) have various shared aspects that have strong potential applicability in managing cyber conflict. They establish open-ended definitions for the weaponry they control, with analysis of prohibition often hinging on state intent. This approach is potentially highly applicable to regulating cyber conflict as cyber weaponry is highly context-dependent, and its attributes cannot be definitively described. The conventions' definitions of prohibited items in terms of state intent, internationalised post-incident investigations of alleged violations, and use of confidence-building measures may offer useful analogues for promoting stability in the cyber realm (US Department of State 1972b; 1993a).\n- United States-Soviet Union Incidents at Sea Agreement has limited application in cyber stability, in part due to differences between the nature of international waters (where no state has jurisdiction) and cyber infrastructure (where different states have jurisdiction over various elements). However, the Incidents at Sea Agreement defined and prohibited a set of actions and manoeuvres that the parties jointly understood presented risks of accident, misinterpretation, and unintended escalation. A treaty regime employing similar principles might be useful in the cyber realm (US Department of State 1972a).\n- The Helsinki Process demonstrated how a sufficiently broad negotiations framework (covering territorial disputes, political-military relations, trade, and human rights) can yield breakthroughs. The human rights aspects of that framework additionally helped to dispel propaganda and disinformation, which have renewed relevance today. The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, a product of the Helsinki Process, now has a dedicated cyber security branch that might be expanded or used as a model for a multilateral cyber security forum (Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe 2017).\n- The History of Regulation of Piracy and Privateering demonstrates that international agreements which expedite criminal prosecution of state proxies and individual criminals have some potential to contribute to deterrence of hostile state cyber actions; however, historical analysis suggests the salient factors contributing to agreements in these areas are not strongly analogous to present-day cyber conflict (for example, Egloff 2015; UN Convention 1982; Guilfoyle 2014).\nFigure 2, below, indicates the types of agreement attributes found in the various treaties and regimes the authors reviewed. The attributes include whether the treaty was bilateral or multilateral; banned types of weapons or placed numerical limits on weapons or delivery systems; limited certain types of destabilising actions and declared that such actions, if taken in violation of the treaty, could be reasonably interpreted by other parties as acts of aggression; required declaration of an accountable number of arms; had verification measures through inspections or of suspected violations; limited tests of specific types of weapons; established communication and informa\nJournal of Information Warfare\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\ntion-sharing mechanisms; established confidence-building measures; facilitated criminal prosecution; or allowed certain types of materials/activities so long as there was no indication that the state intended to use those materials/activities for prohibited purposes. Where an item on this list was not a feature of a treaty, it was left blank. Where an item on this list was a feature of the treaty, it was marked in the corresponding column, either as a concept assessed as applicable to cyber conflict or not believed applicable. Patterns emerged about the types of attributes in a treaty that might be useful for cyber stability.\nFigure 2: Summary of findings on applicability of prior treaty regimes and instruments to managing cyber conflict Application of treaty-derived principles in a notional regime for managing cyber conflict Based on the analyses of these treaties, the principles highlighted above might notionally be applied in an agreed framework for managing cyber conflict.\n- Given the difficulties of meaningfully defining, describing, disclosing, accounting, or verifying cyber weaponry, states should eschew a cyber-weapons-focused approach.\n- States should focus on defining a set of prohibited conduct, likely actions that present either\nJournal of Information Warfare\nA Technical and Policy Toolkit for Cyber Deterrence and Stability\nrisks to civilian populations or special risks of provocation or conflict escalation.\n- States could make a binding commitment not to engage in attacks against other states’ critical infrastructure, consistent with emerging consensus positions of the Group of Government Experts, or against certain sensitive defence-related facilities or armed forces, like the escalation-avoidance framework of the Incidents at Sea Agreement.\n- States could vest a shared function for verifying compliance with this prohibition in a neutral international body like the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons or the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization, which could emphasise technical attribution forensics.\n- If a state declares it has been the victim of a treaty-prohibited attack, to allow for more effective forensic attribution, the victim state(s) would be subject to commitments to provide certain onsite access and share certain information with this verification body.\n- The scope of access could be subject to certain managed access or information barrier modalities to ensure the protection of sensitive information, like the various treaty regimes with onsite verification.\n- Like the Budapest Convention, participating states could be affirmatively obligated to render assistance in forensic verification and attribution investigations, for instance in designating central authorities for interfacing on investigations, preserving computer data, and the like. These might offer means to enhance both state participation in such a regime as well as the effectiveness of attribution that it could achieve.\n- Such a regime might be bolstered by vesting additional functions in the verification body, such as a forum for transparency, confidence-building measures, and technical exchanges.\nFurther technical and institutional options for international cooperation on the attribution of hostile cyber actions could be a valuable topic for future research.\n## Conclusion\nWeaponisation of the cyber realm is already undermining international cyber stability. Nevertheless, states have a variety of tools available to deter hostile cyber actions and increase stability. Though neither 20th century deterrence nor historic arms control approaches offer simple, direct analogues for cyber stability, various elements from these areas, particularly when synthesised, offer considerable potential for managing cyber conflict. States should carefully consider their potential adversaries, their desired outcomes, and the tools at their disposal to impose operational, retaliatory, and normative and reputational costs against their adversaries. In addition, detailed analysis of prior arms control and stabilising treaty regimes demonstrates there are several principles having considerable potential to be cross-applied to manage cyber conflict."
