It develops a policy-relevant conceptual framework for states to design legally permissible deterrent strategies and calls for further work on norms and legal interpretation. While theoretical and lacking empirical validation (a noted limitation), the paper is directly pertinent to both attribution research and cyber policy/law discussions.\"\n}"
