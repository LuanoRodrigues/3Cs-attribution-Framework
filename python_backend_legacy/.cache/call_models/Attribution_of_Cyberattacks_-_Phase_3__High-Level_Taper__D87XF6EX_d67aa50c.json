It also proposes operational policy mechanisms (notification procedures, cooperative/ad hoc action, institutionalized codes of conduct) and engages with state practice and international organizations (NATO, US policy, China\u2013Russia proposals). While doctrinal/legal rather than technical-forensic, the work is squarely focused on attribution doctrine and policy/law responses, making it highly relevant.\"\n}"
