It also analyzes canonical cyber incidents (Estonia 2007, Georgia 2008, Stuxnet 2010) and calls for normative and institutional responses\u2014core concerns for policy/law work on cyber attribution. Although the study is doctrinal and notes empirical limitations, its subject matter and proposed attribution standards make it highly relevant to cyber conflict attribution and related legal/policy debates.\"\n}"
