It proposes a unified conceptual framework for decisionmakers, delineates three levels of attribution (machine, operator, state), emphasizes probabilistic evidence and transparency about confidence, and discusses legal doctrines (state responsibility, jus ad bellum) and policy calibration\u2014making it centrally relevant to cyber conflict attribution and policy/law. The use of case studies and suggested future research on evidence independence and active defense further increase its applicability to policy and legal scholarship.\"\n}"
