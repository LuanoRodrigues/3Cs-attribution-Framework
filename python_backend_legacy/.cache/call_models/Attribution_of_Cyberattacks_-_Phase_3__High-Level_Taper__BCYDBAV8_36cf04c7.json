It synthesizes state positions (including reference to UN GGE reports) and discusses implications for legal accountability and enforceability \u2014 topics central to cyber conflict policy, state responsibility, and frameworks for attribution and response. (It does not focus on technical forensic attribution methods, but is highly relevant to the legal/policy context that shapes attribution, liability, and state responses.)\"\n}"
