It situates these issues within public international law, cites state practice (Sony, Estonia), and makes explicit policy recommendations (empirical research, multilateral codification), making it highly applicable to scholarship and policymaking on cyber attribution and legal responses. While doctrinal in form, the piece engages operational and normative aspects critical to attribution and policy/law debates.\"\n}"
