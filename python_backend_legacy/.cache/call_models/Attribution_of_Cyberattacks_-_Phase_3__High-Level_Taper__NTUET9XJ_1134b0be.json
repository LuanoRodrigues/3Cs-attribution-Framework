It evaluates how nuclear arms-control verification tools can be adapted to cyberspace, proposes concrete verification techniques (network monitoring, forensics, log inspection, selective data sharing), and addresses legal questions (treaty design, jus ad bellum/jus in bello), confidentiality mechanisms, and operational/political limits. These features make the work directly substantive for cyber conflict attribution and cyber policy/law.\"\n}"
