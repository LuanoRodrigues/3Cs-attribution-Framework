It cites relevant policy and normative forums (Tallinn Manual, UN GGE, NATO CCD COE) and uses doctrinal methodology to assess state practice and legal instruments. These elements map squarely to cyber conflict attribution and policy/law concerns, making it highly relevant. (Note: the provided inclusion/exclusion criteria were unavailable; this classification is based on the abstract content.)\"\n}"
