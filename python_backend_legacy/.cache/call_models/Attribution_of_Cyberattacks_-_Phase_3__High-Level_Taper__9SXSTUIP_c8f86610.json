The title explicitly references a legal regime ('control & capabilities test') shaping attribution, and the text acknowledges reliance on publicly available attribution data and policy-relevant implications (strategic shifts, calls for case studies and comparative analyses). These features make the work highly relevant to research and policy/legal debates on cyber conflict attribution.\"\n}"
