It engages doctrinal materials (Tallinn Manual 2.0, DoD manuals), high-profile case examples (Stuxnet, US indictment of PLA actors), and the interplay between attribution intelligence and military targeting \u2014 all directly relevant to cyber conflict attribution and policy/law. While the study uses a doctrinal legal methodology (rather than empirical/technical analysis), that focus is appropriate for legal and policy audiences and does not reduce its central relevance.\"\n}"
