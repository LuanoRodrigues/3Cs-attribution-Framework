It addresses governance mechanisms, enforcement roles, stakeholder incentives, and systemic challenges (geopolitical rivalries, trust/capability gaps, private-sector control and conflicts of interest), and proposes a research agenda to build an evidence base for credible transnational attribution institutions. These elements directly engage questions of accountability, deterrence, international norms, and the role of private actors in attribution\u2014all central to cyber conflict attribution and policy/law. The paper\u2019s reliance on secondary sources is a noted limitation but does not reduce its high relevance to policy and legal debates about institutionalizing attribution.\"\n}"
