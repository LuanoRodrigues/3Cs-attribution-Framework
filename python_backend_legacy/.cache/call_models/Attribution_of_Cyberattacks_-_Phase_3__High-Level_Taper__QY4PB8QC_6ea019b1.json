It draws on state practice, strategy documents, and the Tallinn Manual and calls for normative and policy development\u2014making it directly and strongly relevant to cyber conflict attribution and policy/law. Noted methodological limitations (public-source reliance, English-language focus) affect generalizability but do not reduce topical relevance.\"\n}"
