These topics squarely fall within policy and legal treatment of cyber attribution and countermeasures. The paper's doctrinal analysis and concrete policy recommendations justify a 'Highly Relevant' / 'High' score despite noted limitations (classified evidence, limited empirical data). Note: the provided inclusion/exclusion criteria were marked 'AUTO DRAFT UNAVAILABLE'; this classification is based on topical relevance to cyber attribution and policy/law as presented in the abstract.\"\n}"
