It analyzes State practice and jurisprudence, assesses doctrinal thresholds for attributing non-State actors\u2019 cyber conduct to States, and proposes concrete policy/normative developments (e.g., incitement-style prohibitions, intermediate control standards, strengthened due diligence, and treaty/interpretive guidance). While it excludes evidentiary rules and notes limited current state practice, its focus on attribution thresholds and normative implications makes it centrally relevant to cyber conflict attribution and related policy and legal debates.\"\n}"
