It explicitly discusses attribution challenges (botnets, multi-jurisdictional data flows) and the limits those pose on lawful anticipatory action, and it concludes with policy recommendations (improved attribution capabilities, enhanced defenses, multilateral cooperation). These doctrinal and policy-focused elements make the work squarely relevant to cyber conflict attribution and policy/law.\"\n}"
