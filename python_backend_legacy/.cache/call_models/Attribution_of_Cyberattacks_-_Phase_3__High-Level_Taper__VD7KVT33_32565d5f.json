It uses high-profile cyber incidents as case studies and explicitly advances policy debates on deterrence and institutional design for holding states accountable. Although the study is doctrinal rather than empirical, its focus on legal standards and procedural mechanisms makes it highly relevant to cyber conflict attribution and policy/law.\"\n}"
