It proposes a tailored cyber-diligence framework, discusses minimal thresholds that activate a State\u2019s duty to act (including serious physical or incapacitating injury to infrastructure), and considers policy implications (channeling ultimate security responsibility to industry). Although doctrinal and limited by case-study scope, the paper focuses squarely on legal standards, remedial consequences (reparations), and normative policy design\u2014making it highly relevant to research on cyber attribution and state obligations under international law.\"\n}"
