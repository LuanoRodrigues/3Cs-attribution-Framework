It identifies precise legal thresholds (effective control; planning/directing/commanding), legal consequences (state responsibility, reparations, countermeasures, self-defense, international armed conflict), and cites authoritative sources (Tallinn Manual, tribunal decisions), while offering policy guidance for states. These elements make the work directly and substantively relevant to cyber conflict attribution and related policy/law. Note: the prompt's inclusion/exclusion criteria were placeholders ('AUTO DRAFT UNAVAILABLE'), so this classification is based on the abstract's content.\"\n}"
