It uses legal-analytic methodology and concrete attribution cases (Sony 2014, DNC, Yahoo, Iranian DDoS, etc.), making it centrally relevant to both attribution standards and international cyber policy/law. The paper\u2019s focus on evolving legal standards, evidentiary thresholds, and policy implications makes it highly relevant to research on cyber conflict attribution and related legal/policy frameworks.\"\n}"
