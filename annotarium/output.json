            "text_verbatim": "Since 2004, Mandiant has investigated computer security breaches at hundreds of organizations around the world. The majority of these security breaches are attributed to advanced threat actors referred to as the “Advanced Persistent Threat” (APT). We first published details about the APT in our January 2010 M-Trends report. As we stated in the report, our position was that “The Chinese government may authorize this activity, but there’s no way to determine the extent of its involvement.” Now, three years later, we have the evidence required to change our assessment. The details we have analyzed during hundreds of investigations convince us that the groups conducting these activities are based primarily in China and that the Chinese Government is aware of them.³ Mandiant continues to track dozens of APT groups around the world; however, this report is focused on the most prolific of these groups. We refer to this group as “APT1” and it is one of more than 20 APT groups with origins in China. APT1 is a single organization of operators that has conducted a cyber espionage campaign against a broad range of victims since at least 2006. From our observations, it is one of the most prolific cyber espionage groups in terms of the sheer quantity of information stolen. The scale and impact of APT1’s operations compelled us to write this report. The activity we have directly observed likely represents only a small fraction of the cyber espionage that APT1 has conducted. Though our visibility of APT1’s activities is incomplete, we have analyzed the group’s intrusions against nearly 150 victims over seven years. From our unique vantage point responding to victims, we tracked APT1 back to four large networks in Shanghai, two of which are allocated directly to the Pudong New Area. We uncovered a substantial amount of APT1’s attack infrastructure, command and control, and modus operandi (tools, tactics, and procedures). In an effort to underscore there are actual individuals behind the keyboard, Mandiant is revealing three personas we have attributed to APT1. These operators, like soldiers, may merely be following orders given to them by others. Our analysis has led us to conclude that APT1 is likely government-sponsored and one of the most persistent of China’s cyber threat actors. We believe that APT1 is able to wage such a long-running and extensive cyber espionage campaign in large part because it receives direct government support. In seeking to identify the organization behind this activity, our research found that People’s Liberation Army (PLA’s) Unit 61398 is similar to APT1 in its mission, capabilities, and resources. PLA Unit 61398 is also located in precisely the same area from which APT1 activity appears to originate. ³ Our conclusions are based exclusively on unclassified, open source information derived from Mandiant observations. None of the information in this report involves access to or confirmation by classified intelligence. Mandiant APT1 www.mandiant.com",

The central building in this compound is a 130,663 square foot facility that is 12 stories high and was built in early 2007. - We estimate that Unit 61398 is staffed by hundreds, and perhaps thousands of people based on the size of Unit 61398's physical infrastructure. - China Telecom provided special fiber optic communications infrastructure for the unit in the name of national defense. - Unit 61398 requires its personnel to be trained in computer security and computer network operations and also requires its personnel to be proficient in the English language. - Mandiant has traced APT1's activity to four large networks in Shanghai, two of which serve the Pudong New Area where Unit 61398 is based. APT1 has systematically stolen hundreds of terabytes of data from at least 141 organizations, and has demonstrated the capability and intent to steal from dozens of organizations simultaneously.⁴ - Since 2006, Mandiant has observed APT1 compromise 141 companies spanning 20 major industries. - APT1 has a well-defined attack methodology, honed over years and designed to steal large volumes of valuable intellectual property. - Once APT1 has established access, they periodically revisit the victim's network over several months or years and steal broad categories of intellectual property, including technology blueprints, proprietary manufacturing processes, test results, business plans, pricing documents, partnership agreements, and emails and contact lists from victim organizations' leadership. - APT1 uses some tools and techniques that we have not yet observed being used by other groups including two utilities designed to steal email — GETMAIL and MAPIGET. - APT1 maintained access to victim networks for an average of 356 days.⁵ The longest time period APT1 maintained access to a victim's network was 1,764 days, or four years and ten months. - Among other large-scale thefts of intellectual property, we have observed APT1 stealing 6.5 terabytes of compressed data from a single organization over a ten-month time period. - In the first month of 2011, APT1 successfully compromised at least 17 new victims operating in 10 different industries. ⁴ We believe that the extensive activity we have directly observed represents only a small fraction of the cyber espionage that APT1 has conducted. Therefore, Mandiant is establishing the lower bounds of APT1 activities in this report. ⁵ This is based on 91 of the 141 victim organizations. In the remaining cases, APT1 activity is either ongoing or else we do not have visibility into the last known date of APT1 activity in the network. Mandiant APT1 www.mandiant.com APT1 focuses on compromising organizations across a broad range of industries in English-speaking countries. - Of the 141 APT1 victims, 87% of them are headquartered in countries where English is the native language",

APT1 maintains an extensive infrastructure of computer systems around the world. - APT1 controls thousands of systems in support of their computer intrusion activities. - In the last two years we have observed APT1 establish a minimum of 937 Command and Control (C2) servers hosted on 849 distinct IP addresses in 13 countries. The majority of these 849 unique IP addresses were registered to organizations in China (709), followed by the U.S. (109). - In the last three years we have observed APT1 use fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) resolving to 988 unique IP addresses. - Over a two-year period (January 2011 to January 2013) we confirmed 1,905 instances of APT1 actors logging into their attack infrastructure from 832 different IP addresses with Remote Desktop, a tool that provides a remote user with an interactive graphical interface to a system. - In the last several years we have confirmed 2,551 FQDNs attributed to APT1. In over 97% of the 1,905 times Mandiant observed APT1 intruders connecting to their attack infrastructure, APT1 used IP addresses registered in Shanghai and systems set to use the Simplified Chinese language. - In 1,849 of the 1,905 (97%) of the Remote Desktop sessions APT1 conducted under our observation, the APT1 operator's keyboard layout setting was “Chinese (Simplified) — US Keyboard”. Microsoft’s Remote Desktop client configures this setting automatically based on the selected language on the client system. Therefore, the APT1 attackers likely have their Microsoft® operating system configured to display Simplified Chinese fonts. - 817 of the 832 (98%) IP addresses logging into APT1 controlled systems using Remote Desktop resolved back to China. - We observed 767 separate instances in which APT1 intruders used the “HUC Packet Transmit Tool” or HTRAN to communicate between 614 distinct routable IP addresses and their victims’ systems using their attack infrastructure. Of the 614 distinct IP addresses used for HTRAN communications: - 614 of 614 (100%) were registered in China. - 613 (99.8%) were registered to one of four Shanghai net blocks. Mandiant APT1 www.mandiant.com Mandiant APT1 www.mandiant.com The size of APT1's infrastructure implies a large organization with at least dozens, but potentially hundreds of human operators. - We conservatively estimate that APT1's current attack infrastructure includes over 1,000 servers. - Given the volume, duration and type of attack activity we have observed, APT1 operators would need to be directly supported by linguists, open source researchers, malware authors, industry experts who translate task requests from requestors to the operators, and people who then transmit stolen information to the requestors. - APT1 would also need a sizable IT staff dedicated to acquiring and maintaining computer equipment, people who handle finances, facility management, and logistics (e.g., shipping). In an effort to underscore that there are actual individuals behind the keyboard, Mandiant is revealing three personas that are associated with APT1 activity. - The first persona, \"UglyGorilla\", has been active in computer network operations since October 2004",

Mandiant is releasing more than 3,000 indicators to bolster defenses against APT1 operations. - Specifically, Mandiant is providing the following: - Digital delivery of over 3,000 APT1 indicators, such as domain names, IP addresses, and MD5 hashes of malware. - Sample Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and detailed descriptions of over 40 families of malware in APT1's arsenal of digital weapons. - Thirteen (13) X.509 encryption certificates used by APT1. - A compilation of videos showing actual attacker sessions and their intrusion activities. - While existing customers of Mandiant's enterprise-level products, Mandiant Managed Defense and Mandiant Intelligent Response®, have had prior access to these APT1 Indicators, we are also making them available for use with Redline™, our free host-based investigative tool.

However, we admit there is one other unlikely possibility: A secret, resourced organization full of mainland Chinese speakers with direct access to Shanghai-based telecommunications infrastructure is engaged in a multi-year, enterprise scale computer espionage campaign right outside of Unit 61398's gates, performing tasks similar to Unit 61398's known mission.",

What started as a \"what if\" discussion about our traditional non-disclosure policy quickly turned into the realization that the positive impact resulting from our decision to expose APT1 outweighed the risk to our ability to collect intelligence on this particular APT group. It is time to acknowledge the threat is originating in China, and we wanted to do our part to arm and prepare security professionals to combat that threat effectively. The issue of attribution has always been a missing link in publicly understanding the landscape of APT cyber espionage. Without establishing a solid connection to China, there will always be room for observers to dismiss APT actions as uncoordinated, solely criminal in nature, or peripheral to larger national security and global economic concerns. We hope that this report will lead to increased understanding and coordinated action in countering APT network breaches. At the same time, there are downsides to publishing all of this information publicly. Many of the techniques and technologies described in this report are vastly more effective when attackers are not aware of them. Additionally, publishing certain kinds of indicators dramatically shortens their lifespan. When Unit 61398 changes their techniques after reading this report, they will undoubtedly force us to work harder to continue tracking them with such accuracy. It is our sincere hope, however, that this report can temporarily increase the costs of Unit 61398's operations and impede their progress in a meaningful way. We are acutely aware of the risk this report poses for us. We expect reprisals from China as well as an onslaught of criticism. Mandiant APT1 www.mandiant.com",

The CPC is the ultimate authority in Mainland China; unlike in Western societies, in which political parties are subordinate to the government, the military and government in China are subordinate to the CPC. In fact, the PLA reports directly to the CPC's Central Military Commission (CMC, 中央军事委员会). This means that any enterprise cyber espionage campaign within the PLA is occurring at the direction of senior members of the CPC. We believe that the PLA's strategic cyber command is situated in the PLA's General Staff Department (GSD,总参谋部), specifically its 3rd Department (总参三部). The GSD is the most senior PLA department. Similar to the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, the GSD establishes doctrine and provides operational guidance for the PLA. Within the GSD, the 3rd Department has a combined focus on signals intelligence, foreign language proficiency, and defense information Mandiant APT1 www.mandiant.com systems. $^{8}$ It is estimated to have $130,000^{9}$ personnel divided between 12 bureaus (局), three research institutes, and 16 regional and functional bureaus. $^{10}$ We believe that the GSD 3rd Department, 2nd Bureau (总参三部二局), is the APT group that we are tracking as APT1. Figure 1 shows how close the 2nd Bureau sits to the highest levels of the CPC. At this level, the 2nd Bureau also sits atop a large-scale organization of subordinate offices.

This bureau already placed fiber-optic cable at the East Gate front entrance [road pole]. They need to use two ports to enter our company's East Gate communication channel. The length is about 30m. At the same time, the second stage construction (in Gaoqiao Base) needs to enter into our company's Shanghai Nanhui Communication Park 005 Center (special-use bureau). This military fiber-optic cable has already been placed at the Shanghai Nanhui Communication Park entrance. They need to use 4 of our company ports inside the Nanhui Communication Park to enter. The length is 600m. Upon our division's negotiation with the 3rd Department 2nd Bureau's communication branch, the military has promised to pay at most 40,000 Yuan for each port. They also hope Shanghai Telecom will smoothly accomplish this task for the military based on the principle that national defense construction is important. After checking the above areas' channels, our company has a relatively abundant inventory to satisfy the military's request. This is our suggestion: because this is concerning defense construction, and also the 3rd Department 2nd Bureau is a very important communication control department, we agree to provide the requested channels according to the military's suggested price. Because this is a one-time payment, and it is difficult to use the normal renting method, we suggest our company accept one-time payment using the reason of \"Military Co-Construction [with China Telecom] of Communication Channels\" and provide from our inventory. The military's co-building does not interfere with our proprietary rights",

FIGURE 10: Timeline showing dates of earliest known APT1 activity in the networks of the 141 organizations in which Mandiant has observed APT1 conducting cyber espionage. ²⁶ Figure 10 shows that we have seen APT1 compromise an increasing number of organizations each year, which may reflect an increase in APT1's activity. However, this increase may also simply reflect Mandiant's expanding visibility into APT1's activities as the company has grown and victims' awareness of cyber espionage activity in their networks has improved. Longest time period within which APT1 has continued to access a victim's network: 4 Years, 10 Months Once APT1 has compromised a network, they repeatedly monitor and steal proprietary data and communications from the victim for months or even years. For the organizations in Figure 10, we found that APT1 maintained access to the victim's network for an average of 356 days.²⁷ The longest time period APT1 maintained access to a victim's network was at least 1,764 days, or four years and ten months. APT1 was not continuously active on a daily basis during this time period; however, in the vast majority of cases we observed, APT1 continued to commit data theft as long as they had access to the network.",

            "text_verbatim": "The organizations targeted by APT1 primarily conduct their operations in English. However, we have also seen the group target a small number of non-English speaking victims. A full 87% of the APT1 victims we have observed are headquartered in countries where English is the native language (see Figure 11). This includes 115 victims located in the U.S. and seven in Canada and the United Kingdom. Of the remaining 19 victims, 17 use English as a primary language for operations. These include international cooperation and development agencies, foreign governments in which English is one of multiple official languages, and multinational conglomerates that primarily conduct their business in English. Only two victims appear to operate using a language other than English. Given that English-language proficiency is required for many members of PLA Unit 61398, we believe that the two non-English speaking victims are anomalies representing instances in which APT1 performed tasks outside of their normal activities. ²⁷ This is based on 91 of the 141 victim organizations shown. In the remaining cases, APT1 activity is either ongoing or else we do not have visibility into the last known date of APT1 activity in the network. Mandiant APT1 www.mandiant.com FIGURE 11: Geographic location of APT1's victims. In the case of victims with a multinational presence, the location shown reflects either the branch of the organization that APT1 compromised (when known), or else is the location of the organization's headquarters. APT1 has demonstrated the capability and intent to steal from dozens of organizations across a wide range of industries virtually simultaneously. Figure 12 provides a view of the earliest known date of APT1 activity against all of the 141 victims we identified, organized by the 20 major industries they represent. The results suggest that APT1's mission is extremely broad; the group does not target industries systematically but more likely steals from an enormous range of industries on a continuous basis. Since the organizations included in the figure represent only the fraction of APT1 victims that we confirmed directly, the range of industries that APT1 targets may be even broader than our findings suggest. Further, the scope of APT1's parallel activities implies that the group has significant personnel and technical resources at its disposal. In the first month of 2011, for example, Figure 12 shows that APT1 successfully compromised 17 new victims operating in 10 different industries. Since we have seen that the group remains active in each victim's network for an average of nearly a year after the initial date of compromise, we infer that APT1 committed these 17 new breaches while simultaneously maintaining access to and continuing to steal data from a number of previously compromised victims.

The types of information the group has stolen relate to: - product development and use, including information on test results, system designs, product manuals, parts lists, and simulation technologies; - manufacturing procedures, such as descriptions of proprietary processes, standards, and waste management processes; - business plans, such as information on contract negotiation positions and product pricing, legal events, mergers, joint ventures, and acquisitions; - policy positions and analysis, such as white papers, and agendas and minutes from meetings involving high-ranking personnel; - emails of high-ranking employees; and - user credentials and network architecture information. It is often difficult for us to estimate how much data APT1 has stolen during their intrusions for several reasons: - APT1 deletes the compressed archives after they pilfer them, leaving solely trace evidence that is usually overwritten during normal business activities. - Pre-existing network security monitoring rarely records or identifies the data theft. - The duration of time between the data theft and Mandiant's investigation is often too great, and the trace evidence of data theft is overwritten during the normal course of business. - Some victims are more intent on assigning resources to restore the security of their network in lieu of investigating and understanding the impact of the security breach. Even with these challenges, we have observed APT1 steals as much as 6.5 terabytes of compressed data from a single organization over a ten-month time period. Given the scope of APT1's operations, including the number of organizations and industries we have seen them target, along with the volume of data they are clearly capable of stealing from any single organization, APT1 has likely stolen hundreds of terabytes from its victims. &gt; Largest APT1 data theft from a single organization: &gt; 6.5 Terabytes &gt; over 10 months Although we do not have direct evidence indicating who receives the information that APT1 steals or how the recipient processes such a vast volume of data, we do believe that this stolen information can be used to obvious advantage by the PRC and Chinese state-owned enterprises. As an example, in 2008, APT1 compromised the network of a company involved in a wholesale industry. APT1 installed tools to create compressed file archives and to extract emails and attachments. Over the following 2.5 years, APT1 stole an unknown number of files from the victim and repeatedly accessed the email accounts of several executives, including the CEO and General Counsel. During this same time period, major news organizations reported that China had successfully negotiated a double-digit decrease in price per unit with the victim organization for one of its major commodities. This may be coincidental; however, it would be surprising if APT1 could continue perpetrating such a broad mandate of cyber espionage and data theft if the results of the group's efforts were not finding their way into the hands of entities able to capitalize on them.

For one thing, information security researchers and journalists refer to APT1 by a variety of names. In addition, many cyber security analysts focus on writing about tools that are shared between multiple Chinese APT groups without differentiating between the various actors that use them. To assist researchers in identifying which public reports describe the threat group that we identify as APT1, Table 3 provides a list of APT group nicknames that frequently appear in the media and differentiates between those that describe APT1 and those that do not.

They have evolved their digital weapons for more than seven years, resulting in continual upgrades as part of their own software release cycle. Their ability to adapt to their environment and spread across systems makes them effective in enterprise environments with trust relationships. These attacks fit into a cyclic pattern of activity that we will describe in this section within the framework of Mandiant's Attack Lifecycle model.

APT1 also creates webmail accounts using real peoples' names — names that are familiar to the recipient, such as a colleague, a company executive, an IT department employee, or company counsel — and uses these accounts to send the emails.

The account \"kevin.mandia@rocketmail.com\" does not belong to Mr. Mandia. Rather, an APT1 actor likely signed up for the account specifically for this spear phishing event.

APT1 establishes a foothold once email recipients open a malicious file and a backdoor is subsequently installed. A backdoor is software that allows an intruder to send commands to the system remotely. In almost every case, APT backdoors initiate outbound connections to the intruder's \"command and control\" (C2) server. APT intruders employ this tactic because while network firewalls are generally adept at keeping malware outside the network from initiating communication with systems inside the network, they are less reliable at keeping malware that is already inside the network from communicating to systems outside. FIGURE 17: Backdoors installed on compromised systems usually initiate connections with C2 servers While APT1 intruders occasionally use publicly available backdoors such as Poison Ivy and Gh0st RAT, the vast majority of the time they use what appear to be their own custom backdoors. We have documented 42 families of backdoors in \"Appendix C: The Malware Arsenal\" that APT1 uses that we believe are not publicly available. In addition we have provided 1,007 MD5 hashes associated with APT1 malware in Appendix E. We will describe APT1's backdoors in two categories: \"Beachhead Backdoors\" and \"Standard Backdoors.\" Mandiant APT1 www.mandiant.com Mandiant APT1 31 www.mandiant.com",

They offer the attacker a toe-hold to perform simple tasks like retrieve files, gather basic system information and trigger the execution of other more significant capabilities such as a standard backdoor. APT1's beachhead backdoors are usually what we call WEBC2 backdoors. WEBC2 backdoors are probably the most well-known kind of APT1 backdoor, and are the reason why some security companies refer to APT1 as the \"Comment Crew.\" A WEBC2 backdoor is designed to retrieve a webpage from a C2 server. It expects the webpage to contain special HTML tags; the backdoor will attempt to interpret the data between the tags as commands. Older versions of WEBC2 read data between HTML comments, though over time WEBC2 variants have evolved to read data contained within other types of tags. From direct observation, we can confirm that APT1 was using WEBC2 backdoors as early as July 2006. However, the first compile time³⁵ we have for WEBC2-KT3 is 2004-01-23, suggesting that APT1 has been crafting WEBC2 backdoors since early 2004. Based on the 400+ samples of WEBC2 variants that we have accumulated, it appears that APT1 has direct access to developers who have continually released new WEBC2 variants for over six years. For example, these two build paths, which were discovered inside WEBC2-TABLE samples, help to illustrate how APT1 has been steadily building new WEBC2 variants as part of a continuous development process:",

The compile date is easily accessible in the PE header of the resulting executable file unless the intruder takes additional steps to obfuscate it. A \"build path\" discloses the directory from which the programmer built and compiled his source code. These samples, compiled 2.5 years apart, were compiled within a folder named \"work\\code\\...\\ mywork\". The instances of \"work\" suggest that working on WEBC2 is someone's day job and not a side project or hobby. Furthermore, the Sample A build string includes \"2012-2-23\" — which matches Sample A's compile date. The Sample B build string lacks \"2012-2-23\" but includes \"2009-8-7\" — which also matches Sample B's compile date. This suggests that the code used to compile Sample A was modified from code that was used to compile Sample B 2.5 years previously. The existence of \"2008-7-8\" suggests that the code for both samples was modified from a version that existed in July 2008, a year before Sample B was created. This series of dates indicates that developing and modifying the WEBC2 backdoor is an iterative and long-term process. WEBC2 backdoors typically give APT1 attackers a short and rudimentary set of commands to issue to victim systems, including: - Open an interactive command shell (usually Windows' cmd.exe) - Download and execute a file - Sleep (i.e. remain inactive) for a specified amount of time WEBC2 backdoors are often packaged with spear phishing emails. Once installed, APT1 intruders have the option to tell victim systems to download and execute additional malicious software of their choice.

Although simple, this method is also very insecure: anyone who can access that same system will be able to see the person's password. Instead, systems that verify passwords usually store password hashes. In simple terms, a password hash is a number that is mathematically generated from the person's password. The mathematical methods (algorithms) used to generate password hashes will create values that are unique for all practical purposes.

If they match, the passwords are presumed to be the same and the person is allowed to log in. It is supposed to be impossible to \"reverse\" a hash to obtain the original password. However, it is possible with enough computational resources to \"crack\" password hashes to discover the original password. (\"Cracking\" generally consists of guessing a large number of passwords, hashing them, and comparing the generated hashes to the existing hashes to see if any match.)
