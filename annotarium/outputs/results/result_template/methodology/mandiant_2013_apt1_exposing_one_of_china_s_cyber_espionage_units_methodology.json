Therefore the most probable conclusion is that APT1 is able to wage such a long-running and extensive cyber espionage campaign because it is acting with the full knowledge and cooperation of the government. Given the mission, resourcing, and location of PLA Unit 61398, we conclude that PLA Unit 61398 is APT1. Table 12 summarizes the parallels between APT1 and PLA Unit 61398.",

By using FQDNs rather than hard-coded IP addresses as C2 addresses, attackers may dynamically decide where to direct C2 connections from a given backdoor. That is, if they lose control of a specific hop point (IP address) they can \"point\" the C2 FQDN address to a different IP address and resume their control over victim backdoors. This flexibility allows the attacker to direct victim systems to myriad C2 servers and avoid being blocked.",

We believe that APT1 is able to wage such a long-running and extensive cyber espionage campaign in large part because it receives direct government support. In seeking to identify the organization behind this activity, our research found that People’s Liberation Army (PLA’s) Unit 61398 is similar to APT1 in its mission, capabilities, and resources. PLA Unit 61398 is also located in precisely the same area from which APT1 activity appears to originate."

The detection and awareness of APT1 is made even more probable by the sheer scale and sustainment of attacks that we have observed and documented in this report. Therefore the most probable conclusion is that APT1 is able to wage such a long-running and extensive cyber espionage campaign because it is acting with the full knowledge and cooperation of the government. Given the mission, resourcing, and location of PLA Unit 61398, we conclude that PLA Unit 61398 is APT1. Table 12 summarizes the parallels between APT1 and PLA Unit 61398."

Though our visibility of APT1’s activities is incomplete, we have analyzed the group’s intrusions against nearly 150 victims over seven years. From our unique vantage point responding to victims, we tracked APT1 back to four large networks in Shanghai, two of which are allocated directly to the Pudong New Area. We uncovered a substantial amount of APT1’s attack infrastructure, command and control, and modus operandi (tools, tactics, and procedures). In an effort to underscore there are actual individuals behind the keyboard, Mandiant is revealing three personas we have attributed to APT1. These operators, like soldiers, may merely be following orders given to them by others."

The FQDNs play an important role in their intrusion campaigns because APT1 embeds FQDNs as C2 addresses within their backdoors. In the last several years we have confirmed 2,551 FQDNs attributed to APT1. Of these, we have redacted FQDNs that implicated victims by name and provided 2,046 in Appendix D. By using FQDNs rather than hard-coded IP addresses as C2 addresses, attackers may dynamically decide where to direct C2 connections from a given backdoor. That is, if they lose control of a specific hop point (IP address) they can \"point\" the C2 FQDN address to a different IP address and resume their control over victim backdoors. This flexibility allows the attacker to direct victim systems to myriad C2 servers and avoid being blocked."

APT1 is a single organization of operators that has conducted a cyber espionage campaign against a broad range of victims since at least 2006. From our observations, it is one of the most prolific cyber espionage groups in terms of the sheer quantity of information stolen.

We believe that APT1 is able to wage such a long-running and extensive cyber espionage campaign in large part because it receives direct government support. In seeking to identify the organization behind this activity, our research found that People’s Liberation Army (PLA’s) Unit 61398 is similar to APT1 in its mission, capabilities, and resources. PLA Unit 61398 is also located in precisely the same area from which APT1 activity appears to originate."

The detection and awareness of APT1 is made even more probable by the sheer scale and sustainment of attacks that we have observed and documented in this report. Therefore the most probable conclusion is that APT1 is able to wage such a long-running and extensive cyber espionage campaign because it is acting with the full knowledge and cooperation of the government. Given the mission, resourcing, and location of PLA Unit 61398, we conclude that PLA Unit 61398 is APT1. Table 12 summarizes the parallels between APT1 and PLA Unit 61398."

From our unique vantage point responding to victims, we tracked APT1 back to four large networks in Shanghai, two of which are allocated directly to the Pudong New Area. We uncovered a substantial amount of APT1’s attack infrastructure, command and control, and modus operandi (tools, tactics, and procedures). In an effort to underscore there are actual individuals behind the keyboard, Mandiant is revealing three personas we have attributed to APT1. These operators, like soldiers, may merely be following orders given to them by others."

The FQDNs play an important role in their intrusion campaigns because APT1 embeds FQDNs as C2 addresses within their backdoors. In the last several years we have confirmed 2,551 FQDNs attributed to APT1. Of these, we have redacted FQDNs that implicated victims by name and provided 2,046 in Appendix D. By using FQDNs rather than hard-coded IP addresses as C2 addresses, attackers may dynamically decide where to direct C2 connections from a given backdoor. That is, if they lose control of a specific hop point (IP address) they can \"point\" the C2 FQDN address to a different IP address and resume their control over victim backdoors. This flexibility allows the attacker to direct victim systems to myriad C2 servers and avoid being blocked."

APT1 is a single organization of operators that has conducted a cyber espionage campaign against a broad range of victims since at least 2006. From our observations, it is one of the most prolific cyber espionage groups in terms of the sheer quantity of information stolen. The scale and impact of APT1’s operations compelled us to write this report."

    "methodology_reference_excerpt": "# Methodology\n\n## I. Methodological Position\n\nThis study treats cyber-attribution reporting as an evidentiary exercise rather than a narrative exercise. The central claim is that attribution assessments should be evaluated as structured arguments about State responsibility, not as standalone assertions of confidence. In consequence, the method asks, for each proposition advanced in a report, what evidentiary materials are relied upon, how those materials are connected to the proposition, and whether those connections can bear weight under adversarial scrutiny.\n\nThe analytical posture is therefore jurisprudential. It draws from recurring ICJ evidentiary practice: differential weighting of heterogeneous materials, caution toward single-origin or litigation-shaped records, and preference for convergent indications over repetition. The objective is not to replicate adjudication procedurally, but to translate judicially legible evidentiary logic into a reproducible scoring framework for cyber-attribution dossiers.\n\n## II. Corpus, Record Formation, and Constraints\n\nThe corpus consists of cybersecurity attribution reports in PDF form. Each report is transcribed into markdown and then transformed into a schema-constrained evidentiary record. The schema is strict by design. It separates claims, sources, artifacts, and evidence links into distinct objects and requires explicit anchors for evidentiary references.\n\nThis design choice has methodological significance. It prevents retrospective reconstruction of support through implicit model inference and compels the system to preserve an inspectable chain between proposition and proof. The method thus prioritizes evidentiary legibility over extraction breadth.\n\n## III. Procedural Architecture\n\nThe workflow proceeds in four phases. First, source documents are transcribed from PDF into markdown. Second, markdown is parsed into structured outputs containing metadata, source inventories, artifact inventories, and claim-level analytic blocks. Third, outputs undergo integrity checks. Fourth, validated outputs are scored under an ICJ-inspired weighting model.\n\nTwo procedural commitments govern all phases. The first is determinacy: where possible, deterministic transformations are preferred, and model-assisted components are constrained by schema and post-run verification. The second is persistence: all major intermediate and terminal artifacts are written to disk, so that any score can be reconstructed and contested from the underlying record.\n\n## IV. Integrity Controls as Admissibility Discipline\n\nNo score is produced absent structural integrity of the evidentiary record. In practical terms, runs are failed where identifier collisions occur, where artifact anchors are missing, where citation pathways cannot be traced, or where references resolve to nonexistent entities. These controls function analogously to admissibility discipline: they do not determine substantive truth, but they determine whether the record is fit to carry a substantive weighing exercise.\n\nThis stage is essential to avoid pseudo-precision. Without strict record integrity, downstream numerical outputs risk expressing parser convenience rather than evidentiary strength.\n\n## V. Evidentiary Weight Model\n\n### A. Item-Level Weight\n\nEach evidence item is evaluated along five bounded dimensions: independence, authentication/provenance, methodological soundness, procedural testing, and contemporaneity. Item-level probative force is computed multiplicatively. The multiplicative form is deliberate: strong performance on one dimension cannot fully compensate for critical weakness on another.\n\n### B. Corroboration and Anti-Circularity\n\nCorroboration is not treated as citation volume. Evidence is clustered by origin, origin-level contribution is aggregated with diminishing returns, and claim-level corroboration is then derived from convergence across origins. This implements an anti-circularity rule: repeated downstream reporting of one upstream source does not become independent support merely by repetition.\n\n### C. Core 3Cs\n\nThe principal outputs are the core 3Cs: Chain of Custody, Credibility, and Clarity. Corroboration is preserved as an explicit sub-calculation and audit surface, but it is integrated into the top-level Credibility axis rather than exposed as a separate top-level C.\n\nChain of Custody is modeled as claim-specific evidentiary handling quality, not as raw artifact quantity. In the current implementation, custody is computed from five normalized variables extracted from evidence text: provenance markers, integrity markers, temporal anchors, artifact identifiers, and versioning/update lineage. These dimensions are weighted and combined linearly, then bounded in `[0,1]`, so that the score remains auditable at claim level and cannot be inflated by a single indicator class.\n\nCredibility is modeled as a composite of source-quality support and corroborative convergence for each claim. The source-quality component is derived from source-type quality, the strongest source attached to the claim, source diversity, and domain independence, with a single-source penalty. Internal/auto sources and newspapers are excluded from credibility support. The model gives maximal weight to international institutions/judicial material and peer-reviewed academic material, intermediate weight to official government and NGO material, and lower weight to think-tank/other material.\n\nIn addition, credibility is calibrated at the document level by a weighted claim-coverage factor keyed to high-credibility source support. Let `Cred_raw_i` denote raw credibility for claim `i`, and let `w_i` denote claim gravity weight. Define a credibility-covered claim as one with at least one high-credibility source (`source_quality >= 0.90`). Then:\n\n`credibility_coverage_factor = (Σ w_i over credibility-covered claims) / (Σ w_i over all claims)`\n\nand:\n\n`Cred_i = Cred_raw_i × credibility_coverage_factor`\n\nThis ensures credibility is interpreted as weighted coverage across the claim set rather than isolated source quality in a small subset of claims.\n\nCorroboration is modeled as convergence constrained by support relevance. A claim with broad wording but narrow evidentiary support receives lower corroborative strength, even where artifact volume is high. In the current presentation model, corroboration is retained as a dedicated subscore and then merged into top-level credibility:\n\n`Credibility_top = 0.50 × Credibility_source_quality + 0.50 × Corroboration`\n\nClarity is modeled as legal attribution intelligibility. Operationally, it answers two linked questions: (i) whether attribution of attack `Z` to State `X` is clearly reasoned in the text, and (ii) whether the mode of responsibility is clear under state-responsibility doctrine. The scorer therefore checks not only act–actor–link specificity, but also whether the report clearly indicates one of three legal pathways: attribution through state organs, attribution through non-state actors operating under state direction/control, or state omission/failure of due diligence (knowledge plus failure to prevent within jurisdiction).\n\nIn practice, the clarity panel and score details expose explicit question-level outputs:\n\n- “Is attribution to State X given attack Z clear?”\n- “Was the state’s responsibility pathway clear: direct conduct by official organs, control/direction of non-state operators, or omission/due diligence failure in its territory?”\n- “Is it clear that the state knew of the activity and failed to prevent, investigate, or suppress it (due diligence)?”\n\nIn addition, corroboration is calibrated at the document level by a claim-coverage factor so that corroboration is interpreted as proportionate coverage across the claim set, not absolute citation mass in isolated claims. Let `C_raw_i` denote raw corroboration for claim `i`, and let `w_i` denote the claim gravity weight. Define a corroborated claim as one for which `C_raw_i > 0`. Th..."

Each claim is scored on calibrated C-axes and then aggregated to document-level indicators under explicit weighting assumptions.</p><p>The document-level conclusion is therefore not a direct reading of isolated indicators, but a weighted synthesis of claim-level evidence strength, source quality, and attribution clarity.</p><p>Execution mode: <code>single</code>. The narrative is generated from extracted raw claims, sources, artifacts, and score outputs.</p></section>\n<section class=\"wiki-section\" id=\"sec-scope_units\"><h2>Scope, Units of Analysis, and Output Semantics</h2><p>Define units of analysis (claim, source, artifact, evidence item, document) and explain what each output score means and does not mean.</p></section>\n<section class=\"wiki-section\" id=\"sec-data_ingestion\"><h2>Data Ingestion and Corpus Handling</h2><p>Explain report ingestion, deterministic file handling, and reproducibility guarantees from raw PDF inputs through intermediate artifacts.</p></section>\n<section class=\"wiki-section\" id=\"sec-pdf_to_markdown\"><h2>PDF-to-Markdown Conversion</h2><p>Explain conversion from PDF to markdown, explicitly describing Mistral-based processing and offline fallback posture as methodological resilience rather than conceptual change.</p></section>\n<section class=\"wiki-section\" id=\"sec-structural_parsing\"><h2>Structural Parsing of Text, Tables, and Figures</h2><p>Describe extraction of text blocks, tables, and figures/images with anchors and why anchor-preserving structure is required for auditability.</p></section>\n<section class=\"wiki-section\" id=\"sec-artifact_extraction\"><h2>Artifact Extraction and Technical Object Normalization</h2><p>Explain artifact extraction across modalities, normalization of technical objects, and implications for custody/provenance evaluation.</p></section>\n<section class=\"wiki-section\" id=\"sec-reference_parsing\"><h2>Footnote and Reference Parsing</h2><p>Explain reference and footnote parsing, citation linkage, and resolution from rhetorical citation to analyzable source graph.</p></section>\n<section class=\"wiki-section\" id=\"sec-institution_inference\"><h2>Institution Inference and Source Typology</h2><p>Explain source institution inference, typology mapping, and how institutional class affects credibility weighting and corroboration eligibility.</p></section>\n<section class=\"wiki-section\" id=\"sec-claim_evidence_graph\"><h2>Claim-Evidence Graph Construction</h2><p>Describe how claims are linked to evidence, sources, and artifacts, including anchor-level traceability and anti-circularity safeguards.</p></section>\n<section class=\"wiki-section\" id=\"sec-scoring_overview\"><h2>Scoring Framework Overview</h2><p>Present the overall scoring architecture from claim-level axes to document-level synthesis.
