<section class="wiki-section" id="sec-introduction"><h2>Introduction and Epistemic Framing</h2><p>This methodology formalizes cyber-attribution assessment as a claim-based evidentiary scoring process. Each claim is scored on calibrated C-axes and then aggregated to document-level indicators under explicit weighting assumptions.</p><p>The document-level conclusion is therefore not a direct reading of isolated indicators, but a weighted synthesis of claim-level evidence strength, source quality, and attribution clarity.</p><p>Execution mode: <code>aggregate</code>. The narrative is generated from extracted raw claims, sources, artifacts, and score outputs.</p></section>
<section class="wiki-section" id="sec-scope_units"><h2>Scope, Units of Analysis, and Output Semantics</h2><p>Define units of analysis (claim, source, artifact, evidence item, document) and explain what each output score means and does not mean.</p></section>
<section class="wiki-section" id="sec-data_ingestion"><h2>Data Ingestion and Corpus Handling</h2><p>Explain report ingestion, deterministic file handling, and reproducibility guarantees from raw PDF inputs through intermediate artifacts.</p></section>
<section class="wiki-section" id="sec-pdf_to_markdown"><h2>PDF-to-Markdown Conversion</h2><p>Explain conversion from PDF to markdown, explicitly describing Mistral-based processing and offline fallback posture as methodological resilience rather than conceptual change.</p></section>
<section class="wiki-section" id="sec-structural_parsing"><h2>Structural Parsing of Text, Tables, and Figures</h2><p>Describe extraction of text blocks, tables, and figures/images with anchors and why anchor-preserving structure is required for auditability.</p></section>
<section class="wiki-section" id="sec-artifact_extraction"><h2>Artifact Extraction and Technical Object Normalization</h2><p>Explain artifact extraction across modalities, normalization of technical objects, and implications for custody/provenance evaluation.</p></section>
<section class="wiki-section" id="sec-reference_parsing"><h2>Footnote and Reference Parsing</h2><p>Explain reference and footnote parsing, citation linkage, and resolution from rhetorical citation to analyzable source graph.</p></section>
<section class="wiki-section" id="sec-institution_inference"><h2>Institution Inference and Source Typology</h2><p>Explain source institution inference, typology mapping, and how institutional class affects credibility weighting and corroboration eligibility.</p></section>
<section class="wiki-section" id="sec-claim_evidence_graph"><h2>Claim-Evidence Graph Construction</h2><p>Describe how claims are linked to evidence, sources, and artifacts, including anchor-level traceability and anti-circularity safeguards.</p></section>
<section class="wiki-section" id="sec-scoring_overview"><h2>Scoring Framework Overview</h2><p>Present the overall scoring architecture from claim-level axes to document-level synthesis. Clarify separation between extraction outputs and inferential weighting.</p></section>
<section class="wiki-section" id="sec-chain_of_custody"><h2>Chain of Custody Axis</h2><p>Explain chain-of-custody variables (provenance, integrity, time anchors, artifact identifiers, versioning), quality controls, and penalties.</p></section>
<section class="wiki-section" id="sec-credibility_corroboration"><h2>Credibility Axis with Corroboration Subcomponent</h2><p>Explain source hierarchy, independence logic, corroboration rules, claim coverage scaling, and exclusion criteria for low-value source classes.</p></section>
<section class="wiki-section" id="sec-clarity_axis"><h2>Clarity Axis and State Responsibility Pathways</h2><p>Explain clarity scoring for attribution to state actors through organs, control over non-state actors, and due diligence failure pathways.</p></section>
<section class="wiki-section" id="sec-aggregation_calibration"><h2>Aggregation, Calibration, and Uncertainty</h2><p>Explain claim-to-document aggregation, weighting, calibration, and uncertainty handling (e.g., confidence intervals/dispersion diagnostics) in interpretation.</p></section>
<section class="wiki-section" id="sec-validation_quality_assurance"><h2>Validation and Quality Assurance</h2><p>Explain automated validation gates and QA protocol with agent review and targeted human review on a 10% sample with no observed errors in that sample.</p></section>
<section class="wiki-section" id="sec-limitations_governance"><h2>Limitations, Governance, and Future Refinement</h2><p>Discuss methodological limits, governance controls, and principled refinement roadmap without overstating certainty.</p></section>
