Recent examination of this group's activities by FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence reveals APT37 has expanded its operations in both scope and sophistication. APT37's toolset, which includes access to zero-day vulnerabilities and wiper malware, combined with heightened tensions in Northeast Asia and North Korea's penchant for norm breaking, means this group should be taken seriously.\n\nWe assess with high confidence that this activity is carried out on behalf of the North Korean government given malware development artifacts and targeting that aligns with North Korean state interests. FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence believes that APT37 is aligned with the activity publicly reported as Scarcraft and Group123.\n\nSPECIAL REPORT\n\nAPT37 (REAPER): THE OVERLOOKED NORTH KOREAN ACTOR\n\n# Targeting and Mission\n\nAPT37 has likely been active since at least 2012 and focuses on targeting the public and private sectors primarily in South Korea. In 2017, APT37 expanded its targeting beyond the Korean peninsula to include Japan, Vietnam and the Middle East, and to a wider range of industry, verticals, including chemicals, electronics, manufacturing, aerospace, automotive and healthcare entities (Fig. 1).\n\nFigure 1. APT37 Targeting Scope\n\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)\n\nWe judge that APT37's primary mission is covert intelligence gathering in support of North Korea's strategic military, political and economic interests. This is based on consistent targeting of South Korean public and private entities and social engineering. APT37's recently expanded targeting scope also appears to have direct relevance to North Korea's strategic interests.\n\nFrom 2014 to 2017, APT37 targeting concentrated primarily on the South Korean government, military, defense industrial base, and media sector. Lure materials (Fig. 2) typically leveraged the Korean language and featured themes such as Korean peninsula reunification or sanctions.\n\nFigure 2. \"2016 Korean Reunification Conference Form\" (MD5:183be2035d5a546670d2b9deeca4eb59).\n\n|  [천연도극제속성 2016 총정 제한 학술대치] 심지치  |   |   |   |   |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  심지치의 소속 및 전원  |   |   |   |   |\n|  ■ 신청자 정보  |   |   |   |   |\n|  이름 | 신청번호 | 위키피소  |   |   |\n|  내용 | 첫인보 영상용 서적: 이북전부 2016 2016년 10월 30일  |   |   |   |\n|  ■ 심지 법적 (백명피스 공식 스포를 해석 주십시오)  |   |   |   |   |\n|  ■ 심지치의 백명 법적  |   |   |   |   |\n|  심지치  |   |   |   |   |\n|  성명 |   | 성명 | 성명 | 성명  |\n|  성(제4의 저자) |   |  |  |   |\n|  성(제5의 저자) 2016년 10월 30일 |   |  |  |   |\n|  성(제6의 저자) 2016년 10월 30일 |   |  |  |   |\n|  성(제7의 제1의 저자) 2016년 10월 30일 |   |  |  |   |\n|  성(제8의 10대 저자) 2016년 10월 30일 |   |  |  |   |\n|  성(제9의 제2의 저자) 2016년 10월 30일 |   |  |  |   |\n|  성(제10의 제3의 저자) 2016년 10월 30일 |   |  |  |   |\n|  계속  |   |   |   |   |\n|  a. 제자 자격, b. 자격, c. 성명, d. 이명, e. 제자 가명  |   |   |   |   |\n|  ■ 본정 법적 (백명피스 공제 스포를 해석 주십시오) - 저자, 백명, 법적 통찰기 외에 기인인 경우 “별표기”  |   |   |   |   |\n|  부서, 자 | 법정 법적  |   |   |   |\n|  ■ 당국명  |   |   |   |   |\n|  * 법정 기획서, 정서, 신호사기 발송을 위한 시 법정별 서명 지표시스템, 민영영화에 기재 * 법정 발간일 경우 필기 기획서, 법정 인증확인 기재  |   |   |   |   |\n\nSPECIAL REPORT\n\nAPT37 (REAPER): THE OVERLOOKED NORTH KOREAN ACTOR\n\nIn 2017, APT37 targeted a Middle Eastern company that entered into a joint venture with the North Korean government to provide telecommunications service to the country (read on for a case study). At that time, other targets included individuals involved in international affairs and trade issues, the general director of a Vietnamese international trading and transport company, and possibly individuals working with Olympics organizations assisting in securing resources for athletes.\n\nNorth Korean defector and human rights-related targeting provides further evidence that APT37 conducts operations aligned with the interests of North Korea.\n\nAPT37 targeted a research fellow, advisory member, and journalist associated with different North Korean human rights issues and strategic organizations. It also targeted an entity in Japan associated with the United Nations missions on sanctions and human rights. APT37 distributed SLOWDRIFT malware using a lure referencing the Korea Global Forum against academic and strategic institutions located in South Korea. Notably, the email was sent from a compromised South Korean institute that conducts studies on North Korea. The string \"durihana,\" which is also the name of a Christian missionary organization that works with North Korean defectors, was included in an APT37 weaponized document sent to an individual who works with a North Korean human rights organization.\n\n## CASE STUDY:\n\n## Targeting of Middle Eastern Organization with Business ties to North Korea\n\nWe believe a Middle Eastern organization was targeted by APT37 because it had been involved with a North Korean company and a business deal went bad. This firm was targeted shortly after media reports of this schism had gone public. The targeting effort may have been an attempt by the North Korean government to gather information on a former business partner. The operation exemplifies APT37's tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs), and reflects the advanced capabilities of this espionage group.\n\nIn May 2017, APT37 used a bank liquidation letter as a spear phishing lure against a board member of a Middle Eastern financial company. The specially crafted email included an attachment containing exploit code for CVE-2017-0199, a vulnerability in Microsoft Office that had been disclosed just a month earlier. Once opened, the malicious document communicated with a compromised website, most likely to surreptitiously download and install a backdoor called SHUTTERSPEED (MDS: 7c2ebfc7960aac6f8d58b37a3f092a9c). The tool would enable APT37 to collect system information, take screenshots and download additional malicious files to the victim computer.\n\n## Initial Infection Vectors\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned spear phishing tactics, APT37 leverages a variety of methods to deliver malware. These include strategic web compromises typical of targeted cyber espionage operations, as well as the use of torrent file-sharing sites to distribute malware more indiscriminately.\n\nNumerous campaigns have employed social engineering tactics tailored specifically to desired targets. Lures and websites of particular interest to South Korean organizations (e.g. reunification) are regularly leveraged in campaigns. Multiple South Korean websites were abused in strategic web compromises to deliver newer variants of KARAE and POORAIM malware. Identified sites included South Korean conservative media and a news site for North Korean refugees and defectors. In one instance, APT37 weaponized a video downloader application with KARAE malware that was indiscriminately distributed to South Korean victims through torrent websites.\n\n![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)\n\nSPECIAL REPORT\n\nAPT37 (REAPER): THE OVERLOOKED NORTH KOREAN ACTOR\n\n![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)\nFigure 3. Timeline of CVE Release Dates vs. Dates of APT37 CVE Exploitation.\n\n# Exploited Vulnerabilities\n\nAPT37 frequently exploits vulnerabilities in Hangul Word Processor (HWP) due to the software's prevalence in South Korea. Further, the group recently demonstrated access to zero-day vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-0802) and has the flexibility to quickly incorporate recently publicized vulnerabilities into spear phishing and strategic web compromise operations. These capabilities suggest a high operational tempo and specialized expertise.\n\nAPT37 has repeatedly deployed exploits, especially in Flash, quickly after vulnerabilities are initially publicized (see Table 1). CVE-2016-4117, CVE-2016-1019 and CVE-2015-3043 were all exploited by APT37 in this way. FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence confirmed that since at least November 2017, APT37\n\nexploited a zero-day Adobe Flash vulnerability, CVE-2018-4878, to distribute DOGCALL malware to South Korean victims.\n\nWhile use and discovery of zero-day exploits over the past several years has expanded beyond a nation-state dominated environment to include commercial vendors of cyber espionage capabilities and sophisticated financially motivated actors, access to zero-day exploits remains a factor in distinguishing sophisticated or well-resourced actors.\n\nFigure 3 details the vulnerabilities exploited by APT37, comparing the time of exploitation to the time the CVE was released.\n\n# Command and Control Infrastructure\n\nAPT37 uses a variety of techniques for command and control. They leverage compromised servers, messaging platforms and cloud service providers to avoid detection. The group often relies on compromised sites to host second stage malware payloads. Over time, APT37 has changed the email providers to set up command and control accounts in a possible attempt to cover their tracks and cause misdirection. These tactics have been refined over the years as APT37 evolves to evade network defenders.\n\nAPT37 has used various legitimate platforms as command and control for its malware tools. While some early campaigns leveraged POORAIM, which abused AOL Instant Messenger, newer activity deploys DOGCALL, which uses cloud storage APIs such as pCloud and Dropbox.\n\nAPT37 relies on compromised websites to host second stage malware. Small websites focused on subjects such as aromatherapy and scuba diving have been leveraged, and were most likely compromised opportunistically and made to host malicious payloads.\n\nAPT37 has improved its operational security over time. For example, early 2015 use of SLOWDRIFT involved credentials associated with Korea related mail servers such as \"Daum.net\". Later, in 2015 and early 2016, APT37 pivoted to different email providers such as Gmail and \"hmamail.com\" in an attempt to anonymize activity. Then from mid-2016 onward, APT37 began using @yandex.com and @ india.com email accounts — possibly an attempt to cause misattribution.\n\nSPECIAL REPORT\n\nAPT37 (REAPER): THE OVERLOOKED NORTH KOREAN ACTOR\n\n# Malware\n\nAPT37 employs a diverse suite of malware for initial intrusion and exfiltration. Their malware is characterized by a focus on stealing information from victims, with many set up to automatically exfiltrate data of interest. Figure 4 shows APT37's malware usage over time. A full breakdown of the malware we associate with APT37, along with how it is detected by FireEye devices, is available in the Appendix.\n\nAlong with custom malware used for espionage purposes, APT37 also has access to destructive malware. In April 2017, APT37 targeted South Korean military and government organizations with the DOGCALL backdoor and RUHAPPY wiper malware. Although the wiper capability was not used in the identified instance, RUHAPPY can overwrite a machine's Master Boot Record (MBR), causing the system to fail to boot into preconfigured partitions.\n\nIt is possible that APT37's distribution of KARAE malware via torrent websites could assist in creating and maintaining botnets for future distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, or for other activity such as financially motivated campaigns or disruptive operations. Disruptive and destructive cyber threat activity, including the use of wiper malware, public leaks of proprietary materials by false hacktivist personas, DDoS attacks and electronic warfare tactics such as GPS signal jamming is consistent with past behavior by other North Korean actors.\n\n![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)\nFigure 4. Timeline of APT37 Malware Use By First and Last Observed Compile Times.\n\nSPECIAL REPORT\n\nART37 DREAMER: THE OVERLOOKED NORTH KOREAN ACTOR\n\n# Attribution\n\nWe assess with high confidence that APT37 acts in support of the North Korean government and is primarily based in North Korea. This assessment is based on multiple factors, including APT37's targeting profile, insight into the group's malware development and probable links to a North Korean individual believed to be the developer of several of APT37's proprietary malware families:\n\n- An individual we believe to be the developer behind several APT37 malware payloads inadvertently disclosed personal data showing that the actor was operating from an IP address and access point associated with North Korea.\n- The compilation times of APT37 malware is consistent with a developer operating in the North Korea time zone (UTC +8:30) and follows what is believed to be a typical North Korean workday (Fig. 5). The majority of malware compilation times occurred between 10:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m., with a dip around noon. Additional activity occurred late into the evening. This is consistent with media reporting of extremely long hours for North Korean workers.\n- The majority of APT37 activity continues to target South Korea, North Korean defectors, and organizations and individuals involved in Korean Peninsula reunification efforts. Similarly, APT37 targeting of a Middle Eastern company in 2017 is also consistent with North Korean objectives given the entity's extensive relationships inside North Korea.\n\n![img-5.jpeg](img-5.jpeg)\nFrequency\n\n![img-6.jpeg](img-6.jpeg)\n\n# Outlook and Implications\n\nNorth Korea has repeatedly demonstrated a willingness to leverage its cyber capabilities for a variety of purposes, unmetered by national, hellines and international norms. Though they have primarily tapped other tracked suspected North Korean teams to carry out the most aggressive actions, APT37 is an additional tool available to the regime, perhaps even desirable for its relative obscurity. We anticipate APT37 will be leveraged more and more in previously unfamiliar roles and regions, especially as pressure mounts on their sponsor.\n\nThe slow transformation of regional actors into global threats is well established. Minor incidents in Ukraine, the Middle East and South Korea have heralded the threats, which are now impossible to ignore. In some cases, the global economy connects organizations to aggressive regional actors. In other cases, a growing mandate draws the actor on to the international stage, ignored, these threats enjoy the benefit of surprise, allowing them to extract significant losses on their victims, many of whom have never previously heard of the actor.\n\nSPECIAL REPORT\n\nAPT37 (REAPER): THE OVERLOOKED NORTH KOREAN ACTOR\n\n# Appendix: Malware Used by APT37\n\n|  Malware | Description | Detected as  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  CORALDECK | CORALDECK is an exfiltration tool that searches for specified files and exfiltrates them in password protected archives using hardcoded HTTP POST headers.

FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence confirmed that since at least November 2017, APT37\nexploited a zero-day Adobe Flash vulnerability, CVE-2018-4878, to distribute DOGCALL malware to South Korean victims.\nWhile use and discovery of zero-day exploits over the past several years has expanded beyond a nation-state dominated environment to include commercial vendors of cyber espionage capabilities and sophisticated financially motivated actors, access to zero-day exploits remains a factor in distinguishing sophisticated or well-resourced actors.\nFigure 3 details the vulnerabilities exploited by APT37, comparing the time of exploitation to the time the CVE was released.\n# Command and Control Infrastructure\nAPT37 uses a variety of techniques for command and control. They leverage compromised servers, messaging platforms and cloud service providers to avoid detection. The group often relies on compromised sites to host second stage malware payloads. Over time, APT37 has changed the email providers to set up command and control accounts in a possible attempt to cover their tracks and cause misdirection. These tactics have been refined over the years as APT37 evolves to evade network defenders.\nAPT37 has used various legitimate platforms as command and control for its malware tools. While some early campaigns leveraged POORAIM, which abused AOL Instant Messenger, newer activity deploys DOGCALL, which uses cloud storage APIs such as pCloud and Dropbox.\nAPT37 relies on compromised websites to host second stage malware. Small websites focused on subjects such as aromatherapy and scuba diving have been leveraged, and were most likely compromised opportunistically and made to host malicious payloads.\nAPT37 has improved its operational security over time. For example, early 2015 use of SLOWDRIFT involved credentials associated with Korea related mail servers such as \"Daum.net\". Later, in 2015 and early 2016, APT37 pivoted to different email providers such as Gmail and \"hmamail.com\" in an attempt to anonymize activity. Then from mid-2016 onward, APT37 began using @yandex.com and @ india.com email accounts — possibly an attempt to cause misattribution.\nSPECIAL REPORT\nAPT37 (REAPER): THE OVERLOOKED NORTH KOREAN ACTOR\n# Malware\nAPT37 employs a diverse suite of malware for initial intrusion and exfiltration. Their malware is characterized by a focus on stealing information from victims, with many set up to automatically exfiltrate data of interest. Figure 4 shows APT37's malware usage over time. A full breakdown of the malware we associate with APT37, along with how it is detected by FireEye devices, is available in the Appendix.\nAlong with custom malware used for espionage purposes, APT37 also has access to destructive malware. In April 2017, APT37 targeted South Korean military and government organizations with the DOGCALL backdoor and RUHAPPY wiper malware. Although the wiper capability was not used in the identified instance, RUHAPPY can overwrite a machine's Master Boot Record (MBR), causing the system to fail to boot into preconfigured partitions.\nIt is possible that APT37's distribution of KARAE malware via torrent websites could assist in creating and maintaining botnets for future distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, or for other activity such as financially motivated campaigns or disruptive operations. Disruptive and destructive cyber threat activity, including the use of wiper malware, public leaks of proprietary materials by false hacktivist personas, DDoS attacks and electronic warfare tactics such as GPS signal jamming is consistent with past behavior by other North Korean actors.\nFigure 4. Timeline of APT37 Malware Use By First and Last Observed Compile Times.\nSPECIAL REPORT\nART37 DREAMER: THE OVERLOOKED NORTH KOREAN ACTOR\n# Attribution\nWe assess with high confidence that APT37 acts in support of the North Korean government and is primarily based in North Korea. This assessment is based on multiple factors, including APT37's targeting profile, insight into the group's malware development and probable links to a North Korean individual believed to be the developer of several of APT37's proprietary malware families:\n- An individual we believe to be the developer behind several APT37 malware payloads inadvertently disclosed personal data showing that the actor was operating from an IP address and access point associated with North Korea.\n- The compilation times of APT37 malware is consistent with a developer operating in the North Korea time zone (UTC +8:30) and follows what is believed to be a typical North Korean workday (Fig. 5). The majority of malware compilation times occurred between 10:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m., with a dip around noon. Additional activity occurred late into the evening. This is consistent with media reporting of extremely long hours for North Korean workers.\n- The majority of APT37 activity continues to target South Korea, North Korean defectors, and organizations and individuals involved in Korean Peninsula reunification efforts. Similarly, APT37 targeting of a Middle Eastern company in 2017 is also consistent with North Korean objectives given the entity's extensive relationships inside North Korea.\nFrequency\n# Outlook and Implications\nNorth Korea has repeatedly demonstrated a willingness to leverage its cyber capabilities for a variety of purposes, unmetered by national, hellines and international norms. Though they have primarily tapped other tracked suspected North Korean teams to carry out the most aggressive actions, APT37 is an additional tool available to the regime, perhaps even desirable for its relative obscurity. We anticipate APT37 will be leveraged more and more in previously unfamiliar roles and regions, especially as pressure mounts on their sponsor.\nThe slow transformation of regional actors into global threats is well established. Minor incidents in Ukraine, the Middle East and South Korea have heralded the threats, which are now impossible to ignore. In some cases, the global economy connects organizations to aggressive regional actors. In other cases, a growing mandate draws the actor on to the international stage, ignored, these threats enjoy the benefit of surprise, allowing them to extract significant losses on their victims, many of whom have never previously heard of the actor.\nSPECIAL REPORT\nAPT37 (REAPER): THE OVERLOOKED NORTH KOREAN ACTOR\n# Appendix: Malware Used by APT37\n|  Malware | Description | Detected as  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  CORALDECK | CORALDECK is an exfiltration tool that searches for specified files and exfiltrates them in password protected archives using hardcoded HTTP POST headers.

Recent examination of this group's activities by FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence reveals APT37 has expanded its operations in both scope and sophistication. APT37's toolset, which includes access to zero-day vulnerabilities and wiper malware, combined with heightened tensions in Northeast Asia and North Korea's penchant for norm breaking, means this group should be taken seriously.\n\nWe assess with high confidence that this activity is carried out on behalf of the North Korean government given malware development artifacts and targeting that aligns with North Korean state interests. FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence believes that APT37 is aligned with the activity publicly reported as Scarcraft and Group123.\n\nSPECIAL REPORT\n\nAPT37 (REAPER): THE OVERLOOKED NORTH KOREAN ACTOR\n\n# Targeting and Mission\n\nAPT37 has likely been active since at least 2012 and focuses on targeting the public and private sectors primarily in South Korea. In 2017, APT37 expanded its targeting beyond the Korean peninsula to include Japan, Vietnam and the Middle East, and to a wider range of industry, verticals, including chemicals, electronics, manufacturing, aerospace, automotive and healthcare entities (Fig. 1).\n\nFigure 1. APT37 Targeting Scope\n\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg) We judge that APT37's primary mission is covert intelligence gathering in support of North Korea's strategic military, political and economic interests. This is based on consistent targeting of South Korean public and private entities and social engineering. APT37's recently expanded targeting scope also appears to have direct relevance to North Korea's strategic interests.\n\nFrom 2014 to 2017, APT37 targeting concentrated primarily on the South Korean government, military, defense industrial base, and media sector. Lure materials (Fig. 2) typically leveraged the Korean language and featured themes such as Korean peninsula reunification or sanctions.\n\nFigure 2. \"2016 Korean Reunification Conference Form\" (MD5:183be2035d5a546670d2b9deeca4eb59).\n\n|  [천연도극제속성 2016 총정 제한 학술대치] 심지치  |   |   |   |   |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  심지치의 소속 및 전원  |   |   |   |   |\n|  ■ 신청자 정보  |   |   |   |   |\n|  이름 | 신청번호 | 위키피소  |   |   |\n|  내용 | 첫인보 영상용 서적: 이북전부 2016 2016년 10월 30일  |   |   |   |\n|  ■ 심지 법적 (백명피스 공식 스포를 해석 주십시오)  |   |   |   |   |\n|  ■ 심지치의 백명 법적  |   |   |   |   |\n|  심지치  |   |   |   |   |\n|  성명 |   | 성명 | 성명 | 성명  |\n|  성(제4의 저자) |   |  |  |   |\n|  성(제5의 저자) 2016년 10월 30일 |   |  |  |   |\n|  성(제6의 저자) 2016년 10월 30일 |   |  |  |   |\n|  성(제7의 제1의 저자) 2016년 10월 30일 |   |  |  |   |\n|  성(제8의 10대 저자) 2016년 10월 30일 |   |  |  |   |\n|  성(제9의 제2의 저자) 2016년 10월 30일 |   |  |  |   |\n|  성(제10의 제3의 저자) 2016년 10월 30일 |   |  |  |   |\n|  계속  |   |   |   |   |\n|  a. 제자 자격, b. 자격, c. 성명, d. 이명, e. 제자 가명  |   |   |   |   |\n|  ■ 본정 법적 (백명피스 공제 스포를 해석 주십시오) - 저자, 백명, 법적 통찰기 외에 기인인 경우 “별표기”  |   |   |   |   |\n|  부서, 자 | 법정 법적  |   |   |   |\n|  ■ 당국명  |   |   |   |   |\n|  * 법정 기획서, 정서, 신호사기 발송을 위한 시 법정별 서명 지표시스템, 민영영화에 기재 * 법정 발간일 경우 필기 기획서, 법정 인증확인 기재  |   |   |   |   |\n\nSPECIAL REPORT\n\nAPT37 (REAPER): THE OVERLOOKED NORTH KOREAN ACTOR\n\nIn 2017, APT37 targeted a Middle Eastern company that entered into a joint venture with the North Korean government to provide telecommunications service to the country (read on for a case study). At that time, other targets included individuals involved in international affairs and trade issues, the general director of a Vietnamese international trading and transport company, and possibly individuals working with Olympics organizations assisting in securing resources for athletes.\n\nNorth Korean defector and human rights-related targeting provides further evidence that APT37 conducts operations aligned with the interests of North Korea.\n\nAPT37 targeted a research fellow, advisory member, and journalist associated with different North Korean human rights issues and strategic organizations. It also targeted an entity in Japan associated with the United Nations missions on sanctions and human rights. APT37 distributed SLOWDRIFT malware using a lure referencing the Korea Global Forum against academic and strategic institutions located in South Korea. Notably, the email was sent from a compromised South Korean institute that conducts studies on North Korea. The string\"durihana,\"which is also the name of a Christian missionary organization that works with North Korean defectors, was included in an APT37 weaponized document sent to an individual who works with a North Korean human rights organization.\n\n## CASE STUDY:\n\n## Targeting of Middle Eastern Organization with Business ties to North Korea\n\nWe believe a Middle Eastern organization was targeted by APT37 because it had been involved with a North Korean company and a business deal went bad. This firm was targeted shortly after media reports of this schism had gone public. The targeting effort may have been an attempt by the North Korean government to gather information on a former business partner. The operation exemplifies APT37's tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs), and reflects the advanced capabilities of this espionage group.\n\nIn May 2017, APT37 used a bank liquidation letter as a spear phishing lure against a board member of a Middle Eastern financial company. The specially crafted email included an attachment containing exploit code for CVE-2017-0199, a vulnerability in Microsoft Office that had been disclosed just a month earlier. Once opened, the malicious document communicated with a compromised website, most likely to surreptitiously download and install a backdoor called SHUTTERSPEED (MDS: 7c2ebfc7960aac6f8d58b37a3f092a9c). The tool would enable APT37 to collect system information, take screenshots and download additional malicious files to the victim computer.\n\n## Initial Infection Vectors\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned spear phishing tactics, APT37 leverages a variety of methods to deliver malware. These include strategic web compromises typical of targeted cyber espionage operations, as well as the use of torrent file-sharing sites to distribute malware more indiscriminately.\n\nNumerous campaigns have employed social engineering tactics tailored specifically to desired targets. Lures and websites of particular interest to South Korean organizations (e.g. reunification) are regularly leveraged in campaigns. Multiple South Korean websites were abused in strategic web compromises to deliver newer variants of KARAE and POORAIM malware. Identified sites included South Korean conservative media and a news site for North Korean refugees and defectors. In one instance, APT37 weaponized a video downloader application with KARAE malware that was indiscriminately distributed to South Korean victims through torrent websites.\n\n![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)\n\nSPECIAL REPORT\n\nAPT37 (REAPER): THE OVERLOOKED NORTH KOREAN ACTOR\n\n![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)\nFigure 3. Timeline of CVE Release Dates vs. Dates of APT37 CVE Exploitation.\n\n# Exploited Vulnerabilities\n\nAPT37 frequently exploits vulnerabilities in Hangul Word Processor (HWP) due to the software's prevalence in South Korea. Further, the group recently demonstrated access to zero-day vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-0802) and has the flexibility to quickly incorporate recently publicized vulnerabilities into spear phishing and strategic web compromise operations. These capabilities suggest a high operational tempo and specialized expertise.\n\nAPT37 has repeatedly deployed exploits, especially in Flash, quickly after vulnerabilities are initially publicized (see Table 1). CVE-2016-4117, CVE-2016-1019 and CVE-2015-3043 were all exploited by APT37 in this way. FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence confirmed that since at least November 2017, APT37 exploited a zero-day Adobe Flash vulnerability, CVE-2018-4878, to distribute DOGCALL malware to South Korean victims.\n\nWhile use and discovery of zero-day exploits over the past several years has expanded beyond a nation-state dominated environment to include commercial vendors of cyber espionage capabilities and sophisticated financially motivated actors, access to zero-day exploits remains a factor in distinguishing sophisticated or well-resourced actors.\n\nFigure 3 details the vulnerabilities exploited by APT37, comparing the time of exploitation to the time the CVE was released.\n\n# Command and Control Infrastructure\n\nAPT37 uses a variety of techniques for command and control. They leverage compromised servers, messaging platforms and cloud service providers to avoid detection. The group often relies on compromised sites to host second stage malware payloads. Over time, APT37 has changed the email providers to set up command and control accounts in a possible attempt to cover their tracks and cause misdirection.

Recent examination of this group's activities by FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence reveals APT37 has expanded its operations in both scope and sophistication. APT37's toolset, which includes access to zero-day vulnerabilities and wiper malware, combined with heightened tensions in Northeast Asia and North Korea's penchant for norm breaking, means this group should be taken seriously.</p>\n<p>We assess with high confidence that this activity is carried out on behalf of the North Korean government given malware development artifacts and targeting that aligns with North Korean state interests.

In 2017, APT37 expanded its targeting beyond the Korean peninsula to include Japan, Vietnam and the Middle East, and to a wider range of industry, verticals, including chemicals, electronics, manufacturing, aerospace, automotive and healthcare entities (Fig. 1).</p>\n<p>Figure 1.

At that time, other targets included individuals involved in international affairs and trade issues, the general director of a Vietnamese international trading and transport company, and possibly individuals working with Olympics organizations assisting in securing resources for athletes.</p>\n<p>North Korean defector and human rights-related targeting provides further evidence that APT37 conducts operations aligned with the interests of North Korea.</p>\n<p>APT37 targeted a research fellow, advisory member, and journalist associated with different North Korean human rights issues and strategic organizations. It also targeted an entity in Japan associated with the United Nations missions on sanctions and human rights. APT37 distributed SLOWDRIFT malware using a lure referencing the Korea Global Forum against academic and strategic institutions located in South Korea. Notably, the email was sent from a compromised South Korean institute that conducts studies on North Korea. The string\"durihana,\"which is also the name of a Christian missionary organization that works with North Korean defectors, was included in an APT37 weaponized document sent to an individual who works with a North Korean human rights organization.</p>\n<h2>CASE STUDY:</h2>\n<h2>Targeting of Middle Eastern Organization with Business ties to North Korea</h2>\n<p>We believe a Middle Eastern organization was targeted by APT37 because it had been involved with a North Korean company and a business deal went bad. This firm was targeted shortly after media reports of this schism had gone public. The targeting effort may have been an attempt by the North Korean government to gather information on a former business partner. The operation exemplifies APT37's tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs), and reflects the advanced capabilities of this espionage group.</p>\n<p>In May 2017, APT37 used a bank liquidation letter as a spear phishing lure against a board member of a Middle Eastern financial company. The specially crafted email included an attachment containing exploit code for CVE-2017-0199, a vulnerability in Microsoft Office that had been disclosed just a month earlier. Once opened, the malicious document communicated with a compromised website, most likely to surreptitiously download and install a backdoor called SHUTTERSPEED (MDS: 7c2ebfc7960aac6f8d58b37a3f092a9c). The tool would enable APT37 to collect system information, take screenshots and download additional malicious files to the victim computer.</p>\n<h2>Initial Infection Vectors</h2>\n<p>In addition to the aforementioned spear phishing tactics, APT37 leverages a variety of methods to deliver malware. These include strategic web compromises typical of targeted cyber espionage operations, as well as the use of torrent file-sharing sites to distribute malware more indiscriminately.</p>\n<p>Numerous campaigns have employed social engineering tactics tailored specifically to desired targets. Lures and websites of particular interest to South Korean organizations (e.g. reunification) are regularly leveraged in campaigns. Multiple South Korean websites were abused in strategic web compromises to deliver newer variants of KARAE and POORAIM malware. Identified sites included South Korean conservative media and a news site for North Korean refugees and defectors. In one instance, APT37 weaponized a video downloader application with KARAE malware that was indiscriminately distributed to South Korean victims through torrent websites.</p>\n<p>![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)</p>\n<p>SPECIAL REPORT</p>\n<p>APT37 (REAPER): THE OVERLOOKED NORTH KOREAN ACTOR</p>\n<p>![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg) Figure 3. Timeline of CVE Release Dates vs. Dates of APT37 CVE Exploitation.</p>\n<h1>Exploited Vulnerabilities</h1>\n<p>APT37 frequently exploits vulnerabilities in Hangul Word Processor (HWP) due to the software's prevalence in South Korea. Further, the group recently demonstrated access to zero-day vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-0802) and has the flexibility to quickly incorporate recently publicized vulnerabilities into spear phishing and strategic web compromise operations. These capabilities suggest a high operational tempo and specialized expertise.</p>\n<p>APT37 has repeatedly deployed exploits, especially in Flash, quickly after vulnerabilities are initially publicized (see Table 1). CVE-2016-4117, CVE-2016-1019 and CVE-2015-3043 were all exploited by APT37 in this way. FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence confirmed that since at least November 2017, APT37 exploited a zero-day Adobe Flash vulnerability, CVE-2018-4878, to distribute DOGCALL malware to South Korean victims.</p>\n<p>While use and discovery of zero-day exploits over the past several years has expanded beyond a nation-state dominated environment to include commercial vendors of cyber espionage capabilities and sophisticated financially motivated actors, access to zero-day exploits remains a factor in distinguishing sophisticated or well-resourced actors.</p>\n<p>Figure 3 details the vulnerabilities exploited by APT37, comparing the time of exploitation to the time the CVE was released.</p>\n<h1>Command and Control Infrastructure</h1>\n<p>APT37 uses a variety of techniques for command and control. They leverage compromised servers, messaging platforms and cloud service providers to avoid detection. The group often relies on compromised sites to host second stage malware payloads. Over time, APT37 has changed the email providers to set up command and control accounts in a possible attempt to cover their tracks and cause misdirection. These tactics have been refined over the years as APT37 evolves to evade network defenders.</p>\n<p>APT37 has used various legitimate platforms as command and control for its malware tools. While some early campaigns leveraged POORAIM, which abused AOL Instant Messenger, newer activity deploys DOGCALL, which uses cloud storage APIs such as pCloud and Dropbox.</p>\n<p>APT37 relies on compromised websites to host second stage malware. Small websites focused on subjects such as aromatherapy and scuba diving have been leveraged, and were most likely compromised opportunistically and made to host malicious payloads.</p>\n<p>APT37 has improved its operational security over time. For example, early 2015 use of SLOWDRIFT involved credentials associated with Korea related mail servers such as\"Daum.net\". Later, in 2015 and early 2016, APT37 pivoted to different email providers such as Gmail and\"hmamail.com\"in an attempt to anonymize activity. Then from mid-2016 onward, APT37 began using @yandex.com and @ india.com email accounts — possibly an attempt to cause misattribution.</p>\n<p>SPECIAL REPORT</p>\n<p>APT37 (REAPER): THE OVERLOOKED NORTH KOREAN ACTOR</p>\n<h1>Malware</h1>\n<p>APT37 employs a diverse suite of malware for initial intrusion and exfiltration. Their malware is characterized by a focus on stealing information from victims, with many set up to automatically exfiltrate data of interest. Figure 4 shows APT37's malware usage over time. A full breakdown of the malware we associate with APT37, along with how it is detected by FireEye devices, is available in the Appendix.</p>\n<p>Along with custom malware used for espionage purposes, APT37 also has access to destructive malware. In April 2017, APT37 targeted South Korean military and government organizations with the DOGCALL backdoor and RUHAPPY wiper malware. Although the wiper capability was not used in the identified instance, RUHAPPY can overwrite a machine's Master Boot Record (MBR), causing the system to fail to boot into preconfigured partitions.</p>\n<p>It is possible that APT37's distribution of KARAE malware via torrent websites could assist in creating and maintaining botnets for future distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, or for other activity such as financially motivated campaigns or disruptive operations. Disruptive and destructive cyber threat activity, including the use of wiper malware, public leaks of proprietary materials by false hacktivist personas, DDoS attacks and electronic warfare tactics such as GPS signal jamming is consistent with past behavior by other North Korean actors.</p>\n<p>![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg) Figure 4. Timeline of APT37 Malware Use By First and Last Observed Compile Times.</p>\n<p>SPECIAL REPORT</p>\n<p>ART37 DREAMER: THE OVERLOOKED NORTH KOREAN ACTOR</p>\n<h1>Attribution</h1>\n<p>We assess with high confidence that APT37 acts in support of the North Korean government and is primarily based in North Korea. This assessment is based on multiple factors, including APT37's targeting profile, insight into the group's malware development and probable links to a North Korean individual believed to be the developer of several of APT37's proprietary malware families: - An individual we believe to be the developer behind several APT37 malware payloads inadvertently disclosed personal data showing that the actor was operating from an IP address and access point associated with North Korea. - The compilation times of APT37 malware is consistent with a developer operating in the North Korea time zone (UTC +8:30) and follows what is believed to be a typical North Korean workday (Fig. 5). The majority of malware compilation times occurred between 10:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m., with a dip around noon. Additional activity occurred late into the evening. This is consistent with media reporting of extremely long hours for North Korean workers. - The majority of APT37 activity continues to target South Korea, North Korean defectors, and organizations and individuals involved in Korean Peninsula reunification efforts. Similarly, APT37 targeting of a Middle Eastern company in 2017 is also consistent with North Korean objectives given the entity's extensive relationships inside North Korea.</p>\n<p>![img-5.jpeg](img-5.jpeg) Frequency![img-6.jpeg](img-6.jpeg)</p>\n<h1>Outlook and Implications</h1>\n<p>North Korea has repeatedly demonstrated a willingness to leverage its cyber capabilities for a variety of purposes, unmetered by national, hellines and international norms. Though they have primarily tapped other tracked suspected North Korean teams to carry out the most aggressive actions, APT37 is an additional tool available to the regime, perhaps even desirable for its relative obscurity. We anticipate APT37 will be leveraged more and more in previously unfamiliar roles and regions, especially as pressure mounts on their sponsor.</p>\n<p>The slow transformation of regional actors into global threats is well established. Minor incidents in Ukraine, the Middle East and South Korea have heralded the threats, which are now impossible to ignore. In some cases, the global economy connects organizations to aggressive regional actors. In other cases, a growing mandate draws the actor on to the international stage, ignored, these threats enjoy the benefit of surprise, allowing them to extract significant losses on their victims, many of whom have never previously heard of the actor.</p>\n<p>SPECIAL REPORT</p>\n<p>APT37 (REAPER): THE OVERLOOKED NORTH KOREAN ACTOR</p>\n<h1>Appendix: Malware Used by APT37</h1>\n<p>|  Malware | Description | Detected as  | | --- | --- | --- | |  CORALDECK | CORALDECK is an exfiltration tool that searches for specified files and exfiltrates them in password protected archives using hardcoded HTTP POST headers.

    "# Targeting and Mission": "APT37 has likely been active since at least 2012 and focuses on targeting the public and private sectors primarily in South Korea. In 2017, APT37 expanded its targeting beyond the Korean peninsula to include Japan, Vietnam and the Middle East, and to a wider range of industry, verticals, including chemicals, electronics, manufacturing, aerospace, automotive and healthcare entities (Fig. 1).\nFigure 1.

Lure materials (Fig. 2) typically leveraged the Korean language and featured themes such as Korean peninsula reunification or sanctions.\nFigure 2. \"2016 Korean Reunification Conference Form\" (MD5:183be2035d5a546670d2b9deeca4eb59).\n|  [천연도극제속성 2016 총정 제한 학술대치] 심지치  |   |   |   |   |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  심지치의 소속 및 전원  |   |   |   |   |\n|  ■ 신청자 정보  |   |   |   |   |\n|  이름 | 신청번호 | 위키피소  |   |   |\n|  내용 | 첫인보 영상용 서적: 이북전부 2016 2016년 10월 30일  |   |   |   |\n|  ■ 심지 법적 (백명피스 공식 스포를 해석 주십시오)  |   |   |   |   |\n|  ■ 심지치의 백명 법적  |   |   |   |   |\n|  심지치  |   |   |   |   |\n|  성명 |   | 성명 | 성명 | 성명  |\n|  성(제4의 저자) |   |  |  |   |\n|  성(제5의 저자) 2016년 10월 30일 |   |  |  |   |\n|  성(제6의 저자) 2016년 10월 30일 |   |  |  |   |\n|  성(제7의 제1의 저자) 2016년 10월 30일 |   |  |  |   |\n|  성(제8의 10대 저자) 2016년 10월 30일 |   |  |  |   |\n|  성(제9의 제2의 저자) 2016년 10월 30일 |   |  |  |   |\n|  성(제10의 제3의 저자) 2016년 10월 30일 |   |  |  |   |\n|  계속  |   |   |   |   |\n|  a. 제자 자격, b. 자격, c. 성명, d. 이명, e. 제자 가명  |   |   |   |   |\n|  ■ 본정 법적 (백명피스 공제 스포를 해석 주십시오) - 저자, 백명, 법적 통찰기 외에 기인인 경우 “별표기”  |   |   |   |   |\n|  부서, 자 | 법정 법적  |   |   |   |\n|  ■ 당국명  |   |   |   |   |\n|  * 법정 기획서, 정서, 신호사기 발송을 위한 시 법정별 서명 지표시스템, 민영영화에 기재 * 법정 발간일 경우 필기 기획서, 법정 인증확인 기재  |   |   |   |   |\nSPECIAL REPORT\nAPT37 (REAPER): THE OVERLOOKED NORTH KOREAN ACTOR\nIn 2017, APT37 targeted a Middle Eastern company that entered into a joint venture with the North Korean government to provide telecommunications service to the country (read on for a case study). At that time, other targets included individuals involved in international affairs and trade issues, the general director of a Vietnamese international trading and transport company, and possibly individuals working with Olympics organizations assisting in securing resources for athletes.\nNorth Korean defector and human rights-related targeting provides further evidence that APT37 conducts operations aligned with the interests of North Korea.\nAPT37 targeted a research fellow, advisory member, and journalist associated with different North Korean human rights issues and strategic organizations. It also targeted an entity in Japan associated with the United Nations missions on sanctions and human rights. APT37 distributed SLOWDRIFT malware using a lure referencing the Korea Global Forum against academic and strategic institutions located in South Korea. Notably, the email was sent from a compromised South Korean institute that conducts studies on North Korea. The string\"durihana,\"which is also the name of a Christian missionary organization that works with North Korean defectors, was included in an APT37 weaponized document sent to an individual who works with a North Korean human rights organization.\n## CASE STUDY:\n## Targeting of Middle Eastern Organization with Business ties to North Korea\nWe believe a Middle Eastern organization was targeted by APT37 because it had been involved with a North Korean company and a business deal went bad. This firm was targeted shortly after media reports of this schism had gone public. The targeting effort may have been an attempt by the North Korean government to gather information on a former business partner. The operation exemplifies APT37's tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs), and reflects the advanced capabilities of this espionage group.\nIn May 2017, APT37 used a bank liquidation letter as a spear phishing lure against a board member of a Middle Eastern financial company. The specially crafted email included an attachment containing exploit code for CVE-2017-0199, a vulnerability in Microsoft Office that had been disclosed just a month earlier. Once opened, the malicious document communicated with a compromised website, most likely to surreptitiously download and install a backdoor called SHUTTERSPEED (MDS: 7c2ebfc7960aac6f8d58b37a3f092a9c). The tool would enable APT37 to collect system information, take screenshots and download additional malicious files to the victim computer.\n## Initial Infection Vectors\nIn addition to the aforementioned spear phishing tactics, APT37 leverages a variety of methods to deliver malware. These include strategic web compromises typical of targeted cyber espionage operations, as well as the use of torrent file-sharing sites to distribute malware more indiscriminately.\nNumerous campaigns have employed social engineering tactics tailored specifically to desired targets. Lures and websites of particular interest to South Korean organizations (e.g. reunification) are regularly leveraged in campaigns. Multiple South Korean websites were abused in strategic web compromises to deliver newer variants of KARAE and POORAIM malware. Identified sites included South Korean conservative media and a news site for North Korean refugees and defectors. In one instance, APT37 weaponized a video downloader application with KARAE malware that was indiscriminately distributed to South Korean victims through torrent websites.\n![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)\nSPECIAL REPORT\nAPT37 (REAPER): THE OVERLOOKED NORTH KOREAN ACTOR\n![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)\nFigure 3.

    "# Command and Control Infrastructure": "APT37 uses a variety of techniques for command and control. They leverage compromised servers, messaging platforms and cloud service providers to avoid detection. The group often relies on compromised sites to host second stage malware payloads. Over time, APT37 has changed the email providers to set up command and control accounts in a possible attempt to cover their tracks and cause misdirection. These tactics have been refined over the years as APT37 evolves to evade network defenders.\nAPT37 has used various legitimate platforms as command and control for its malware tools. While some early campaigns leveraged POORAIM, which abused AOL Instant Messenger, newer activity deploys DOGCALL, which uses cloud storage APIs such as pCloud and Dropbox.\nAPT37 relies on compromised websites to host second stage malware. Small websites focused on subjects such as aromatherapy and scuba diving have been leveraged, and were most likely compromised opportunistically and made to host malicious payloads.\nAPT37 has improved its operational security over time. For example, early 2015 use of SLOWDRIFT involved credentials associated with Korea related mail servers such as\"Daum.net\". Later, in 2015 and early 2016, APT37 pivoted to different email providers such as Gmail and\"hmamail.com\"in an attempt to anonymize activity. Then from mid-2016 onward, APT37 began using @yandex.com and @ india.com email accounts — possibly an attempt to cause misattribution.\nSPECIAL REPORT\nAPT37 (REAPER): THE OVERLOOKED NORTH KOREAN ACTOR",
    "# Malware": "APT37 employs a diverse suite of malware for initial intrusion and exfiltration. Their malware is characterized by a focus on stealing information from victims, with many set up to automatically exfiltrate data of interest. Figure 4 shows APT37's malware usage over time. A full breakdown of the malware we associate with APT37, along with how it is detected by FireEye devices, is available in the Appendix.\nAlong with custom malware used for espionage purposes, APT37 also has access to destructive malware. In April 2017, APT37 targeted South Korean military and government organizations with the DOGCALL backdoor and RUHAPPY wiper malware. Although the wiper capability was not used in the identified instance, RUHAPPY can overwrite a machine's Master Boot Record (MBR), causing the system to fail to boot into preconfigured partitions.\nIt is possible that APT37's distribution of KARAE malware via torrent websites could assist in creating and maintaining botnets for future distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, or for other activity such as financially motivated campaigns or disruptive operations. Disruptive and destructive cyber threat activity, including the use of wiper malware, public leaks of proprietary materials by false hacktivist personas, DDoS attacks and electronic warfare tactics such as GPS signal jamming is consistent with past behavior by other North Korean actors.\n![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)\nFigure 4.

    "# Attribution": "We assess with high confidence that APT37 acts in support of the North Korean government and is primarily based in North Korea. This assessment is based on multiple factors, including APT37's targeting profile, insight into the group's malware development and probable links to a North Korean individual believed to be the developer of several of APT37's proprietary malware families: - An individual we believe to be the developer behind several APT37 malware payloads inadvertently disclosed personal data showing that the actor was operating from an IP address and access point associated with North Korea.\n- The compilation times of APT37 malware is consistent with a developer operating in the North Korea time zone (UTC +8:30) and follows what is believed to be a typical North Korean workday (Fig. 5). The majority of malware compilation times occurred between 10:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m., with a dip around noon. Additional activity occurred late into the evening. This is consistent with media reporting of extremely long hours for North Korean workers.\n- The majority of APT37 activity continues to target South Korea, North Korean defectors, and organizations and individuals involved in Korean Peninsula reunification efforts. Similarly, APT37 targeting of a Middle Eastern company in 2017 is also consistent with North Korean objectives given the entity's extensive relationships inside North Korea.\n![img-5.jpeg](img-5.jpeg) Frequency![img-6.jpeg](img-6.jpeg)",
    "# Outlook and Implications": "North Korea has repeatedly demonstrated a willingness to leverage its cyber capabilities for a variety of purposes, unmetered by national, hellines and international norms. Though they have primarily tapped other tracked suspected North Korean teams to carry out the most aggressive actions, APT37 is an additional tool available to the regime, perhaps even desirable for its relative obscurity. We anticipate APT37 will be leveraged more and more in previously unfamiliar roles and regions, especially as pressure mounts on their sponsor.\nThe slow transformation of regional actors into global threats is well established. Minor incidents in Ukraine, the Middle East and South Korea have heralded the threats, which are now impossible to ignore. In some cases, the global economy connects organizations to aggressive regional actors. In other cases, a growing mandate draws the actor on to the international stage, ignored, these threats enjoy the benefit of surprise, allowing them to extract significant losses on their victims, many of whom have never previously heard of the actor.\nSPECIAL REPORT\nAPT37 (REAPER): THE OVERLOOKED NORTH KOREAN ACTOR",

Recent examination of this group's activities by FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence reveals APT37 has expanded its operations in both scope and sophistication. APT37's toolset, which includes access to zero-day vulnerabilities and wiper malware, combined with heightened tensions in Northeast Asia and North Korea's penchant for norm breaking, means this group should be taken seriously.\n\nWe assess with high confidence that this activity is carried out on behalf of the North Korean government given malware development artifacts and targeting that aligns with North Korean state interests. FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence believes that APT37 is aligned with the activity publicly reported as Scarcraft and Group123.\n\nSPECIAL REPORT\n\nAPT37 (REAPER): THE OVERLOOKED NORTH KOREAN ACTOR\n\n# Targeting and Mission\n\nAPT37 has likely been active since at least 2012 and focuses on targeting the public and private sectors primarily in South Korea. In 2017, APT37 expanded its targeting beyond the Korean peninsula to include Japan, Vietnam and the Middle East, and to a wider range of industry, verticals, including chemicals, electronics, manufacturing, aerospace, automotive and healthcare entities (Fig. 1).\n\nFigure 1. APT37 Targeting Scope\n\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg) We judge that APT37's primary mission is covert intelligence gathering in support of North Korea's strategic military, political and economic interests. This is based on consistent targeting of South Korean public and private entities and social engineering. APT37's recently expanded targeting scope also appears to have direct relevance to North Korea's strategic interests.\n\nFrom 2014 to 2017, APT37 targeting concentrated primarily on the South Korean government, military, defense industrial base, and media sector. Lure materials (Fig. 2) typically leveraged the Korean language and featured themes such as Korean peninsula reunification or sanctions.\n\nFigure 2. \"2016 Korean Reunification Conference Form\" (MD5:183be2035d5a546670d2b9deeca4eb59).\n\n|  [천연도극제속성 2016 총정 제한 학술대치] 심지치  |   |   |   |   |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  심지치의 소속 및 전원  |   |   |   |   |\n|  ■ 신청자 정보  |   |   |   |   |\n|  이름 | 신청번호 | 위키피소  |   |   |\n|  내용 | 첫인보 영상용 서적: 이북전부 2016 2016년 10월 30일  |   |   |   |\n|  ■ 심지 법적 (백명피스 공식 스포를 해석 주십시오)  |   |   |   |   |\n|  ■ 심지치의 백명 법적  |   |   |   |   |\n|  심지치  |   |   |   |   |\n|  성명 |   | 성명 | 성명 | 성명  |\n|  성(제4의 저자) |   |  |  |   |\n|  성(제5의 저자) 2016년 10월 30일 |   |  |  |   |\n|  성(제6의 저자) 2016년 10월 30일 |   |  |  |   |\n|  성(제7의 제1의 저자) 2016년 10월 30일 |   |  |  |   |\n|  성(제8의 10대 저자) 2016년 10월 30일 |   |  |  |   |\n|  성(제9의 제2의 저자) 2016년 10월 30일 |   |  |  |   |\n|  성(제10의 제3의 저자) 2016년 10월 30일 |   |  |  |   |\n|  계속  |   |   |   |   |\n|  a. 제자 자격, b. 자격, c. 성명, d. 이명, e. 제자 가명  |   |   |   |   |\n|  ■ 본정 법적 (백명피스 공제 스포를 해석 주십시오) - 저자, 백명, 법적 통찰기 외에 기인인 경우 “별표기”  |   |   |   |   |\n|  부서, 자 | 법정 법적  |   |   |   |\n|  ■ 당국명  |   |   |   |   |\n|  * 법정 기획서, 정서, 신호사기 발송을 위한 시 법정별 서명 지표시스템, 민영영화에 기재 * 법정 발간일 경우 필기 기획서, 법정 인증확인 기재  |   |   |   |   |\n\nSPECIAL REPORT\n\nAPT37 (REAPER): THE OVERLOOKED NORTH KOREAN ACTOR\n\nIn 2017, APT37 targeted a Middle Eastern company that entered into a joint venture with the North Korean government to provide telecommunications service to the country (read on for a case study).

Over time, APT37 has changed the email providers to set up command and control accounts in a possible attempt to cover their tracks and cause misdirection. These tactics have been refined over the years as APT37 evolves to evade network defenders.\n\nAPT37 has used various legitimate platforms as command and control for its malware tools. While some early campaigns leveraged POORAIM, which abused AOL Instant Messenger, newer activity deploys DOGCALL, which uses cloud storage APIs such as pCloud and Dropbox.\n\nAPT37 relies on compromised websites to host second stage malware. Small websites focused on subjects such as aromatherapy and scuba diving have been leveraged, and were most likely compromised opportunistically and made to host malicious payloads.\n\nAPT37 has improved its operational security over time. For example, early 2015 use of SLOWDRIFT involved credentials associated with Korea related mail servers such as\"Daum.net\". Later, in 2015 and early 2016, APT37 pivoted to different email providers such as Gmail and\"hmamail.com\"in an attempt to anonymize activity. Then from mid-2016 onward, APT37 began using @yandex.com and @ india.com email accounts — possibly an attempt to cause misattribution.\n\nSPECIAL REPORT\n\nAPT37 (REAPER): THE OVERLOOKED NORTH KOREAN ACTOR\n\n# Malware\n\nAPT37 employs a diverse suite of malware for initial intrusion and exfiltration. Their malware is characterized by a focus on stealing information from victims, with many set up to automatically exfiltrate data of interest. Figure 4 shows APT37's malware usage over time. A full breakdown of the malware we associate with APT37, along with how it is detected by FireEye devices, is available in the Appendix.\n\nAlong with custom malware used for espionage purposes, APT37 also has access to destructive malware. In April 2017, APT37 targeted South Korean military and government organizations with the DOGCALL backdoor and RUHAPPY wiper malware. Although the wiper capability was not used in the identified instance, RUHAPPY can overwrite a machine's Master Boot Record (MBR), causing the system to fail to boot into preconfigured partitions.\n\nIt is possible that APT37's distribution of KARAE malware via torrent websites could assist in creating and maintaining botnets for future distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, or for other activity such as financially motivated campaigns or disruptive operations. Disruptive and destructive cyber threat activity, including the use of wiper malware, public leaks of proprietary materials by false hacktivist personas, DDoS attacks and electronic warfare tactics such as GPS signal jamming is consistent with past behavior by other North Korean actors.\n\n![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)\nFigure 4. Timeline of APT37 Malware Use By First and Last Observed Compile Times.\n\nSPECIAL REPORT\n\nART37 DREAMER: THE OVERLOOKED NORTH KOREAN ACTOR\n\n# Attribution\n\nWe assess with high confidence that APT37 acts in support of the North Korean government and is primarily based in North Korea. This assessment is based on multiple factors, including APT37's targeting profile, insight into the group's malware development and probable links to a North Korean individual believed to be the developer of several of APT37's proprietary malware families: - An individual we believe to be the developer behind several APT37 malware payloads inadvertently disclosed personal data showing that the actor was operating from an IP address and access point associated with North Korea.\n- The compilation times of APT37 malware is consistent with a developer operating in the North Korea time zone (UTC +8:30) and follows what is believed to be a typical North Korean workday (Fig. 5). The majority of malware compilation times occurred between 10:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m., with a dip around noon. Additional activity occurred late into the evening. This is consistent with media reporting of extremely long hours for North Korean workers.\n- The majority of APT37 activity continues to target South Korea, North Korean defectors, and organizations and individuals involved in Korean Peninsula reunification efforts. Similarly, APT37 targeting of a Middle Eastern company in 2017 is also consistent with North Korean objectives given the entity's extensive relationships inside North Korea.\n\n![img-5.jpeg](img-5.jpeg) Frequency![img-6.jpeg](img-6.jpeg)\n\n# Outlook and Implications\n\nNorth Korea has repeatedly demonstrated a willingness to leverage its cyber capabilities for a variety of purposes, unmetered by national, hellines and international norms. Though they have primarily tapped other tracked suspected North Korean teams to carry out the most aggressive actions, APT37 is an additional tool available to the regime, perhaps even desirable for its relative obscurity. We anticipate APT37 will be leveraged more and more in previously unfamiliar roles and regions, especially as pressure mounts on their sponsor.\n\nThe slow transformation of regional actors into global threats is well established. Minor incidents in Ukraine, the Middle East and South Korea have heralded the threats, which are now impossible to ignore. In some cases, the global economy connects organizations to aggressive regional actors. In other cases, a growing mandate draws the actor on to the international stage, ignored, these threats enjoy the benefit of surprise, allowing them to extract significant losses on their victims, many of whom have never previously heard of the actor.\n\nSPECIAL REPORT\n\nAPT37 (REAPER): THE OVERLOOKED NORTH KOREAN ACTOR\n\n# Appendix: Malware Used by APT37\n\n|  Malware | Description | Detected as  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  CORALDECK | CORALDECK is an exfiltration tool that searches for specified files and exfiltrates them in password protected archives using hardcoded HTTP POST headers.

Recent examination of this group's activities by FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence reveals APT37 has expanded its operations in both scope and sophistication. APT37's toolset, which includes access to zero-day vulnerabilities and wiper malware, combined with heightened tensions in Northeast Asia and North Korea's penchant for norm breaking, means this group should be taken seriously.\n\nWe assess with high confidence that this activity is carried out on behalf of the North Korean government given malware development artifacts and targeting that aligns with North Korean state interests. FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence believes that APT37 is aligned with the activity publicly reported as Scarcraft and Group123.\n\nSPECIAL REPORT\n\nAPT37 (REAPER): THE OVERLOOKED NORTH KOREAN ACTOR\n\n# Targeting and Mission\n\nAPT37 has likely been active since at least 2012 and focuses on targeting the public and private sectors primarily in South Korea. In 2017, APT37 expanded its targeting beyond the Korean peninsula to include Japan, Vietnam and the Middle East, and to a wider range of industry, verticals, including chemicals, electronics, manufacturing, aerospace, automotive and healthcare entities (Fig. 1).\n\nFigure 1. APT37 Targeting Scope\n\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg) We judge that APT37's primary mission is covert intelligence gathering in support of North Korea's strategic military, political and economic interests. This is based on consistent targeting of South Korean public and private entities and social engineering. APT37's recently expanded targeting scope also appears to have direct relevance to North Korea's strategic interests.\n\nFrom 2014 to 2017, APT37 targeting concentrated primarily on the South Korean government, military, defense industrial base, and media sector. Lure materials (Fig. 2) typically leveraged the Korean language and featured themes such as Korean peninsula reunification or sanctions.\n\nFigure 2. \"2016 Korean Reunification Conference Form\" (MD5:183be2035d5a546670d2b9deeca4eb59).\n\n|  [천연도극제속성 2016 총정 제한 학술대치] 심지치  |   |   |   |   |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  심지치의 소속 및 전원  |   |   |   |   |\n|  ■ 신청자 정보  |   |   |   |   |\n|  이름 | 신청번호 | 위키피소  |   |   |\n|  내용 | 첫인보 영상용 서적: 이북전부 2016 2016년 10월 30일  |   |   |   |\n|  ■ 심지 법적 (백명피스 공식 스포를 해석 주십시오)  |   |   |   |   |\n|  ■ 심지치의 백명 법적  |   |   |   |   |\n|  심지치  |   |   |   |   |\n|  성명 |   | 성명 | 성명 | 성명  |\n|  성(제4의 저자) |   |  |  |   |\n|  성(제5의 저자) 2016년 10월 30일 |   |  |  |   |\n|  성(제6의 저자) 2016년 10월 30일 |   |  |  |   |\n|  성(제7의 제1의 저자) 2016년 10월 30일 |   |  |  |   |\n|  성(제8의 10대 저자) 2016년 10월 30일 |   |  |  |   |\n|  성(제9의 제2의 저자) 2016년 10월 30일 |   |  |  |   |\n|  성(제10의 제3의 저자) 2016년 10월 30일 |   |  |  |   |\n|  계속  |   |   |   |   |\n|  a. 제자 자격, b. 자격, c. 성명, d. 이명, e. 제자 가명  |   |   |   |   |\n|  ■ 본정 법적 (백명피스 공제 스포를 해석 주십시오) - 저자, 백명, 법적 통찰기 외에 기인인 경우 “별표기”  |   |   |   |   |\n|  부서, 자 | 법정 법적  |   |   |   |\n|  ■ 당국명  |   |   |   |   |\n|  * 법정 기획서, 정서, 신호사기 발송을 위한 시 법정별 서명 지표시스템, 민영영화에 기재 * 법정 발간일 경우 필기 기획서, 법정 인증확인 기재  |   |   |   |   |\n\nSPECIAL REPORT\n\nAPT37 (REAPER): THE OVERLOOKED NORTH KOREAN ACTOR\n\nIn 2017, APT37 targeted a Middle Eastern company that entered into a joint venture with the North Korean government to provide telecommunications service to the country (read on for a case study). At that time, other targets included individuals involved in international affairs and trade issues, the general director of a Vietnamese international trading and transport company, and possibly individuals working with Olympics organizations assisting in securing resources for athletes.\n\nNorth Korean defector and human rights-related targeting provides further evidence that APT37 conducts operations aligned with the interests of North Korea.\n\nAPT37 targeted a research fellow, advisory member, and journalist associated with different North Korean human rights issues and strategic organizations. It also targeted an entity in Japan associated with the United Nations missions on sanctions and human rights. APT37 distributed SLOWDRIFT malware using a lure referencing the Korea Global Forum against academic and strategic institutions located in South Korea. Notably, the email was sent from a compromised South Korean institute that conducts studies on North Korea. The string\"durihana,\"which is also the name of a Christian missionary organization that works with North Korean defectors, was included in an APT37 weaponized document sent to an individual who works with a North Korean human rights organization.\n\n## CASE STUDY:\n\n## Targeting of Middle Eastern Organization with Business ties to North Korea\n\nWe believe a Middle Eastern organization was targeted by APT37 because it had been involved with a North Korean company and a business deal went bad. This firm was targeted shortly after media reports of this schism had gone public. The targeting effort may have been an attempt by the North Korean government to gather information on a former business partner. The operation exemplifies APT37's tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs), and reflects the advanced capabilities of this espionage group.\n\nIn May 2017, APT37 used a bank liquidation letter as a spear phishing lure against a board member of a Middle Eastern financial company. The specially crafted email included an attachment containing exploit code for CVE-2017-0199, a vulnerability in Microsoft Office that had been disclosed just a month earlier. Once opened, the malicious document communicated with a compromised website, most likely to surreptitiously download and install a backdoor called SHUTTERSPEED (MDS: 7c2ebfc7960aac6f8d58b37a3f092a9c). The tool would enable APT37 to collect system information, take screenshots and download additional malicious files to the victim computer.\n\n## Initial Infection Vectors\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned spear phishing tactics, APT37 leverages a variety of methods to deliver malware. These include strategic web compromises typical of targeted cyber espionage operations, as well as the use of torrent file-sharing sites to distribute malware more indiscriminately.\n\nNumerous campaigns have employed social engineering tactics tailored specifically to desired targets. Lures and websites of particular interest to South Korean organizations (e.g. reunification) are regularly leveraged in campaigns. Multiple South Korean websites were abused in strategic web compromises to deliver newer variants of KARAE and POORAIM malware. Identified sites included South Korean conservative media and a news site for North Korean refugees and defectors. In one instance, APT37 weaponized a video downloader application with KARAE malware that was indiscriminately distributed to South Korean victims through torrent websites.\n\n![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)\n\nSPECIAL REPORT\n\nAPT37 (REAPER): THE OVERLOOKED NORTH KOREAN ACTOR\n\n![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)\nFigure 3. Timeline of CVE Release Dates vs. Dates of APT37 CVE Exploitation.\n\n# Exploited Vulnerabilities\n\nAPT37 frequently exploits vulnerabilities in Hangul Word Processor (HWP) due to the software's prevalence in South Korea. Further, the group recently demonstrated access to zero-day vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-0802) and has the flexibility to quickly incorporate recently publicized vulnerabilities into spear phishing and strategic web compromise operations. These capabilities suggest a high operational tempo and specialized expertise.\n\nAPT37 has repeatedly deployed exploits, especially in Flash, quickly after vulnerabilities are initially publicized (see Table 1). CVE-2016-4117, CVE-2016-1019 and CVE-2015-3043 were all exploited by APT37 in this way. FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence confirmed that since at least November 2017, APT37 exploited a zero-day Adobe Flash vulnerability, CVE-2018-4878, to distribute DOGCALL malware to South Korean victims.\n\nWhile use and discovery of zero-day exploits over the past several years has expanded beyond a nation-state dominated environment to include commercial vendors of cyber espionage capabilities and sophisticated financially motivated actors, access to zero-day exploits remains a factor in distinguishing sophisticated or well-resourced actors.\n\nFigure 3 details the vulnerabilities exploited by APT37, comparing the time of exploitation to the time the CVE was released.\n\n# Command and Control Infrastructure\n\nAPT37 uses a variety of techniques for command and control. They leverage compromised servers, messaging platforms and cloud service providers to avoid detection. The group often relies on compromised sites to host second stage malware payloads. Over time, APT37 has changed the email providers to set up command and control accounts in a possible attempt to cover their tracks and cause misdirection. These tactics have been refined over the years as APT37 evolves to evade network defenders.\n\nAPT37 has used various legitimate platforms as command and control for its malware tools. While some early campaigns leveraged POORAIM, which abused AOL Instant Messenger, newer activity deploys DOGCALL, which uses cloud storage APIs such as pCloud and Dropbox.\n\nAPT37 relies on compromised websites to host second stage malware. Small websites focused on subjects such as aromatherapy and scuba diving have been leveraged, and were most likely compromised opportunistically and made to host malicious payloads.\n\nAPT37 has improved its operational security over time. For example, early 2015 use of SLOWDRIFT involved credentials associated with Korea related mail servers such as\"Daum.net\". Later, in 2015 and early 2016, APT37 pivoted to different email providers such as Gmail and\"hmamail.com\"in an attempt to anonymize activity. Then from mid-2016 onward, APT37 began using @yandex.com and @ india.com email accounts — possibly an attempt to cause misattribution.\n\nSPECIAL REPORT\n\nAPT37 (REAPER): THE OVERLOOKED NORTH KOREAN ACTOR\n\n# Malware\n\nAPT37 employs a diverse suite of malware for initial intrusion and exfiltration.

In April 2017, APT37 targeted South Korean military and government organizations with the DOGCALL backdoor and RUHAPPY wiper malware. Although the wiper capability was not used in the identified instance, RUHAPPY can overwrite a machine's Master Boot Record (MBR), causing the system to fail to boot into preconfigured partitions.\n\nIt is possible that APT37's distribution of KARAE malware via torrent websites could assist in creating and maintaining botnets for future distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, or for other activity such as financially motivated campaigns or disruptive operations. Disruptive and destructive cyber threat activity, including the use of wiper malware, public leaks of proprietary materials by false hacktivist personas, DDoS attacks and electronic warfare tactics such as GPS signal jamming is consistent with past behavior by other North Korean actors.\n\n![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)\nFigure 4.

Recent examination of this group's activities by FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence reveals APT37 has expanded its operations in both scope and sophistication. APT37's toolset, which includes access to zero-day vulnerabilities and wiper malware, combined with heightened tensions in Northeast Asia and North Korea's penchant for norm breaking, means this group should be taken seriously.\n\nWe assess with high confidence that this activity is carried out on behalf of the North Korean government given malware development artifacts and targeting that aligns with North Korean state interests. FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence believes that APT37 is aligned with the activity publicly reported as Scarcraft and Group123.\n\nSPECIAL REPORT\n\nAPT37 (REAPER): THE OVERLOOKED NORTH KOREAN ACTOR\n\n# Targeting and Mission\n\nAPT37 has likely been active since at least 2012 and focuses on targeting the public and private sectors primarily in South Korea. In 2017, APT37 expanded its targeting beyond the Korean peninsula to include Japan, Vietnam and the Middle East, and to a wider range of industry, verticals, including chemicals, electronics, manufacturing, aerospace, automotive and healthcare entities (Fig. 1).\n\nFigure 1. APT37 Targeting Scope\n\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)\n\nWe judge that APT37's primary mission is covert intelligence gathering in support of North Korea's strategic military, political and economic interests. This is based on consistent targeting of South Korean public and private entities and social engineering. APT37's recently expanded targeting scope also appears to have direct relevance to North Korea's strategic interests.\n\nFrom 2014 to 2017, APT37 targeting concentrated primarily on the South Korean government, military, defense industrial base, and media sector. Lure materials (Fig. 2) typically leveraged the Korean language and featured themes such as Korean peninsula reunification or sanctions.\n\nFigure 2. \"2016 Korean Reunification Conference Form\" (MD5:183be2035d5a546670d2b9deeca4eb59).\n\n|  [천연도극제속성 2016 총정 제한 학술대치] 심지치  |   |   |   |   |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  심지치의 소속 및 전원  |   |   |   |   |\n|  ■ 신청자 정보  |   |   |   |   |\n|  이름 | 신청번호 | 위키피소  |   |   |\n|  내용 | 첫인보 영상용 서적: 이북전부 2016 2016년 10월 30일  |   |   |   |\n|  ■ 심지 법적 (백명피스 공식 스포를 해석 주십시오)  |   |   |   |   |\n|  ■ 심지치의 백명 법적  |   |   |   |   |\n|  심지치  |   |   |   |   |\n|  성명 |   | 성명 | 성명 | 성명  |\n|  성(제4의 저자) |   |  |  |   |\n|  성(제5의 저자) 2016년 10월 30일 |   |  |  |   |\n|  성(제6의 저자) 2016년 10월 30일 |   |  |  |   |\n|  성(제7의 제1의 저자) 2016년 10월 30일 |   |  |  |   |\n|  성(제8의 10대 저자) 2016년 10월 30일 |   |  |  |   |\n|  성(제9의 제2의 저자) 2016년 10월 30일 |   |  |  |   |\n|  성(제10의 제3의 저자) 2016년 10월 30일 |   |  |  |   |\n|  계속  |   |   |   |   |\n|  a. 제자 자격, b. 자격, c. 성명, d. 이명, e. 제자 가명  |   |   |   |   |\n|  ■ 본정 법적 (백명피스 공제 스포를 해석 주십시오) - 저자, 백명, 법적 통찰기 외에 기인인 경우 “별표기”  |   |   |   |   |\n|  부서, 자 | 법정 법적  |   |   |   |\n|  ■ 당국명  |   |   |   |   |\n|  * 법정 기획서, 정서, 신호사기 발송을 위한 시 법정별 서명 지표시스템, 민영영화에 기재 * 법정 발간일 경우 필기 기획서, 법정 인증확인 기재  |   |   |   |   |\n\nSPECIAL REPORT\n\nAPT37 (REAPER): THE OVERLOOKED NORTH KOREAN ACTOR\n\nIn 2017, APT37 targeted a Middle Eastern company that entered into a joint venture with the North Korean government to provide telecommunications service to the country (read on for a case study). At that time, other targets included individuals involved in international affairs and trade issues, the general director of a Vietnamese international trading and transport company, and possibly individuals working with Olympics organizations assisting in securing resources for athletes.\n\nNorth Korean defector and human rights-related targeting provides further evidence that APT37 conducts operations aligned with the interests of North Korea.\n\nAPT37 targeted a research fellow, advisory member, and journalist associated with different North Korean human rights issues and strategic organizations. It also targeted an entity in Japan associated with the United Nations missions on sanctions and human rights. APT37 distributed SLOWDRIFT malware using a lure referencing the Korea Global Forum against academic and strategic institutions located in South Korea. Notably, the email was sent from a compromised South Korean institute that conducts studies on North Korea. The string \"durihana,\" which is also the name of a Christian missionary organization that works with North Korean defectors, was included in an APT37 weaponized document sent to an individual who works with a North Korean human rights organization.\n\n## CASE STUDY:\n\n## Targeting of Middle Eastern Organization with Business ties to North Korea\n\nWe believe a Middle Eastern organization was targeted by APT37 because it had been involved with a North Korean company and a business deal went bad. This firm was targeted shortly after media reports of this schism had gone public. The targeting effort may have been an attempt by the North Korean government to gather information on a former business partner. The operation exemplifies APT37's tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs), and reflects the advanced capabilities of this espionage group.\n\nIn May 2017, APT37 used a bank liquidation letter as a spear phishing lure against a board member of a Middle Eastern financial company. The specially crafted email included an attachment containing exploit code for CVE-2017-0199, a vulnerability in Microsoft Office that had been disclosed just a month earlier. Once opened, the malicious document communicated with a compromised website, most likely to surreptitiously download and install a backdoor called SHUTTERSPEED (MDS: 7c2ebfc7960aac6f8d58b37a3f092a9c). The tool would enable APT37 to collect system information, take screenshots and download additional malicious files to the victim computer.\n\n## Initial Infection Vectors\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned spear phishing tactics, APT37 leverages a variety of methods to deliver malware. These include strategic web compromises typical of targeted cyber espionage operations, as well as the use of torrent file-sharing sites to distribute malware more indiscriminately.\n\nNumerous campaigns have employed social engineering tactics tailored specifically to desired targets. Lures and websites of particular interest to South Korean organizations (e.g. reunification) are regularly leveraged in campaigns. Multiple South Korean websites were abused in strategic web compromises to deliver newer variants of KARAE and POORAIM malware. Identified sites included South Korean conservative media and a news site for North Korean refugees and defectors. In one instance, APT37 weaponized a video downloader application with KARAE malware that was indiscriminately distributed to South Korean victims through torrent websites.\n\n![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)\n\nSPECIAL REPORT\n\nAPT37 (REAPER): THE OVERLOOKED NORTH KOREAN ACTOR\n\n![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)\nFigure 3. Timeline of CVE Release Dates vs. Dates of APT37 CVE Exploitation.\n\n# Exploited Vulnerabilities\n\nAPT37 frequently exploits vulnerabilities in Hangul Word Processor (HWP) due to the software's prevalence in South Korea. Further, the group recently demonstrated access to zero-day vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-0802) and has the flexibility to quickly incorporate recently publicized vulnerabilities into spear phishing and strategic web compromise operations. These capabilities suggest a high operational tempo and specialized expertise.\n\nAPT37 has repeatedly deployed exploits, especially in Flash, quickly after vulnerabilities are initially publicized (see Table 1). CVE-2016-4117, CVE-2016-1019 and CVE-2015-3043 were all exploited by APT37 in this way. FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence confirmed that since at least November 2017, APT37\n\nexploited a zero-day Adobe Flash vulnerability, CVE-2018-4878, to distribute DOGCALL malware to South Korean victims.\n\nWhile use and discovery of zero-day exploits over the past several years has expanded beyond a nation-state dominated environment to include commercial vendors of cyber espionage capabilities and sophisticated financially motivated actors, access to zero-day exploits remains a factor in distinguishing sophisticated or well-resourced actors.\n\nFigure 3 details the vulnerabilities exploited by APT37, comparing the time of exploitation to the time the CVE was released.\n\n# Command and Control Infrastructure\n\nAPT37 uses a variety of techniques for command and control. They leverage compromised servers, messaging platforms and cloud service providers to avoid detection. The group often relies on compromised sites to host second stage malware payloads. Over time, APT37 has changed the email providers to set up command and control accounts in a possible attempt to cover their tracks and cause misdirection. These tactics have been refined over the years as APT37 evolves to evade network defenders.\n\nAPT37 has used various legitimate platforms as command and control for its malware tools. While some early campaigns leveraged POORAIM, which abused AOL Instant Messenger, newer activity deploys DOGCALL, which uses cloud storage APIs such as pCloud and Dropbox.\n\nAPT37 relies on compromised websites to host second stage malware. Small websites focused on subjects such as aromatherapy and scuba diving have been leveraged, and were most likely compromised opportunistically and made to host malicious payloads.\n\nAPT37 has improved its operational security over time. For example, early 2015 use of SLOWDRIFT involved credentials associated with Korea related mail servers such as \"Daum.net\". Later, in 2015 and early 2016, APT37 pivoted to different email providers such as Gmail and \"hmamail.com\" in an attempt to anonymize activity. Then from mid-2016 onward, APT37 began using @yandex.com and @ india.com email accounts — possibly an attempt to cause misattribution.\n\nSPECIAL REPORT\n\nAPT37 (REAPER): THE OVERLOOKED NORTH KOREAN ACTOR\n\n# Malware\n\nAPT37 employs a diverse suite of malware for initial intrusion and exfiltration. Their malware is characterized by a focus on stealing information from victims, with many set up to automatically exfiltrate data of interest. Figure 4 shows APT37's malware usage over time. A full breakdown of the malware we associate with APT37, along with how it is detected by FireEye devices, is available in the Appendix.\n\nAlong with custom malware used for espionage purposes, APT37 also has access to destructive malware. In April 2017, APT37 targeted South Korean military and government organizations with the DOGCALL backdoor and RUHAPPY wiper malware. Although the wiper capability was not used in the identified instance, RUHAPPY can overwrite a machine's Master Boot Record (MBR), causing the system to fail to boot into preconfigured partitions.\n\nIt is possible that APT37's distribution of KARAE malware via torrent websites could assist in creating and maintaining botnets for future distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, or for other activity such as financially motivated campaigns or disruptive operations. Disruptive and destructive cyber threat activity, including the use of wiper malware, public leaks of proprietary materials by false hacktivist personas, DDoS attacks and electronic warfare tactics such as GPS signal jamming is consistent with past behavior by other North Korean actors.\n\n![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)\nFigure 4. Timeline of APT37 Malware Use By First and Last Observed Compile Times.\n\nSPECIAL REPORT\n\nART37 DREAMER: THE OVERLOOKED NORTH KOREAN ACTOR\n\n# Attribution\n\nWe assess with high confidence that APT37 acts in support of the North Korean government and is primarily based in North Korea. This assessment is based on multiple factors, including APT37's targeting profile, insight into the group's malware development and probable links to a North Korean individual believed to be the developer of several of APT37's proprietary malware families:\n\n- An individual we believe to be the developer behind several APT37 malware payloads inadvertently disclosed personal data showing that the actor was operating from an IP address and access point associated with North Korea.\n- The compilation times of APT37 malware is consistent with a developer operating in the North Korea time zone (UTC +8:30) and follows what is believed to be a typical North Korean workday (Fig. 5). The majority of malware compilation times occurred between 10:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m., with a dip around noon. Additional activity occurred late into the evening. This is consistent with media reporting of extremely long hours for North Korean workers.\n- The majority of APT37 activity continues to target South Korea, North Korean defectors, and organizations and individuals involved in Korean Peninsula reunification efforts. Similarly, APT37 targeting of a Middle Eastern company in 2017 is also consistent with North Korean objectives given the entity's extensive relationships inside North Korea.\n\n![img-5.jpeg](img-5.jpeg)\nFrequency\n\n![img-6.jpeg](img-6.jpeg)\n\n# Outlook and Implications\n\nNorth Korea has repeatedly demonstrated a willingness to leverage its cyber capabilities for a variety of purposes, unmetered by national, hellines and international norms. Though they have primarily tapped other tracked suspected North Korean teams to carry out the most aggressive actions, APT37 is an additional tool available to the regime, perhaps even desirable for its relative obscurity. We anticipate APT37 will be leveraged more and more in previously unfamiliar roles and regions, especially as pressure mounts on their sponsor.\n\nThe slow transformation of regional actors into global threats is well established. Minor incidents in Ukraine, the Middle East and South Korea have heralded the threats, which are now impossible to ignore. In some cases, the global economy connects organizations to aggressive regional actors. In other cases, a growing mandate draws the actor on to the international stage, ignored, these threats enjoy the benefit of surprise, allowing them to extract significant losses on their victims, many of whom have never previously heard of the actor.\n\nSPECIAL REPORT\n\nAPT37 (REAPER): THE OVERLOOKED NORTH KOREAN ACTOR\n\n# Appendix: Malware Used by APT37\n\n|  Malware | Description | Detected as  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  CORALDECK | CORALDECK is an exfiltration tool that searches for specified files and exfiltrates them in password protected archives using hardcoded HTTP POST headers.

Recent examination of this group's activities by FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence reveals APT37 has expanded its operations in both scope and sophistication. APT37's toolset, which includes access to zero-day vulnerabilities and wiper malware, combined with heightened tensions in Northeast Asia and North Korea's penchant for norm breaking, means this group should be taken seriously.\n\nWe assess with high confidence that this activity is carried out on behalf of the North Korean government given malware development artifacts and targeting that aligns with North Korean state interests. FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence believes that APT37 is aligned with the activity publicly reported as Scarcraft and Group123.\n\nSPECIAL REPORT\n\nAPT37 (REAPER): THE OVERLOOKED NORTH KOREAN ACTOR\n\n# Targeting and Mission\n\nAPT37 has likely been active since at least 2012 and focuses on targeting the public and private sectors primarily in South Korea. In 2017, APT37 expanded its targeting beyond the Korean peninsula to include Japan, Vietnam and the Middle East, and to a wider range of industry, verticals, including chemicals, electronics, manufacturing, aerospace, automotive and healthcare entities (Fig. 1).\n\nFigure 1. APT37 Targeting Scope\n\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg) We judge that APT37's primary mission is covert intelligence gathering in support of North Korea's strategic military, political and economic interests. This is based on consistent targeting of South Korean public and private entities and social engineering. APT37's recently expanded targeting scope also appears to have direct relevance to North Korea's strategic interests.\n\nFrom 2014 to 2017, APT37 targeting concentrated primarily on the South Korean government, military, defense industrial base, and media sector. Lure materials (Fig. 2) typically leveraged the Korean language and featured themes such as Korean peninsula reunification or sanctions.\n\nFigure 2. \"2016 Korean Reunification Conference Form\" (MD5:183be2035d5a546670d2b9deeca4eb59).\n\n|  [천연도극제속성 2016 총정 제한 학술대치] 심지치  |   |   |   |   |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  심지치의 소속 및 전원  |   |   |   |   |\n|  ■ 신청자 정보  |   |   |   |   |\n|  이름 | 신청번호 | 위키피소  |   |   |\n|  내용 | 첫인보 영상용 서적: 이북전부 2016 2016년 10월 30일  |   |   |   |\n|  ■ 심지 법적 (백명피스 공식 스포를 해석 주십시오)  |   |   |   |   |\n|  ■ 심지치의 백명 법적  |   |   |   |   |\n|  심지치  |   |   |   |   |\n|  성명 |   | 성명 | 성명 | 성명  |\n|  성(제4의 저자) |   |  |  |   |\n|  성(제5의 저자) 2016년 10월 30일 |   |  |  |   |\n|  성(제6의 저자) 2016년 10월 30일 |   |  |  |   |\n|  성(제7의 제1의 저자) 2016년 10월 30일 |   |  |  |   |\n|  성(제8의 10대 저자) 2016년 10월 30일 |   |  |  |   |\n|  성(제9의 제2의 저자) 2016년 10월 30일 |   |  |  |   |\n|  성(제10의 제3의 저자) 2016년 10월 30일 |   |  |  |   |\n|  계속  |   |   |   |   |\n|  a. 제자 자격, b. 자격, c. 성명, d. 이명, e. 제자 가명  |   |   |   |   |\n|  ■ 본정 법적 (백명피스 공제 스포를 해석 주십시오) - 저자, 백명, 법적 통찰기 외에 기인인 경우 “별표기”  |   |   |   |   |\n|  부서, 자 | 법정 법적  |   |   |   |\n|  ■ 당국명  |   |   |   |   |\n|  * 법정 기획서, 정서, 신호사기 발송을 위한 시 법정별 서명 지표시스템, 민영영화에 기재 * 법정 발간일 경우 필기 기획서, 법정 인증확인 기재  |   |   |   |   |\n\nSPECIAL REPORT\n\nAPT37 (REAPER): THE OVERLOOKED NORTH KOREAN ACTOR\n\nIn 2017, APT37 targeted a Middle Eastern company that entered into a joint venture with the North Korean government to provide telecommunications service to the country (read on for a case study). At that time, other targets included individuals involved in international affairs and trade issues, the general director of a Vietnamese international trading and transport company, and possibly individuals working with Olympics organizations assisting in securing resources for athletes.\n\nNorth Korean defector and human rights-related targeting provides further evidence that APT37 conducts operations aligned with the interests of North Korea.\n\nAPT37 targeted a research fellow, advisory member, and journalist associated with different North Korean human rights issues and strategic organizations. It also targeted an entity in Japan associated with the United Nations missions on sanctions and human rights. APT37 distributed SLOWDRIFT malware using a lure referencing the Korea Global Forum against academic and strategic institutions located in South Korea. Notably, the email was sent from a compromised South Korean institute that conducts studies on North Korea. The string\"durihana,\"which is also the name of a Christian missionary organization that works with North Korean defectors, was included in an APT37 weaponized document sent to an individual who works with a North Korean human rights organization.\n\n## CASE STUDY:\n\n## Targeting of Middle Eastern Organization with Business ties to North Korea\n\nWe believe a Middle Eastern organization was targeted by APT37 because it had been involved with a North Korean company and a business deal went bad. This firm was targeted shortly after media reports of this schism had gone public. The targeting effort may have been an attempt by the North Korean government to gather information on a former business partner. The operation exemplifies APT37's tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs), and reflects the advanced capabilities of this espionage group.\n\nIn May 2017, APT37 used a bank liquidation letter as a spear phishing lure against a board member of a Middle Eastern financial company. The specially crafted email included an attachment containing exploit code for CVE-2017-0199, a vulnerability in Microsoft Office that had been disclosed just a month earlier. Once opened, the malicious document communicated with a compromised website, most likely to surreptitiously download and install a backdoor called SHUTTERSPEED (MDS: 7c2ebfc7960aac6f8d58b37a3f092a9c). The tool would enable APT37 to collect system information, take screenshots and download additional malicious files to the victim computer.\n\n## Initial Infection Vectors\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned spear phishing tactics, APT37 leverages a variety of methods to deliver malware. These include strategic web compromises typical of targeted cyber espionage operations, as well as the use of torrent file-sharing sites to distribute malware more indiscriminately.\n\nNumerous campaigns have employed social engineering tactics tailored specifically to desired targets. Lures and websites of particular interest to South Korean organizations (e.g. reunification) are regularly leveraged in campaigns. Multiple South Korean websites were abused in strategic web compromises to deliver newer variants of KARAE and POORAIM malware. Identified sites included South Korean conservative media and a news site for North Korean refugees and defectors. In one instance, APT37 weaponized a video downloader application with KARAE malware that was indiscriminately distributed to South Korean victims through torrent websites.\n\n![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)\n\nSPECIAL REPORT\n\nAPT37 (REAPER): THE OVERLOOKED NORTH KOREAN ACTOR\n\n![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)\nFigure 3. Timeline of CVE Release Dates vs. Dates of APT37 CVE Exploitation.\n\n# Exploited Vulnerabilities\n\nAPT37 frequently exploits vulnerabilities in Hangul Word Processor (HWP) due to the software's prevalence in South Korea. Further, the group recently demonstrated access to zero-day vulnerabilities and has the flexibility to quickly incorporate recently publicized vulnerabilities into spear phishing and strategic web compromise operations. These capabilities suggest a high operational tempo and specialized expertise.\n\nAPT37 has repeatedly deployed exploits, especially in Flash, quickly after vulnerabilities are initially publicized (see Table 1). CVE-2016-4117, CVE-2016-1019 and CVE-2015-3043 were all exploited by APT37 in this way. FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence confirmed that since at least November 2017, APT37 exploited a zero-day Adobe Flash vulnerability, CVE-2018-4878, to distribute DOGCALL malware to South Korean victims.\n\nWhile use and discovery of zero-day exploits over the past several years has expanded beyond a nation-state dominated environment to include commercial vendors of cyber espionage capabilities and sophisticated financially motivated actors, access to zero-day exploits remains a factor in distinguishing sophisticated or well-resourced actors.\n\nFigure 3 details the vulnerabilities exploited by APT37, comparing the time of exploitation to the time the CVE was released.\n\n# Command and Control Infrastructure\n\nAPT37 uses a variety of techniques for command and control. They leverage compromised servers, messaging platforms and cloud service providers to avoid detection. The group often relies on compromised sites to host second stage malware payloads. Over time, APT37 has changed the email providers to set up command and control accounts in a possible attempt to cover their tracks and cause misdirection. These tactics have been refined over the years as APT37 evolves to evade network defenders.\n\nAPT37 has used various legitimate platforms as command and control for its malware tools. While some early campaigns leveraged POORAIM, which abused AOL Instant Messenger, newer activity deploys DOGCALL, which uses cloud storage APIs such as pCloud and Dropbox.\n\nAPT37 relies on compromised websites to host second stage malware. Small websites focused on subjects such as aromatherapy and scuba diving have been leveraged, and were most likely compromised opportunistically and made to host malicious payloads.\n\nAPT37 has improved its operational security over time. For example, early 2015 use of SLOWDRIFT involved credentials associated with Korea related mail servers such as\"Daum.net\". Later, in 2015 and early 2016, APT37 pivoted to different email providers such as Gmail and\"hmamail.com\"in an attempt to anonymize activity. Then from mid-2016 onward, APT37 began using @yandex.com and @ india.com email accounts — possibly an attempt to cause misattribution.\n\nSPECIAL REPORT\n\nAPT37 (REAPER): THE OVERLOOKED NORTH KOREAN ACTOR\n\n# Malware\n\nAPT37 employs a diverse suite of malware for initial intrusion and exfiltration. Their malware is characterized by a focus on stealing information from victims, with many set up to automatically exfiltrate data of interest. Figure 4 shows APT37's malware usage over time. A full breakdown of the malware we associate with APT37, along with how it is detected by FireEye devices, is available in the Appendix.\n\nAlong with custom malware used for espionage purposes, APT37 also has access to destructive malware. In April 2017, APT37 targeted South Korean military and government organizations with the DOGCALL backdoor and RUHAPPY wiper malware. Although the wiper capability was not used in the identified instance, RUHAPPY can overwrite a machine's Master Boot Record (MBR), causing the system to fail to boot into preconfigured partitions.\n\nIt is possible that APT37's distribution of KARAE malware via torrent websites could assist in creating and maintaining botnets for future distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, or for other activity such as financially motivated campaigns or disruptive operations. Disruptive and destructive cyber threat activity, including the use of wiper malware, public leaks of proprietary materials by false hacktivist personas, DDoS attacks and electronic warfare tactics such as GPS signal jamming is consistent with past behavior by other North Korean actors.\n\n![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)\nFigure 4. Timeline of APT37 Malware Use By First and Last Observed Compile Times.\n\nSPECIAL REPORT\n\nART37 DREAMER: THE OVERLOOKED NORTH KOREAN ACTOR\n\n# Attribution\n\nWe assess with high confidence that APT37 acts in support of the North Korean government and is primarily based in North Korea. This assessment is based on multiple factors, including APT37's targeting profile, insight into the group's malware development and probable links to a North Korean individual believed to be the developer of several of APT37's proprietary malware families: - An individual we believe to be the developer behind several APT37 malware payloads inadvertently disclosed personal data showing that the actor was operating from an IP address and access point associated with North Korea.\n- The compilation times of APT37 malware is consistent with a developer operating in the North Korea time zone (UTC +8:30) and follows what is believed to be a typical North Korean workday (Fig. 5). The majority of malware compilation times occurred between 10:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m., with a dip around noon. Additional activity occurred late into the evening. This is consistent with media reporting of extremely long hours for North Korean workers.\n- The majority of APT37 activity continues to target South Korea, North Korean defectors, and organizations and individuals involved in Korean Peninsula reunification efforts. Similarly, APT37 targeting of a Middle Eastern company in 2017 is also consistent with North Korean objectives given the entity's extensive relationships inside North Korea.\n\n![img-5.jpeg](img-5.jpeg) Frequency![img-6.jpeg](img-6.jpeg)\n\n# Outlook and Implications\n\nNorth Korea has repeatedly demonstrated a willingness to leverage its cyber capabilities for a variety of purposes, unmetered by national, hellines and international norms. Though they have primarily tapped other tracked suspected North Korean teams to carry out the most aggressive actions, APT37 is an additional tool available to the regime, perhaps even desirable for its relative obscurity. We anticipate APT37 will be leveraged more and more in previously unfamiliar roles and regions, especially as pressure mounts on their sponsor.\n\nThe slow transformation of regional actors into global threats is well established. Minor incidents in Ukraine, the Middle East and South Korea have heralded the threats, which are now impossible to ignore. In some cases, the global economy connects organizations to aggressive regional actors. In other cases, a growing mandate draws the actor on to the international stage, ignored, these threats enjoy the benefit of surprise, allowing them to extract significant losses on their victims, many of whom have never previously heard of the actor.\n\nSPECIAL REPORT\n\nAPT37 (REAPER): THE OVERLOOKED NORTH KOREAN ACTOR\n\n# Appendix: Malware Used by APT37\n\n|  Malware | Description | Detected as  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  CORALDECK | CORALDECK is an exfiltration tool that searches for specified files and exfiltrates them in password protected archives using hardcoded HTTP POST headers.

  "payload": "## # INTRODUCTION\n\nOn Feb. 2, 2018, we published a blog detailing the use of an Adobe Flash zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2018-4878) by a suspected North Korean cyber espionage group that we now track as APT37 (Reaper). Recent examination of this group's activities by FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence reveals APT37 has expanded its operations in both scope and sophistication. APT37's toolset, which includes access to zero-day vulnerabilities and wiper malware, combined with heightened tensions in Northeast Asia and North Korea's penchant for norm breaking, means this group should be taken seriously.\nWe assess with high confidence that this activity is carried out on behalf of the North Korean government given malware development artifacts and targeting that aligns with North Korean state interests. FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence believes that APT37 is aligned with the activity publicly reported as Scarcraft and Group123.\nSPECIAL REPORT\nAPT37 (REAPER): THE OVERLOOKED NORTH KOREAN ACTOR\n\n---\n\n## # Attribution\n\nWe assess with high confidence that APT37 acts in support of the North Korean government and is primarily based in North Korea. This assessment is based on multiple factors, including APT37's targeting profile, insight into the group's malware development and probable links to a North Korean individual believed to be the developer of several of APT37's proprietary malware families: - An individual we believe to be the developer behind several APT37 malware payloads inadvertently disclosed personal data showing that the actor was operating from an IP address and access point associated with North Korea.\n- The compilation times of APT37 malware is consistent with a developer operating in the North Korea time zone (UTC +8:30) and follows what is believed to be a typical North Korean workday (Fig. 5). The majority of malware compilation times occurred between 10:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m., with a dip around noon. Additional activity occurred late into the evening. This is consistent with media reporting of extremely long hours for North Korean workers.\n- The majority of APT37 activity continues to target South Korea, North Korean defectors, and organizations and individuals involved in Korean Peninsula reunification efforts. Similarly, APT37 targeting of a Middle Eastern company in 2017 is also consistent with North Korean objectives given the entity's extensive relationships inside North Korea.\n![img-5.jpeg](img-5.jpeg) Frequency![img-6.jpeg](img-6.jpeg)",
