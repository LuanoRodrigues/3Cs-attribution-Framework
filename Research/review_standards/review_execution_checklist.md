# Review Execution Checklist (Unified)

Use this checklist for all review modes. Keep evidence paths in your run folder.

## 0. Review Identity
- [ ] `review_type` chosen: `literature` | `bibliographic` | `systematic`
- [ ] Topic and research question(s) fixed
- [ ] Corpus source locked and frozen snapshot saved
- [ ] Run directory created and artifact index initialized

## 1. Corpus and Screening
- [ ] Eligibility criteria finalized (`inclusion`, `exclusion`)
- [ ] Screening completed for all records
- [ ] Screening decisions include rationale per record
- [ ] Counts reconciled (`processed`, `screened`, `included`)
- [ ] Exclusion reasons summarized

## 2. Full-text and Coding Readiness
- [ ] Full-text availability audit completed
- [ ] Coding queue produced with per-item status
- [ ] Missing/full-text constraints documented
- [ ] Codebook initialized from unified coding system

## 3. Coding Quality Controls
- [ ] Required coding fields present for all coded rows
- [ ] Evidence rows linked to source item key
- [ ] Confidence/relevance scoring applied consistently
- [ ] Theme/argument tags normalized to controlled vocabulary
- [ ] Duplicates or low-value extracts filtered

## 4. Synthesis and Writing
- [ ] Theme clusters finalized
- [ ] Section-level synthesis drafted from coded evidence
- [ ] Claims carry citation/footnote links
- [ ] Abstract/introduction/conclusion/limitations drafted
- [ ] Reference list generated from cited sources only

## 5. Validation and Finalization
- [ ] Format validation passed (required headings/structure)
- [ ] Citation validation passed (in-text <-> notes/references)
- [ ] Context consistency checks passed (counts/themes/refs)
- [ ] Traceability file generated (`claim -> evidence -> source`)
- [ ] Final HTML generated and archived

## Mode-Specific Add-ons

### Literature Review
- [ ] Narrative synthesis prioritizes cross-source argument comparison
- [ ] 3-7 coherent findings themes (excluding intro/method/conclusion)
- [ ] Methodology section reports screening + coding pipeline

### Bibliographic Review
- [ ] Bibliometric metadata completeness checked (authors/year/venue/DOI)
- [ ] Descriptive trend outputs included (timeline/keyword clusters)
- [ ] Statistical summaries tied back to corpus constraints

### Systematic Review
- [ ] PRISMA checklist referenced and completed
- [ ] PRISMA flow counts fully reconciled
- [ ] Risk-of-bias method and outputs documented
- [ ] Eligibility and extraction process reproducible by third party
