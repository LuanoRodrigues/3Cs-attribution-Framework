        "abstractNote": "Emilio Iasiello’s conference paper “Cyber Attack: A Dull Tool to Shape Foreign Policy” delivers a rigorous multidisciplinary examination of the strategic utility—and limitations—of state-level offensive cyber operations in the pursuit of foreign policy objectives. Structured around three emblematic case studies—the October 2012 distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks on U.S. financial institutions, the 2012 Stuxnet operation against Iran’s Natanz nuclear facility, and the 2007 cyber assault on Estonia’s government networks—Iasiello adopts the working assumption of state sponsorship or proxy orchestration, using intent analysis, circumstantial evidence, and open-source expert testimony in the absence of definitive attribution. The study commences by positioning cyber weapons alongside nuclear arms within the framework of deterrence theory, underscoring the stark contrasts between the transparently monitored development and assured destruction characteristic of nuclear arsenals and the opaque, attribution-resistant nature of cyber capabilities. He argues that the absence of clear attribution, a lack of genuinely destructive “shock” effects analogous to nuclear blasts, and the constrained target base of heavily networked states undermine the credibility and coercive potential of cyber operations. In each case study, despite technical success in disruption and degradation, the cyber campaigns fell short of compelling policy change or deterring adversarial behavior: the U.S. banking sector DDoS incidents produced only transient service interruptions without eliciting concessions; Stuxnet inflicted notable damage on Iranian centrifuges but failed to decelerate Iran’s nuclear ambitions or prompt meaningful diplomatic negotiation; and the Estonia attacks showcased Russia’s cyber coordination yet did not translate into political leverage over the Baltic state or NATO. Iasiello contrasts these empirical insights with prevailing U.S. cyber policy frameworks—namely the 2011 International Strategy for Cyberspace and the Department of Defense’s 2011 Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace—which articulate a holistic approach encompassing diplomatic, informational, military, and economic instruments under international law. Despite the establishment of U.S. Cyber Command and policy proclamations affirming the right to employ “all necessary means” in defense of national interests, Iasiello contends that offensive cyber operations remain largely symbolic, lacking the paradigm-shifting impact required for coercive statecraft. The paper concludes that until a cyber event emerges that both guarantees attribution and generates pervasive strategic fear, states will continue to prioritize traditional diplomatic and military levers over cyber coercion. By bridging technical incident analysis with strategic policy assessment, this work offers a sober reassessment of the nascent role of cyber weapons in modern interstate competition and contributes a valuable multidisciplinary perspective to the study of cyber conflict.",

        "abstractNote": "The increasing reliance of states on information technology has elevated cyber-attacks into a prominent challenge for international security, yet their unique characteristics and legal ambiguity have hindered the effective application of existing jus ad bellum principles. Recognizing the milestone cyber-incidents such as the 2007 Estonia attacks and the Stuxnet operation against Iran in 2010, this article addresses the critical issue of cyber-attribution and its implications for lawful state responses. The authors argue that without a robust attribution framework, states face a dual risk: either unchecked escalation through misdirected self-defense or paralysis when pursuing peaceful legal redress. Motivated by the lack of consensus in scholarly proposals and the absence of binding international jurisprudence, the study aims to develop a model that aligns attribution requirements with the nature of the victim state’s response, thereby resolving the practical impasse in state practice. Employing a doctrinal analysis of public international law, the article leverages existing state practice, scholarly literature, and principles established in the United Nations Charter, particularly Articles 2(4) and 51. It examines the taxonomy of cyber-attacks—direct intrusion, indirect malware-based assaults, and denial of service operations—and assesses how each challenges traditional notions of the use of force, self-defense, and state responsibility. The findings reveal that the technical complexity and anonymity inherent in cyber operations render high thresholds for attribution essential when invoking self-defense, while the same hurdles impede legal recourse under international adjudication. To reconcile these conflicting demands, the authors propose a dual-tier attribution model: a strict ‘‘effective control’’ or high-evidence standard for self-defense measures to prevent misdirected force, coupled with a strict liability regime governing non-forcible state responses, under which host-state cooperation in evidence gathering constitutes fulfillment of attribution obligations. This framework incentivizes peaceful resolution, discourages unilateral retaliation, and leverages states’ mutual interest in legal cooperation. The novel contribution lies in linking attribution thresholds to the chosen response mechanism, thereby extending established doctrines of effective control and strict liability into the cyber domain. The model provides a structured pathway for victims to pursue legal remedies without being stranded by evidentiary hurdles, while preserving the integrity of self-defense law. The authors acknowledge limitations, including the challenges of enforcing host-state cooperation absent compulsory jurisdiction and the nascent development of international tribunals with mandates over cyber disputes. They also note that their model does not fully address countermeasure doctrines and leaves open questions about reciprocal obligations in transnational data flows. Future research is encouraged to explore mechanisms for compulsory adjudication in cyber-incidents, the role of emerging norms such as those in the Tallinn Manual, and the applicability of countermeasures under international law to refine the proposed attribution model and support its adoption within multilateral treaty frameworks.",

        "abstractNote": "Concerns about state-directed cyber intrusions have grown increasingly prevalent as governments exploit proxy actors to obfuscate involvement, complicating international enforcement and legal accountability in cyberspace. This paper addresses the challenge of attributing state sponsorship when operational tasks are delegated to non-state hackers by proposing a structured framework that refines conventional, technically oriented attribution methods with contextually grounded political and legal indicators. The research matters because gaps in international law, stringent evidentiary burdens, and obstacles to detection threaten to shield sponsoring states from responsibility, undermining the deterrence value of international norms and countermeasures. It aims to identify the specific conditions under which states are likely to outsource cyber operations, articulate a method for integrating these conditions with forensic signals, and answer the question of how to distinguish genuinely state-backed attacks from independent hacktivism without excessive false positives.1 Employing a hybrid analytical methodology that synthesizes international legal analysis, dyadic conflict theory, and proxy warfare scholarship, the author draws on open-source data—such as existing cyber capabilities assessments conducted by intelligence agencies, polling on nationalist sentiment among domestic hacker populations, documented instances of enmity between states, and incident-specific forensic indicators—to operationalize variables like motive, means, opportunity, nationalism salience, and technical skill levels. By inferring approximate values for these variables and applying a process-of-elimination logic, the framework enables investigators to narrow the pool of suspect states in the absence of full technical disclosure. The core finding is that the permissive conditions under which states rationally choose to delegate cyberattacks occupy a much narrower range than commonly assumed, meaning that most attribution challenges can be resolved by identifying overlaps between contextual conditions and forensic markers. This insight not only reduces false positives but also enhances the normative force of attribution judgments by ensuring that only those instances meeting both technical and contextual thresholds are classified as state-sponsored. The paper’s principal contribution is a novel attribution roadmap that integrates legal standards of state responsibility—drawing on the spectrum of control in international law and State Responsibility Articles—with social science indicators of proxy conflict, thereby offering policymakers, legal advocates, and technical analysts a unified model for assessing foreign state complicity. A limitation acknowledged by the author is the potential error in approximating variables such as nationalistic fervor and ideological salience, as well as the reluctance of private cybersecurity firms to disclose breach details, which may constrain the empirical application of the framework. The author suggests that future research could focus on refining measurement techniques for contextual indicators, conducting case studies to empirically validate and calibrate the model against documented cyber incidents, and exploring how evolving international legal norms—such as those articulated in the Tallinn Manual and ILC Articles—might further shape attribution standards and state behavior in proxy-based cyber conflict.",

        "abstractNote": "Attributing a cyber-operation through the use of multiple pieces of technical evidence (i.e., malware reverse-engineering and source tracking) and conventional intelligence sources (i.e., human or signals intelligence) is a difficult problem not only due to the effort required to obtain evidence, but the ease with which an adversary can plant false evidence. In this paper, we introduce a formal reasoning system called the InCA (Intelligent Cyber Attribution) framework that is designed to aid an analyst in the attribution of a cyber-operation even when the available information is conflicting and/or uncertain. Our approach combines argumentation-based reasoning, logic programming, and probabilistic models to not only attribute an operation but also explain to the analyst why the system reaches its conclusions.",

At the same time, cybersecurity issues have been catapulted into the highest of high politics: cyberpolitics. The objective of this chapter is to encourage political decision-makers (and others) to create a framework of proportionate ways to respond to different kinds of cyber hostility. The proportionate response is a complicated, situational political question. This chapter creates a context for the contemporary politics of cyber affairs in the world and determines five variables that policymakers need to consider when evaluating appropriate responses to a cyber attack. As offensive cyber activity becomes more prevalent, policymakers will be challenged to develop proportionate responses to disruptive or destructive attacks. There has already been significant pressure to \"do something\" in the light of the alleged state-sponsored attacks. Past experience suggests that most policy responses are ad hoc. This chapter comprehensively analyzes how cyber attacks should be treated as a political question and represents a rough framework for policymakers to build on. The chapter presents five variables that policymakers need to consider when evaluating appropriate responses to cyber hostilities. Combining incident impact, policy options, and other variables, the framework outlines the different levers of cyberpolitics that can be applied in response to the escalating levels of cyber incidents. The response framework is also an integral part of the state's cyber deterrence.",

        "abstractNote": "test\nThe study addresses the critical challenge of cyber attribution, which is essential for effective cybersecurity but remains hindered by the limitations of purely technical approaches that focus narrowly on Indicators of Compromise (IOC) without resolving the broader origins of attacks. The research problem centers on the lack of a unified framework to integrate diverse data types and specialized analyses required for comprehensive attribution, exacerbated by communication barriers between disciplines. The primary objective is to develop a multidisciplinary framework enabling experts from various fields to contribute to attribution through standardized libraries, thereby filling intelligence gaps and facilitating collaborative analysis. The methodology involves creating a process for developing compatible libraries across technical disciplines, which analysts can use to construct a holistic attribution picture. Key findings demonstrate the framework’s success in real-time intelligence integration, bridging communication gaps between technical and non-technical analysts, and providing a visual tool for briefings. Limitations include the reliance on highly specialized skills and the complexity of harmonizing disparate data types. Future research directions suggest expanding the framework’s applicability to non-technical domains and refining methods to address identified weaknesses in the attribution process. The study’s novelty lies in its interdisciplinary approach, offering a practical solution to a persistent cybersecurity challenge.",

Consequentially, decision makers in the private sector and policymakers in the U.S. government (USG) need a framework in order to make effective response decisions. The authors' research identified two competing risks: 1) the risk of not responding forcefully enough to deter a suspected attacker, and 2) responding in a manner that escalates a situation with an attacker. The authors also identified three primary factors that influence these risks: attribution confidence/time, the scale of the attack, and the relationship with the suspected attacker. This paper provides a framework to help decision makers understand how these factors interact to influence the risks associated with potential response options to cyberattacks.

        "abstractNote": "The increasing reliance of states on information technology has elevated cyber-attacks into a prominent challenge for international security, yet their unique characteristics and legal ambiguity have hindered the effective application of existing jus ad bellum principles. Recognizing the milestone cyber-incidents such as the 2007 Estonia attacks and the Stuxnet operation against Iran in 2010, this article addresses the critical issue of cyber-attribution and its implications for lawful state responses. The authors argue that without a robust attribution framework, states face a dual risk: either unchecked escalation through misdirected self-defense or paralysis when pursuing peaceful legal redress. Motivated by the lack of consensus in scholarly proposals and the absence of binding international jurisprudence, the study aims to develop a model that aligns attribution requirements with the nature of the victim state’s response, thereby resolving the practical impasse in state practice. Employing a doctrinal analysis of public international law, the article leverages existing state practice, scholarly literature, and principles established in the United Nations Charter, particularly Articles 2(4) and 51. It examines the taxonomy of cyber-attacks—direct intrusion, indirect malware-based assaults, and denial of service operations—and assesses how each challenges traditional notions of the use of force, self-defense, and state responsibility. The findings reveal that the technical complexity and anonymity inherent in cyber operations render high thresholds for attribution essential when invoking self-defense, while the same hurdles impede legal recourse under international adjudication. To reconcile these conflicting demands, the authors propose a dual-tier attribution model: a strict ‘‘effective control’’ or high-evidence standard for self-defense measures to prevent misdirected force, coupled with a strict liability regime governing non-forcible state responses, under which host-state cooperation in evidence gathering constitutes fulfillment of attribution obligations. This framework incentivizes peaceful resolution, discourages unilateral retaliation, and leverages states’ mutual interest in legal cooperation. The novel contribution lies in linking attribution thresholds to the chosen response mechanism, thereby extending established doctrines of effective control and strict liability into the cyber domain. The model provides a structured pathway for victims to pursue legal remedies without being stranded by evidentiary hurdles, while preserving the integrity of self-defense law. The authors acknowledge limitations, including the challenges of enforcing host-state cooperation absent compulsory jurisdiction and the nascent development of international tribunals with mandates over cyber disputes. They also note that their model does not fully address countermeasure doctrines and leaves open questions about reciprocal obligations in transnational data flows. Future research is encouraged to explore mechanisms for compulsory adjudication in cyber-incidents, the role of emerging norms such as those in the Tallinn Manual, and the applicability of countermeasures under international law to refine the proposed attribution model and support its adoption within multilateral treaty frameworks.",

        "abstractNote": "Emilio Iasiello’s conference paper “Cyber Attack: A Dull Tool to Shape Foreign Policy” delivers a rigorous multidisciplinary examination of the strategic utility—and limitations—of state-level offensive cyber operations in the pursuit of foreign policy objectives. Structured around three emblematic case studies—the October 2012 distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks on U.S. financial institutions, the 2012 Stuxnet operation against Iran’s Natanz nuclear facility, and the 2007 cyber assault on Estonia’s government networks—Iasiello adopts the working assumption of state sponsorship or proxy orchestration, using intent analysis, circumstantial evidence, and open-source expert testimony in the absence of definitive attribution. The study commences by positioning cyber weapons alongside nuclear arms within the framework of deterrence theory, underscoring the stark contrasts between the transparently monitored development and assured destruction characteristic of nuclear arsenals and the opaque, attribution-resistant nature of cyber capabilities. He argues that the absence of clear attribution, a lack of genuinely destructive “shock” effects analogous to nuclear blasts, and the constrained target base of heavily networked states undermine the credibility and coercive potential of cyber operations. In each case study, despite technical success in disruption and degradation, the cyber campaigns fell short of compelling policy change or deterring adversarial behavior: the U.S. banking sector DDoS incidents produced only transient service interruptions without eliciting concessions; Stuxnet inflicted notable damage on Iranian centrifuges but failed to decelerate Iran’s nuclear ambitions or prompt meaningful diplomatic negotiation; and the Estonia attacks showcased Russia’s cyber coordination yet did not translate into political leverage over the Baltic state or NATO. Iasiello contrasts these empirical insights with prevailing U.S. cyber policy frameworks—namely the 2011 International Strategy for Cyberspace and the Department of Defense’s 2011 Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace—which articulate a holistic approach encompassing diplomatic, informational, military, and economic instruments under international law. Despite the establishment of U.S. Cyber Command and policy proclamations affirming the right to employ “all necessary means” in defense of national interests, Iasiello contends that offensive cyber operations remain largely symbolic, lacking the paradigm-shifting impact required for coercive statecraft. The paper concludes that until a cyber event emerges that both guarantees attribution and generates pervasive strategic fear, states will continue to prioritize traditional diplomatic and military levers over cyber coercion. By bridging technical incident analysis with strategic policy assessment, this work offers a sober reassessment of the nascent role of cyber weapons in modern interstate competition and contributes a valuable multidisciplinary perspective to the study of cyber conflict.",

        "abstractNote": "Concerns about state-directed cyber intrusions have grown increasingly prevalent as governments exploit proxy actors to obfuscate involvement, complicating international enforcement and legal accountability in cyberspace. This paper addresses the challenge of attributing state sponsorship when operational tasks are delegated to non-state hackers by proposing a structured framework that refines conventional, technically oriented attribution methods with contextually grounded political and legal indicators. The research matters because gaps in international law, stringent evidentiary burdens, and obstacles to detection threaten to shield sponsoring states from responsibility, undermining the deterrence value of international norms and countermeasures. It aims to identify the specific conditions under which states are likely to outsource cyber operations, articulate a method for integrating these conditions with forensic signals, and answer the question of how to distinguish genuinely state-backed attacks from independent hacktivism without excessive false positives.1 Employing a hybrid analytical methodology that synthesizes international legal analysis, dyadic conflict theory, and proxy warfare scholarship, the author draws on open-source data—such as existing cyber capabilities assessments conducted by intelligence agencies, polling on nationalist sentiment among domestic hacker populations, documented instances of enmity between states, and incident-specific forensic indicators—to operationalize variables like motive, means, opportunity, nationalism salience, and technical skill levels. By inferring approximate values for these variables and applying a process-of-elimination logic, the framework enables investigators to narrow the pool of suspect states in the absence of full technical disclosure. The core finding is that the permissive conditions under which states rationally choose to delegate cyberattacks occupy a much narrower range than commonly assumed, meaning that most attribution challenges can be resolved by identifying overlaps between contextual conditions and forensic markers. This insight not only reduces false positives but also enhances the normative force of attribution judgments by ensuring that only those instances meeting both technical and contextual thresholds are classified as state-sponsored. The paper’s principal contribution is a novel attribution roadmap that integrates legal standards of state responsibility—drawing on the spectrum of control in international law and State Responsibility Articles—with social science indicators of proxy conflict, thereby offering policymakers, legal advocates, and technical analysts a unified model for assessing foreign state complicity. A limitation acknowledged by the author is the potential error in approximating variables such as nationalistic fervor and ideological salience, as well as the reluctance of private cybersecurity firms to disclose breach details, which may constrain the empirical application of the framework. The author suggests that future research could focus on refining measurement techniques for contextual indicators, conducting case studies to empirically validate and calibrate the model against documented cyber incidents, and exploring how evolving international legal norms—such as those articulated in the Tallinn Manual and ILC Articles—might further shape attribution standards and state behavior in proxy-based cyber conflict.",

        "abstractNote": "Attributing a cyber-operation through the use of multiple pieces of technical evidence (i.e., malware reverse-engineering and source tracking) and conventional intelligence sources (i.e., human or signals intelligence) is a difficult problem not only due to the effort required to obtain evidence, but the ease with which an adversary can plant false evidence. In this paper, we introduce a formal reasoning system called the InCA (Intelligent Cyber Attribution) framework that is designed to aid an analyst in the attribution of a cyber-operation even when the available information is conflicting and/or uncertain. Our approach combines argumentation-based reasoning, logic programming, and probabilistic models to not only attribute an operation but also explain to the analyst why the system reaches its conclusions.",

At the same time, cybersecurity issues have been catapulted into the highest of high politics: cyberpolitics. The objective of this chapter is to encourage political decision-makers (and others) to create a framework of proportionate ways to respond to different kinds of cyber hostility. The proportionate response is a complicated, situational political question. This chapter creates a context for the contemporary politics of cyber affairs in the world and determines five variables that policymakers need to consider when evaluating appropriate responses to a cyber attack. As offensive cyber activity becomes more prevalent, policymakers will be challenged to develop proportionate responses to disruptive or destructive attacks. There has already been significant pressure to \"do something\" in the light of the alleged state-sponsored attacks. Past experience suggests that most policy responses are ad hoc. This chapter comprehensively analyzes how cyber attacks should be treated as a political question and represents a rough framework for policymakers to build on. The chapter presents five variables that policymakers need to consider when evaluating appropriate responses to cyber hostilities. Combining incident impact, policy options, and other variables, the framework outlines the different levers of cyberpolitics that can be applied in response to the escalating levels of cyber incidents. The response framework is also an integral part of the state's cyber deterrence.",

The research problem centers on the lack of a unified framework to integrate diverse data types and specialized analyses required for comprehensive attribution, exacerbated by communication barriers between disciplines. The primary objective is to develop a multidisciplinary framework enabling experts from various fields to contribute to attribution through standardized libraries, thereby filling intelligence gaps and facilitating collaborative analysis. The methodology involves creating a process for developing compatible libraries across technical disciplines, which analysts can use to construct a holistic attribution picture. Key findings demonstrate the framework’s success in real-time intelligence integration, bridging communication gaps between technical and non-technical analysts, and providing a visual tool for briefings. Limitations include the reliance on highly specialized skills and the complexity of harmonizing disparate data types. Future research directions suggest expanding the framework’s applicability to non-technical domains and refining methods to address identified weaknesses in the attribution process. The study’s novelty lies in its interdisciplinary approach, offering a practical solution to a persistent cybersecurity challenge.",

        "abstractNote": "The process for determining how to respond to a cyberattack involves evaluating many factors, including some with competing risks. Consequentially, decision makers in the private sector and policymakers in the U.S. government (USG) need a framework in order to make effective response decisions. The authors' research identified two competing risks: 1) the risk of not responding forcefully enough to deter a suspected attacker, and 2) responding in a manner that escalates a situation with an attacker. The authors also identified three primary factors that influence these risks: attribution confidence/time, the scale of the attack, and the relationship with the suspected attacker. This paper provides a framework to help decision makers understand how these factors interact to influence the risks associated with potential response options to cyberattacks.

        "abstractNote": "Emilio Iasiello’s conference paper “Cyber Attack: A Dull Tool to Shape Foreign Policy” delivers a rigorous multidisciplinary examination of the strategic utility—and limitations—of state-level offensive cyber operations in the pursuit of foreign policy objectives. Structured around three emblematic case studies—the October 2012 distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks on U.S. financial institutions, the 2012 Stuxnet operation against Iran’s Natanz nuclear facility, and the 2007 cyber assault on Estonia’s government networks—Iasiello adopts the working assumption of state sponsorship or proxy orchestration, using intent analysis, circumstantial evidence, and open-source expert testimony in the absence of definitive attribution. The study commences by positioning cyber weapons alongside nuclear arms within the framework of deterrence theory, underscoring the stark contrasts between the transparently monitored development and assured destruction characteristic of nuclear arsenals and the opaque, attribution-resistant nature of cyber capabilities. He argues that the absence of clear attribution, a lack of genuinely destructive “shock” effects analogous to nuclear blasts, and the constrained target base of heavily networked states undermine the credibility and coercive potential of cyber operations. In each case study, despite technical success in disruption and degradation, the cyber campaigns fell short of compelling policy change or deterring adversarial behavior: the U.S. banking sector DDoS incidents produced only transient service interruptions without eliciting concessions; Stuxnet inflicted notable damage on Iranian centrifuges but failed to decelerate Iran’s nuclear ambitions or prompt meaningful diplomatic negotiation; and the Estonia attacks showcased Russia’s cyber coordination yet did not translate into political leverage over the Baltic state or NATO. Iasiello contrasts these empirical insights with prevailing U.S. cyber policy frameworks—namely the 2011 International Strategy for Cyberspace and the Department of Defense’s 2011 Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace—which articulate a holistic approach encompassing diplomatic, informational, military, and economic instruments under international law. Despite the establishment of U.S. Cyber Command and policy proclamations affirming the right to employ “all necessary means” in defense of national interests, Iasiello contends that offensive cyber operations remain largely symbolic, lacking the paradigm-shifting impact required for coercive statecraft. The paper concludes that until a cyber event emerges that both guarantees attribution and generates pervasive strategic fear, states will continue to prioritize traditional diplomatic and military levers over cyber coercion. By bridging technical incident analysis with strategic policy assessment, this work offers a sober reassessment of the nascent role of cyber weapons in modern interstate competition and contributes a valuable multidisciplinary perspective to the study of cyber conflict.",

        "abstractNote": "The increasing reliance of states on information technology has elevated cyber-attacks into a prominent challenge for international security, yet their unique characteristics and legal ambiguity have hindered the effective application of existing jus ad bellum principles. Recognizing the milestone cyber-incidents such as the 2007 Estonia attacks and the Stuxnet operation against Iran in 2010, this article addresses the critical issue of cyber-attribution and its implications for lawful state responses. The authors argue that without a robust attribution framework, states face a dual risk: either unchecked escalation through misdirected self-defense or paralysis when pursuing peaceful legal redress. Motivated by the lack of consensus in scholarly proposals and the absence of binding international jurisprudence, the study aims to develop a model that aligns attribution requirements with the nature of the victim state’s response, thereby resolving the practical impasse in state practice. Employing a doctrinal analysis of public international law, the article leverages existing state practice, scholarly literature, and principles established in the United Nations Charter, particularly Articles 2(4) and 51. It examines the taxonomy of cyber-attacks—direct intrusion, indirect malware-based assaults, and denial of service operations—and assesses how each challenges traditional notions of the use of force, self-defense, and state responsibility. The findings reveal that the technical complexity and anonymity inherent in cyber operations render high thresholds for attribution essential when invoking self-defense, while the same hurdles impede legal recourse under international adjudication. To reconcile these conflicting demands, the authors propose a dual-tier attribution model: a strict ‘‘effective control’’ or high-evidence standard for self-defense measures to prevent misdirected force, coupled with a strict liability regime governing non-forcible state responses, under which host-state cooperation in evidence gathering constitutes fulfillment of attribution obligations. This framework incentivizes peaceful resolution, discourages unilateral retaliation, and leverages states’ mutual interest in legal cooperation. The novel contribution lies in linking attribution thresholds to the chosen response mechanism, thereby extending established doctrines of effective control and strict liability into the cyber domain. The model provides a structured pathway for victims to pursue legal remedies without being stranded by evidentiary hurdles, while preserving the integrity of self-defense law. The authors acknowledge limitations, including the challenges of enforcing host-state cooperation absent compulsory jurisdiction and the nascent development of international tribunals with mandates over cyber disputes. They also note that their model does not fully address countermeasure doctrines and leaves open questions about reciprocal obligations in transnational data flows. Future research is encouraged to explore mechanisms for compulsory adjudication in cyber-incidents, the role of emerging norms such as those in the Tallinn Manual, and the applicability of countermeasures under international law to refine the proposed attribution model and support its adoption within multilateral treaty frameworks.",

        "abstractNote": "Concerns about state-directed cyber intrusions have grown increasingly prevalent as governments exploit proxy actors to obfuscate involvement, complicating international enforcement and legal accountability in cyberspace. This paper addresses the challenge of attributing state sponsorship when operational tasks are delegated to non-state hackers by proposing a structured framework that refines conventional, technically oriented attribution methods with contextually grounded political and legal indicators. The research matters because gaps in international law, stringent evidentiary burdens, and obstacles to detection threaten to shield sponsoring states from responsibility, undermining the deterrence value of international norms and countermeasures. It aims to identify the specific conditions under which states are likely to outsource cyber operations, articulate a method for integrating these conditions with forensic signals, and answer the question of how to distinguish genuinely state-backed attacks from independent hacktivism without excessive false positives.1 Employing a hybrid analytical methodology that synthesizes international legal analysis, dyadic conflict theory, and proxy warfare scholarship, the author draws on open-source data—such as existing cyber capabilities assessments conducted by intelligence agencies, polling on nationalist sentiment among domestic hacker populations, documented instances of enmity between states, and incident-specific forensic indicators—to operationalize variables like motive, means, opportunity, nationalism salience, and technical skill levels. By inferring approximate values for these variables and applying a process-of-elimination logic, the framework enables investigators to narrow the pool of suspect states in the absence of full technical disclosure. The core finding is that the permissive conditions under which states rationally choose to delegate cyberattacks occupy a much narrower range than commonly assumed, meaning that most attribution challenges can be resolved by identifying overlaps between contextual conditions and forensic markers. This insight not only reduces false positives but also enhances the normative force of attribution judgments by ensuring that only those instances meeting both technical and contextual thresholds are classified as state-sponsored. The paper’s principal contribution is a novel attribution roadmap that integrates legal standards of state responsibility—drawing on the spectrum of control in international law and State Responsibility Articles—with social science indicators of proxy conflict, thereby offering policymakers, legal advocates, and technical analysts a unified model for assessing foreign state complicity. A limitation acknowledged by the author is the potential error in approximating variables such as nationalistic fervor and ideological salience, as well as the reluctance of private cybersecurity firms to disclose breach details, which may constrain the empirical application of the framework. The author suggests that future research could focus on refining measurement techniques for contextual indicators, conducting case studies to empirically validate and calibrate the model against documented cyber incidents, and exploring how evolving international legal norms—such as those articulated in the Tallinn Manual and ILC Articles—might further shape attribution standards and state behavior in proxy-based cyber conflict.",

        "abstractNote": "Attributing a cyber-operation through the use of multiple pieces of technical evidence (i.e., malware reverse-engineering and source tracking) and conventional intelligence sources (i.e., human or signals intelligence) is a difficult problem not only due to the effort required to obtain evidence, but the ease with which an adversary can plant false evidence. In this paper, we introduce a formal reasoning system called the InCA (Intelligent Cyber Attribution) framework that is designed to aid an analyst in the attribution of a cyber-operation even when the available information is conflicting and/or uncertain. Our approach combines argumentation-based reasoning, logic programming, and probabilistic models to not only attribute an operation but also explain to the analyst why the system reaches its conclusions.",

        "abstractNote": "The debate on both the impacts of cyber attacks and how to respond to them is active, but precedents are a few. At the same time, cybersecurity issues have been catapulted into the highest of high politics: cyberpolitics. The objective of this chapter is to encourage political decision-makers (and others) to create a framework of proportionate ways to respond to different kinds of cyber hostility. The proportionate response is a complicated, situational political question. This chapter creates a context for the contemporary politics of cyber affairs in the world and determines five variables that policymakers need to consider when evaluating appropriate responses to a cyber attack. As offensive cyber activity becomes more prevalent, policymakers will be challenged to develop proportionate responses to disruptive or destructive attacks. There has already been significant pressure to \"do something\" in the light of the alleged state-sponsored attacks. Past experience suggests that most policy responses are ad hoc. This chapter comprehensively analyzes how cyber attacks should be treated as a political question and represents a rough framework for policymakers to build on. The chapter presents five variables that policymakers need to consider when evaluating appropriate responses to cyber hostilities. Combining incident impact, policy options, and other variables, the framework outlines the different levers of cyberpolitics that can be applied in response to the escalating levels of cyber incidents. The response framework is also an integral part of the state's cyber deterrence.",

        "abstractNote": "test\nThe study addresses the critical challenge of cyber attribution, which is essential for effective cybersecurity but remains hindered by the limitations of purely technical approaches that focus narrowly on Indicators of Compromise (IOC) without resolving the broader origins of attacks. The research problem centers on the lack of a unified framework to integrate diverse data types and specialized analyses required for comprehensive attribution, exacerbated by communication barriers between disciplines. The primary objective is to develop a multidisciplinary framework enabling experts from various fields to contribute to attribution through standardized libraries, thereby filling intelligence gaps and facilitating collaborative analysis. The methodology involves creating a process for developing compatible libraries across technical disciplines, which analysts can use to construct a holistic attribution picture. Key findings demonstrate the framework’s success in real-time intelligence integration, bridging communication gaps between technical and non-technical analysts, and providing a visual tool for briefings. Limitations include the reliance on highly specialized skills and the complexity of harmonizing disparate data types. Future research directions suggest expanding the framework’s applicability to non-technical domains and refining methods to address identified weaknesses in the attribution process. The study’s novelty lies in its interdisciplinary approach, offering a practical solution to a persistent cybersecurity challenge.",

Consequentially, decision makers in the private sector and policymakers in the U.S. government (USG) need a framework in order to make effective response decisions. The authors' research identified two competing risks: 1) the risk of not responding forcefully enough to deter a suspected attacker, and 2) responding in a manner that escalates a situation with an attacker. The authors also identified three primary factors that influence these risks: attribution confidence/time, the scale of the attack, and the relationship with the suspected attacker. This paper provides a framework to help decision makers understand how these factors interact to influence the risks associated with potential response options to cyberattacks. The views expressed do not reflect the official policy or position of the National Intelligence University, the Department of Defense, the U.S. Intelligence Community, or the U.S. Government.",

        "abstractNote": "Ziolkowski’s 2013 work, “General Principles of Public International Law as Applicable in Cyberspace,” presents a comprehensive doctrinal analysis of how foundational norms governing sovereign behavior translate into the digital domain. Opening with a historical overview, the paper traces the evolution of sovereignty from territorial control over land and airspace to digital jurisdiction over networks and data, arguing that states exercise sovereign rights over cyber infrastructure that they effectively control, including servers, cables, and virtual services within their territory. Building on this, the author examines the principle of non-intervention, demonstrating how unauthorized cyber operations that impair a state’s political independence—through data manipulation, denial-of-service attacks on critical governance systems, or influence operations targeting electoral processes—constitute prohibited interference analogous to coercive measures in kinetic conflict. Central to the analysis is the prohibition on the use of force under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. Ziolkowski develops a set of threshold criteria—scope, intensity, and effect—that parallel traditional armed force assessments, interpreting high-volume cyber assaults that disrupt critical infrastructure or threaten human security as tantamount to use of force. The discussion then transitions to state responsibility and attribution, exploring classical tests of effective control, overall control, and introducing the notion of virtual control to address the diffuse nature of cyber proxies. Relying on state practice and UN GGE reports, the paper critiques the ambiguity in current attribution standards and proposes that a hybrid test—integrating technical forensic evidence with customary legal benchmarks—offers the greatest reliability for linking operations to attested state actors or their agents. The doctrinal inquiry extends to due diligence obligations, positing that states must not only refrain from sponsoring malicious cyber activities but also proactively prevent non-state actors within their jurisdiction from mounting harmful cyber operations. This emphasis on preventive duties is grounded in customary law and established countermeasure frameworks, and aligns with emerging national strategies that call for domestic regulatory measures and cooperative cyber defense initiatives. In discussing countermeasures and sanctions, Ziolkowski assesses the legality of proportionate responses—ranging from diplomatic protests to economic sanctions and cyber counter-operations—within the scope of permissible reprisals, drawing on case law and Security Council practice to outline the parameters of lawful state behavior. Furthermore, the paper interrogates existing doctrine frameworks such as the Tallinn Manual’s articulation of cyber kill chain stages, the MITRE ATT&CK mapping for threat intelligence, and the OODA loop for decision-making attribution, evaluating their applicability to state practice and suggesting refinements to ensure consistency with international legal principles. Concluding, Ziolkowski offers normative policy guidance for states and multilateral bodies, advocating for standardized attribution protocols, enhanced information sharing, and the development of treaty-based rules to fill identified normative gaps. Ultimately, the study contributes a policy-analytic doctrine that bridges legal theory and practical governance, providing a roadmap for reconciling traditional international law with the complexities of state conduct in cyberspace.",

        "abstractNote": "In “Cyber Espionage and International Law,” Aaron Shull examines the twin challenges posed by state practice and legal norms in regulating cyber espionage under international law. The paper begins by observing that, unlike traditional human espionage which directly violates territorial integrity, cyber intrusions do not obviously offend this principle, creating ambiguity as to their legality. To assess the legal status of cyber espionage, Shull turns to customary international law, focusing on state practice and opinio juris. He identifies the customary norm of non-interference — enshrined in the 1965 UN Declaration on Intervention and the 1970 Friendly Relations Declaration — which prohibits “any form of interference” in a state’s political, economic, and cultural affairs. Building on the International Court of Justice’s Lotus and Nicaragua decisions, Shull argues that acts of cyber espionage which coerce or compel a change in a target state’s policies breach the principle of non-interference, and thus are illegal absent explicit treaty authorization.\n\nDespite the theoretical illegality of cyber espionage, Shull demonstrates that weak customary constraints have allowed widespread, largely unchecked practice among states. He analyzes Operation Aurora — the 2010 cyber infiltration of Google’s servers allegedly attributed to a foreign state actor — to show that states habitually deny responsibility and exhibit no consistent sense of legal obligation to abstain from espionage. The result is a gap between the normative prohibition and persistent state behavior.\n\nShull then explores the transnational legal process by which states engage in “regime-building” to codify emerging norms. He reviews U.S.-China dialogues, where the United States sought bifurcation between “economic” and “security” espionage, urging prohibitions on intellectual property theft while tolerating traditional security-related intrusions. China, however, rejects distinctions between economic and military espionage, decrying any stratification as an attempt by Washington to “dictate rules” in cyberspace. This divergence highlights a shifting normative landscape: the United States, backed by domestic laws and the 2011 International Strategy for Cyberspace, champions an explicit prohibition on economic cyber espionage, while China and Russia hypocritically pledge to renounce hostile acts even as they constitute the most active economic intruders.\n\nIn his conclusion, Shull warns that a bifurcated legal regime predicated on discerning the intruder’s motive — economic versus security — is unworkable, since attribution and intent in cyberspace are inherently opaque. He recommends that international efforts focus instead on clarifying and harmonizing a single, robust norm against unauthorized state cyber intrusions. The goal is to bridge the disconnect between customary prohibitions and state practice by articulating clear treaty obligations and reinforcing them through domestic criminal and extraterritorial legislation. Controlled evolution of these rules, supported by major powers, will determine whether cyber espionage becomes subject to enforceable law or remains a contested gray zone in international relations.",

        "abstractNote": "In “A Cyber Chase in Cyber Space: How International Law Must Address the Threat of Cyber Attacks or Suffer the Consequences,” Leah Shellberg offers a comprehensive examination of the challenges posed by malicious operations in cyberspace to traditional international legal frameworks and proposes a novel approach to defining and governing state conduct in cyber operations. Framing cyberspace as a distinct, non-tangible domain characterized by interconnected networks, Shellberg reviews various categories of malicious cyber activities—cyber crime, espionage, terrorism, and the contested concept of cyber warfare—and underscores the inadequacy of existing terminology and legal definitions borrowed from physical conflict. Against this backdrop, she crafts a narrow yet functional definition of “cyber attack” intended for international law: a state-sponsored or proxy operation deliberately designed to harm another state’s cyber infrastructure with effects analogous to physical aggression. Shellberg justifies this tailored definition by addressing scholarly concerns over attribution, overbreadth, and the differentiation between tolerated espionage and condemnable aggression. To illustrate its practical utility, she rigorously applies her definition to two seminal case studies. First, Stuxnet—an advanced, destructive intrusion targeting Iranian nuclear centrifuges—exemplifies a prototypical cyber attack under her criteria, given its state sponsorship, intent to degrade a critical cyber-physical system, and tangible effects. Second, Operation Shady RAT, characterized by covert, long-term data exfiltration across a multitude of international targets, falls outside her attack definition due to its unclear objective to disable or degrade systems rather than to collect intelligence. Through these analyses, Shellberg demonstrates the capacity of a precise legal threshold to distinguish between espionage, historically tolerated under international law, and acts warranting diplomatic or countermeasure responses. Building on analogies to space and maritime law, she advocates adapting well-established principles—sovereignty, non-intervention, and the law of armed conflict—to cyberspace rather than inventing an entirely new regime. Shellberg calls on the United Nations to facilitate negotiations on legally binding cyber norms, emphasizing the Organization’s experience in addressing emergent technological threats. She warns that as states’ reliance on networked technologies deepens, the stakes of inaction grow, and only the international community can craft cooperative frameworks capable of maintaining global stability against transboundary cyber threats. Her multidisciplinary perspective bridges legal theory and policy practice, providing a critical foundation for the development of international cyber law and reinforcing the urgency of an international legal response to the evolving landscape of cyber conflict.",

        "abstractNote": "In “The Challenges Posed by Cyber Attacks to the Law on Self-Defence,” Irène Couzigou examines the evolving intersection between international law’s jus ad bellum framework and the unique character of cyber operations. She argues that while States have traditionally relied upon the right of self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter to respond to armed attacks, the anonymity, speed, and non-physical nature of cyber attacks create significant obstacles to applying this legal regime effectively. The paper first addresses the arduous task of attributing cyber operations to State actors, emphasizing that without a high degree of confidence in attribution—akin to the evidentiary standards for grave allegations in international law—States risk acting unlawfully if they resort to force. Couzigou then considers the threshold at which a cyber operation constitutes an “armed attack” justifying self-defence, contending that only attacks producing effects comparable in scale and consequence to kinetic armed force—such as severe property damage or loss of life—should cross this threshold. Drawing on jurisprudence from the International Court of Justice and State practice, she maintains that mere cyber intrusions or espionage do not suffice; the damage must reach the level of physical harm or destruction typically associated with armed force.\n\nThe analysis proceeds to demonstrate that, as currently framed, the law of self-defence inadequately addresses cyber scenarios, since only cyber attacks attributable to States can trigger the right of self-defence. Couzigou highlights three problematic gaps: (1) there is no right of self-defence against non-State actors conducting severe cyber aggression; (2) States cannot lawfully defend themselves against another State that actively supports non-State cyber attackers through logistical or financial assistance; and (3) there is no clear right to self-defence against a State that passively harbors cyber attackers who launch armed-attack-level operations from its territory. She elucidates that although customary international law imposes a due diligence obligation on States to prevent their territory from being used to plan or launch international attacks—including cyber operations—failure to fulfill this obligation engages State responsibility but does not currently permit forcible self-defence by the victim.\n\nTo remedy these deficiencies, Couzigou proposes nuanced adaptations to the jus ad bellum. First, she argues that any State providing substantial assistance to non-State actors for cyber attacks equivalent to armed attacks should be deemed to have committed an armed attack itself, thereby entitling victim States to self-defence. Second, she contends that a State that knowingly harbors or fails to prevent non-State cyber attackers perpetrating armed-attack-level operations from its territory should forfeit its protection against self-defence, allowing the victim State to use force against the perpetrators. Third, in situations where such attacks originate from failed States lacking capacity to prevent them, victim States should similarly be permitted to act in self-defence. Couzigou cautions that any right of self-defence must remain subject to necessity and proportionality and should target only the cyber perpetrators rather than broader State institutions. She concludes that while treaty reform may prove difficult in the short term, these proposals should crystallize through evolving State practice and opinio juris, ensuring that international law on self-defence rises to the challenge posed by severe cyber attacks.",

        "abstractNote": "In “So You’re Telling Me There’s a Chance: How the Articles on State Responsibility Could Empower Corporate Responses to State-Sponsored Cyber Attacks,” Garrie and Reeves present a compelling analysis of how international law, specifically the Articles on State Responsibility, can be harnessed to equip private corporations with legal authority to defend themselves against state-sponsored cyber incursions. Recognizing that a corporation’s domestic remedies under U.S. statutes against computer-related misconduct are ill suited when the adversary is a foreign state, the authors explore the gap in the international legal framework that currently reserves the right to respond to hostile cyber operations solely to states. They argue that, under Article 5 of the Articles on State Responsibility, a state may delegate elements of its governmental authority to private entities, thereby enabling corporations to undertake proportionate countermeasures—short of those rising to the level of armed force—against state actors. The article begins with an exposition of the international legal structure governing state interaction: the law of state responsibility, jus ad bellum, and jus in bello. From there, it delineates how hostile cyber operations by states against corporate networks evade traditional domestic criminal and civil pathways, leaving victimized businesses reliant on sluggish, unpredictable government intervention.

Morgan Chase, North Korea’s assault on Sony, and Chinese military unit 61398’s intellectual property exfiltration—the authors illustrate the urgency of empowering corporations to respond promptly in cyberspace, where threats unfold rapidly and anonymity hinders attribution. The core contribution lies in articulating the legal mechanism and practical safeguards for “government-sanctioned” corporate countermeasures: domestic legislation must explicitly delegate authority under the Articles on State Responsibility; it must define clear attribution thresholds to avoid misdirected responses; and it must strictly prohibit any corporate action that could be deemed a use of force, thereby preserving the international norm that only states may wage force. By emphasizing that authorizing states remain legally accountable for corporate acts and must codify parameters to prevent escalation into armed conflict, the authors strike a crucial balance between corporate self-help and international stability. They further stress the necessity of embedding these provisions within a broader public–private partnership to enhance information sharing, rebuild trust, and clarify liabilities—a partnership currently hampered by reputational concerns, fragmented intelligence flow, and corporate fears of legal exposure. In conclusion, while acknowledging the risks inherent in delegating countermeasure authority, Garrie and Reeves contend that narrowly tailored, transparent, and accountable corporate responses constitute a vital complement to state actions. Such a delegation would deter state-sponsored cyber aggression by imposing palpable costs on attackers, thereby safeguarding corporate assets and national security interests alike. This article thus offers a timely, multidisciplinary contribution to cyber law scholarship by advancing a novel strategy for bridging the gap between international legal doctrine and the operational realities of corporate cybersecurity.",

        "abstractNote": "This chapter examines the escalating vulnerabilities of modern nuclear and conventional weapons systems to cyber attacks, framing digital interference as a critical yet underexamined facet of strategic stability. Over recent decades, weapons capabilities have become inextricably linked to digital technologies at every stage of their operation—launch, targeting, command and control, security, and safety—rendering them susceptible to data theft, manipulation, and disruption by state and non‐state actors. The authors survey documented cyber intrusions across diverse critical infrastructures—energy grids, maritime transport, space assets, and financial networks—to illustrate the broad threat landscape. They then turn to the implications for nuclear deterrence, arguing that any compromise of nuclear command, control, communications, and intelligence systems could undermine the precarious balance of mutual restraint by introducing confusion and uncertainty into high‐stakes decision‐making. In particular, they highlight how unanticipated cyber interferences could obscure the origin of attacks, pressuring leaders toward hasty or erroneous responses and raising the specter of inadvertent escalation to conventional or nuclear war.\n\nDrawing on historical near‐misses—such as Stanislav Petrov’s 1983 decision to discount a false missile alert and the NORAD simulation tape incident—the chapter illustrates how trust in data and systems is integral to strategic calculations. The authors argue for a comprehensive, all‐cyber‐risks approach to safeguard nuclear infrastructures, emphasizing layered vulnerability assessments that encompass personnel, air‐gaps, cyber hygiene protocols, and rapid incident reporting. They assess the spectrum of potential threats, from espionage targeting warhead designs and facility blueprints to manipulation of launch codes and satellite communications. Recognizing that state actors currently pose the greatest capabilities, they caution that evolving technologies will lower barriers for terrorist groups to inflict high‐consequence damage, necessitating proactive threat modeling and resilience planning.\n\nPolicy recommendations include harmonized international standards for nuclear cybersecurity; integration of cyber risk into deterrence doctrines; routine red‐teaming exercises; intelligence‐sharing agreements among nuclear alliances; and establishment of clear attribution frameworks to reduce misperceptions in crises. By foregrounding the interplay of technology, human judgment, and strategic doctrine, the chapter contributes a multidisciplinary perspective that bridges cyber policy, security studies, and arms control. It underscores the urgency of addressing cyber vulnerabilities to preserve the credibility of deterrence and prevent catastrophic escalation, ultimately calling for renewed international cooperation and robust cyber governance in the nuclear domain.",

        "abstractNote": "In “Cyberspace Security: Trends, Conflicts and Strategic Stability,” Xu Longdi examines the evolution of national and international approaches to cybersecurity, framing cyberspace as a strategic domain alongside land, sea, air, and space. The paper first maps key trends in cyberspace security, highlighting the rapid pace of technological innovation—from big data analytics, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things, to emergent fields such as artificial intelligence, smart cities, trusted computing, and quantum communications. Xu underscores how these advances, while essential for growth and connectivity, equally amplify risks: sophisticated malware, ransomware (e.g., WannaCry), advanced persistent threats targeting critical infrastructure, and the exploitation of personal privacy and financial systems. He observes that major powers have responded by intensifying investments in cyber defense and offense capabilities, establishing specialized institutions, and codifying laws and policies to govern cyberspace.\n\nThe article then shifts to the sources of cyber conflict, exploring ideological, linguistic, and interest-based divisions among states. Xu contrasts the doctrine of “cyber sovereignty” championed by China and Russia—defined as the extension of traditional state sovereignty to online domains—with the Western advocacy for “cyber freedom” as espoused by the United States and its allies. He notes that although the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts and NATO have formally recognized cyber sovereignty principles, the concept remains contested. Moreover, he argues that cyber incidents cannot be uniformly categorized as acts of war; instead, their classification depends on factors such as actor identity, intent, degree of attribution, and potential consequences. He emphasizes that ultimate determinations of cyber warfare are inherently political decisions, with strategic stability in cyberspace vulnerable to disruption when cyberspace breaches cross thresholds of attribution, intention, and severity.\n\nIn the final section, Xu proposes a multi-faceted strategy for shaping cyber strategic stability and reducing conflict risks. He advocates enhancing international dialogue and cooperation to bridge interpretive gaps in technical and political terminology, foster mutual understanding, and build trust through channels such as bilateral cyber hotlines. He calls for sustained investment in domestic technological innovation and the cultivation of “cyber power,” underscoring that without core offensive and defensive capabilities, policy frameworks alone cannot secure cyberspace. On deterrence, Xu reviews Joseph Nye’s model—encompassing punishment threats, defensive denial, entanglement, and normative taboos—and recognizes both the utility and limitations of cyber deterrence given attribution challenges. He urges states to exercise restraint in offensive cyber operations, pursue arms-control measures, advance confidence-building mechanisms, and institutionalize cyber diplomacy. Collectively, these measures, he argues, will contribute directly and indirectly to a peaceful, secure, and stable cyberspace, preserving strategic equilibrium among states.",

        "abstractNote": "In “The Road Ahead: Gaps, Leaks and Drips,” Michael J. Glennon examines the adequacy of existing international legal frameworks to govern state conduct in cyber conflict, interrogating whether the jus ad bellum and jus in bello rules are comprehensive or marked by significant lacunae. Glennon argues that international law’s purported completeness masks critical gaps when applied to cyber operations, as illustrated by the clandestine Stuxnet campaign (codenamed “Olympic Games”). He poses foundational questions: whether such operations constitute a “use of force” under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter; if they amount to an “armed attack” permitting self-defense under Article 51; and how international humanitarian law applies to cyber actors—whether computer specialists qualify as combatants or non-combatants and the implications for detention, prosecution, and state responsibility. Surveying doctrinal literature on non liquet and the completeness of legal systems, Glennon contends that legal categories such as “force,” “attack,” and “combatant” feature blurred margins in cyberspace, undermining the premise that each fact pattern yields a single correct legal classification. \n\nHe then explores two divergent future scenarios. In the first, a dramatic, attributable cyber shock—such as a “digital Pearl Harbor” causing widespread infrastructure collapse—would catalyze an international push for new legal norms, potentially including sanctions or expressly redefining self-defense to permit kinetic responses to cyber attacks. Drawing parallels to post-World War I and II treaty-making, Glennon suggests that high-impact incidents could generate political will for novel regulation. The second scenario envisages a “drip-drip” pattern of intermittent, small-scale cyber intrusions and disruptions—flash crashes, mysterious blackouts, unexplained accidents—that evade clear attribution and diffuse public outrage, leading states to tolerate gradual erosion of norms. He warns that in such an environment, the reciprocal security dilemma—where each side expands cyber capabilities to offset perceived threats—fuels an arms race that resists substantive legal constraint, as policymakers prioritize plausible deniability and protect their own operational freedom while restricting adversaries only weakly. \n\nGlennon further argues that secrecy regimes and classification of cyber methods as “sources and methods” shield operations from public and legislative scrutiny, allowing cyber engagements to proceed without accountability or democratic oversight. This opacity exacerbates the challenges of attributability and risk assessment, as responses may be based on inferred motives rather than confirmed acts. He warns that the remoteness and anonymity of cyber warfare reduce inhibitions against violence—akin to the moral distancing in drone strikes—and may lower thresholds for initiating hostilities, leading to more frequent, geographically dispersed confrontations that resemble war by stealth. \n\nConcluding that the likelihood of deep or broad legal regulation is low without a major attributable incident, Glennon stresses that the drip-drip scenario poses grave humanitarian and institutional risks. He urges recognition of the nuances in cyber conflict and calls for proactive international engagement to fill legal gaps and establish clearer norms before incremental cyber hostilities entrench a precarious de facto status quo.",

        "abstractNote": "This article by George R. Lucas Jr. provides a normative, conceptual engagement with recent ethical analyses of cyber conflict, distinguishing moral from legal evaluations under international law and demonstrating that the unique characteristics of cyber weapons challenge classical just war principles. Setting the discussion against the backdrop of a burgeoning corpus of legal scholarship — exemplified by the Tallinn Manual and analyses by Dunlap, Schmitt, and Graham — Lucas observes that ethical reflection on cyber warfare remains underdeveloped. He responds in particular to contributions in the Journal of Military Ethics special issue (Vol. 12:1, 2013) and earlier essays by Randall Dipert, Neil Rowe, and others, offering a systematic critique of prevailing moral frameworks. Lucas begins by framing the ‘‘threshold problem’’: cyber operations, involving ‘‘virtual’’ harms and low attribution costs, risk lowering the threshold for resorting to force. He explores how the perception of cyber conflict as kinetically ‘‘harmless’’ may encourage premature recourse to offensive action, thereby eroding just war norms. This leads to the ‘‘accountability problem’’: the difficulty of attributing acts in cyberspace undermines state responsibility, complicates retaliation, and diminishes transparency. Lucas discusses how this accountability deficit blurs the distinction between jus ad bellum (the right to go to war) and jus in bello (conduct in war), as concerns about responsibility for cyberattacks must inform decisions to initiate or respond to conflict. He further analyzes the ‘‘discrimination and proportionality problem,’’ showing that attacks on civilian infrastructure — data networks, power grids, financial systems — can inflict widespread civilian suffering, challenging fundamental Principles of Distinction and Proportionality under the law of armed conflict. Engaging Dipert’s detailed ‘‘ontology of cyberspace,’’ Lucas acknowledges the depth of Dipert’s mapping of cyber capabilities, tactics, and strategies, but contests the view that existing just war doctrine is wholly ill-equipped. He examines James Cook’s ‘‘argument from analogy,’’ which contends that cyber operations may be assimilated into classical paradigms of force projection by analogy to air and maritime domains. Lucas argues that while analogies provide heuristic value, they often skirt ethical questions about agency, intention, and acceptable scope. He further probes anticipatory self-defense, discussing the Stuxnet operation and U.S. defensive surveillance architectures as case studies that evoke moral dilemmas: when, if ever, may a state lawfully act without full attribution of hostile intent? Lucas defends preventive measures that impose no ‘‘real-world’’ harm — such as Stuxnet’s damage confined to nuclear centrifuges — as morally permissible under just war theory’s requirements for discrimination and proportionality, provided that collateral effects on civilians are negligible. He critiques overly cautious stances that deny states the right to defend their infrastructure absent certainty of adversarial identity, contending that reasonable inference from adversary preparations justifies cyber defense. Concluding, Lucas identifies three core ethical challenges for future scholarship and policy: defining the moral ‘‘threshold’’ for cyber engagement; clarifying accountability mechanisms in attribution and response; and developing guidelines for discrimination and proportionality in virtual domains. He calls for a collaborative effort among ethicists, legal scholars, policymakers, and military practitioners to construct a ‘‘moral Tallin Manual’’ — a set of operationalized ethical guidelines paralleling legal scholarship — and recommends empirical research into decision-making under uncertainty and norm-building for anticipatory measures in cyberspace. This interdisciplinary approach aims to fuse moral rigor with practical policy prescriptions, thereby advancing both ethical theory and state practice in governing cyber operations.",

        "abstractNote": "This article by Joe Burton provides a comprehensive qualitative policy analysis of how NATO has confronted the evolving challenges of cyber threats from its inception of cyber engagement in 1999 through the adoption of its 2014 enhanced Cyber Defence Policy. It locates NATO’s cyber defence evolution within the broader trajectory of post–Cold War institutional adaptation—first shaped by counter-terrorism imperatives after 9/11 and later accelerated by sophisticated cyber espionage and sabotage attributed to near-peer state actors. Drawing on process tracing, the study analyzes summit declarations, policy texts, speeches by Secretary Generals, and historical case studies such as the 1999 Serbian hack, the 2007 Estonian DDoS campaign, and high-profile incidents involving Stuxnet and Snowden revelations. Burton argues that definitional ambiguities concerning “cyber attacks” and “cyber exploitation” prompted NATO to develop distinct categories of cyber threats—espionage, terrorism, and warfare—each requiring tailored institutional responses. He traces how NATO integrated cyber defence into its 2010 Strategic Concept, established its Cyber Defence Management Authority in Brussels, and formalized collective defence under Article 5 in Cardiff 2014. Despite internal tensions—most notably between U.S. advocacy of offensive cyber capabilities and European preference for defensive norms and legal frameworks—NATO members have achieved remarkable policy convergence on core priorities: attribution mechanisms, industry partnerships, information‐sharing protocols, and the repurposing of command structures to govern cyber operations. Burton finds that NATO’s strong multilateral decision‐making processes foster resilience, enabling incremental institutional adaptation to rapid technological change. He highlights the alliance’s shift from network protection to a broader mandate that encompasses deterrence, incident response, and contributions to emerging international cyber norms. Key strategic challenges include sustaining transatlantic unity amidst divergent civil-military roles, bridging capability gaps among members, and maintaining agility against novel malware tactics. The analysis underscores limitations in reliance on open-source documentation and acknowledges that cyber capabilities may outpace current doctrines. Burton concludes that NATO’s evolving cyber doctrine and its institutional assets—particularly its integrated alliance structures and shared political will—position it as a critical actor in collective cyber defence. He calls for future research on NATO’s deterrence effectiveness in cyberspace, the legal implications of Article 5 applications for cyber incidents, and comparative studies of allied national contributions to strengthen the alliance’s deterrence-by-denial and normative frameworks.",

        "abstractNote": "This paper examines the challenges of attributing responsibility for cyberattacks conducted by non-state actors under existing international law frameworks and offers a categorical analytical model to guide legal practitioners and policymakers. As cyberspace operations become increasingly central to statecraft and interstate tensions, non-state actors often serve as proxies, enabling states to evade accountability for wrongful acts. The author undertakes a doctrinal review of the International Law Commission’s Draft Articles on State Responsibility, relevant international case law, and scholarly commentary to interrogate whether—and under what conditions—states may be held liable for cyber operations executed by private individuals or groups. Building on this doctrinal foundation, two primary attribution theories are formulated: de facto organ theory and control theory. De facto organ theory (agency-based attribution) requires evidence of complete dependence, specific operational instructions, and effective integration of the private actor into the state apparatus, thereby treating the individual’s cyber conduct as an act of the state. Control theory (control-based attribution), by contrast, focuses on the degree of operational control a state exercises, the organizational capacity of the actor, and extraterritorial considerations to ascribe responsibility. The analysis contrasts substantive rules—defining what constitutes a state act—with evidentiary standards—determining the threshold of proof—demonstrating that high thresholds may permit states to evade liability, whereas lower thresholds foster accountability. Through comparative examination of high- and low-proof requirements, the paper highlights current ambiguities in state practice regarding evidentiary burdens in cyber contexts. The findings indicate that while uniform state practice has not yet crystallized, both theoretical models provide coherent legal mechanisms for attributing private cyber conduct to states, thus facilitating accountability for cyber aggression. Limitations are acknowledged, including evolving state practice, variability in evidentiary standards, and the fluid nature of digital evidence. To address these gaps, the paper calls for empirical research to document how states apply attribution models in real-world incidents, normative dialogue to refine evidentiary thresholds appropriate to cyber operations, and further exploration of how international jurisprudence may adapt to cyber-specific challenges. Ultimately, the proposed categorical framework bridges doctrinal attribution rules and the substantive and evidentiary complexities of cyberspace, offering a practical roadmap for clarifying state responsibility in cyber conflict and advancing more robust international norms for accountability.",

        "abstractNote": "This research note examines the persistent attribution problem in cyber conflict—the difficulty that states face in reliably and transparently identifying perpetrators of cyber operations—and proposes a legal and institutional framework to advance international norms governing attribution under customary international law. Recognizing that current ad hoc state assessments lack clarity and consistency, the author begins with a comparative historical analysis of attribution regimes for eighteenth-century piracy and privateering to illustrate how evidentiary expectations evolved in conventional contexts. Building on this foundation, the note argues that the unique characteristics of cyberspace—its ubiquity, the diffuse nature of networks, and the speed of attacks—require a bespoke evidentiary standard calibrated not only to the availability of digital evidence but also to the severity and urgency of a victim state’s potential response. To address these dual imperatives of flexibility and predictability, the author introduces a sliding-scale evidentiary model: lower thresholds of proof suffice for non-forceful countermeasures, while higher thresholds are required before invoking the U.N. Charter’s right of self-defense or imposing significant reprisals. This approach aligns customary international law’s general principles of state responsibility with the practical constraints faced by victims of cyber operations. The note then identifies the absence of transparent, multilateral attribution mechanisms and critiques existing proposals—such as intergovernmental inspection regimes and binding treaties—as politically or functionally unfeasible given geopolitical tensions. In response, it advocates for the creation of an independent, non-governmental global consortium composed of technology firms, academic experts, and think tanks. Structured analogously to a tribunal, this consortium would conduct neutral forensic assessments, publish standardized attribution reports, and thereby foster a body of state practice and opinio juris essential to crystallizing customary norms. The author details the consortium’s proposed governance, funding considerations, and operational procedures, including rapid evidentiary workflows tailored to time-sensitive incidents. Drawing on industry initiatives like Microsoft’s Digital Geneva Convention campaign and the Cybersecurity Tech Accord, the note argues that major technology platforms have both the technical capacity and collective incentive to participate as “neutral Digital Switzerland,” bolstering public and classified attribution claims. By reducing uncertainty in attribution, the consortium would enhance deterrence, mitigate the risk of misdirected escalations, and support proportional state responses. The note acknowledges challenges—securing sustainable financing, ensuring swift operational readiness, and reliably linking proxy actors to state sponsorship—but maintains that these obstacles are surmountable. It concludes that adopting the sliding-scale evidentiary standard in tandem with an independent attribution body offers a practical pathway for shaping international law in cyberspace, empowering states to make consistent, transparent judgments about offensive cyber operations and strengthening global stability.",

        "abstractNote": "This book chapter analyzes the application and adaptation of traditional principles of jurisdiction and state responsibility to cyber activities, highlighting the legal challenges posed by the borderless and anonymous nature of cyberspace. It first clarifies that, while states cannot claim sovereignty over cyberspace itself, they retain sovereign prerogatives to prescribe and enforce domestic law over cyber infrastructure and activities within their territory, including airspace and territorial waters. Territorial jurisdiction extends both subjectively—over incidents originating within the state’s territory—and objectively—over acts causing effects within the territory, regardless of origin. The chapter then examines extraterritorial bases of jurisdiction that states increasingly rely upon: active personality (jurisdiction over nationals), passive personality (jurisdiction over offences against nationals), and the protective principle (jurisdiction over acts threatening state security). It discusses the controversial principle of universal jurisdiction and its established scope in piracy and suppression of serious international crimes. Enforcing criminal jurisdiction abroad requires the host state’s consent, as affirmed by jurisprudence from the Permanent Court of Arbitration and the Permanent Court of International Justice. In the cyber context, the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime exemplifies a treaty-based approach using territoriality and nationality as jurisdictional bases, with UNODC studies confirming their effectiveness in practice. The chapter then turns to the attribution of cyber operations to states under international law, reviewing the Tallinn Manual, UN Commission reports, and ICJ jurisprudence. It surveys the standards of proof articulated by the ICJ—varying from “weighty and convincing” evidence to “fully conclusive” proof—and contrasts these with the pragmatic heuristics used by intelligence analysts. Through illustrative case studies, including the 2014 Sony Pictures hack and allegations of interference in the 2016 US presidential election, the author demonstrates how high burdens of proof and attribution asymmetry hinder victim states’ ability to hold perpetrators accountable. To address these shortcomings, the chapter presents the “virtual control” test, which would shift the burden of disproving state responsibility onto a state that funds or equips non-state actors, thereby creating a rebuttable presumption of involvement and incentivizing due diligence. This novel framework also presumes that use of state infrastructure for an attack implicates state responsibility unless convincingly rebutted. The chapter acknowledges limitations, including reliance on doctrinal analysis and case-specific examples rather than systematic empirical data, and notes that adoption of modified attribution standards depends on evolving state practice and potential judicial endorsement. Finally, it explores attribution of cyber acts to international organizations under the Draft Articles on the Responsibility of International Organizations, assessing consensus-based decision-making in NATO and the European Court of Human Rights’ jurisprudence attributing acts to the United Nations in Kosovo and to member states in Iraq. By synthesizing legal doctrine, treaty provisions, judicial decisions, and state practice, the chapter offers an integrated cyber law framework to guide policymakers, practitioners, and scholars in navigating the complex terrain of jurisdiction and state responsibility in cyberspace.",

        "abstractNote": "In “International Humanitarian Law and the Targeting of Data” (2018), Tim McCormack explores whether digital data qualifies as an “object” under international humanitarian law (IHL), such that cyber operations directed against data during armed conflict would constitute attacks regulated by the law of targeting (jus in bello). After introducing the foundational role of digital data in contemporary life—encompassing everything from intellectual property and personal records to essential services—the article examines how traditional IHL categories apply to data and whether existing legal frameworks adequately protect civilian data from harmful cyber operations. McCormack surveys contrasting views, notably the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) position that certain categories of civilian data deserve specific protection and that general rules on the conduct of hostilities should extend to unprotected data such as social security or tax records. He contrasts this with the Tallinn Manual 1.0 majority, which confines IHL protection to data whose destruction yields tangible physical harm, and a minority view advocating broader protection irrespective of immediate physical effects. Through case studies—the exfiltration of personal data in the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) breach and the global WannaCry ransomware incident—McCormack evaluates whether these operations, conducted in a hypothetical armed conflict context, would fall within IHL’s definition of an attack. He argues that data exfiltration or temporary encryption without corruption or destruction does not physically impair civilian objects and thus remains outside targeting rules; by contrast, operations corrupting or deleting civilian data would qualify as attacks subject to proportionality and distinction principles. Acknowledging the absence of direct precedents from armed conflicts targeting data without physical damage, McCormack underscores States’ reticence to clarify binding norms amid strategic interests in preserving freedom to target data. He observes that until a crisis provokes a unified State response condemning such targeting, the legal status of data as an object will remain unsettled. Drawing on his participation as a Tallinn Manual expert, McCormack aligns with the minority view—advocating that all civilian data merit IHL protection to fulfill the law’s object and purpose of safeguarding civilians. He concludes that expanding IHL to cover data as an object is both legally justifiable and necessary to prevent devastating impacts of cyber operations on civilian populations, though ultimate resolution awaits States’ political will and future practice.",

        "abstractNote": "This chapter, authored by Sean Watts and published by the Defence Centre of Excellence, International Cyber, critically examines the United States Department of Defense Law of War Manual (the Manual) as a window into sovereign approaches to international cyber norm development. Opening with an overview of competing conceptual frameworks for cyberspace—\"Exceptionalism,\" which posits cyberspace as a wholly novel, unregulated domain resisting sovereign control, and \"Sovereigntism,\" which views cyberspace as fully subject to traditional international law—the chapter situates the Manual within broader scholarly and non-state advocacy debates, notably contrasting it with the privately authored Tallinn Manual. The author notes that non-state actors have dominated cyber norm discourse, often outpacing state participation, and that the Tallinn Manual exemplifies a Sovereigntist approach, asserting that ius ad bellum and ius in bello govern cyber operations.   Against this backdrop, Watts evaluates the Manual’s treatment of cyber operations, particularly its restraint in articulating new or refined norms. While the Manual affirms the applicability of existing law of war principles to cyber conflict, it declines to resolve long-standing ambiguities—such as defining the threshold of attack for cyber means, direct participation in cyber hostilities, and review obligations for cyber weapons. Watts identifies three plausible explanations for this reticence: the Manual’s methodology, which eschews definitive opinions on the law of war and treats the Manual as non-opinio juris; its timing, suggesting that States defer treaty-making until problems become tangible, although two decades of cyber incidents might argue otherwise; and security classification constraints, which may relegate detailed legal analyses to classified venues.   The chapter contrasts the Manual’s sparse normative contributions with the more assertive, consensus-driven Tallinn Manual, underscoring the U.S. comfort with persistent legal ambiguities in cyber operations. Watts argues that this reflects a conscious U.S. policy stance favoring flexibility over precision in cyber norms and a reluctance to constrain military or intelligence capabilities through new international obligations. The Manual thus serves as both a snapshot of the current state of international cyber law and an indicator of U.S. reticence to cultivate explicit, binding norms in cyberspace. Watts concludes that while the Manual offers extensive descriptive analysis of existing legal frameworks, it falls short of clarifying or advancing the law of war in cyber conflict, leaving unresolved issues to the international community and signaling a preference for strategic ambiguity.",

        "abstractNote": "Major Christopher M. Kessinger’s 2013 article in Army Lawyer explores the novel application of letters of marque to cyberspace as a means of legitimizing and regulating private sector cyber defense and offensive operations. Drawing on a rich historical tradition dating from the early privateering era and the American Revolutionary and War of 1812 periods, Kessinger argues that letters of marque are a constitutionally grounded tool (U.S. Const. art. I, §8) that could expand the nation’s cyber capabilities without the political gridlock and bureaucratic inertia hampering current government efforts. The article begins by detailing the scale and impact of cyber attacks worldwide—citing millions of incidents targeting states, corporations, and international bodies, with costs in the billions. Kessinger notes the failure of many governments and industries to mount coherent offensive or defensive strategies and highlights proposals from Congress, the private sector, and research agencies that have either stalled or been constrained by legal risks, notably under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.\n\nKessinger then traces the evolution of letters of marque from early self-help authorizations to government-issued privateer commissions, emphasizing their dual military and law enforcement functions. He shows how the Continental Congress and early American presidents, including John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, embraced privateering to augment naval forces and protect commerce. Despite the 1856 Declaration of Paris’ purported ban on privateering, the U.S. never ratified it and retains the constitutional power to issue letters of marque—a power that remains dormant but viable.\n\nBuilding on historical precedent, Kessinger proposes a comprehensive modern “cyber letter of marque” regime in which the government would issue licenses to vetted, well-bonded private entities—cyber privateers—to conduct threat neutralization activities, including hack-back operations, on behalf of network owners and the state. Key elements include rigorous application criteria requiring technical expertise and substantial financial bonds; detailed rules of engagement and daily logging requirements to ensure accountability; mandatory reporting to a centralized oversight body to de-conflict operations with law enforcement and national security missions; and judicial review through the existing admiralty prize court framework under 10 U.S.C. Chapter 655, adapted to cyberspace. Sanctions for overreach—bond forfeiture, debarment from government contracts, criminal prosecution, and tort liability—would deter misuse and align incentives.\n\nKessinger addresses concerns about vigilantism and legal ambiguity by emphasizing that cyber privateers would operate under explicit congressional mandates and judicial oversight, just as their maritime predecessors did. He outlines the statutory and constitutional underpinnings, including the President’s authority to direct private armed vessels (33 U.S.C. §385–386) and the role of federal courts in adjudicating prizes. The article concludes that, faced with an increasingly sophisticated and damaging cyber threat environment, the United States should resurrect the letter of marque power. By integrating well-regulated private sector actors into national cyber defense and offense, a cyber letter of marque regime could provide a flexible, rapid, and constitutionally sound means of securing critical networks and deterring adversaries.",

        "abstractNote": "In \"Interpretation Catalysts in Cyberspace,\" Rebecca Ingber examines how discrete events and processes—what she terms \"interpretation catalysts\"—shape the development of international law governing state conduct in cyberspace. Ingber opens by observing that cyberspace, with its rapid technological evolution and high-profile incidents, offers a compressed timeline in which the dynamics of legal adaptation and consensus formation become especially visible. She identifies four longstanding debates in international law—adapting existing rules to new technologies, secrecy and the emergence of custom, transparency obligations, and the tension between state interests and soft-law initiatives—which are all accelerated and amplified in the cyber domain. \n\nCentral to her argument is the concept of interpretation catalysts: juridical triggers that compel decision-making bodies—whether executive branches, intergovernmental panels, or expert committees—to formulate and articulate legal positions. Such catalysts not only force a choice of interpretation but also affect the composition of deliberative bodies, the framing of legal questions, the contextual parameters of discussion, and the incentives of participating actors. Ingber illustrates this framework through a detailed case study of the two Tallinn Manual processes. The first catalyst was the 2007 cyberattacks against Estonia, which prompted NATO’s Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence to convene experts to map out how existing jus ad bellum and jus in bello norms applied to cyber operations. Subsequently, the Manuals themselves served as ongoing catalysts, compelling states to clarify, develop, or contest their positions during sessions such as The Hague Process. \n\nIngber contrasts her earlier work on U.S. executive-branch legal decision-making—where internal interpretation catalysts can singularly shape national legal positions—with the multinational, soft-law environment of the Tallinn Manuals, where expert consensus and state engagement interact. She argues that soft-law processes driven by law-of-war expertise bring practical focus on operational rules and foster engagement between scholars and practitioners, but also carry normative weight that can steer state behavior. \n\nA key insight is that interpretation catalysts are manipulable: actors can design or leverage such triggers to push the law toward desired outcomes. Ingber underscores this through the divergent treatment of international human rights law versus the law of armed conflict in Tallinn Manual 2.0, noting institutional challenges and critiques over the Manual’s scope. \n\nUltimately, the chapter calls for attention to institutions, actors, and processes—not merely doctrinal debates—in understanding how cyberlaw evolves. The initial events and the choice of forum determine both the trajectory of legal interpretation and the enduring shape of the rules that govern state conduct in cyberspace.",

        "abstractNote": "Buchan’s chapter “Cyber Espionage and International Law” provides a comprehensive doctrinal examination of whether and how existing international legal norms constrain State‐sponsored cyber espionage. After introducing cyberspace as a critical domain for state and non‐state activity, Buchan surveys key incidents—including the 2010 Google intrusion, the 2012 Flame virus against Iranian oil firms, the 2013 Mandiant report exposing China’s Unit 61398, and the Snowden revelations of NSA surveillance—to illustrate the scale and significance of cyber espionage and the persistent uncertainties surrounding its regulation. He then formulates a working definition of cyber espionage, distinguishing it from mere hacking by emphasizing unauthorized access plus copying of electronic information stored or transmitted through interconnected networks, with intent to remain undetected. Focusing on transboundary operations, he excludes purely domestic espionage from his inquiry. The chapter proceeds to analyze the applicability of two core prohibitions of the United Nations Charter: the principle of non‐intervention and the prohibition on the use of force (Article 2(4)). Drawing on State practice, opinio juris, and leading scholarly interpretations, Buchan argues that significant cyber espionage constitutes a prohibited intervention in State sovereignty—one that violates the sovereign prerogative to control information within a State’s jurisdiction—unless falling below a de minimis threshold of seriousness. He methodically unpacks the non‐intervention principle, noting the relevance of de minimis non curat lex in excluding trivial acts, and shows that unauthorized appropriation of substantial confidential data held by State organs or entities under State control triggers liability for intervention. By contrast, Buchan finds insufficient State practice to support an effects‐based reinterpretation of “force” under Article 2(4) to encompass non‐kinetic cyber operations: States such as the United States and the authors of the Tallinn Manual have maintained that “force” requires physical damage. Consequently, cyber espionage—regardless of its scale—is not a prohibited use of force nor an armed attack invoking self‐defense, although exceptionally harmful operations might merit reconsideration. In conclusion, Buchan contends that by breaching sovereignty and undermining mutual confidence among States, cyber espionage poses a threat to international peace and security, and that customary international law’s non‐intervention norm already furnishes a normative foundation to constrain hostile cyber intelligence activities. While acknowledging gaps such as the absence of a dedicated treaty, uneven State practice on significance thresholds, and the need for future research on treaty development and de minimis standards, he underscores the value of existing international law in addressing cyber espionage until a specialized multilateral framework emerges.",

        "abstractNote": "This article examines the application of the international law of neutrality to cyber operations that traverse neutral States’ telecommunications infrastructure, proposing a doctrinal foundation for recognizing a right of transit passage in cyberspace. Drawing upon international legal instruments—including the UN Charter, the Hague and Geneva Conventions—and state practice observed during the 2008 Russo–Georgian conflict, the author clarifies the rights and obligations of neutral States in the context of cyber warfare. Through qualitative doctrinal analysis and case studies, the paper demonstrates that although existing practice—such as Poland’s and Estonia’s provision of server space and data transit for Georgia, and assistance by private U.S. firms—did not breach neutrality rules due to the telegraph exception in Hague V, the technical impossibility of tracing packet pathways imposes an unworkable burden on both belligerents and neutrals under current law. The author argues that cyberspace, like maritime international straits, should be subject to a recognized right of transit passage, institutionalizing the de facto norms permitting data flows across neutral jurisdictions while preserving sovereign authority to regulate domestic content. This analogy reconciles the Internet’s essential resilience and openness with legitimate state controls over harmful content and sovereignty interests. Acknowledging the limitations of maritime analogies and the evolving, decentralized Internet architecture, the paper highlights the practical challenges of establishing route transparency without undermining packet-switching principles. It concludes by calling for multilateral treaty negotiations to codify transit passage rights, further research into mechanisms that balance transit freedoms with content regulation, and the design of technical and normative measures to support a robust, legally sound international regime for cyber neutrality and conflict.",

        "abstractNote": "This article by Aaron F. Brantly challenges the pervasive myth that cyberspace is an ungoverned frontier by demonstrating that it is, in fact, subject to a dense and overlapping network of legal, technical, and policy frameworks at the local, national, and international levels. Employing a qualitative, historical-institutional approach, Brantly traces the evolution of Internet governance from its earliest technical working groups through the establishment of multistakeholder bodies such as ICANN, IETF, IRTF, ITU, and various regional and national legislatures. He shows how “code” functions as de facto law in cyberspace and how protocol design, infrastructure ownership, and jurisdictional boundaries inform state capacities and constrain military action. Through detailed analysis of U.S. Department of Defense doctrine—including Joint Publication 3-12 and Army Field Manual 3-38—Brantly illustrates how U.S. cyber strategy integrates statutory, normative, and technical considerations in calibrating offensive cyber operations, cyber exploitation for intelligence purposes, and defensive cyber operations. Core findings reveal that U.S. decision-makers display a sophisticated understanding of cyberspace’s socio-technical-economic structures, leveraging awareness of overlapping governance regimes to shape operational choices, deter transgressions, and modulate behavior in contested domains. While norms and international condemnation act as informal constraints, some actors continue to probe the limits of acceptable action, underscoring the evolving nature of multilateral cyber treaties and normative frameworks. Brantly introduces the concept of cyberspace as “the most governed ungoverned space,” offering military planners and policymakers a nuanced lens for assessing permissible actions under complex legal and policy constraints. He acknowledges limitations of U.S.-centric focus and calls for further research on treaty development, normative behavior evolution, and decision processes of non-U.S. actors as global Internet penetration and technological complexity grow.",

The study adopts a doctrinal approach within the framework of international law, analyzing both primary rules—such as non-proliferation obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)—and secondary rules of State responsibility codified by the International Law Commission (ILC), as well as jus ad bellum principles under the UN Charter. Roscini begins by distinguishing between cyber attacks—actions aimed at disrupting or damaging systems—and cyber exploitation—non-destructive intelligence-gathering operations. He assesses how each typology might function as a counterproliferation instrument, noting that intelligence-only malware like DuQu and Flame may lack the destructive consequences necessary to constitute a wrongful act under international law, whereas disruptive operations such as Stuxnet clearly breach multiple primary obligations.",

        "abstractNote": "The emergence of cyber operations as a deliberate instrument of statecraft and armed conflict has challenged the existing body of international law, raising fundamental questions about the applicability and evolution of norms in cyberspace. In the face of high-profile incidents, such as the 2007 cyber assaults against Estonia and the 2008 cyber operations during the Russia–Georgia war, scholars and practitioners have grappled with whether classical doctrines of sovereignty, use of force, and humanitarian law can effectively govern digital hostilities. This article undertakes a forward-looking analysis to anticipate how the law of cyber warfare may develop, asking: as cyber activities grow in sophistication and geopolitical significance, what interpretive adaptations will states and tribunals need to make to preserve legal coherence? Drawing on the historical evolution of norms and the process by which state consent shapes customary law, the author employs a doctrinal methodology supplemented by case studies of state practice, treaty provisions, and the deliberations of the International Group of Experts that produced the Tallinn Manual. The analysis identifies key fault lines in the law: the tension between state sovereignty and cross-border digital interference; the threshold at which a cyber operation constitutes a use of force or an armed attack under the jus ad bellum; and the definition and protection of civilian objects and data under the jus in bello. It finds that while the International Group of Experts unanimously affirmed that existing international law applies in cyberspace, they confined themselves to lex lata and eschewed predictions, leaving unresolved debates over the scope of prohibited acts and the status of dual-use cyber infrastructure. The article contends that normative evolution will be driven by states’ need to secure critical civilian networks, leading to an expansion of what qualifies as an attack, a recalibration of proportionality to include non-physical effects on essential services and data, and a refined conception of civilian objects that extends to vital digital assets. Furthermore, states will must balance the imperative to neutralize adversary capabilities hosted on commercial platforms against the requirement to spare civilian systems, a dilemma likely to spur new rules on dual-use targets and precautions. The contribution lies in mapping these prospective vectors of change, highlighting where treaty law, state practice, and interpretive commentary may converge or clash in addressing emerging threats. The author acknowledges the speculative nature of forecasting legal development in a rapidly transforming domain and notes constraints such as divergent state positions, budgetary pressures on cyber defense, and the evolving character of military necessity and humanity considerations. He proposes further research into empirical monitoring of state cyber doctrines, the role of international organizations in norm formation, and the potential impact of non-state cyber actors on the integrity of future legal frameworks. This analysis offers policymakers and scholars a conceptual roadmap for the normative adaptation required to ensure that the law of armed conflict remains relevant and effective in the digital age.",

        "abstractNote": "Over the past decade, the intersection of digital innovation and state security has given rise to a critical challenge: how can a nation safeguard its infrastructure and sovereignty against sophisticated cyberattacks that may be state-sponsored or politically motivated? In this context, the 2007 distributed denial of service strikes on Estonia, widely viewed as the first significant gateway cyberattack by a state actor, highlight the vulnerability of a highly digitized society reliant on online banking, government services, and critical utilities. This research matters because it examines how a small state transformed a disruptive episode into a blueprint for national and international cyber resilience. It aims to answer the question: what policy, legal, societal, and collaborative measures did Estonia deploy to deter, defend, and adapt to large-scale cyber threats in the years following the attacks? The study employs a qualitative case study methodology, drawing on government action plans, national security strategies, legislative texts, academic analyses of the April 2007 events, and reports from NATO, EU, and private-sector cyber emergency teams. By reviewing primary policy documents such as Estonia’s Cyber Security Strategy (2014–2017), legal amendments to the Emergency Act and Penal Code, and records of international exercises, the author reconstructs the evolution of a multi-dimensional defense posture. The findings reveal four complementary policy arenas that underpin Estonia’s enhanced readiness: first, the establishment of national cyber defense capabilities including the Cyber Defense League and resilient data infrastructure through government cloud and overseas data embassies; second, legal modifications granting authorities rapid incident-response powers and updating criminal statutes to penalize cyber sabotage; third, societal adaptation via public–private partnerships, volunteer networks, and a culture of cyber awareness embedded in e-governance; and fourth, proactive international collaboration with NATO, EU institutions, and bilateral partners to share threat intelligence and conduct large-scale exercises. Collectively, these measures not only restored Estonia’s operational networks within weeks of the 2007 attacks but also set global standards for integrating cyber considerations into Article 5 deterrence strategies. The study contributes a conceptual framework—the ‘‘Estonian template’’—for transforming acute cyber crisis into sustained strategic resilience, highlighting the importance of comprehensive legal, diplomatic, and societal components alongside technical defenses. The primary limitation of this work is its focus on Estonia’s unique characteristics as a small, technologically advanced state with strong Western alliances, which may constrain direct application to larger or less digitally integrated nations. Nevertheless, the research points to future avenues, including comparative analyses of cyber adaptation in other NATO member states, assessments of the template’s scalability to middle powers, and empirical evaluation of deterrence effects stemming from multinational cyber exercises. By distilling lessons from Estonia’s trajectory, this study lays the groundwork for broader inquiry into how states can craft proactive, law-based, and norm-building approaches to secure national assets in an era of digital insecurity.",

        "abstractNote": "This study by Tuukkanen (2011) explores the strategic necessity and practical challenges of integrating cyberspace as an operational domain within Finland’s national defence doctrine, traditionally structured around land, sea, air, and space. Drawing on doctrinal analysis of existing Finnish defence legislation, policy documents, military field manuals, and international strategic reports, the author frames cyberspace as the emerging fifth domain, whose unique characteristics demand doctrinal adaptation, legal reform, and cross‐sectoral collaboration. The analysis begins by reviewing global and regional developments, including NATO’s recognition of cyberspace as an operational domain, the U.S. Department of Defense’s Cyber Strategy, and comparative frameworks from OECD and EU studies. The paper then articulates a set of bilateral US–Russia definitions for core cyber terms—cyberspace, cyber conflict, cyber war, and cyber defence—to establish a common conceptual foundation. Finland’s current defence doctrine—emphasizing sovereignty, readiness, and territoriality—is assessed for compatibility with cyber operations. While these tenets are conceptually transferable, significant gaps are identified in legal mandates, command structures, interagency coordination, and public–private partnerships essential for national cyber security. The absence of a cohesive national cyber security strategy emerges as the principal barrier to doctrinal elaboration, undermining clarity in the roles and authorities of military and civilian actors in cyber incident response. To address these deficiencies, Tuukkanen proposes a provisional Finnish Cyber Defence Doctrine structured around five core areas: (1) conceptualizing cyber war in alignment with broader national security objectives, (2) enhancing prevention through intelligence sharing, risk assessment, and evidence‐based policy development, (3) delineating wartime cyber operations by codifying legal authorities and escalation management protocols, (4) leveraging cyber capabilities in peacetime to support foreign policy and international cooperation, particularly within EU and NATO frameworks, and (5) defining the domestic role of the Finnish Defence Forces in critical infrastructure protection and national resilience. The framework advocates enacting legislation that grants explicit cyber defence mandates to armed forces and civilian agencies, establishing agile command structures for rapid decision‐making, and fostering public–private partnerships for threat intelligence exchange and vulnerability management. The study also highlights the need for interoperable sensor networks and automated monitoring systems to achieve real‐time situational awareness and tailored readiness levels across cyber actors. Acknowledging limitations due to reliance on public documents without empirical operational testing, the author calls for further research on technological evolution, industrial base support for cyber capabilities, and specialized personnel training. The paper concludes that, once Finland’s national cyber security strategy is finalized, detailed doctrinal work should focus on evaluating the effectiveness of proposed legal and organizational reforms, exploring the military’s role in cyber research and procurement, and establishing robust education and exercise programs to cultivate a deep bench of cyber defence expertise.",

        "abstractNote": "In “Regulating Cyber-Security,” Nathan Alexander Sales critically examines prevailing U.S. legal and policy paradigms for safeguarding critical digital infrastructure and advocates a novel regulatory framework inspired by administrative law fields such as environmental law, antitrust, products liability, and public health. Sales begins by demonstrating that conventional approaches to cyber-security, which treat cyber-attacks either as criminal conduct or as uses of force in armed conflict, fail to address the market failures afflicting private operators of critical infrastructure. Citing the 2007 cyber-assault on Estonia and warnings of an “electronic Pearl Harbor,” he underscores the systemic underinvestment in cyber-defenses by firms that do not internalize the full social costs of their vulnerabilities. Sales then draws parallels between negative externalities in environmental pollution and cybersecurity risk, explaining that firms underinvest in protective measures because many of the harms from intrusions are borne by customers and third parties. He extends this analogy to antitrust law, noting that inter-firm cooperation on cybersecurity is hindered by antitrust concerns, and to tort law, where the near-absence of liability for breach victims leaves little incentive for defensive innovation. Public health law serves as a further analogy: just as disease surveillance, quarantine, and stockpiling medicines manage epidemics, so too could distributed monitoring networks, system isolation protocols, and reserve digital capacity bolster resilience to cyber-contagions. \n\nSales’s regulatory lens yields four broad categories of policy interventions. First, he proposes a distributed cyber-biosurveillance system whereby private entities report incidents to public authorities, incentivized through liability shields and subsidies akin to antitrust immunity and public health funding. Second, industry-driven security standards co-developed with regulators would “harden” critical systems, supported by calibrated tort liability for noncompliance and liability protections for participants. Third, he advocates resilience-enhancing measures drawn from epidemic containment—namely, quarantining infected systems and maintaining redundant infrastructure that can be rapidly deployed during attacks. Finally, he considers calibrated countermeasures, or “hackbacks,” to deter adversaries and encourage better network hygiene among third-party hosts. \n\nThrough a three-part structure, Sales first assesses whether private investment aligns with the social optimum, then reviews analogues from four administrative disciplines, and finally articulates concrete policy prescriptions for each. Crucially, he cautions against heavy-handed, command-and-control regulation, instead favoring hybrid strategies that leverage firms’ self-interest via positive inducements and targeted immunities, while reserving sanctions for egregious noncompliance. By reframing cyber-security as a regulatory challenge rather than solely a criminal or military one, Sales offers policymakers a richer menu of tools—monitoring, standards, resilience, and deterrence—that harness lessons from established regulatory regimes to strengthen national cyber-defenses.",

        "abstractNote": "The article addresses the persistent mismatch between U.S. national cybersecurity strategy and the distinctive structural and operational features of cyberspace, arguing that reliance on deterrence and operational restraint has produced a strategic deficit in protecting and advancing national interests. The authors justify their analysis by highlighting how cyber aggression in recent years has undermined the assumptions of deterrence, and they set out to propose and evaluate an alternative strategic framework—cyber persistence—that capitalizes on the domain’s uniqueness. Their objective is to demonstrate why deterrence alone is insufficient, to articulate the requirements for shaping international norms through active engagement, and to define the principles and mechanisms of a capabilities-based persistent strategy. Employing a conceptual policy analysis methodology, they draw on official doctrinal definitions, case studies of sabotage, espionage, and subversion operations attributed to state actors, analyses of domain characteristics such as low cost of entry, malleability, persistent contact, reversible effects, and their assessment of existing U.S. strategic documents and White House reports. They further examine practical examples of automated intrusion detection and mitigation techniques, moving target defense, deception measures like honeypots, and large-scale botnet disruption to illustrate the feasibility of continuous active engagement. The authors find that deterrence premised on fear of escalation overlooks cyberspace’s capacity for precise, temporary, and reversible damage, and that states embracing operational persistence can shape acceptable behavior and enjoy a resiliency advantage. They show that shaping norms through diplomacy without concurrent active operations leaves like-minded states in a weakened position relative to unlike-minded actors. As a contribution, the article introduces the concept of cyber persistence as a distinct strategic doctrine grounded in persistent engagement, domain shaping, automated courses of action, and integrated counter-subversion, and it outlines organizational and authority changes needed to implement it, including adjustments to Presidential Policy Directive 41 and Cyber Mission Force allocation. The authors acknowledge limitations in their analysis, noting that implementation would require significant legal and policy revisions, careful design of automated decision models, and the political will to accept proactive cyber operations. They also recognize that persistent engagement could challenge existing norms and that resource constraints may affect scalability. For future research, they propose empirical evaluation of automated cyber persistence tools, development of decision frameworks to balance persistence and escalation control, assessments of how persistent operations influence norm development in multilateral fora, exploration of optimal force structure within Cyber Command, and studies on integrating cyber persistence with diplomatic, intelligence, and military instruments to advance comprehensive national strategy.",

        "abstractNote": "The proliferation of cyber incidents that fall below the armed attack threshold has exposed a critical gap in international cybersecurity governance, as existing norms of armed conflict fail to address the more frequent, low-intensity intrusions that threaten state and private sector networks. In response to high-profile breaches—from state-sponsored espionage to attacks on critical infrastructure—this research contends that clarifying state obligations under international law to exercise due diligence in securing cyberspace is essential for preventing harm and fostering cyber peace. The study aims to define the contours of a cybersecurity due diligence norm by asking what specific measures states and private actors must undertake under customary international law, and how lessons from established private-sector frameworks can inform a proactive, multilevel governance regime. Employing a doctrinal and comparative methodology, the authors analyze leading International Court of Justice jurisprudence—including Corfu Channel, Trail Smelter, and Nicaragua—to derive principles of territorial responsibility and no-harm obligations, and juxtapose these with national regulatory models from the United States, Germany, and China. The study further surveys private-sector practices exemplified by the 2014 National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Framework and corporate initiatives such as vendor compliance mandates. The analysis reveals that customary international law already implies a duty on states to prevent their territory from facilitating cyber operations harmful to other states, but lacks precision on required cybersecurity measures. National approaches vary significantly, with the U.S. favoring voluntary frameworks, Germany mandating compliance through its Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) standards, and China embedding due diligence within broader state-control regimes. Private-sector firms, led by financial institutions and technology companies, have adopted proactive best practices—such as supply chain monitoring, incident reporting, and penetration testing—that exceed current legal minima. Building on Elinor Ostrom’s polycentric governance and the success of IETF working groups, the authors propose a novel, polycentric due diligence regime that leverages public-private partnerships, multi-stakeholder forums, and standardization bodies to generate positive network effects and cascade toward an international norm. While this framework advances the conceptual toolbox for cyber peace by marrying international law with concrete industry standards, it acknowledges limitations stemming from the absence of binding judicial rulings, divergent national policies, and the evolving threat landscape that complicates cost-benefit assessments of security investments. The authors call for empirical research to monitor norm adoption, inter-disciplinary collaboration between international lawyers and chief information security officers, and the development of metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of polycentric governance mechanisms in reducing state-based cybertactics.",

        "abstractNote": "Datta’s “Trust, Interdependence, and Power in Cyber Statecraft” offers a unified theoretical framework for understanding how states deploy cyber capabilities through the lenses of trust and interdependence within global information ecosystems. Recognizing a gap in political theory on cyber statecraft, the study defines “cyber statecraft” as the full spectrum of methods—espionage, sabotage, extortion, intellectual property theft, and supply-chain manipulation—employed by states to achieve political, economic, social, and technological objectives. Drawing on parallels with Cold War economic statecraft, Datta introduces a tripartite model linking structural interdependence (data flows, supply chains, telecommunications chokepoints), trust dynamics (information symmetry between states and private actors), and coercive power projection in cyberspace.\n\nThe article begins by posing fundamental questions: why do some states adopt offensive postures while others emphasize defense? How do domestic political economies constrain or enable these strategies? And how does trust, treated as an attribute of information systems, moderate the exercise of power? To answer these, Datta synthesizes interdisciplinary scholarship on power, interdependence, and trust, highlighting weaponized interdependence theory and economic sanctions paradigms. She then develops a typology of heuristics states employ—from traditional information operations to novel coercive techniques—and maps these onto state preferences for offense versus defense.\n\nKey contributions include comparative analysis of Western and Chinese cyber ecosystems. Western democracies, characterized by multistakeholder governance and transatlantic alliances, leverage transparent norms and inclusive governance to preserve information symmetry while deploying coercive tools. In contrast, China’s state-led ecosystem uses legal instruments—data localization and counter-espionage laws—to exert domestic control and support corporate champions for geopolitical influence. Through case studies such as Stuxnet, Chinese semiconductor policy, and Western measures against Huawei, the paper demonstrates how varying political economies shape strategic outcomes and how weaponized interdependence can both enhance coercive leverage and erode trust, risking fragmentation of cyberspace.\n\nDatta concludes by calling for updated policy frameworks that integrate trust preservation mechanisms—reciprocal data-sharing agreements, transparency norms, and inclusive governance structures—to mitigate misperception and escalation. This work lays the groundwork for future empirical research on the political economy of cyber conflict, the evolution of international cyber law, and the design of resilient architectures for cross-border cooperation in cyberspace.",

        "abstractNote": "The accelerating integration of computer technology into international relations has transformed the nature of conflict, enabling states and nonstate actors to deliver attacks that can disrupt critical infrastructure with the stroke of a key and challenging traditional legal frameworks for armed hostilities. This evolution has exposed significant definitional gaps in the thresholds for “use of force” under U.N. Charter Article 2(4) and “armed attack” under Article 51 when crimes move from kinetic to cyber domains, undermining states’ ability to assess the legality of cyber operations and to respond with proportional countermeasures. Motivated by widespread confusion among policymakers, scholars, and even major powers such as the United States and Russia regarding the applicability of existing Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC) principles to cyber acts, this analysis aims to synthesize prevailing theories and propose clearer lawful thresholds, asking how the international community can achieve objective, enforceable standards for cyber use of force and armed attack. Employing a doctrinal legal methodology, the paper surveys current sources of LOAC and state practice, critically reviews scholarly expansions of Article 2(4) criteria and emerging thresholds below “use of force,” and examines case illustrations including the Stuxnet intrusion, Iranian DDoS banking attacks, the U.S. response to financial-sector hackers, and alleged Russian cyber operations in Crimea. The findings reveal persistent ambiguities: Stuxnet’s stealthy manipulation of nuclear centrifuges defies neat categorization under scale-and-effects tests, state responsibility remains uncertain in botnet-driven denials-of-service, and the precipitating moment and scope of an cyber armed attack lack consensus, frustrating self-defense judgments under Article 51. This study contributes to cyber conflict scholarship by articulating a novel conceptual framework that differentiates levels of cyber coercion based on invasiveness, measurability of harm, and presumptive legitimacy, and by advocating for a formal U.N. treaty to codify these thresholds, thereby enhancing reciprocity and legitimacy in LOAC tradition. Key limitations include reliance on doctrinal interpretation in the absence of binding state practice, the speculative nature of proposed thresholds pending multilateral endorsement, and the evolving technical complexity of cyber operations that may outpace legal constructs. To address these constraints, the author outlines future research directions, including empirical case studies of state cyber doctrines, comparative analyses of regional cyber norms initiatives, intergovernmental negotiations toward treaty language, and the development of technical metrics to calibrate threshold criteria in real time, all aimed at fortifying the international legal order against the unique challenges posed by cyber warfare.",

        "abstractNote": "This article examines the applicability and adequacy of existing international legal frameworks to the phenomenon of \"fake news\", understood both in its strict sense (deliberately false factual statements) and its wider sense (distorted or tendentious reporting), with a particular focus on state-sponsored disinformation campaigns that exploit modern communication technologies. Drawing on historical precedents from the League of Nations’ interwar efforts and the United Nations’ immediate post-World War II broadcasting and correction conventions, the author analyses how false and distorted news have been regulated, and tests these frameworks against the 2016 “Lisa case,” in which Russian government–funded outlets RT and Sputnik disseminated misleading accounts of an alleged abduction and rape of a Russian-German teenager in Berlin. The case study illustrates how false news—fabricated claims of abduction and rape—can be objectively disproven and may fall within the ambit of repressive regulation under the 1936 International Convention on the Use of Broadcasting in the Cause of Peace (“Broadcasting Convention”) and the principle of non-intervention in domestic affairs. The article argues that, while false news can be legitimately proscribed when its falsity is clear and attributable, distorted or tendentious reporting raises far more complex legal and normative issues. Distorted news—framing, selective emphasis, or omission of facts to induce false conclusions—enjoys stronger protection under the right to freedom of expression (Article 19 ICCPR; Article 10 ECHR) and is susceptible to abuse if subject to repressive measures. The author reviews case law (e.g., ECtHR Olafsson v. Iceland; Heinisch v. Germany) and policy practice (UK Ofcom’s finding against RT for lack of due impartiality) to demonstrate the narrow scope in which distorted news might be regulated without infringing fundamental rights. Recognizing attribution challenges in the information age—where false news may originate from informal online platforms, and distortions from identifiable media outlets—the article explores the utility of non-repressive remedial mechanisms. In particular, it highlights the 1953 Convention on the International Right of Correction’s right to reply, which obliges states (and the UN) to disseminate corrections, and suggests that cooperative networks could amplify corrective measures without requiring formal attribution of state sponsorship. The author further proposes that preserving media pluralism—through neutral antitrust enforcement and subsidies—and enhancing transparency of media ownership and fact-checking obligations can fortify trust in information ecosystems. Ultimately, the article concludes that a universal, formal legal standard against fake news must be applied neutrally across all actors to avoid double standards and the risk of instrumentalization by authoritarian regimes. A free and pluralistic press, complemented by targeted government information policies, fact-checking, and transparency requirements, remains the best safeguard against the multifaceted challenges posed by fake news in the digital era.",

        "abstractNote": "This paper by Aaron F. Brantly advances scholarship on cyber deterrence by proposing a framework for cross-domain deterrence (CDD) against state-sponsored cyber operations, and by empirically testing it in two high-profile U.S. cases involving China and Russia. Departing from conventional cyber deterrence models that emphasize within-domain responses, such as denial or punishment confined to cyberspace, Brantly argues that effective state-level deterrence requires clear signaling and credible retaliatory options in other domains—diplomatic, economic, or military—thus expanding deterrence theory into a multidisciplinary context. After reviewing the literature on traditional deterrence, cyber deterrence, and cross‐domain coercion, he develops a theoretical model defining CDD’s essential components: public warnings, specificity of red lines, credible threat of punishment, and an iterated framework for maintaining pressure. In the first case, the United States confronted sustained Chinese cyber espionage targeting U.S. intellectual property and critical infrastructure. Collecting robust forensic evidence and leveraging indictments, sanctions, and diplomatic pressures over an extended period, the Obama administration successfully degraded certain espionage activities by signaling that further cyber theft would incur severe economic and legal costs. The second case examines Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections, including hacking of political organizations, dissemination of stolen emails, and influence operations via social media. Constrained by a compressed timeline and domestic political sensitivities, U.S. responses were limited to a private warning to President Putin, a joint public intelligence statement, and post-election expulsions and sanctions. Brantly shows that these belated, ad-hoc measures lacked the timeliness, scale, and policy consistency necessary to alter Russian behavior, underscoring the importance of pre-emptive and sustained cross-domain signaling. Through comparative analysis, the paper demonstrates that CDD strategies calibrated to an adversary’s threat profile and implemented through iterated, proportional actions are more likely to shift an adversary’s calculus than one-off cyber-only responses. Brantly concludes with policy recommendations for U.S. and allied governments: institutionalize cross-domain deterrence planning, enhance interagency and private sector collaboration to gather and share attribution evidence, codify clear public red-lines for cyber violations, and develop modular escalation mechanisms that maintain credible threat thresholds. The evidence suggests that, while CDD is not a panacea, it offers a practical path to strengthen deterrence below the nuclear threshold by integrating cyber policy with broader coercive instruments, thereby reshaping state behavior in cyberspace.",

        "abstractNote": "This article explores how foundational norms of international environmental law can inform the development of international cyberspace governance, particularly regarding States’ responsibilities for harmful cyber activities undertaken by non-State actors within their jurisdictions. Recognizing that much of the discourse on cyber conflict has focused on the law of armed force—where thresholds for ‘armed attack’ and self-defence are often unmet—the authors redirect attention to the ‘peacetime’ cyber operations that nonetheless pose transboundary risks. They argue that established environmental law principles, notably the harm prevention and due diligence framework, offer a readily available legal toolkit for addressing the panoply of cyber harms without the delays and political gridlock inherent in negotiating new treaty regimes. Drawing on the evolution of environmental law—from reliance on general sovereignty norms to the rapid expansion of specialized multilateral agreements in the late twentieth century, and more recently to a return to core transboundary obligations—the article demonstrates how the no-harm rule and associated procedural duties have been reinvigorated through state practice and judicial clarification. It then maps these developments onto cyberspace, illustrating that concepts such as the ‘global commons’ and ‘shared resources’, as well as institutional innovations like multilateral environmental agreements and norm-setting bodies, can be adapted to the cyber context, while cautioning against uncritical transplantation given cyberspace’s distinct characteristics. The authors survey contemporary norm-building efforts, comparing the Advisory Group on Cross-Border Internet’s preference for flexible, multi-stakeholder standards with the more conservative approach of the Tallinn Manual experts, who hesitated to impose broad preventive measures. They highlight that effective cyber governance likely requires a multi-layered architecture: informal networks, technical standard-setting organizations, multi-stakeholder consultative platforms, and selectively targeted intergovernmental instruments to secure consensus on core duties. Ultimately, Brunnée and Meshel conclude that the harm prevention/due diligence paradigm, already emerging in state practice and soft-law instruments, provides the most pragmatic and normative foundation for international cyber law. By teaching this ‘old law new tricks’, policymakers can build on existing customary and treaty-based obligations to regulate cyberspace more effectively, leveraging informal legal processes to develop and disseminate common standards, and reserving treaty-based cooperation for matters demanding binding commitments.",

        "abstractNote": "In “Law, Borders and the Territorialisation of Cyberspace,” Nicholas Tsagourias provides a comprehensive analysis of how traditional notions of territorial sovereignty and international legal order are extended, reconfigured, and contested within virtual space. Beginning with an exposition of the mutually constitutive relationship between states, borders, territory, and international law, the article recalls the Montevideo Convention’s criteria for statehood—permanent population, defined territory, government, and capacity to enter relations—and highlights how geographic and normative borders underpin the Westphalian model of sovereign authority. Tsagourias then examines whether and how these foundational concepts can be transposed into cyberspace, a domain characterized by a-territoriality, borderlessness, and a layered architecture of physical, logical, and social components. He elucidates two core processes by which the territorial logic of international law manifests online. The first, “territorialisation,” refers to the extraterritorial application of domestic and international legal norms to persons, data, and objects operating across networked infrastructures, effectively assigning them to legal jurisdictions irrespective of physical location. The second process involves active assertions of sovereignty in cyberspace, as states seek to delineate national “cyber zones” through legislative, technical, and diplomatic means. Drawing on theoretical debates and empirical examples—including China’s stratified model of cyber sovereignty and contrasting approaches that favor cyberspace as a global commons—Tsagourias argues that while technology can facilitate the “curving” of networked space along territorial lines, political, economic, and ideological factors ultimately drive state strategies. The article culminates in a critical inquiry into the ontological status of cyberspace itself: it refutes the possibility of a sovereign cyberspace independent of existing states, emphasizing that authority in digital realms remains mediated by terrestrial jurisdictions and the physical location of people and infrastructure. Consequently, Tsagourias concludes, the pressing issue is not whether cyberspace can be governed by spatially bounded sovereignty, but rather how the scope and limits of state authority over and within cyberspace should be negotiated. This question, he contends, will be determined by each state’s legal, political, economic, social, and cultural priorities, as well as by multilateral efforts to balance national regulatory imperatives against the benefits of open, interoperable networks.",

        "abstractNote": "In 'Cyber Security in Air and Space Law,' Stefan A. Kaiser and Martha Mejia-Kaiser examine the emerging legal and regulatory challenges posed by unauthorized cyber activities targeting aviation and space systems. The authors begin by situating cyber space as a distinct, man-made domain built upon physical infrastructure that spans state territories, international waters, and outer space. They note that while existing cybercrime conventions and UN resolutions address general cyber offences, they fail to encompass the full spectrum of risks to air and space applications, particularly those affecting safety-critical flight control systems. The dependency of modern aviation and aerospace platforms on information technologies and networked automation has made them vulnerable to remote manipulation and interference. The article traces the evolution from isolated mainframe computers to interconnected personal computing and internet networks, highlighting how this connectivity, while democratizing information exchange, also enables malicious actors to disrupt, seize, or commandeer systems, potentially causing physical harm and loss of life. National regulatory regimes, the authors argue, are inherently limited by territorial scope and divergent privacy and data protection standards, necessitating harmonized international frameworks. In aviation, a mature regulatory landscape exists for safety and security, yet it lacks specific provisions addressing cyber threats to flight controls, navigation, air traffic management, and onboard systems. Space law, by contrast, has long accepted remote control as integral but has operated with segregated networks and limited interoperability; this insulation is eroding as commercial and civil space operators adopt off-the-shelf ICT platforms. The authors explore how unauthorized cyber interference intersects with outer space treaties: Article VI of the Outer Space Treaty imposes state supervision obligations, while the Liability Convention outlines damage liability. They propose that states that fail to prevent, tolerate, or covertly support cyber incidents against space assets should incur fault-based liability. Moreover, evolving technical standards could serve as evidence of due diligence under the Liability Convention. Under this regime, states must deploy reasonable measures—technological, diplomatic, or cooperative—to prevent or mitigate cyber threats to their spacecraft. For non-physical payload data, the authors argue that the International Telecommunication Union’s Convention provides unsuitable immunity for states, creating a lacuna in protecting remote sensing, navigation, and communication data from cyber theft or interference. They call for specialized regulations that augment ITU rules to safeguard privacy, intellectual property, and commercial interests in space payloads. Concluding, Kaiser and Mejia-Kaiser stress the urgency of integrating cyber security into air and space law, recommending that existing safety and security frameworks be expanded to include cyber-specific obligations, liability provisions, and international cooperation mechanisms. They suggest that the specialized, mature regimes of air and space law could, in turn, inform broader cyber law development. This multidisciplinary approach underscores the need for synchronized technical standards, regulatory instruments, and state responsibilities to secure critical aeronautical and extraterrestrial infrastructures against the evolving spectrum of cyber threats.",

        "abstractNote": "In “Cyberterrorists: The Identification and Classification of Non-State Actors Who Engage in Cyber-Hostilities,” Major Andrea C. Goode examines the evolving nature of cyber warfare and the pivotal legal challenges in defining, identifying, and responding to non-state actors who employ malicious cyber capabilities. Through a hypothetical scenario involving a U.S. Marine vessel compromised by malware delivered via a USB flash drive, Goode illustrates the destructive potential of cyber-weapons and underscores that these threats extend far beyond conventional information operations. She traces national responses to cyber threats, highlighting milestones such as the establishment of the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (2008), the Cyberspace Policy Review (2009), the appointment of an Executive Branch Cybersecurity Coordinator (2009), and the creation of U.S. Cyber Command (2010). She observes that although policy initiatives have proliferated, the expansion of cyber hostilities has outpaced the establishment of clear international legal norms. Turning to the law of armed conflict (LOAC) and U.S. policy, Goode distinguishes cyberterrorists as unlawful combatants who can be lawfully targeted during direct participation in hostilities but who are not entitled to protections afforded by the Third and Fourth Geneva Conventions. She explores U.S. policy constraints, which prioritize capture over lethal force and require assessment of feasible non-lethal alternatives—such as disabling an adversary’s cyber assets—particularly for suspects outside areas of active hostilities. Goode examines six preconditions that must be satisfied before lethal force can be used against non-state cyber actors under U.S. policy, including the immediacy of threat, certainty of presence, protection of civilians, feasilibility of capture, host-nation consent, and exhaustion of alternatives. Critically, she identifies gaps in existing military doctrine regarding the identification and classification of cyberterrorists and notes that while the Tallinn Manual offers foundational guidance, numerous questions remain unresolved. Goode proposes a direct participation in hostilities analytical framework to assess an actor’s conduct and intent, thereby enabling military forces to make informed decisions about lawfulness of targeting and detention. Concluding, she emphasizes the need for greater clarity in international law’s application to cyber warfare and calls for doctrinal developments that integrate legal, technical, and operational perspectives to guide the U.S. armed forces’ strategy in an era where cyberspace is both battlefield and weapon.",

        "abstractNote": "Neutze and Nicholas argue that the accelerating phenomenon of “cyber insecurity” among nation‐states—borne of deepening reliance on information and communication technologies (ICT) coupled with mounting vulnerabilities—demands a robust international regime of cyber security norms. They define cyber insecurity as state perceptions of threat arising from adversarial exploitation of government and critical infrastructure systems, criminal activity, espionage, and the political risks attendant to ICT dependency. This insecurity manifests domestically in intensified investment in defense, intelligence, and regulation, and internationally in diplomatic efforts to manage cyberspace risks. Yet, the authors contend that existing state‐to‐state initiatives have failed to produce a credible “rules of the road” for acceptable behavior in cyberspace. The stakes are high: states’ critical functions—economic activity, defense, public health, and political stability—are increasingly vulnerable to digital attack, as highlighted by incidents like the Saudi Aramco network disruption in 2012. Moreover, the use of proxies and ambiguity in attribution complicates traditional deterrence and response strategies. \n\nThrough empirical survey of more than thirty national cyber policy frameworks—including those of the United States, China, Russia, European Union member states, India, and Brazil—Neutze and Nicholas observe both convergence and divergence in states’ approaches to doctrine, organizational structures, and capability development for offense and defense. While the United States’ emphasis on cyber command and intelligence sharing establishes a model that other powers may emulate or counter, regional initiatives ranging from the European Union’s Network and Information Security Directive to India’s focus on ICT innovation illustrate diverse political motivations and risk tolerances. This variability underscores the need for negotiated principles that balance security with the preservation of ICT‐driven innovation and open commerce. \n\nCentral to the authors’ prescription is a multi‐stakeholder process that engages both governments and the private sector, which build, operate, and defend the global ICT infrastructure. They propose foundational principles—transparency, harmonization, collaboration, risk reduction, and proportionality—as the basis for cyber security norms. By involving large ICT firms alongside the Group of Twenty (G20) nations in a “global coalition,” the initiative could mirror the public‐private partnerships long employed in critical infrastructure protection and draw lessons from nuclear arms‐control frameworks. The authors stress the imperative of capacity‐building in cyber literacy for diplomats, policymakers, and industry leaders, ensuring that discussions are informed by technical realities as well as strategic considerations. \n\nIn conclusion, Neutze and Nicholas warn that failure to establish effective cyber norms may drive military competition and stifle ICT innovation, leaving the “age of digital peril” unchecked. They call for immediate action: governments must commit to a transparent, principle‐based norms development process, and the private sector must proactively convene forums to prevent states from resuming unrestrained surveillance and cyber operations. Only through sustained public‐private engagement can global cyber insecurity be reduced and a stable, secure digital environment be maintained.",

        "abstractNote": "In his Concluding Remarks at the 2012 Naval War College International Law Conference, Professor Yoram Dinstein critiques the prevalent dilution of the concept of “cyber war” in both academic discourse and military deliberations, arguing for a rigorous return to the traditional contours of armed conflict under international law. Dinstein begins by lamenting that many participants conflated generic illicit cyber activities—such as data theft, malware distribution, and peacetime hacking—with the core issue of cyber operations in the context of war, thereby diverting attention from the decisive question: what constitutes cyber warfare? He insists that cyber war must be analyzed through the dual frameworks of jus ad bellum and jus in bello, the former addressing the threshold for resorting to force and the latter governing conduct once hostilities commence. Under jus ad bellum, Dinstein clarifies that the pivotal inquiry is not simply whether a cyber operation amounts to the “use of force” prohibited by Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, but whether it qualifies as an “armed attack” under Article 51, thus entitling a State to self-defense. He distinguishes between non-forcible countermeasures—such as seeking recourse through the Security Council or litigation—and the use of counterforce, permissible only in response to an armed attack. Dinstein rejects the concept of anticipatory self-defense in cyberspace as incompatible with Article 51. Turning to jus in bello, he applies the law of armed conflict (LOAC) to cyber operations, defining cyber “attacks” by their tangible effects—death, injury, or property damage—rather than by the simple planting of code. He underscores the principle of distinction, noting that civilian computers and objects may never lawfully be targeted, and that military computers are identified by their nature, use, or purpose. He further elucidates that computers of ordinary design can become legitimate military objectives if employed for military purposes, and that any doubt must be resolved in favor of civilian status. Indiscriminate cyber attacks—such as unleashing malicious software without control over its propagation—are equated with the indiscriminate use of biological weapons. Dinstein also examines the proportionality rule, stressing that anticipated civilian harm must not be excessive relative to the concrete and direct military advantage sought, and that military advantage must be assessed holistically across a campaign rather than on a piecemeal basis. Concluding, he argues against the immediate pursuit of a new treaty on cyber warfare, predicting that any such instrument would only restate existing LOAC norms in an anodyne fashion, much like the interwar Protocol on Submarine Warfare. He closes with two observations: cyber warfare levels the strategic playing field by offering less powerful States asymmetric tools to challenge major powers, and the imperative for U.S. Cyber Command is to focus on preparing for genuine cyber conflict—ensuring deterrence and readiness—rather than preoccupations with peacetime cyber issues such as intellectual property.",

        "abstractNote": "In “Geopolitics and Cyber Power: Why Geography Still Matters,” John B. Sheldon offers a comprehensive multidisciplinary analysis that bridges international relations, strategic studies, and communications engineering to argue against the prevailing notion that cyberspace has rendered traditional geopolitical considerations obsolete. He contends that despite cyberspace’s capacity to compress time and space, its physical infrastructure—encompassing undersea and terrestrial cables, satellites, servers, and local networks—is deeply rooted in geography and remains subject to sovereign control and strategic contestation. Tracing the historical interplay between communications infrastructure and state power, Sheldon demonstrates that the ownership, distribution, and location of these physical assets shape state capabilities in cyber espionage, sabotage, and information operations, as evidenced in landmark cases such as the Stuxnet attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities and cyber assaults on Ukraine’s power grid. He highlights how the attribution, deterrence, and response frameworks in cyber conflict are inherently tied to the geographic signatures of infrastructure and actor motivations. Further, Sheldon explores the strategic implications of urbanized littorals and megacities, where dense populations and critical economic nodes intersect with pervasive networked technologies, intensifying vulnerabilities and creating complex operational environments. He argues that future conflicts will increasingly blend conventional, irregular, cyber, and information operations within these contested coastal zones, necessitating integrated doctrines and training for armies, navies, and air forces to exploit cyber capabilities for intelligence, deception, and network denial or exploitation. At the grand strategic level, Sheldon revisits classical geopolitical theories—Mackinder’s Heartland and Spykman’s Rimland—to demonstrate that while cyber capabilities do not overturn the historic rivalry between continental and maritime powers, they amplify each side’s ability to project influence and contest critical infrastructure. By examining how cyber power interacts with diplomacy, economic statecraft, and military force, he shows that an effective state strategy must integrate territorial considerations, infrastructure vulnerabilities, and geostrategic context to enhance deterrence, resilience, and crisis response. His conclusion underscores that cyberspace is neither placeless nor apolitical, and that geography remains a fundamental determinant of state cyberpower. Policymakers and analysts are thus urged to rebalance their cyber strategies by recognizing the enduring influence of territory and geopolitics in shaping digital operations and the broader dynamics of international power competition.",

Employing a doctrinal methodology, the paper systematically reviews seminal ICJ jurisprudence (e.g., Corfu Channel, Chorzow Factory), the International Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility, and secondary sources such as the Tallinn Manual to elucidate how general principles—pacta sunt servanda, reparations obligations, equity, and estoppel—inform state conduct in cyberspace. The authors show that, in the near total vacuum of cyber-specific treaties and custom, states and courts resort to these general principles to adjudicate disputes and guide normative expectations. For example, the obligation not to allow one’s territory to be used for harmful acts underlies Tallinn Manual Rule 5, mirroring the ICJ’s Corfu Channel pronouncement. The paper highlights divergent state positions: Western states are gradually articulating stances on the applicability of existing law to cyber operations, though often vaguely, while Russia and China have softened but not clarified their earlier objections. Through their narrative, Schmitt and Vihul synthesize these developments into a coherent framework, identifying sources, interpretive challenges, and the influence of scholarly contributions as secondary sources under Article 38. They argue that, despite scholarly efforts exemplified by the Tallinn Manual and its “2.0” successor, formal law-making authority resides solely with states, and without active state engagement, legal ambiguity and policy-driven interpretations will persist. Limitations include the slow pace of customary law formation, the lack of binding treaties, and the inherent difficulty of applying centuries-old legal principles to rapidly evolving cyber phenomena. The paper concludes that, in the interim, policy and ethical norms may fill normative gaps and potentially mature into binding international law through codification or crystallization, but that sustained state action is necessary to shape the legal architecture of cyberspace. Future research should focus on empirical study of state practice to clarify customary norms, monitoring treaty initiatives, and bridging scholarly work with formal law-making processes to enhance legal certainty and normative coherence in cyber conflict contexts.",

        "abstractNote": "Ilai Saltzman’s 2013 article “Cyber Posturing and the Offense-Defense Balance” in Contemporary Security Policy advances a realist framework accounting for how cyber capabilities reshape interstate security dynamics by altering the classical offense–defense balance. Challenging the prevailing view among some realists that cyber operations represent only incremental changes to traditional warfare, Saltzman reconceptualizes Offense–Defense theory to encompass the distinctive qualities of cyberspace—its low attribution thresholds, minimal marginal costs for attackers, and potential for rapid political-military escalation. Drawing on Robert Jervis’s and George Quester’s original formulations, he identifies the central question as whether cyber tools inherently favor offense or defense, proposing a modified conceptualization in which Offense–Defense distinctions hinge on the relative costs and risks states face when using cyber means to degrade adversary military or civilian infrastructures. Empirically, Saltzman conducts a comparative qualitative analysis of official doctrines and strategic statements from four leading actors—China, Russia, the United States, and NATO—using primary sources including defence white papers, military doctrines, and allied summit declarations. His findings reveal a convergence toward offensive cyber postures: all four actors emphasize the strategic enabler function of cyber capabilities, viewing them as force multipliers that lower barriers to attack and confer asymmetric advantages by complicating attribution. In each case, public documents indicate growing investments in specialized offensive cyber units, doctrinal acceptance that cyber operations can precede or accompany kinetic strikes, and a shift from defensive information security to proactive cyber engagement. Saltzman argues that while cyber warfare does not directly cause interstate armed conflict, it lowers the political and military threshold for escalation, transforming conflict calculus by making coercive digital actions cheaper, faster, and less publicly costly. The integration of ICT into national security thus creates a novel domain of operations that realism must accommodate: cyberspace functions as an alternative battlefield where states posture offensively to signal resolve, deter adversaries, and prepare contingency options. Saltzman acknowledges limitations due to reliance on publicly available documents and calls for longitudinal incident tracking, quantitative modeling of offense versus defense cost ratios, and investigation into norm-building processes to mitigate instability. He concludes that cyber war is neither inevitable nor decisive on its own, but its inf luence as a strategic enabler demands that prospectives theories of international security transcend territorial and kinetic assumptions. By expanding Offense–Defense theory to include cyberspace, this study offers a multidisciplinary contribution bridging international relations, strategic studies, and cyber policy, highlighting the need for theorists and policymakers to reckon with digital technologies as fundamental reshapers of the offense–defense balance and international security.",

Recognizing cyberspace’s unique characteristics—low entry cost, anonymity, legal ambiguity, and asymmetric reach—the paper maps the diverse array of non-state participants in cyberspace operations, including hacktivists, patriot hackers, cybermilitias, organized crime groups, and rogue malware authors. Through a qualitative literature review and conceptual analysis of academic studies, military doctrines, government reports, and documented cyber incidents (notably the 2007 Estonia attacks, the GhostNet espionage network, and the Stuxnet operation), the author elaborates a taxonomy of these non-state actors, detailing their motivations (political protest, espionage, economic gain, or state-directed aggression), recruitment dynamics, tactics (denial-of-service, web defacement, information leaks, espionage, and malware deployment), and varying degrees of state affiliation. The paper interrogates definitional boundaries between cyberattack, cyberwar, and traditional kinetic warfare by synthesizing existing definitions of cyberwarfare, drawing on Clausewitzian frames, and disaggregating “cyberactions” to clarify thresholds at which state-endorsed or state-utilized non-state actors may constitute acts of war under international law. Core findings indicate that many governments are actively recruiting or tolerating non-state actors to augment their cyber capabilities, leveraging their specialized skills to achieve deniable, cost-effective offensive and defensive operations. This convergence transforms cyberspace into a flexible tool of state power but raises profound legal and ethical dilemmas regarding attribution, state responsibility, compliance with jus ad bellum, and the adequacy of existing legal frameworks. The author highlights that the legal ambiguity and the paucity of verifiable cyberwarfare cases impede clear policy formulation, complicate threshold-setting for armed conflict, and challenge the enforcement of international norms. As a result, the paper calls for the development of more robust normative and legal instruments to govern state sponsorship of non-state cyber actors, enhanced attribution technologies to improve accountability, and codified conflict thresholds to guide coherent military and policy responses. The research contributes a conceptual framework for understanding state–non-state partnerships in cyberspace and offers preliminary assessments of their strategic utility and associated risks. Acknowledging limitations due to nascent empirical data, the author urges further empirical studies to refine the taxonomy of non-state cyber actors, evaluate evolving doctrinal approaches to cyber warfare, and advance multidisciplinary policy debates on how to regulate and respond to cyber conflict in the twenty-first century.",

        "abstractNote": "This article offers the first large-scale empirical portrait of state-driven cyber conflict by systematically cataloguing and analysing cyber incidents and disputes among international rivals from 2001 to 2011. Arguing that discussions of cyberwar and cyber conflict have been dominated by speculative and sensationalist accounts, Valeriano and Maness return the debate to social science by constructing and examining a dataset of 110 discrete cyber incidents clustered into 45 cyber disputes across 126 active rival dyads. They define cyber incidents as individual malicious operations—ranging from website defacements and distributed denial-of-service attacks to data theft—launched by one state against another, and cyber disputes as campaigns comprising one or more related incidents over a given time period. Drawing on rivalry literature, deterrence theory, and theories of restraint and regionalism, they hypothesize that contrary to the popular perception of unbounded cyber aggression, states will demonstrate restraint in their use of cyber tactics and that cyber conflict will be geographically constrained to rival pairs with existing histories of tension. Using rigorous open-source coding procedures, each incident is coded for initiator, target, tactic, severity, and timing. Quantitative analysis reveals that only 20 of the 126 rival dyads engaged in any cyber conflict during the decade under study, and those that did averaged just three incidents per dyad. The most active dyad, the United States and China, accounts for 22 of the 110 incidents within five disputes, yet even this pair refrains from the most destructive forms of cyber operations. The overwhelming majority of incidents are low-intensity interactions—chiefly defacements, probes, and denial-of-service campaigns—that do not escalate into kinetic violence. The authors identify a pattern of ‘cyber restraint,’ whereby states refrain from targeting critical infrastructure or employing destructive malware, motivated by fears of retaliation, uncontrolled escalation, collateral damage and erosion of international norms. They also demonstrate pronounced regionalism: most cyber disputes occur among neighboring adversaries, notably post-Soviet states in Eastern Europe and rivals in South and East Asia, supporting the view that cyberspace does not erase traditional geopolitical constraints. The study acknowledges limitations related to open-source data and attribution challenges, and proposes future research on how emerging cyber capabilities influence the evolution of international norms, the role of non-state actors and proxies in cyber rivalries, and the effects of alliances and third-party interventions on dispute dynamics. By grounding the study of interstate cyber conflict in empirical evidence and rivalry theory, this work provides a nuanced foundation for policymakers seeking proportional and informed responses in cyberspace, rather than reactionary or alarmist measures.",

        "abstractNote": "This article investigates how States should organize military cyberspace commands to conduct both offensive and defensive operations in compliance with the law of armed conflict and broader strategic objectives, using the establishment and practices of the United States Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) as a primary lens. It begins with the historical context of USCYBERCOM’s creation in 2009—merging Joint Task Force-Global Network Operations and Joint Functional Component Command–Network Warfare—driven by recognized gaps in Department of Defense (DoD) network defense and high-profile intrusion events such as Operation Buckshot Yankee. The study maps international responses, noting analogous developments in China, India, Russia, South Korea, Iran, Germany, and the United Kingdom, and underscores the diversity of organizational models emerging worldwide. Part II focuses on the legal vetting of cyberspace capabilities, comparing the U.S. Air Force’s policy of reviewing all cyber tools against the Army and Navy’s effect-based review by which only capabilities with potential lethal or destructive outcomes undergo legal scrutiny. Drawing on DoD policy memoranda, service-level legal review procedures, and perspectives from the Tallinn Manual, the author recommends that States adopt a differentiated review standard calibrated to operational effect, thereby balancing the imperative of legal compliance with the need for rapid capability fielding. Part III addresses precautions against harm to civilian infrastructure, analyzing the feasibility and benefits of maintaining segregated military networks—such as the NIPRnet—distinct from civilian Internet systems to minimize collateral damage, improve attribution, and strengthen legal defensibility of operations. The author contends that virtual and physical network segregation enhances operational security and upholds civilian protection obligations, though it acknowledges challenges posed by shared gateways and chokepoints. Part IV extends this discussion to the conduct of cyber attacks, evaluating proposals like the ‘carpet bomb’ botnet concept, which envisions leveraging .mil infrastructure to generate large-scale denial-of-service effects. While recognizing the technical feasibility of such dedicated offensive architectures, the analysis warns that intermingling military and civilian networks without adequate separation raises serious legal and operational risks under jus in bello. Through these sections, the paper develops a normative framework underscoring three core principles: effect-based legal review of cyber capabilities, virtual or physical segregation of military networks to protect civilian systems, and rigorous evaluation of operational practicability when determining feasible cyber command structures. Limitations stem from sparse publicly available State practice and evolving cyber technologies, yet the author identifies future research avenues—including empirical assessments of segregation efficacy and comparative studies of cyber command doctrines—to refine policy guidelines. Ultimately, the study offers actionable recommendations to ensure that as States organize for cyberspace operations, they remain fully compliant with international law while preserving strategic effectiveness in a rapidly transforming domain of warfare.",

        "abstractNote": "This article offers a comprehensive doctrinal analysis of the existing international legal framework governing state conduct in cyberspace, specifically assessing the applicability of the United Nations Charter and the non-binding Tallinn Manual to cyber-warfare and proposing a path toward a binding treaty. Epstein begins by surveying divergent conceptions of cyber-warfare—definitions based variously on the nature of the targeted object, the medium employed, and the syntactic, semantic, or hybrid characteristics of the attacks—and illustrates each category with hypothetical scenarios ranging from denial-of-service operations to semantic manipulation of critical information systems. He then turns to the core provisions of the UN Charter—Article 2(4)’s prohibition on the threat or use of force, Article 51’s right of self-defense, and Articles 41 and 42’s complementary measures—and demonstrates how these rules, crafted for kinetic conflict, struggle to accommodate cyber operations. Epstein examines the interpretive guidance of the Tallinn Manual’s rules on use of force, threat of force, necessity, proportionality, immediacy, collective self-defense, and permissible countermeasures, identifying four principal deficiencies: the misfit of traditional “use of force” and “armed attack” definitions in cyber contexts; the Manual’s unquantified scale-and-effects test; attribution and intent challenges; and the normative ambiguity created by reliance on a non-binding instrument. To remedy these gaps, Epstein advocates convening a U.S.-led international conference to negotiate a binding cyber-warfare treaty that builds upon the substance of the Tallinn Manual while introducing: a sliding-scale and effects test with quantifiable thresholds; explicit consideration of state intent; mandatory multilateral consultations before defensive or counter-cyber actions; illustrative examples to guide interpretation; and a universal obligation, analogous to Article 2(6) of the UN Charter, to ensure compliance by non-signatories to preserve international peace and security. Acknowledging procedural and political hurdles—such as achieving consensus among diverse state actors and keeping pace with rapidly evolving cyber threats—Epstein argues that without a binding instrument, states will continue to grapple with unacceptable legal uncertainty. The article concludes by urging U.S. leadership in treaty negotiations to establish a clear, adaptable, and legally precise regime that balances the flexibility needed to address emergent cyber threats with sufficient precision to deter unlawful cyber-attacks and sustain global stability.",

        "abstractNote": "In “This Means War (Maybe) – Clarifying Casus Belli in Cyberspace,” Lieutenant Colonel Charles C. Poche examines the ambiguous threshold at which cyber operations can justifiably trigger a state’s right to self-defense under existing international law. Noting that cyberspace blurs the traditional distinction between espionage and armed attack, Poche argues that the lack of agreed norms governing casus belli in the cyber domain creates a dangerous gray zone that risks inadvertent escalation to armed conflict. Employing a doctrinal legal analysis grounded in the emerging Tallinn Manual framework and case-study methodology, the paper first reviews the prohibition on the use of force in the U.N. Charter and the attendant exception for self-defense. The author then details the Tallinn Manual indicators—state involvement, severity, invasiveness, immediacy, and directness—and applies these factors to two seminal incidents: the 2007 distributed denial-of-service attacks on Estonia and the 2010 Stuxnet operation against Iran. Through comparative analysis, Poche finds that while the Estonian attacks lacked the requisite severity and directness to constitute an armed attack, Stuxnet’s physical effects on Iran’s nuclear infrastructure likely met the threshold for triggering self-defense. Recognizing the expansive intermediate zone between these extremes, the paper offers a five-part framework to reduce legal ambiguity and deter miscalculation. First, it urges the United States to openly acknowledge its justified offensive cyber operations to build transparent state practice. Second, it recommends preserving clear organizational boundaries between cyber attack/defense and espionage functions to safeguard espionage’s status under the law. Third, it advocates asserting sovereign control over designated portions of cyberspace as a bright-line test of invasiveness. Fourth, it calls for deploying active cyber defenses—automated detection, tracing, and counter-strikes—within sovereign cyber territories, drawing a modern parallel to the Caroline standard’s “reflexive” self-defense. Fifth, it proposes routinely reporting active defense deployments to the U.N. Security Council to promote shared understanding of limits and expected responses, thus accelerating the crystallization of customary international law. The paper acknowledges its U.S.-centric focus and the evolving nature of cyber capabilities as limitations and suggests future research comparing these recommendations against other major cyber powers’ doctrines and exploring empirical effects of reporting active defenses on deterrence and norm formation. Poche’s work advances both scholarly and practical policymaking by delineating the contours of cyber casus belli, integrating legal theory with operational considerations, and offering concrete measures to foster clarity and stability in state behavior in cyberspace.",

        "abstractNote": "Jason F. Keen’s 2015 article examines whether and under what circumstances states may lawfully employ conventional military force in response to malicious cyber intrusions, a pressing issue amid rapidly evolving cyber capabilities and lagging international legal frameworks. Drawing on a doctrinal legal methodology, Keen analyzes the United Nations Charter’s use-of-force provisions, customary international law, and state practice to clarify whether cyber-only intrusions justify countermeasures or self-defense under Articles 2(4) and 51 of the Charter and the Articles on State Responsibility. He surveys key International Court of Justice judgments—Nicaragua, Congo, Oil Platforms—and Security Council reactions, illustrating the high thresholds the ICJ has set for an “armed attack” and the reluctance of states and international bodies to classify cyber operations as uses of force. Keen identifies a trend in which targeted conventional strikes—cross-border raids in Georgia post-2008, the U.S. cruise missile attack on Iraqi intelligence in 1993, and Israel’s 2014 response to a Syrian missile launch—are tacitly accepted by the Security Council as legitimate countermeasures when cyber or other hostile acts fall below the armed-attack threshold. Through empirical examples, he argues that while few cyber intrusions meet the threshold of armed attack, states nonetheless carve out a “below the line” operational space for proportionate conventional responses, challenging doctrinal claims that the Security Council holds a monopoly on the use of force. Keen warns that this indeterminacy between legal theory and pragmatic state practice risks unregulated escalation and destabilizing precedents, particularly given attribution challenges and inconsistent international practice. Concluding that Security Council authorization for force in cyber-only scenarios is unlikely and ICJ determinations of cyberarmed attacks remain remote, the article offers a nuanced legal framework for understanding when conventional force may serve as a permissible countermeasure to cyber threats. It underscores the need for normative guidelines to reconcile legal doctrines with evolving state practice, propose standardized thresholds for lawful retaliation, and assess the deterrent efficacy of conventional countermeasures in cyber conflict.",

        "abstractNote": "This article addresses the domestic legal governance of U.S. military offensive cyber operations and examines whether such operations fall within the scope of the War Powers Resolution. Congress, through Section 954 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, explicitly linked “military activities in cyberspace” to the War Powers Resolution, reflecting congressional intent to subject offensive cyber capabilities to the same checks as traditional kinetic forces. The author, employing a doctrinal, case-based method, analyzes legislative texts, congressional history, executive branch communications, and public reporting to trace how “hostilities” became the operative trigger for statutory reporting and withdrawal requirements under the 1973 Resolution. After reconstructing the four limiting factors articulated by the Departments of Defense and State—scale of engagement, risk of escalation, exposure of U.S. forces, and scope of military means—the article applies this rubric in a detailed case study of the Stuxnet computer virus attack in Iran. This analysis reveals that Stuxnet’s narrowly tailored objective, minimal risk of escalation due to attribution challenges and geographic containment, nonexistent U.S. personnel exposure, and exclusive use of cyber means would likely lead the executive branch to conclude that such an operation does not constitute “hostilities.” Accordingly, the War Powers Resolution’s notification and withdrawal mandates would remain unlikely to constrain stand-alone offensive cyber activities despite explicit congressional linkage. By synthesizing statutory language, executive practice, and a concrete cyber incident, the article uncovers a significant governance gap: under existing executive criteria, offensive military cyber operations consistently fail to reach the threshold of “hostilities” necessary to trigger domestic constitutional checks on the use of force. The author concludes that without revised statutory definitions or new policy mechanisms—whether through amended domestic law or treaty-based models—the War Powers Resolution will continue to exclude a growing class of state-sponsored cyber operations from meaningful democratic oversight, thereby undermining accountability in the digital battlespace. The article calls for future research on comparative legislative approaches and empirical study of executive-legislative interactions in cyber missions to develop more robust oversight frameworks.",

        "abstractNote": "Christopher P. Toscano’s article “Pouring New Wine into Old Bottles: Understanding the Notion of Direct Participation in Hostilities within the Cyber Domain” examines the challenge of applying established International Humanitarian Law (IHL) and the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC) principles—especially the principle of distinction and Direct Participation in Hostilities (DPH)—to cyber operations. Recognizing that cyber attacks like Stuxnet can produce physical effects and that civilian hackers can operate globally without proximity to the battlefield, Toscano argues that existing legal frameworks, though not explicitly drafted for cyber operations, must nonetheless regulate cyber hostilities until a specialized cyber warfare treaty emerges. He conducts a thorough doctrinal analysis of treaty provisions, customary law scholarship, state practice, opinio juris, and the Tallinn Manual, identifying gaps in current legal thought and proposing a novel framework for determining when a civilian who engages in cyber hostilities forfeits protection and becomes a lawful target. Toscano defines the threshold criteria for cyber-related DPH by analogizing traditional kinetic operations: hostilities encompass acts intended to cause harm to a state’s military or civilian infrastructure, whether through data destruction, denial of service, or manipulation of cyber-physical systems. He outlines three response modalities within self-defense bounds—non-kinetic, kinetic, and covert—each of which must adhere to sovereignty, proportionality, necessity, and the prohibition on unnecessary suffering. For non-kinetic responses, Toscano proposes active cyber defenses that detect and neutralize threats while preserving evidence. In discussing kinetic responses, he clarifies that cyber-enabled physical attacks can be legally analogous to conventional targeting of enemy combatants, though political and escalation risks mandate case-by-case analysis. On covert action, the author explores clandestine operations, including targeted killings, renditions, and cyber operations designed to track or neutralize adversary actors in neutral states, and he addresses the legal constraints posed by Executive Order 12333 and the United Nations Charter. Throughout, Toscano emphasizes the Frankenstein-like national policies that interpret IHL as cyber law, noting that the opacity of many states’ cyber doctrines and classified U.S. authorities underscores the need for transparency. He concludes that, despite divergent state positions and the unlikelihood in the near term of a comprehensive cyber-hostilities treaty, IHL principles, as elaborated in the Tallinn Manual, provide an immediate baseline for regulating cyber warfare. Toscano further argues that consistent state practice and opinio juris will gradually crystallize into customary international law and urges future research into treaty negotiations, the role of regional bodies such as NATO in harmonizing norms, transparent national cyber doctrines, and the refinement of self-defense criteria in preemptive cyber contexts. His proposed DPCH framework offers military and policy-makers a structured approach to classify cyber actors, determine lawful targeting, and select appropriate response options that balance defense imperatives with civilian protection obligations.",

        "abstractNote": "This article by Sico van der Meer critically examines the challenge of securing the international cyber domain through the lens of diplomacy and normative development, arguing that while national cyber-deterrence strategies may offer short-term gains, they risk provoking an arms race and escalating tensions among state actors. Drawing on qualitative policy analysis, the author reviews official documents, case studies of major cyber incidents—including the Estonia attacks of 2007, Georgia 2008, Iran 2010, and Ukraine 2015—and ongoing multilateral processes such as the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts (UNGGE), the OSCE confidence-building measures (CBMs), and NATO’s Tallinn Manual. Van der Meer first outlines the growing spectrum of cyber threats—from espionage and crime to terrorism and sabotage—and the limitations of passive deterrence through costly defensive investments that may fuel “tit-for-tat” escalation without addressing underlying misperceptions or the absence of binding norms. He then situates diplomacy as a more sustainable mechanism for fostering transparency, predictability, and cooperation in cyberspace. Confidence-building measures, both bilateral and multilateral, are presented as “pressure valves” to defuse tensions, while shared norms and values, though slower to develop, offer powerful invisible restraints analogous to the nuclear non-use taboo. However, the author acknowledges significant obstacles: divergent state conceptions of cyber security, contested views regarding Internet freedom versus state intervention, the involvement of non-state actors such as industry leaders, civil society, and technical experts, and the inherently non-binding nature of CBMs and emerging norms. Despite the protracted pace of diplomatic norm-building relative to rapid technological change, van der Meer documents nascent progress: the UNGGE’s work on responsible state behavior and the application of international law in cyberspace; the ITU’s initiatives on common language and standards; OSCE’s adoption of CBMs; and the positive reception of the Tallinn Manual beyond NATO membership. He concludes that while continued investment in secure cyber infrastructure remains necessary, policy-makers should prioritize and accelerate diplomatic processes to establish enduring confidence and a normative order in cyberspace. The study calls for future research on legally binding cyber treaties, robust compliance and verification regimes, and the role of private actors in norm creation and enforcement, offering a roadmap for transitioning from unilateral deterrence to a cooperative, norm-based international cyber security regime.",

        "abstractNote": "This article by Christian Walter critically examines the existing international legal framework governing inter-State “cyber security incidents” that fall below the threshold of armed conflict or use of force, asking how general principles and rules of international law might impose duties on States before, during, and after such incidents. Walter begins by affirming the continued primacy of sovereign territoriality in cyberspace, rejecting the notion of a sui generis legal space divorced from State authority. He defines a “cyber security incident” expansively to encompass a spectrum of malicious cyber operations—from distributed denial of service attacks to industrial espionage and hacktivism—that inflict cross-border harm akin to environmental damage yet do not constitute armed force. This definition situates most cyber events outside the armed conflict paradigm, redirecting attention to preventive and cooperative obligations under general international law. The core of Walter’s inquiry is whether established doctrines—drawn by analogy from environmental law’s principle of good neighbourliness, human rights jurisprudence on positive obligations, and procedural norms in cybercrime treaties—supply a coherent foundation for State duties in cyberspace. He critiques the preventive model: unlike pollution or hazardous environmental activities, cyberspace cannot be neatly partitioned into hazardous versus non-hazardous operations, so pre-incident triggers for preventive duties are impractical. Instead, he argues that the general principle of good neighbourliness offers the most promising normative basis for obligations of cooperation and mutual assistance during and after a cyber security incident. This principle, long applied in environmental law to mitigate transboundary harm, can be adapted to require States to share information, coordinate responses, and render assistance once harmful cyber activity occurs. Walter further proposes that where a malicious operation can be traced to a computer system under a State’s exclusive control, that State bears a human rights–inspired obligation to investigate, akin to duties to inquire into rights abuses in contexts of State detention. He then examines the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime as the leading multilateral instrument creating procedural obligations for data preservation, evidence sharing, and mutual legal assistance. Although its treaty obligations bind only parties, its provisions illustrate how States might operationalize post-incident cooperation, including expedited data preservation, mutual legal assistance, and extradition consultations. Walter concludes that, given the absence of clear preventive thresholds in cyberspace, the focus of international law should shift from pre-incident regulation to reinforcing cooperative and investigative obligations once cyber incidents arise. He acknowledges the exploratory nature of analogical reasoning across legal fields and notes that comprehensive preventive duties and transborder data-access rules await further development. He highlights the ongoing negotiations for an Additional Protocol to the Budapest Convention on transborder data access as a critical frontier for shaping future State obligations. Ultimately, Walter’s analysis maps a preliminary yet structured framework—anchored in good neighbourliness, investigative duties, and cybercrime cooperation mechanisms—to address interstate cyber incidents and fill gaps where no specialized treaty regime yet exists.",

        "abstractNote": "This article examines the applicability of established international legal frameworks, specifically the 1907 Hague Convention and the Hague Rules Regarding Aerial Warfare, to the emerging domain of information warfare and the principle of neutrality in cyberspace. Against a backdrop of notable incidents—including infiltration of U.S. Department of Defense networks, Stuxnet’s attack on Iran’s nuclear program, and distributed denial-of-service assaults during the Estonian and Georgian conflicts—the author argues that most offensive cyber operations capable of causing harm should be regarded as armed conflict under current international humanitarian law. Through a legal doctrinal analysis informed by treaty text, state practice, and illustrative scenarios, the article identifies the three core duties of neutral states—impartiality, intervention to prevent harm emanating from neutral territory, and repulsion of belligerent forces—and demonstrates how these translate into the digital realm. Neutral states must provide telecommunications services without discrimination, quarantine or disable compromised systems used for attacks, and adopt proactive measures to safeguard critical infrastructure. Failure to do so may permit belligerents to invoke the right of necessity and neutralize offending systems. The study also grapples with challenges unique to cyberspace: difficulties in timely attribution of attacks, uncertainty regarding notification of compromise, and the classification of information operations as armed conflict, espionage, or criminal activity. While certain cyber intrusions, such as data theft, may fall outside the Law of Armed Conflict and be more appropriately addressed through criminal or espionage channels, the authors contend that the majority of high-impact information warfare tactics that risk injury or damage—exploitation, destruction, and disruption of digital systems—demand application of existing LoAC norms. The article further explores scenarios where neutral states inadvertently host digital weapons or permit use of their infrastructure to attack belligerents, concluding that the storage of non-weaponized data backups by private companies does not breach neutrality, whereas failure to intervene against botnets or malware launches does. Recognizing the rapid evolution of cyber capabilities, the author recommends that rather than drafting wholly new treaties, the international community should adapt and refine existing neutrality rules, develop early–warning and deterrent technologies, and cultivate diplomatic consensus to guide state and non-state actors. The article concludes that the extension of current neutrality obligations to the digital battlefield offers a flexible, humane approach to governing cyber conflict, emphasizes the need for international cooperation to address attribution and notification challenges, and calls for empirical research on state practice and private sector roles in information warfare.",

        "abstractNote": "This article addresses a critical gap in the international relations literature by examining how states leverage cyber weapons in diplomatic bargaining, a topic largely overlooked despite the rapid proliferation of military cyber capabilities. Traditional models of militarized interstate bargaining assume that credible threats require visibility and attribution; however, cyber weapons derive their potency from secrecy and deniability. This paradox has led some scholars to dismiss cyber coercion as ineffective or even mythical. Against this backdrop, Richard B. Andres introduces the concept of “inverted-militarized diplomacy,” a framework that reconceptualizes the integration of cyber operations within statecraft. Rather than initiating coercive diplomacy through explicit threats, states employing this inverted approach first execute clandestine cyber intrusions to achieve strategic gains—ranging from economic disruption to information manipulation—and subsequently engage in diplomatic channels to forestall retaliation and manage escalation. Drawing on historical analogues such as piracy and proxy irregular warfare, the author identifies three principal methods of cyber coercion: economic sabotage, political subversion, and critical infrastructure disruption, each facilitated by the plausible deniability inherent in cyber tools. Through conceptual analysis and illustrative case studies—spanning state-sponsored malware deployments, intellectual property theft campaigns, and the covert facilitation of insurgent communications—the article demonstrates how inverted diplomacy allows states to exploit surprise for immediate objectives while preserving strategic ambiguity. This model challenges prevailing theories of deterrence and signaling by showing that the sequence of force and negotiation need not follow conventional patterns. The framework underscores the need for policymakers to anticipate covert cyber operations not as anomalies but as deliberate components of diplomatic strategy. The article concludes by outlining avenues for future research, including empirical validation across diverse geopolitical contexts, exploration of legal implications under jus ad bellum and doctrines of state responsibility, and development of normative and policy instruments to regulate clandestine cyber coercion. Ultimately, inverted-militarized diplomacy provides a novel theoretical lens that situates cyber weapons within a broader repertoire of state strategies, offering both scholars and practitioners insights into the evolving intersection of warfare and diplomacy in the digital age.",

        "abstractNote": "This article by J. Taylor offers a comprehensive doctrinal analysis of the evolving legal and regulatory challenges arising from the convergence of civilian and military activities in cyberspace. Recognizing cyberspace as an emergent domain of human activity integral to both everyday life and state security, the paper systematically reviews existing international legal instruments—most notably the Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions, the law of armed conflict (LOAC), and the Tallinn Manual—to assess their applicability to cyber operations and to highlight critical lacunae. Through examination of real-world incidents, including disruptive attacks on SCADA systems and the rise of ransomware, Taylor demonstrates that traditional principles such as distinction, proportionality, and accountability are severely strained by the borderless, dual-use nature of cyber tools and the diffusion of capabilities among state and non-state actors. The principle of distinction is particularly compromised by the inherent indistinctness of cyber infrastructure, where an operation aimed at a military target often risks civilian harm. Proportionality is further complicated by the cascading, uncontrollable effects of malware once deployed, prompting controversial arguments about human responsibility for unintended consequences. Taylor also critiques the NATO-centric origins of the Tallinn Manual and the limited legitimacy of its norms beyond Western states. In response to these deficiencies, the paper proposes a recalibrated regulatory framework emphasizing proactive legal restraint, clearer criteria for state responsibility, and a normative consensus on weapon classification and civilian participation in hostilities. The author calls for enhanced predictability in cyber regulation through the development of universally accepted definitions and attribution mechanisms and urges empirical research into state practice, the interplay between emerging cyber norms and online freedoms, and legal strategies for countering terrorism-driven cyber operations. Limitations include the Western-centric doctrinal focus and the rapid technological evolution that may outpace legal adaptation. By integrating civilian and military perspectives, this study advances policy discourse and charts pathways toward a more coherent and secure regulatory regime for cyberspace.",

        "abstractNote": "In “Whither the Web? International Law, Cybersecurity, and Critical Infrastructure Protection,” David P. Fidler analyzes the adequacy of existing international legal norms and U.S. policy frameworks for defending critical infrastructure against cyber threats, and examines the emerging U.S. strategic turn toward offensive cyber capabilities as a deterrent. Fidler begins by highlighting congressional testimony from Admiral Michael Rogers, Commander of U.S. Cyber Command and Director of the NSA, who underscores that adversarial states and non-state actors can incapacitate U.S. critical infrastructure via networked control systems. Rogers calls for new norms or principles to govern behavior in cyberspace, reflecting a broader demand to strengthen the “web” of international law applicable to cyber threats. Against this backdrop, Fidler maps the normative landscape, noting that although preexisting international law—treaties governing terrorism, armed conflict, and transnational harm—already prohibits most cyber operations against critical infrastructure, these legacy rules were not designed for the cyber context and offer little assurance of compliance or enforcement. He details how existing instruments—the 1998 U.S. Presidential Directive on critical infrastructure protection, the 2013 Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity, and multilateral conventions such as the Council of Europe’s Cybercrime Convention and the African Union’s Cybersecurity Convention—address discrete sectors but fall short of a cohesive, binding regime. Moreover, Fidler underscores that attempts to develop cyber-specific norms face challenges in securing state agreement, distinguishing new principles from ineffective antecedents, and enforcing compliance against determined violators. Faced with normative uncertainty, U.S. policy has pivoted to material power: Fidler chronicles the 2013 Executive Order on Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity, President Obama’s 2015 sanctions authority targeting malicious cyber actors, and the April 2015 DoD Cyber Strategy, all of which emphasize offensive cyber capabilities and sanctions to deter hostile actions. He observes that this shift reflects a lack of confidence in both existing and prospective norms to safeguard critical infrastructure, prompting reliance on a doctrine of cyber deterrence predicated on threat and use of cyber power rather than international legal restraints. Fidler warns that this nascent approach to deterrence diverges from traditional models, especially nuclear, and its efficacy remains untested. He concludes by offering a conceptual framework of the “web” of international legal norms relevant to cyber-enabled attacks on critical infrastructure, and he calls for future empirical research on the effectiveness of deterrence measures, normative adaptation in non-Western contexts, and the delineation of credible thresholds for cyber coercion and retaliation in a multipolar world. His analysis integrates doctrinal, policy, and strategic dimensions, illuminating why power projection has become central to U.S. cyber defense and why norm development alone may be insufficient to address the persistent threat to vital national systems.",

        "abstractNote": "This article examines the customary international law obligation of states to prevent transboundary harm arising from malicious cyber operations conducted by non-state actors via cyber infrastructure located within their territories. Buchan argues that, in contrast to the contested doctrine of attribution—where states incur responsibility only when they exercise “effective control” over perpetrators—the obligation to prevent hinges on a due diligence standard and does not require precise technical attribution. Drawing on seminal decisions of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) (notably Corfu Channel and Bosnia Genocide), International Law Commission materials, state practice, and scholarly commentary, the article demonstrates that the prevention obligation comprises two distinct duties: an obligation of result and an obligation of conduct. The first duty—an obligation of result—imposes on states a requirement to establish a minimum domestic legal and institutional framework capable of deterring and punishing malicious cyber conduct. While states retain broad discretion regarding the design of these frameworks, they must adopt legislation, regulatory regimes, and law-enforcement or cyber incident response capacities sufficient to guard against cyber threats emanating from their jurisdiction. The second duty—an obligation of conduct—applies when states have actual or constructive knowledge of a specific threat. Under a due diligence standard, states must act reasonably, employing available resources to suppress or mitigate the threat; what is “reasonable” depends on the state’s capacity, the nature of the threat, and the risks involved. The article highlights two limiting factors: the wide margin of appreciation in domestic measures leads to uneven prevention capabilities, and a capacity-sensitive due diligence standard may incentivize forum-shopping by attackers exploiting weaker states. Buchan concludes that while the customary prevention obligation offers a valuable legal tool that operates independently of precise attribution and applies even when malicious traffic merely transits a state’s infrastructure, its current breadth and flexibility are insufficient to ensure uniform protection. He proposes that binding treaty law could “upgrade” state obligations by prescribing specific procedural and substantive measures—such as cybercrime statutes, regulatory oversight of ICT providers, creation of national Computer Emergency Response Teams, and mandatory 24/7 points of contact—and by establishing supranational institutions to facilitate prospective cooperation, capacity building, and information-sharing. Future research should explore treaty design for enhancing due diligence standards, empirical assessments of state capacities, and non-state actor routing strategies to inform more coherent and equitable prevention norms in cyberspace.",

        "abstractNote": "This article examines how international legal expertise is mobilized to articulate the scope and meaning of existing norms in light of emerging forms of cyber conflict. Focusing on the Tallinn Manual on Cyberwarfare—an expert report commissioned by NATO—the authors analyze how expert discourse addresses uncertainties inherent in applying the jus ad bellum and jus in bello frameworks of international law to cyber operations. Drawing on interpretive qualitative methods, Kessler and Werner trace the institutional role of expert commissions in constructing “institutional facts” and normative interpretations through analogical reasoning, legal definitions, and contextual factors. They emphasize the dual function of expertise: to absorb uncertainty by formulating analogies such as the International Court of Justice’s “scale and effects” test from Nicaragua, and to produce new indeterminacies by relativizing core legal concepts and exposing fractures among experts. The article highlights the Manual’s invocation of factors like severity, invasiveness, state involvement, and the prevailing political environment to guide assessments of whether cyberattacks constitute prohibited uses of force under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. Although these factors aim to reduce ambiguity, their empirical grounding rests on the intuitions and reputations of individual experts rather than opinio juris of states, raising questions about the legitimacy and authority of such expert-led frameworks. Moreover, the Manual officially records instances of expert dissent on foundational issues—including the qualification of cyber operations as armed attacks, the threshold for applying the laws of armed conflict, and the distinction between international and non-international armed conflict—thereby solidifying uncertainties rather than resolving them. Kessler and Werner argue that legal expertise functions as the strategic management of uncertainty: experts not only interpret law but also co-constitute the problem space by framing cyber threats, selecting analogies, and incorporating risk-based considerations into legal reasoning. This process transforms unstructured uncertainty about cyber operations into structured but contested legal norms, cementing expert authority while institutionalizing indeterminacy. Concluding that the proliferation and specialization of international legal instruments have made legal experts indispensable, the authors call for critical scrutiny of expert commissions in conflict and security law. They suggest further comparative research into how different expert bodies articulate norms amid evolving security challenges and empirical studies on how states incorporate, contest, or resist expert-produced interpretations in their legal positions and policy practices. By situating cybersecurity within broader dynamics of legal fragmentation, professional bias, and the politics of uncertainty, the study sheds light on the co-constitution of legal expertise and cyber conflict in contemporary international relations.",

        "abstractNote": "This article investigates whether the Kampala compromise’s definition of the crime of aggression, as adopted at the 2010 Review Conference and embedded in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC), can be interpreted to encompass state-sponsored cyberattacks, thereby creating a legal deterrent against acts of cyber-aggression. It begins by tracing the decades-long struggle to define aggression in international law, from the Nuremberg Tribunal’s characterization of aggression as the “supreme international crime” through the placeholder in Article 5(2) of the Rome Statute and the Special Working Group on the Crime of Aggression’s negotiations, culminating in the Kampala compromise’s adoption of key terms—\"act of aggression,\" \"manifest violation,\" and the gravity threshold. Employing a doctrinal legal methodology, the study examines the preparatory travaux of the Special Working Group, analyzes emblematic cyber incidents, and reviews post-Kampala state practice, with particular attention to U.S. cyber doctrine and policy documents. The analysis demonstrates that although the Kampala definitions are conventionally grounded in kinetic warfare paradigms, their language can be flexibly construed by ICC judges to cover cyber operations when assessed by their impact on state sovereignty, threat to international peace, and severity of consequences. However, the article identifies significant jurisdictional and political barriers—namely the primacy of the U.N. Security Council in labeling acts of aggression and the stringent threshold for individual criminal responsibility—which render near-term prosecutions for cyber-aggression unlikely. The author warns that expansive U.S. cyber doctrines risk broadening the ambit of aggression to include routine intelligence gathering or defensive counter-intrusions, potentially influencing customary international law ahead of global consensus. Recognizing these limitations, the article argues for complementary measures to deter and address cyber-aggression, including diplomatic engagement, norm-setting initiatives such as the Tallinn Manual and International Telecommunication Union cyber-peace proposals, international standard-setting for secure network infrastructures, cooperative defensive measures, and information-sharing regimes. It further recommends that U.S. policy be recalibrated to balance normative stability with effective deterrence, and that implementation of non-binding guidance precede the eventual application of individual criminal liability. The study concludes by advocating sustained multidisciplinary efforts—legal, diplomatic, and technical—to preemptively curb cyber-aggression and promote a peaceful cyberspace before hostile acts reach the threshold of armed conflict.",

        "abstractNote": "This article examines the evolving nexus of cybersecurity threats, collective defense, and international law within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), assessing whether the Alliance can adapt its policies and capabilities in cyberspace before a major crisis undermines its Article 5 obligations. Drawing on a symposium that integrated three expert presentations—covering operational perspectives on NATO’s Computer Incident Response Capability (NCIRC), the legal framework for cyber operations and collective self-defense, and NATO’s doctrinal and legal responses—the authors employ a qualitative legal-political methodology to synthesize policy documents, consensus-based decision-making processes, and landmark case studies, including the 2007 Estonian cyber attacks and the 2013 PRISM disclosures. Part I outlines NATO’s historical evolution from a Cold War collective defense alliance to a security actor confronting nontraditional threats, highlighting how the Alliance’s principles of sovereignty, nonintervention, and unanimous decision-making shape its cyber defense posture. The analysis traces NATO’s operational responses, notably the establishment and mandate of NCIRC, and identifies three overarching policy approaches: a threat-centric framework emphasizing adaptation of legacy legal norms; a defense-centric stance focusing on building resilient architectures; and a technology-centric orientation privileging capability accumulation without due regard for established legal principles. Part II interrogates a policy shift from the dense legal texture of the threat approach toward a capability-driven model, uncovering constraints imposed by conservative legal interpretations, limited technology sharing among member states, and the absence of agreed rules for proactive or offensive cyber measures. Such constraints risk relegating NATO to a static, reactive ‘‘cyber Maginot Line.’’ The article highlights key legal questions regarding state responsibility, jus ad bellum in cyberspace, and the potential need to revise International Law categories as discussed in the Tallinn Manual. It concludes that, although NATO has made foundational strides in articulating a cyber threat approach and operational structures, without consensus on more dynamic defense and offense capabilities—and willingness to adapt legal frameworks—the Alliance will remain reactive. The authors propose future research on empirical evaluation of member-state technology sharing, development of cyber rules of engagement within NATO’s Nuclear Planning Group model, examination of secrecy’s impact on alliance cohesion, and legal reforms to accommodate cyber contingencies, aiming to enable NATO to lead global cybersecurity cooperation rather than trail behind.",

        "abstractNote": "In “Cyber Responsibility to Protect: Legal Obligations of States Directly Affected by Cyber-Incidents,” Oren Gross develops a comprehensive international legal framework that positions cybersecurity incidents as akin to natural disasters, thereby imposing a duty on directly affected states (DAS) to prevent, mitigate, manage, and recover from cyber-incidents under established principles of international law. Gross begins by mapping the growing centrality and vulnerability of ICT and critical infrastructure systems—including energy, transportation, healthcare, and emergency services—to deliberate or accidental cyber disruptions. He underscores key trends magnifying cyber risk: exponential growth in software complexity, the integration of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition systems into public networks, and the diffusion of cloud computing across multiple jurisdictions. Turning to legal scholarship, Gross observes that extant literature prioritizes the responsibilities of attack-originating actors while largely ignoring the obligations of victim states. To fill this gap, he introduces the concept of a “cyber responsibility to protect” (cyber‐R2P), analogizing DAS duties to the International Law Commission’s (ILC) draft articles on disaster response. Employing doctrinal analysis of treaties, a comparative review of ILC draft provisions, and case-based examination of state practice and domestic laws, he articulates a tripartite timeline of state duty. Before incidents, DAS must implement risk assessments, robust cyber-hygiene protocols, resilience planning, and legislative measures. During incidents, they owe duties to seek and accept external cooperation, facilitate investigations, avoid arbitrary conditions on assistance, and prevent transboundary harm under human rights and environmental law principles. After incidents, states must enact recovery measures, coordinate international assistance, pursue legislative and judicial reforms to prosecute perpetrators, and institutionalize long-term resilience strategies. Gross further addresses challenges in attributing cyber-attacks, assessing post-incident needs, and ensuring quality control of assistance in an environment where affected states may not recognize attacks or accurately gauge damage. He argues that adapting the ILC’s duties to seek, accept, and facilitate assistance—subject to reasonable, non-arbitrary conditions—can balance state sovereignty with global security demands. Gross concludes that operationalizing cyber-R2P will require international consensus on assistance modalities, standard templates for bilateral and multilateral incident response, and empirical evaluation of domestic reforms. By reframing cyber-incidents within an established disaster relief paradigm, this study lays the groundwork for coherent policy, normative development, and legal obligations that bind states to protect both national and global digital infrastructure.",

        "abstractNote": "In The 2014 Sony Hack and the Role of International Law, Clare Sullivan examines the unprecedented cyber operation against Sony Pictures in November 2014, situating the incident within the framework of international law to determine whether state-linked cyberattacks can constitute breaches of sovereignty, use of force, or even armed attacks that justify countermeasures or anticipatory self-defense. Sullivan begins by contextualizing the 2014 hack amid a record number of data breaches in the United States, emphasizing the distinctive ideological motive and scale of damage inflicted by the Guardians of Peace, an actor widely attributed to North Korea. She reconstructs the sequence of events from June 2014 diplomatic protests by Pyongyang over the film The Interview to the eight subsequent data dumps of over 38 million files, which exposed corporate financials, unreleased films, personal employee data, and trade secrets. Employing a doctrinal methodology grounded in the UN Charter, customary international law (notably the Caroline test), state practice, and the Tallinn Manual, Sullivan evaluates U.S. responses, including targeted sanctions under an executive order and reported disruptions to North Korean internet access. She argues that the attack breached U.S. sovereignty by invading protected cyberspace territory and inflicted harm analogous to physical force, thereby creating a lawful basis for proportional countermeasures under international law without resorting to physical violence. She further contends that, given the sustained and threatening nature of the hack, the United States could have invoked anticipatory self-defense because the operation satisfied criteria of necessity and proportionality by posing an imminent threat. Sullivan’s analysis highlights gaps in existing legal norms—such as the lack of clarity on what constitutes proportional cyber countermeasures or the threshold for “armed attack” in cyberspace—and underscores the need for clearer definitions in future legal frameworks. She observes that, while diplomatic and economic sanctions serve as viable tools, cyber operations of this magnitude demand new international legal thinking to deter and defend against state-linked aggression effectively. In concluding, Sullivan calls for further research to refine criteria for cyber sovereignty, the use of force, and legitimate state responses, and for the development of binding norms that balance state security with protection of civilian infrastructure and individual rights in the evolving domain of cyber conflict.",

        "abstractNote": "The advent of increasingly sophisticated cyber attacks has transformed cyberspace into a battleground where nation-states wield computer code as a weapon capable of inflicting physical destruction and destabilizing critical infrastructure. Traditional jus ad bellum principles, which emerged in an era of kinetic warfare, offer scant guidance on when a cyber attack constitutes an unlawful use of force or an armed attack justifying countermeasures under the United Nations Charter. This gap has significant implications for international peace and security, as states struggle to calibrate their strategic and legal responses to digital operations that may cause irreversible harm. Recognizing these challenges, the author sets out to refine the conceptual and doctrinal underpinnings of jus ad bellum in the cyber domain, asking when and under what criteria a cyber operation crosses the threshold into armed conflict. To address this question, the paper adopts a doctrinal methodology grounded in international law scholarship, complemented by analysis of technical cyber security research and case studies of malware campaigns such as Stuxnet and large-scale denial-of-service operations. The author first clarifies definitional ambiguities by contrasting object-based definitions of cyber attack with an instrument-based perspective that emphasizes computer networks as the means by which digital weapons operate. Technical contours—such as malware propagation, reversible versus irreversible damage, attribution difficulties, and the convergence of cyber and physical systems—are examined to inform the legal analysis. Next, the paper critiques leading approaches to assessing cyber attacks under jus ad bellum: instrument-based, target-based, and effects-based models each reveal shortcomings in accommodating the unpredictable scope of malware and the diffuseness of its impacts. Drawing on this critique, the author proposes a novel analytical framework centered on cyber-physical systems, defining an armed cyber attack as one intentionally designed to inflict irreversible disruption or damage on systems that intertwine computing and physical components. This cyber-physical systems approach yields clear criteria: attacks against purely digital targets that are reversible and non-destabilizing do not constitute force, while operations threatening critical infrastructure or causing tangible destruction are deemed armed attacks, thus triggering lawful self-defense. While this framework advances the law’s ability to deter the most dangerous cyber operations and to preserve interstate stability, the author acknowledges practical limitations, including the evidentiary challenges of discerning intent and payload design, as well as the evolving nature of networked technologies that may outpace doctrinal adaptation. The paper concludes by calling for further treaty development and state practice to solidify norms, suggesting future research directions such as refining attribution methodologies, exploring proportionality in cyber countermeasures, and integrating the framework into broader strategic doctrine. By offering an objective, administrable standard that aligns with both legal principles and technological realities, this work aims to guide policymakers and legal practitioners in navigating the complexities of cyber conflict under international law.",

        "abstractNote": "This chapter provides an in-depth examination of the self-help measures available to victim States in response to unlawful, state-sponsored cyber operations under existing international law, focusing on retorsion, countermeasures, and self-defence. It begins by situating these measures within the broader context of the decentralized enforcement of international law, emphasizing that in the absence of a global enforcement authority, self-help remains indispensable for upholding State obligations. The author defines retorsion as lawful but unfriendly acts—such as diplomatic severance, expulsions, travel bans, or economic restrictions—undertaken to signal displeasure while remaining within legal bounds, and contrasts it with countermeasures, which are otherwise unlawful acts rendered lawful as proportionate responses to internationally wrongful acts. The chapter introduces cyber retorsion, illustrating how States may tacitly encourage or tolerate distributed denial-of-service attacks against adversaries, and analyzes landmark case studies including the 2007 Estonia and 2008 Georgia cyber incidents and Operation Ababil against US financial institutions. In the discussion of countermeasures, the author argues that this modality should be the primary tool for victim States, permitting reversible, proportionate sanctions—such as network blocks or asset freezes—and demonstrates how the conditions set forth in the Articles on State Responsibility (notification, proportionality, non-use of force) legitimize cyber countermeasures, particularly given that most cyber intrusions do not meet the armed attack threshold under the jus ad bellum. The self-defence section reviews jus ad bellum criteria, clarifying that only a narrow subset of cyber operations qualify as armed attacks warranting kinetic or forceful responses, and introduces the “accumulation theory” whereby multiple lower-intensity events might collectively constitute an armed attack. It concludes that countermeasures should serve as the default response to state-sponsored cyber operations, reserving self-defence for exceptional scenarios. The chapter further examines emerging State practice—highlighting the United States’ use of public retorsion through sanctions and covert countermeasures following the Sony Pictures hack and the 2016 DNC intrusion—and warns of potential fragmentation of cyber norms after the impasse at the fifth UN Group of Governmental Experts, underscoring the urgent need to clarify cyber law at both the jus ad bellum and jus in bello levels.",

        "abstractNote": "The article addresses the challenge of applying established principles of international law to cyber operations occurring both in peacetime and during armed conflict, highlighting the ambiguity and strategic risks that states face in responding to malicious cyber activities. It emphasizes the significance of clarifying legal frameworks for state responses to harmful cyber operations in the context of rising geopolitical tensions and the prevalence of state-sponsored intrusions, arguing that legal uncertainty may undermine effective deterrence and provoke escalatory dynamics. To address this gap, the author aims to provide government legal advisers and policymakers with a practical analytical roadmap, posing the central question of how to assess cyber incidents against thresholds for self-defense, necessity, and countermeasures, as well as how to interpret targeting rules under international humanitarian law in cyber warfare. Methodologically, the article draws on doctrinal legal analysis grounded in the 154 rules and commentary of Tallinn Manual 2.0, deploying normative legal reasoning and structured flowcharts to translate complex legal norms into a step-by-step vade mecum for practitioners. The first flowchart guides states through the assessment of peacetime cyber operations, delineating criteria for armed attack, self-defense, the plea of necessity, and countermeasures, including attribution, breach of obligation, and proportionality, while the second diagram addresses the classification of cyber activities in armed conflict, covering definitions of attack, target identification, precautions, proportionality, and neutrality obligations. Key findings reveal that although existing international law principles can be applied to cyberspace, their operationalization requires careful parsing of intent, effects, and jurisdictional factors, and that the thresholds for invoking self-defense or countermeasures depend on the severity of harm and immediacy of threat. The article contributes a novel skeleton framework that systematizes the decision-making process, translating abstract rules into actionable steps that can support coherent state practice and strengthen legal deterrence. However, the author acknowledges limitations inherent in this skeletal approach, cautioning that the flowcharts offer only a general vector through a complex legal landscape and may not accommodate every incident’s unique features, and that the nascent state of international cyber law leaves many issues unresolved. For future research, the article underscores the need for empirical studies of state practice and opinio juris to refine legal norms, calls for more granular analysis of emerging gray-zone operations, and suggests that iterative feedback between practice and doctrine will be essential to evolve a robust legal regime governing cyber conflict.",

        "abstractNote": "States increasingly rely on cyberspace for critical communication, economic transactions, and public services, yet the absence of specific international legal norms governing state behavior in this domain has generated uncertainty and risk. This research addresses the urgent problem of how preexisting rules of international law can regulate harmful state-conduct in cyberspace by examining the general concept of due diligence and its applicability to cyber activities. The study is motivated by the significance of securing an open, stable, and rights-respecting cyberspace in contemporary geopolitics, and asks how due diligence obligations under general international law can be specified to govern state behavior before, during, and after cyber incidents. Employing a doctrinal legal methodology, the authors analyse state practice and opinio juris, relevant United Nations Group of Governmental Experts reports, and established principles from analogous fields such as international environmental law. They examine foundational norms from the UN Charter and state sovereignty, and review outcomes from successive Berlin Cyber Conferences organised by the German Federal Foreign Office. The analysis reveals that international law, including the prohibition of the use of force, the right of self-defence, and principles of state responsibility, fully applies to information and communications technology. Due diligence emerges as a minimum standard against which state conduct may be tested, encompassing both substantive measures—such as preventing misuse of cyber infrastructure under jurisdiction—and procedural measures—such as establishing institutional capacities and points of contact for inter-state cooperation. The authors identify context-specific obligations for origin states to prevent and mitigate harmful cyber operations, for transit states to curb malicious traffic passing through their territory, and for target states to enhance resilience of critical infrastructure and share intelligence. They further clarify that due diligence obligations vary with technical feasibility and economic capacity, implying no uniform set of measures is required of all states. The principal contribution of this study lies in articulating a coherent due diligence framework tailored to cyber-conflict contexts and in proposing guidelines for preventive, responsive, and cooperative state actions. Recognising that due diligence is inherently broad, the authors acknowledge limitations including the vagueness of general legal norms and the lack of consensus on harm thresholds that trigger obligations, as well as potential tensions with privacy rights. They caution that until specific treaty regimes emerge, states must navigate these general obligations, balancing freedom, security, and rule-of-law values. For future research, the authors advocate comparative investigation of international environmental law’s treaty development to inform the creation of a specialized cyber treaty regime, empirical study of state capacity constraints, and exploration of institutional models for enhanced inter-state cooperation in cyberspace governance.",

        "abstractNote": "Since 2010, states have confronted the growing challenge of deterring adversarial actions conducted through cyberspace, recognizing that traditional concepts of military deterrence may not readily translate into the digital domain. The United Nations Group of Governmental Experts underscored the need for norms on state behavior in Information and Communication Technologies to reduce collective risk and protect critical infrastructure, framing the debate on cyber conflict as a matter of international security. This article investigates how the United States has pursued a norms-based approach to cyber deterrence, posing the question of whether embedding cyber strategy within a normative framework can enhance stability and restraint among states. By examining official U.S. policy documents—including the 2011 International Strategy for Cyberspace and the Department of Defense’s Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace—alongside theoretical insights from constructivist scholarship on norm emergence and lifecycle, the author employs a qualitative policy analysis methodology enriched by international relations theory and case references to Estonia, Georgia, and the Stuxnet operation. The analysis reveals that while attribution challenges, difficulty in holding adversaries’ assets at risk, and nonstate actor involvement complicate traditional deterrence models, the U.S. norms-based strategy leverages multilateral dialogue and confidence-building measures to socialize expectations regarding acceptable state conduct. This synergy between normative engagement and military capability appears to strengthen general deterrence, imparting predictability to state behaviors and reducing opportunities for miscalculation. The article contributes a conceptual framework that links the stages of norm development—emergence, cascade, and institutionalization—to the potential evolution of norms into binding international law, thereby providing a structure for effective cyber deterrence. It argues that norms can act as “rules of the road” in cyberspace, internalized by actors and reinforced through diplomatic practice, multilateral forums, and state conduct. Notwithstanding these insights, the study acknowledges limitations stemming from the novelty of cyber norms, the uneven participation of states, potential allegations of double standards—especially in light of the U.S. and Israeli Stuxnet operation—and the political mistrust that can hinder consensus. The paucity of empirical data on compliance mechanisms and the unpredictable nature of norm internalization underscore the need for further empirical investigation. Future research should focus on mapping the processes through which specific cyber norms become legally binding, elucidating the mechanisms of compliance, and exploring how confidence-building transparency measures can pave the way for formal international agreements. By advancing an integrated approach to cyber deterrence that combines normative development, international law, and strategic policy, this study offers a novel lens for scholars and policymakers seeking to secure cyberspace through law and shared expectations rather than force alone.",

        "abstractNote": "The evolution of cyberspace as a fifth domain of warfare has outpaced the development of a coherent international legal framework, creating a critical gap in addressing cyber operations that may not constitute armed attacks yet still pose significant threats to states. This article sets forth the problem that international law’s current use of art. 2(4) of the UN Charter and the jus ad bellum and jus in bello frameworks inadequately encompasses “cyber uses of force” and “uses of cyber coercion,” leaving a structural fragility that risks uncontrolled escalation or even a military response to state-sponsored cyber activity. The author justifies this inquiry by pointing to high-profile incidents such as the Sony Pictures operation and Stuxnet that demonstrate both the increasing frequency and escalating destructive potential of cyber operations; the article aims to reconceptualize cyber discourse, define these categories of cyber activity, and propose mechanisms by which the international community can preemptively regulate them. Methodologically, the research employs a doctrinal legal analysis grounded in the Charter of the United Nations, a critical literature review of scholarly definitions of “cyber war,” and a case study examination of the Sony Pictures hack to illustrate the insufficiencies of existing norms and response options. The findings reveal that states have neither expressly nor implicitly extended art. 2(4) to include all cyber operations amounting to force or coercion, that the rhetorical prevalence of terms like “cyber war” may license overly broad national responses, and that most cyber operations fall short of armed attack thresholds yet nonetheless undermine political independence or territorial integrity. As a contribution, the author proposes a novel “Cyber Kellogg–Briand Pact” framework, modeled on the 1928 Pact’s renunciation of war, which would formally define “cyber uses of force” and “uses of cyber coercion,” stigmatize their employment as instruments of policy, clarify lawful countermeasures, and prohibit military responses to coercive cyber operations. The article acknowledges limitations inherent in a treaty analogous to the original Kellogg–Briand Pact, including potential non-signatory states, the exclusion of self-defense parameters, and the challenge of enforcing soft-law commitments; it also recognizes that its doctrinal focus may not capture all technical nuances of cyber capability development. For future research, the author suggests refining the proposed treaty’s parameters to address self-defense, elaborating compliance mechanisms for non-signatories, integrating technical thresholds for destructive potential, and studying the impact of naming and shaming practices on state behavior in cyberspace. This work lays the groundwork for a preventive normative architecture capable of stabilizing state conduct in cyber conflict before a destructive “true event” compels reactive legal development.",

        "abstractNote": "The growing prominence of cyberspace as a domain of state confrontation has catalyzed intense debate over whether and how existing international law governs cyber operations amounting to the use of force. This study examines the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare, a leading expert restatement aiming to apply jus ad bellum norms, particularly Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, to cyber operations. Recognizing that ambiguity persists over whether and how the prohibition on the use of force applies to actions that lack physical destruction or loss of life, the research asks how the Manual’s so-called ‘‘Schmitt criteria’’ should be understood in relation to existing law. It seeks to determine whether these criteria reflect lex lata, propose lex ferenda, constitute new treaty or customary rules, or function merely as political tools influencing state assessments. Employing a doctrinal legal methodology, the article undertakes a close textual analysis of the Manual’s introduction, Rule 11 and commentary, supplemented by key scholarly works and decisional sources. The analysis traces the Manual’s historical lineage from early normative frameworks, through Schmitt’s six criteria, to the Manual’s presentation of eight ‘‘factors’’ states ‘‘are likely to consider’’ when characterizing cyber operations as uses of force. It finds that the criteria lack substantiation in any primary source of international law—treaty, custom or general principles—and that the Manual’s self-professed intent to ‘‘restat[e] the law as it is’’ clashes with its reliance on nonlegal, predictive considerations. Nor does the Manual advocate for treaty formation or customary crystallization, instead depicting the factors as non-binding, context-dependent guides. Yet labeling them political tools overlooks their normative effect: application of the criteria directly influences determinations of state responsibility, reparation, and prospective countermeasures. By conflating ‘‘predictive’’ with ‘‘normative’’ processes, the Manual inadvertently undermines the prescriptive clarity it promises. This critique contributes a systematic typology of possible legal statuses for the criteria and reveals the Manual’s interpretative effort as more than mere law application, occupying a quasi-legislative space that deepens rather than resolves legal indeterminacy. Acknowledging its focus on textual analysis and the limited corpus of state practice available, the article calls for empirical research into how states actually invoke the criteria in diplomatic and legal fora, comparative study of analogous doctrinal evolutions in economic coercion law, and exploration of alternative normative instruments—such as treaties or a cyber-specific dispute resolution mechanism—to address the inherent indeterminacy of Article 2(4) when applied to cyber operations.",

        "abstractNote": "States are increasingly deploying cyber operations as tools of foreign policy, yet debate over the significance of these actions often outpaces empirical evidence. This discrepancy poses a challenge for policy-makers seeking to ground deterrence strategies, norms development, and legal frameworks in factual understanding. Maness and Valeriano address this gap by asking how cyber conflict affects interstate relations and whether different methods and objectives of cyber malice alter conflict-cooperation dynamics. They employ an international relations framework and leverage weekly events data, drawing on the Distributed Cyber Incident Data (DCID) and the Goldstein scale–coded WEIS events to quantify foreign policy responses following cyber incidents. Using a ten-year panel of forty directed dyads and random‐effects regression, their methodology controls for dyadic heterogeneity and temporal trends to isolate the impact of cyber tactics on subsequent cooperative or hostile interactions. The analysis reveals that among various forms of cyber aggression, only distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks produce a statistically significant increase in conflictual behaviors and diminish cooperative exchanges between states. Furthermore, the study identifies that regional powers and those involving the United States exhibit pronounced effects: while most cyber incidents sour relations, Chinese cyber operations targeting the United States elicit primarily diplomatic responses aimed at relationship improvement. These findings challenge prevailing assumptions that cyber conflict uniformly revolutionizes interstate interaction and instead suggest that its impact depends on tactic and target. The authors contribute a novel empirical test of “cyber restraint,” a theory positing that cyber actors face intention-based constraints that condition their effects on foreign policy dynamics. Their work advances scholarly understanding by operationalizing cyber conflict within established international relations metrics and by integrating cyber incidents into models of conflict escalation and cooperation. Constraints acknowledged include limited severity within observed incidents, potential attribution biases inherent in open-source data, and the exclusion of additional variables such as economic sanctions or militarized disputes due to collinearity and data coverage limitations. Maness and Valeriano propose that future research extend temporal and dyadic scopes to incorporate emerging cyber operations, refine normative frameworks through analysis of Track II and United Nations dialogues, and examine the interplay of cyber deterrence and state coercive diplomacy in regions such as Russia–West relations. Their dataset and analytical approach lay groundwork for subsequent investigations into how cyber tools integrate with traditional power projection and influence international legal norm development.",

        "abstractNote": "This Article addresses the growing challenge of cyber attack and cyberwar in state-level conflict and examines the role of deterrence and broader influence strategies in preventing disruptive or destructive cyber operations. The problem centers on the fragility of deterrence by punishment as a basis for strategic thinking about cyber threats, given the unique characteristics of cyber attack, the diversity of threat actors, and the nascent state of international norms and legal frameworks. Recognizing that states and other actors seek stability, resilience, and favorable crisis outcomes in an environment where cyber operations can upset the strategic balance, the author aims to situate deterrence within a larger spectrum of objectives and influence mechanisms, asking whether deterrence alone can be effective against different classes of cyber threats and how it should be complemented by other measures. To answer these questions, the research adopts a conceptual and analytical methodology that combines a critical literature review with the development of a simple cognitive model of deterrence decision-making under varying degrees of rationality. The literature review synthesizes existing scholarship on deterrence, cyberattack, and escalation, while the model provides a structured way to explore how attackers perceive risks and potential gains from initiating cyber operations in different conflict scenarios. The findings reveal that classic deterrence concepts—relying on threat of punishment—are insufficient in the cyber context because of ambiguity in attribution, the rapid pace and technical complexity of cyber operations, and differing actor motivations. The analysis shows that some forms of deterrence by denial and dissuasion by futility may have limited success but cannot replace comprehensive influence strategies. Further, perceptions of escalation ladders and first-strike advantages can create crisis instability, making reliance on deterrence alone dangerous. The Article contributes a reframed vocabulary that distinguishes deterrence from denial and dissuasion, situates deterrence as one element in a multi-dimensional spectrum of influences, and presents a cognitive model to clarify decision drivers for both state and non-state attackers. It also proposes refining the escalation-ladder concept to account for the contextual and technical nuances of cyber operations. The main limitations of this work include its conceptual focus and simplified modeling approach, which may not capture all the empirical variations across different conflict environments and actor types. The Article acknowledges that further empirical validation is needed to calibrate the cognitive model and to assess the real-world effectiveness of proposed influence measures. For future research, the author suggests developing multi-dimensional escalation frameworks, examining the role of social and intellectual norms alongside legal instruments, and conducting case studies to test and refine strategies for deterrence, denial, and broader influence in cyber conflict scenarios.",

        "abstractNote": "This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the applicability and utility of international law for regulating state-led cyberoperations that fall below the jus ad bellum threshold, focusing on Ireland as a representative small state. It begins by situating sub-threshold cyberoperations within a contested international environment marked by divergent state positions and legal uncertainty. While there is broad agreement among states that existing legal frameworks—principally the UN Charter and customary international law—apply to cyberspace, disputes persist over the precise contours of this application and the threshold at which cyber activities constitute an armed attack. The study reviews two parallel United Nations processes—the Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) and the Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG)—and illustrates how geopolitical rivalries have impeded consensus on binding norms, creating exploitable legal lacunae. Against this backdrop, the paper evaluates the role of informal lawmaking fora, notably the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence’s Tallinn Manuals, and non-binding norms adopted in UN GGE reports. Although these instruments lack binding force, they have incrementally shaped state practice and opinio juris by providing shared interpretations of existing law and promoting behavioural expectations. Integrating theories of small state security drawn from Keohane’s Lilliputian model and ‘soft’ security paradigms, the paper argues that small states like Ireland can leverage both formal international law and non-binding norms to enhance cyber deterrence. It proposes that the promotion of legal norms serves as a strategic tool for small states to cultivate collective resilience, impose reputational costs on aggressors, and compensate for their limited coercive capacities. Empirical evidence is drawn from Ireland’s voluntary national contributions to UN processes and Irish cybersecurity strategy documents, forming the basis of an original framework that fuses doctrinal legal analysis with state security paradigms. The paper identifies persistent challenges to the regulation of sub-threshold cyberoperations: the inherently transnational nature of cyberspace, the rapid pace of technological change outstripping doctrinal development, and deeply entrenched geopolitical fault lines that hinder multilateral cooperation. Nevertheless, it concludes that international law, when complemented by non-binding norms and potentially a future cyber treaty, remains an indispensable component of a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy for small states. The author calls for further empirical research into how legal norms influence state behaviour in cyberspace and the mechanisms for solidifying customary law, including more explicit state declarations of adherence to specific legal principles and enhanced participation in norm-building processes.",

        "abstractNote": "In “Sovereignty in Cyberspace: Can It Exist?”, Lieutenant Colonel Patrick W. Franzese undertakes a comprehensive examination of whether and how the foundational principle of state sovereignty can be applied to the digital domain. Drawing from both traditional international law doctrine and comparative analysis of sovereignty regimes in maritime, air, and outer-space domains, the article argues that despite cyberspace’s borderless nature, territorial control is both achievable and necessary. Franzese begins by surveying high-profile cyber incidents, including the 2007 DDoS attacks on Estonia, the 2008 multinational espionage campaign compromising over 1,200 computers worldwide, and clandestine breaches of U.S. military and congressional networks. These case studies underscore the urgent need for a coherent legal framework to govern cyber operations and protect critical infrastructure. Employing a historical-normative methodology, the author distills principles from existing international regimes—such as maritime zones, national airspace, and space treaties—and identifies mechanisms for extending sovereign jurisdiction beyond terrestrial boundaries. Central to this analysis is a detailed breakdown of these regimes’ evolution, illustrating how states translated physical domain sovereignty into codified international law norms. Franzese then addresses four principal challenges to cyber sovereignty: (1) state recognition of cyberspace as a distinct domain requiring legal status; (2) political resistance rooted in normative commitments to online freedom and open networks; (3) protection of civilian privacy and civil liberties; and (4) technical obstacles to actor identification and border control in the digital realm. To overcome these hurdles, the article outlines practical, technology-forward solutions: the issuance of cyber identity credentials akin to Department of Defense common access cards; deployment of biometric authentication at strategic internet gateways; and implementation of “Internet border inspections” to monitor and regulate cross-border IP traffic. These proposals are justified by demonstrating the economic imperative: U.S. Department of Defense cyber defense expenditures exceeded $100 million in a recent six-month period, and potential damages from successful cyberattacks on critical infrastructure could reach billions. The centerpiece of Franzese’s policy prescription is a three-pronged framework: (i) a unilateral U.S. declaration asserting sovereign jurisdiction over its cyberspace, supported by robust border-control measures and clear statements equating cyber aggressors with terrorists; (ii) multilateral treaties obligating states to trace, prosecute, or extradite cyber perpetrators and share forensic capabilities; and (iii) proactive U.S. leadership within the United Nations to codify norms and reciprocal obligations, establish forums for standard-setting, and foster accountability for non-state actors. While acknowledging the limitations—namely the exclusion of in-depth engineering analysis and potential resistance from states unwilling to cede cyber “freedoms”—Franzese contends that technical innovation, diplomatic engagement, and expert convenings can realign national strategies with emerging norms. Ultimately, the article concludes that without a clear sovereignty regime, both states and the international community remain vulnerable to non-kinetic cyber attacks, and that reliance on ad hoc measures is insufficient: hope, he warns, is no substitute for a robust legal and institutional framework governing cyberspace.",

        "abstractNote": "In “Protecting Australian Cyberspace: Are Our International Lawyers Ready?,” Stephen Tully offers a comprehensive multidisciplinary analysis of Australia’s evolving legal and policy frameworks in response to four categories of cyber threat: state-sponsored “cyber war,” inter-combatant “cyber conflicts,” “cyberterrorism,” and “cybercrime.” After defining cyberspace as an interconnected domain of information technology, telecommunications networks, and industrial control systems whose physical elements lie within sovereign territory but whose functionality transcends borders, Tully situates Australia’s response alongside that of leading digital powers, principally the United States and the United Kingdom. He examines how each state has developed offensive and defensive cyber doctrines, integrated military–civilian strategies, and institutional mechanisms—such as Australia’s Cyber Security Operations Centre and engineer training at the Idaho National Laboratory—to deter, detect, and respond to digital incursions. \n\nTully next surveys four distinct legal paradigms. He assesses the applicability of the UN Charter’s prohibition on the use of force (Article 2(4)) to cyber operations, noting both emerging state practice and persistent ambiguity over thresholds of force and attribution. His analysis of international humanitarian law reveals unsettled principles of distinction and proportionality in a borderless digital domain. He then critiques anti-terrorism legislation, demonstrating how definitional disputes over “cyberterrorism” risk overreach, create protracted prosecutions, and threaten civil liberties. Finally, he addresses domestic criminal law enforcement, detailing challenges of jurisdiction, evidence, and the specter of overcriminalization amid a legislative patchwork ill-suited to rapidly evolving technologies. \n\nAcross these regimes, Tully identifies systemic deficiencies: the absence of clear rules of engagement for state conduct in cyberspace, indeterminacy over thresholds of hostilities, the tension between national security imperatives and fundamental rights in counterterrorism, and statutory gaps that both empower prosecution and invite civil-liberties incursions. He argues persuasively for an integrated, multidisciplinary national strategy that harnesses diplomatic initiatives, military doctrine, intelligence cooperation, and law enforcement to forge coherent norms—blending treaty-based prohibitions, humanitarian safeguards, criminal accountability, and military deterrence—capable of deterring malicious actors without stifling innovation. \n\nConcluding that none of the existing paradigms alone suffices to protect critical national infrastructure, Tully calls for Australian international lawyers to contribute empirical research, interdisciplinary norm-development studies, and detailed case studies of state practice. He warns against overregulation, the erosion of privacy through dataveillance, and the dominance of extraterritorial power politics in shaping cyber norms. As Australia prepares its Cyber White Paper, Tully’s work underscores the urgent need for a distinctive national perspective—one that secures cyberspace, upholds the rule of law, and aligns with Australia’s broader security and economic objectives in the digital age.",

        "abstractNote": "Cybersecurity Due Diligence: A Transatlantic Case Study addresses the growing challenge of delineating state obligations to promote cyber peace below an armed attack threshold, exemplified by the 2015 Ukrainian power grid outage, the first known cyberattack to incapacitate an electric grid. The event underscored the need for clear rules of behavior in cyberspace and for states and private actors to fulfill due diligence responsibilities. Recognizing a gap in defining legal and policy regimes for sub-threshold cyber risks, the authors analyze how the United States and the European Union translate cybersecurity due diligence into practice and propose a menu of policy-relevant options. Employing a comparative case study methodology grounded in a polycentric governance framework, the study reviews key U.S. initiatives—including executive orders on private-sector information sharing, the NIST Framework, sector-specific regulations and intelligence assessments—and EU measures such as the NIS Directive, the GDPR, Germany’s BSI strategies, and parliamentary proposals from November 2015. Through systematic legal and policy analysis of legislation, policy documents, stakeholder briefings, and governance structures on both sides of the Atlantic, the authors identify due diligence themes such as tailored frameworks, integrated reporting, information sharing, active defense, risk mitigation, and capacity building. They find that while the U.S. relies on market incentives and federal standards, the EU emphasizes binding directives and private sector accountability, yet both contexts present opportunities for cross-pollination of public and private cybersecurity practices within multilevel governance networks. As a contribution, the article offers policymakers a menu of actionable options to foster a positive vision of cyber peace—one that respects human rights, extends internet access with robust security, and strengthens governance through multi-stakeholder collaboration. The authors acknowledge limitations, noting the lack of systematic data on compliance and enforcement across domestic regulations and the political challenges of implementing certain reforms. They suggest future research should empirically assess compliance and enforcement, expand analysis to additional jurisdictions, evaluate polycentric governance effectiveness, and develop metrics to gauge the impact of due diligence norms on reducing cyber conflict. They illustrate in tabular form how states engage in collaboration, control, enforcement, monitoring, and assessment of critical infrastructure security, and they underscore the importance of leveraging low-hanging fruit such as Australia’s suite of application whitelisting, rapid patching, and privilege minimization measures that reportedly thwart up to 85 percent of attacks. Concluding that an all-of-the-above approach combining tailored frameworks, integrated reporting, information sharing, active defense, risk mitigation best practices, and polycentric partnerships is essential to operationalize cybersecurity due diligence, the authors argue the time is ripe for deeper market engagement and multilateral cooperation given recent legislative developments such as the NIS Directive, GDPR, the Cybersecurity Act of 2015, and FTC enforcement actions. By operationalizing cybersecurity due diligence, this study advances international legal scholarship on cyber peace and offers a practical framework for bridging policy debates and on-the-ground governance.",

        "abstractNote": "The paper addresses the enduring challenge of applying deterrence theory to the digital domain, where sophisticated cyber actors can place critical assets at risk without deploying traditional military force, thereby raising urgent questions about the continued relevance of established deterrence frameworks. In highlighting the gap between nuclear-era deterrence concepts and the unique attributes of cyberspace, the author argues that understanding deterring adversary behavior in this new arena is crucial for maintaining interstate stability and shaping coherent national strategies. The study aims to clarify whether classical rational deterrence models, enriched by cognitive insights, can be adapted for both within-domain cyber signaling and cross-domain coercive threats, ultimately posing the research question of whether cyberspace is fundamentally compatible with deterrence or necessitates a fundamentally new approach. To answer this question, the work undertakes a conceptual and analytical review, first surveying the historical evolution of three waves of deterrence scholarship—from Bernard Brodie’s nuclear-era abstractions through the incorporation of behavioral economics and cognitive psychology—and then mapping those theories onto the tactical, operational, and strategic dimensions of cyberspace. This dual-method methodology combines literature synthesis with domain-specific technical analysis to illuminate how state and sub-state actors assess costs, benefits, and credibility when considering cyber operations. The analysis reveals that deterrence constrained to a single domain heightens risks and can undermine cost-imposing signals, while neglecting cross-domain interactions weakens overall efficacy. The paper finds that within-domain deterrence often fails due to ambiguity in signaling and the inherent complexity of attribution, and that effective coercion in cyberspace requires integrated measures across political, economic, and military tools. Building on these findings, the author contributes a dynamic framework that transcends traditional within-domain deterrence models by advocating an integrated approach to cyber deterrence that incorporates denial strategies, punitive options, and hybrid signals aligned with established interstate deterrence practices. This integrated cyber deterrence model emphasizes the need for combined signaling across multiple domains to generate clear, credible costs to adversaries. Although the theoretical nature of the study limits empirical validation and acknowledges that technical domain understanding is continually evolving, it establishes a foundation for refining national strategies that account for the interconnectedness of cyber and physical domains. The work concludes by outlining the trajectory for future research, including the development of operational guidelines for national cyber deterrence strategies and empirical case studies to test the proposed dynamic model in real-world conflict scenarios, thereby charting a path toward robust policy frameworks that can effectively deter state-sponsored cyber aggression.",

        "abstractNote": "In “Act and Actor Attribution in Cyberspace: A Proposed Analytic Framework,” Mejia identifies attribution—determining who is responsible for a hostile cyber act (actor attribution) and assessing the severity of that act (act attribution)—as the essential first step for states responding to cyber hostility. He contrasts the clear state-on-state aggression of Pearl Harbor with ambiguous 21st-century cyberattacks on U.S. banks to illustrate how uncertainty in either dimension impedes coherent policy, legal, or military responses. Drawing on the UN Charter’s Articles 2(4) and 51 and customary interpretations of Additional Protocol I’s Article 52(2), Mejia reviews how traditional jus ad bellum and jus in bello principles of distinction, necessity, and proportionality apply in cyberspace despite challenges posed by dual-use infrastructure and “knock-on” effects. He explains that cyber infrastructure and prepositioned malicious code are dual-use objects that may qualify as military objectives if they effectively contribute to hostile operations and offers a two-part test—legitimate military objective and definite military advantage—to determine targetability. The author emphasizes that while technical indicators (e.g., IP tracing, malware signatures) are necessary for attribution, they are insufficient without legal expertise to interpret evidence and frame appropriate state responses under international law. Mejia then proposes a structured analytic framework that integrates legal, policy, and strategic considerations into a diagnostic tool: it delineates processes for assessing act severity (from espionage to armed attack), establishes attribution confidence thresholds, and maps response options—diplomatic, law enforcement, intelligence, or military—to combinations of severity and attribution confidence. By clarifying which agency should lead and what type of response (economic sanctions, prosecutions, counterstrikes) is legally justified, the framework promotes consistent decision making and reinforces deterrence by signaling clear consequences tied to act severity. Recognizing limitations—subjectivity inherent in attribution judgments, evolving customary international law, and sophisticated techniques adversaries use to mask identities—Mejia calls for closer integration of legal experts and technical practitioners, investment in advanced forensic capabilities, refinement of severity thresholds in multistate contexts, and empirical validation through war-gaming and crisis simulations. He argues that improving attribution accuracy and structuring responses through his analytic framework will strengthen deterrence, uphold the rule of law in cyberspace, and guide policymakers and military planners toward proportionate and lawful responses to cyber aggression.",

        "abstractNote": "Bradshaw, Raymond, and Shull address the urgent challenge of attributing state-level cyber attacks by integrating technical, legal, and political perspectives and by proposing a rule-based institutional framework to govern state conduct in attribution. Motivated by incidents such as the 2014 tit-for-tat Korean peninsula website disruptions and the 2007 Russian-Estonia cyber campaign, the authors illustrate that attribution is not merely a forensic exercise but a multifaceted problem whose mismanagement risks escalation to kinetic conflict. In the technical domain, they review the capabilities and limits of computer forensics—tracing IP addresses, code signatures, and linguistic markers—as well as the growing role of private actors and CERTs, noting that state and non-state entities exploit proxies and botnets to obscure origins. Legally, they analyze the International Law Commission’s Draft Articles on State Responsibility and key jurisprudence to demonstrate ambiguities in attributing hostile acts when non-state actors operate under state direction, control, or tolerance—highlighting contested thresholds for jus ad bellum and jus in bello. Politically, the authors explore how strategic considerations, domestic audiences, and national reputations shape public attribution decisions, undermining transparency and norm consistency. To address these challenges, they propose a novel, three-pillar framework: (1) clearer legal guidelines articulating attribution thresholds through amendments to existing international instruments; (2) standardized technical protocols—mediated by empowered CERTs—ensuring interoperability of evidence collection and peer validation; and (3) an impartial, cooperative international mechanism—modeled in part on nuclear non-proliferation forums—entrusted with adjudicating contested attributions. They advocate that middle powers such as Canada, Australia, and South Korea lead a transnational learning process, convening policymakers, military experts, academics, and private stakeholders to co-develop best practices and capacity-building programs. Recognizing political reluctance among major powers to cede authority and resource disparities among states, the authors underscore the need for low-cost exchanges, shared technical assistance, and multilevel norm diffusion to foster acceptance and compliance. They conclude by calling for empirical studies on the efficacy of enhanced CERT structures, comparative analyses of national attribution policies, and pilot programs for international adjudication of cyber incidents. By charting a path toward a transparent, rule-based regime for cyber attack attribution, this work aims to reduce misattribution risks, inhibit escalatory spirals, and promote responsible state behavior in cyberspace.",

        "abstractNote": "In “Anti-social networking: crowdsourcing and the cyber defence of national critical infrastructures,” Chris W. Johnson investigates how social media technologies have reshaped state-level cyber-attacks, exacerbating the longstanding “attribution problem” while simultaneously offering new avenues for defence. Drawing on action-research engagements and case studies involving Estonia (2007), Belarus (2008), Lithuania (2008), Georgia (2008), China (2009), and the Stuxnet attack (2010), Johnson identifies four distinct roles of social networks in cyber-conflict. First, attackers harness online communities to crowdsource distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) campaigns, disseminating malware, coordinating target selection, and mobilizing participants through appeals on social platforms. Second, social media profiles and interpersonal connections enable spear-phishing, whereby attackers exploit trust relationships—sending malicious attachments or links that appear to originate from legitimate contacts—to breach critical infrastructure networks. Third, social-network–related service models facilitate “disposable” command-and-control architectures; by embedding C2 servers within cloud and social environments, attackers obscure ownership and operation, hindering forensic traceability. Finally, states have tacitly exploited or tolerated criminal botnet networks cultivated via social media to conduct covert operations against third-party infrastructures. Through confidential interviews with military, intelligence, telecom, and critical-infrastructure stakeholders, supplemented by forensic analyses and provider data, Johnson reconstructs how these tactics unfolded in each case: how Estonia’s web-based banking and national services endured over 120 DDoS incidents; how Radio Free Europe, Lithuanian parliamentary sites, and Georgian government portals suffered politically motivated outages; how Chinese dissident and government targets were surveilled or attacked under the guise of GhostNet and other campaigns; and how Stuxnet leveraged peer-to-peer and cloud services to damage Iranian enrichment centrifuges. Building on these insights, the paper proposes a five-stage strategic roadmap for national cyber-defence that leverages social media positively: (1) proactive monitoring of social platforms to identify emerging hacktivist coordination and intersections with criminal networks; (2) systematic risk assessment through public–private partnerships, mapping vulnerabilities revealed by social-media intelligence; (3) dissemination of community-focused early warnings via specialised social channels (e.g., WARPs), accompanied by drills to ensure responsive action; (4) enhanced forensic readiness through real-time anomaly detection and social-sourced data in incident response; and (5) institutionalising lessons learned—sharing anonymised, cross-sector incident reports to counter misinformation and stimulate continuous resilience improvements. Johnson acknowledges limitations, including potential positivist bias from his dual role as researcher-practitioner and restricted access to certain state data, and calls for future work on automated social-media analytics, standardised cross-sector threat-reporting protocols, empirically validating community-based exercises, and refining legal frameworks to balance transparency and security. This multidisciplinary analysis advances understanding of how social networking both amplifies and mitigates state-sponsored cyber threats, offering policymakers and infrastructure operators actionable guidance to deter, detect, and recover from sophisticated attacks.",

        "abstractNote": "Since the early 2000s, the rapid expansion of global Internet connectivity and dependence has introduced new vulnerabilities—and with them, urgent questions about how states and other actors can effectively deter or dissuade malicious cyber operations. In “Deterrence and Dissuasion in Cyberspace,” Joseph S. Nye Jr. surveys the conceptual and policy challenges of applying traditional deterrence theory to cyber threats. After reviewing the evolution of deterrence thought and its Cold War origins, Nye argues that nuclear analogies mislead more than illuminate cyberspace dynamics. He identifies four complementary mechanisms for cyber deterrence and dissuasion: punishment (threats of retaliation across or beyond the cyber domain), denial (strengthening defenses and resilience to raise adversary costs), entanglement (economic and infrastructural interdependence that alters cost–benefit calculations), and normative taboos (stigmatizing certain cyber practices through law and shared expectations). Each mechanism operates differently against major state actors, small states, and nonstate entities: attribution challenges often blunt punitive threats against advanced persistent threats, while defensive denial can better deter less capable actors; entanglement has little leverage against isolated regimes but remains potent against integrated economies; and norms shape behavior most effectively among states seeking international legitimacy. Nye emphasizes that cyber deterrence need not be confined to in-domain, cyber-only responses, and that effective strategy must integrate cross-domain instruments. He also examines ambiguities in defining “use of force,” the difficulty of attribution, and the gaps in international law, highlighting the lack of consensus on thresholds for armed attack in cyberspace. Nye surveys policy debates within NATO and U.S. doctrine, noting official commitments to respond by any necessary means, subject to international law and proportionality. While peacetime deterrence has relied heavily on denial and normative restraint, the author acknowledges uncertainties surrounding wartime escalation, crisis stability, and the offense–defense balance. Looking ahead, Nye calls for empirical research on cyber crisis dynamics, intra-war deterrence, and the impact of emerging technologies on attribution and defense. He concludes that cyber deterrence is neither impossible nor uniform: it depends critically on who is being deterred, by what means, and in what context. Recognizing the diversity of cyber threats—from espionage and sabotage to full-scale attacks—policymakers must adopt a multidimensional approach that goes beyond punishment to incorporate defense, interdependence, and normative frameworks.",

        "abstractNote": "This article by Jon R. Lindsay investigates the persistent pessimism in policy debates over the feasibility of deterring cyberattacks, attributing it largely to the deep-seated attribution problem and the prevailing assumptions about offense–defense dynamics in cyberspace. Lindsay observes that while traditional deterrence theory distinguishes deterrence by denial (defensive measures that prevent a successful attack) from deterrence by punishment (threats of retribution following a successful attack), both strategies are thought to falter in cyberspace. Defensive denial seems inadequate because attackers can exploit vulnerabilities faster than defenders can patch them, and deterrence by punishment founders on the inability to reliably trace attacks to their authors. The widespread failure to deter low-value, anonymous intrusions reinforces doubts about deterrence, yet Lindsay argues that these failures do not preclude successful deterrence of high-value targets. He contends that the political context—specifically the value of the target and the scale-dependent costs of exploitation, attribution, and retaliation—fundamentally shapes the offense–defense balance, often undermining conventional wisdom that cyberspace inherently favors offense.\n\nLindsay develops a rationalist international relations framework to integrate attribution uncertainty into deterrence theory. He presents a formal one-shot game-theoretic model in which an attacker chooses whether to exploit a target of value v at cost c1 and risk of punishment, and a defender chooses whether to retaliate at cost c2. Crucially, uncertainty about the defender’s valuation and retaliation costs is modeled via a probabilistic attribution function that depends on scale, and both cost parameters scale with target value according to empirically plausible functions. The model demonstrates that for low-value targets, attackers benefit from deception and low reconnaissance costs, leading defenders to underinvest in attribution and deterrence remains largely ineffective. However, as target value grows, the attack becomes more complex and costly, reconnaissance must be more thorough, and defenders have both greater political will and more resources to bear the costs of attribution and punitive response. Paradoxically, relative attribution costs can decline with scale, making attribution and thus deterrence by punishment more credible for high-value targets.\n\nThe model yields a U-shaped curve of deterrence effectiveness: minimal for low-value targets, rising sharply at higher values where state-level actors can credibly threaten retaliation, and potentially declining again at extreme values if retaliation costs escalate. These insights reconcile the empirical patterns of incessant low-level cybercrime and industrial espionage with the relative scarcity of sophisticated attacks on truly vital systems. Lindsay illustrates this with historical examples—from the trivial but endemic malware-driven breaches affecting ordinary networks, to the precisely calibrated Stuxnet operation against Iran’s nuclear program, where the United States and Israel invested heavily in reconnaissance, maintained secrecy for years, and relied on their unrivaled capacity for attribution and cross-domain retaliation to deter Iranian reprisal.\n\nBeyond the formal model, Lindsay highlights that anonymity and deception in cyberspace exacerbate traditional bargaining failures—information asymmetries and commitment problems—but these constraints are scale-dependent rather than absolute. He argues that policy should reflect this nuance: rather than pursuing unverifiable, universal norms or focusing solely on defensive denial, states should accept some degree of low-level cyber aggression as the “necessary price” for maintaining credible deterrence of high-stakes attacks. Policymakers should invest selectively in attribution capabilities, refine cross-domain punishment options, and distinguish between denial strategies appropriate for everyday threats and punitive retaliation reserved for attacks surpassing a political threshold. By embedding attribution uncertainty within established IR concepts, the article offers a multidisciplinary lens that integrates technological realities and political incentives, guiding more targeted and realistic cyber policy, especially regarding the credible deterrence of state-level cyber aggression.",

        "abstractNote": "In “The Politics of Attributing Blame for Cyberattacks and the Costs of Uncertainty,” Marcus Schulzke explores how pervasive uncertainty around the origins of cyberattacks constrains democratic accountability, shapes public opinion, and empowers narrow elite frames to define security threats and appropriate responses. Drawing on the unique technical characteristics of cyber conflict—such as indirect routing through third‐party servers, the “many‐hands” problem in software development, and lengthy, resource‐intensive forensic investigations—Schulzke argues that attributional uncertainty is more than a technical challenge for cybersecurity professionals and policymakers. Instead, it is a profound political issue that undermines citizens’ ability to evaluate government actions, to update causal beliefs as new evidence emerges, and to resist conspiratorial narratives. Through detailed case studies of U.S. allegations of Chinese and Russian state‐sponsored hacking, North Korea’s disputed intrusion into Sony Pictures Entertainment, and the Solar Sunrise virus incident of 1998, the paper illustrates how initial attributions—often based on circumstantial or fragmentary evidence—rapidly become entrenched in public discourse. These early blame assignments persist in “feedback loops” fueled by elite framing and media speculation, defying correction even when subsequent investigations produce contradictory findings. Schulzke synthesizes insights from political science research on blame attribution, framing effects, and information processing to show that when citizens confront ambiguous evidence, they default to familiar enemy tropes or conspiratorial explanations, deepening public misunderstanding and polarizing attitudes toward cybersecurity policies. Such dynamics impede democratic oversight by obscuring the link between decision‐makers’ crisis responses—whether diplomatic measures, deterrence strategies, or legislative reforms—and the threat actors they are intended to address. The author warns that attributional uncertainty allows opportunistic elites to exploit public fear, justifying aggressive or ill‐defined policy agendas while stifling critical debate. To counter these risks, Schulzke calls for interdisciplinary research combining digital forensics, public opinion surveys, controlled experiments on framing effects, and educational initiatives to enhance digital literacy. He advocates for transparent, standardized forensic methodologies and publicly accessible reporting to narrow uncertainty windows and empower citizens with more reliable information. By politicizing the attribution problem beyond elite circles and linking forensic complexity to mass opinion dynamics, this paper underscores both the urgent need to reduce uncertainty in cyber conflict and the value of reinforcing democratic accountability in responses to emerging security threats.",

        "abstractNote": "This article develops a comprehensive, process-based model for attributing responsibility for cyber incidents when they escalate into the realm of state-level conflict and security decision-making. Departing from existing technical and legal attribution frameworks, it distinguishes between two parallel processes—an apolitical criminal justice process focused on individual perpetrators, and a politically charged national security process centered on adversary identity and state sponsorship. The study identifies five key determinants that politicize attribution: the profile of the target (particularly its political nature or threat to critical national infrastructure and intellectual property), the severity and scale of damage inflicted, the apparent origin of the instigator, the technical means employed in the attack, and any public claims by political actors. Through a comparative conceptual analysis of seminal attribution models from computer science and political science and illustrative case studies of the Aramco Shamoon attack and the Sasser worm incident, the article shows how each determinant imposes distinct constraints and evidentiary standards. In criminal settings, attribution hinges on the rigorous collection and analysis of digital evidence to satisfy high judicial proof thresholds, with formal investigations led by law enforcement and judiciary bodies. Conversely, in national security contexts, attribution decisions rely on intelligence rather than formal evidence, are made within executive bodies, and reflect broader political judgments about foreign relations, deterrence strategies, and diplomatic consequences. The proposed dual-process model reframes attribution as an inherently political endeavor when certain criteria are met, guiding policymakers on when to involve executive decision-makers, calibrate evidentiary thresholds appropriately, and manage potential diplomatic fallout. Acknowledging the model’s theoretical nature and the need for empirical validation, the study recommends future research to apply the framework to a wider range of historical and contemporary cyber incidents, to develop quantitative indicators for the five determinants, and to explore interactions between evolving international norms, legal frameworks, and political attribution processes.",

        "abstractNote": "As cyberspace has evolved into a recognized warfighting domain, policymakers and security experts have debated the applicability of Cold War deterrence theory to hostile cyber activities targeting critical infrastructure. This paper examines whether traditional concepts of deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial can effectively dissuade adversaries—ranging from lone hackers and hacktivists to organized criminal groups and state-sponsored cyber units—from conducting destructive operations. Grounded in a conceptual policy analysis, the study synthesizes official U.S. government strategy documents, strategic deterrence theory, and illustrative cases such as Stuxnet and historical nuclear deterrence episodes. It demonstrates that the success of nuclear-era deterrence depended on clear attribution, credible calibrated retaliation, and mutually recognized thresholds of unacceptable behavior, conditions fundamentally undermined in cyberspace by attribution challenges, actor multiplicity, and opaque signaling mechanisms. Deterrence by punishment in cyberspace falters because states cannot reliably identify or retaliate proportionally against every malicious intrusion, nor can they sustain repeatable punishments across a diverse threat landscape; deterrence by denial is constrained by adversaries’ rapid tactical evolution and persistent exploitation of basic security lapses. The analysis further argues that cyber deterrence strategies presuppose rational adversaries with assets of value; yet many cyber actors—including hacktivists or cells with diffuse structures—and closed regimes with minimal online footprints lack both treaty-based incentives and clear assets to deter. By dissecting the axioms of attribution, repeatability, and strategic success, the author contends that pre-emptive or retaliatory cyber strikes are impractical for achieving lasting stability and risk provoking escalation through misinterpretation. Instead, the study reframes strategic emphasis toward robust cyber defense postures, adaptive security controls, accountability frameworks, and performance monitoring. It highlights industry best practices, including the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s guidance on agile threat awareness and response, and the SANS Institute’s Critical Security Controls, as essential measures to reduce systemic vulnerability. Recognizing limitations inherent in theoretical modeling and reliance on open sources, the paper calls for empirical validation of deterrence metrics, development of advanced attribution technologies to strengthen credible signaling, and dynamic policy frameworks that integrate rigorous compliance standards. Ultimately, the author concludes that cyber deterrence, as currently conceptualized, is illusory; states should prioritize continuous defensive improvement, stakeholder accountability, and resilience to navigate cyberspace’s shifting threat environment.",

        "abstractNote": "In “The Limits of Deterrence Theory in Cyberspace,” Mariarosaria Taddeo critically examines the applicability of traditional deterrence theory—originating in the context of kinetic warfare and nuclear standoffs—to the unique domain of cyber conflict. Acknowledging the growing reliance of states and non-state actors on cyber operations and the concomitant risks of escalation, Taddeo argues that fundamental differences between kinetic and cyber domains undermine the core assumptions of classical deterrence: clear attribution, credible threat of punishment, and controllable retaliation. Through a conceptual analysis grounded in international relations theory, philosophy of technology, and strategic policy documents, she unpacks the three core elements of deterrence theory—attribution, defense and retaliation strategies, and signaling—and contrasts how each element functions in cyberspace. Deterrence theory’s minimalist model (DM), based on rational choice assumptions and six key conditions adapted from Morgan’s framework, presumes a bilateral kinetic conflict in which actors can reliably identify adversaries, signal intentions, and execute punitive measures that are proportionate and controllable. In cyberspace, however, low barriers to entry, multiplicity of actors, dynamic threat landscapes, and pervasive ambiguity hinder precise attribution, expose signaling to misattribution and capability leaks, and complicate proportional responses. Taddeo distinguishes between general signaling—as when states publicly declare cyber strategies for reputational deterrence—and tailored signaling, which seeks to threaten specific adversaries but risks revealing sensitive capabilities or targeting the wrong actor. She contends that while general deterrence posturing may remain feasible for established powers, tailored signaling in cyberspace faces intractable trade-offs between credibility and secrecy, thereby weakening coercive leverage and raising risks of inadvertent escalation. Taddeo concludes that uncritical analogies between kinetic and cyber deterrence must be abandoned in order to develop a domain-specific theory of cyber deterrence. Such a theory must address the conceptual redefinition of violence, harm, and political power in cyberspace, confront normative gaps in extending just war principles and individual rights protections to cyber operations, and resolve regulative ambiguities in applying international humanitarian law to non-kinetic conflicts. She outlines future research directions focused on integrating conceptual, normative, and regulatory dimensions to craft deterrence strategies that are ethically sound, legally compliant, and effective in maintaining international stability in the cyber-enabled era.",

        "abstractNote": "This report by Davis et al. addresses the critical gap in credible, transparent attribution of state and non-state cyber operations and proposes the establishment of an independent Global Cyber Attribution Consortium to enhance international accountability. The authors begin with a review of high-profile incidents such as the Bangladesh Central Bank heist and Democratic National Committee intrusion, highlighting inconsistencies in evidentiary standards, naming conventions, and the fragmentation of attribution practices across intelligence agencies, private cybersecurity firms, and academic researchers. Public skepticism towards attribution findings often stems from opaque decision-making processes, undisclosed analytical methods, and divergent thresholds for evidence. Drawing on a comparative analysis of existing multilateral organizations and investigative protocols in analogous domains—ranging from the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts to joint law-enforcement task forces—the report identifies key governance principles that underlie legitimacy: multistakeholder oversight, peer review, standardized procedures, and tiered reporting mechanisms. \n\nThe authors assess the principal barriers to credible attribution, including political resistance due to state sovereignty concerns, the reluctance to share sensitive intelligence, and the absence of shared norms for evidence adjudication. They then present a conceptual blueprint for a consortium composed of government, industry, and civil society representatives, underpinned by a charter defining procedural rules, evidentiary requirements, and confidentiality safeguards. Core features include an independent secretariat, a peer-reviewed adjudication panel, and a public register of attribution reports with tiered disclosure levels balancing transparency and operational security. The consortium’s mandate would extend to standardizing metadata taxonomies, convening annual stakeholder workshops, and liaising with regional bodies to build cooperative networks. \n\nWhile acknowledging limitations—such as the lack of empirical validation of the consortium model and potential non-participation by powerful states—the report outlines a research agenda to pilot evidentiary frameworks in controlled exercises, legal analyses on state consent and liability, and policy dialogues to refine the governance architecture. Ultimately, the proposed consortium represents an innovative, multidisciplinary policy mechanism aimed at bolstering trust in cyber attribution, reinforcing norms of responsible state behavior, and deterring malicious activity through credible accountability pathways.",

        "abstractNote": "In “Information Warfare?: The Case for an Asian Perspective on Information Operations,” Alan Chong argues that Western conceptions of information warfare (IW), characterized as a strategic revolution with five defining features and rooted in liberal democratic ideology, inadequately capture the full strategic breadth of information-based conflict. Drawing on qualitative comparative analysis of contemporary cyber conflict case narratives—such as the 2007 Estonian DDOS attacks, Stuxnet’s covert sabotage of Iran’s nuclear infrastructure, the 2012 Shamoon data-wiping assault on Saudi Aramco, and the alleged activities of China’s PLA Unit 61398—alongside classical strategic texts by Sun Tzu, Mao Zedong, and Vo Nguyen Giap, Chong develops a novel framework of generic features for an Asian model of information operations (IO). He distinguishes IW as the use of symbolic resources to penetrate an adversary’s secrecy and confidence primarily in wartime and military contexts, whereas IO encompasses a seamless continuum of symbolic, diplomatic, and civilian efforts serving political objectives across both peacetime and wartime. Chong identifies key characteristics of the Asian IO model, including the intentional cultivation of attributional ambiguity to exploit cyberspace’s ‘safe havens,’ the systematic targeting of an adversary’s will through symbolic paralysis, and the integration of psychological operations, military deception, and public diplomacy within a unified strategic concept. He argues that Asian traditions, informed by the pre-digital wisdom of Sun Tzu’s emphasis on deception and intelligence, Mao’s holistic view of protracted people’s war, and Giap’s guerrilla strategies, treat information as a continuous political instrument rather than a compartmentalized military adjunct. The study highlights how these Asian IO features diverge from American paradigms that strictly separate wartime from peacetime information efforts and emphasize technological superiority. Chong’s framework broadens the strategic field beyond Western universalism, enriching policy debates on deterrence, international norms, and the legal thresholds of cyber engagement. The author acknowledges limitations inherent in selective textual interpretation of exemplar cases and classical treatises without extensive empirical validation. He calls for future research to empirically test the proposed Asian IO framework through systematic analysis of national cyber doctrines, examine its normative implications under international law and state responsibility, and integrate additional non-Western strategic traditions to refine guidelines for policy, diplomacy, and high-level cyber strategy development.",

        "abstractNote": "This article examines the evolving regime of international law governing State conduct in cross-border cyber operations and articulates a unified framework for State obligations in cyberspace. Beginning with the challenge posed by cyber incidents such as alleged Russian cyber tools against Estonia and Chinese-linked intrusions into U.S. networks, the author frames the normative gap created by the transboundary nature of cyber activities and the difficulty of timely attribution. Employing a doctrinal methodology grounded in treaty analysis, State practice, customary international law, and jurisprudence from international tribunals, the study addresses three core questions: (1) What legal duty do States have to resolve cyber disputes peacefully? (2) To what extent must States monitor and control cyber infrastructure under their jurisdiction to prevent transboundary harm? (3) How do established principles—due diligence, precautionary principle, due regard, and duty to cooperate—apply to cyber operations? Under Articles 2(3), 2(4), and 33–38 of the UN Charter, the paper confirms that States are obligated to settle disputes threatening international peace and security through peaceful means of their choice, a principle reinforced by General Assembly resolutions and ICJ decisions. It further identifies an emerging obligation of due diligence requiring States to monitor networks and prevent misuse of infrastructure within their territory or exclusive control. Although conceptualizations of the precautionary principle and due regard lack uniform clarity, treaty provisions and judicial opinions increasingly recognize these norms as precursors to state responsibility for transboundary cyber harm. Finally, the article highlights an obligation to cooperate in investigations and mitigation—grounded in the UN Charter and instruments such as the European Cybercrime Convention—and recommends that future research delineate thresholds for applying due diligence and precaution in cyberspace while exploring institutional mechanisms to enhance international cooperation and norm development. This synthesis of disparate legal norms offers policymakers and jurists a coherent framework to guide State behavior in cyber conflict scenarios and identifies limitations arising from nascent State practice and attribution challenges.",

        "abstractNote": "In “Keeping Cool: Steps for Avoiding Conflict and Escalation in Cyberspace,” Roger Hurwitz addresses the growing risks of miscalculation and unintended escalation in international cyber operations, arguing that without concrete political and strategic measures, such conflicts could spill over into kinetic warfare and undermine both global stability and the open Internet. Grounded in a qualitative, conceptual framework informed by game‐theoretic reasoning and detailed case studies—most notably the 2007 Estonia DDoS attacks and deliberations of the U.N. Group of Governmental Experts—the paper maps the institutional and diplomatic landscapes within which states may pursue deterrence, attribution, and response in cyberspace. Hurwitz identifies critical challenges: the absence of agreed red lines for use of force in cyberspace, ideological fissures among major powers that stall consensus on norms, attribution difficulties that weaken deterrence, and the inherently multi‐actor, multi‐equilibrium nature of cyber strategic interactions that complicate decision‐making. To overcome these obstacles, he proposes a structured framework of seven strategic options: (1) delaying responses to enable robust forensic attribution and thereby strengthen the credibility of proportional retaliation; (2) leveraging extracyber venues such as WTO dispute settlement and mutual legal assistance treaties to pursue redress without resorting to offensive or kinetic measures; (3) expanding and negotiating binding legal instruments—including multilateral conventions and bilateral agreements—to cover cyber investigations and cross‐border cooperation; (4) enlisting respected third‐party verifiers—from academic and private cyber researchers to international certification authorities—to “name and shame” attackers and mediate disputes; (5) harnessing diplomatic, economic, and rhetorical tools within established international orders to impose sanctions or incentives that dissuade aggression; (6) adopting confidence‐building measures, including information sharing among national CERTs and multilateral norm dialogues, to reduce mistrust and misperception; and (7) applying rhetorical disarmament to frame cyber incidents in economic or criminal terms rather than military threats, thereby biasing policy responses toward non‐escalatory options. The study illustrates these recommendations with examples—from NATO’s diplomatic support for Estonia to proposals for invoking WTO security exceptions against intellectual property theft—demonstrating how existing institutions can be repurposed for cyber conflict management. Hurwitz acknowledges limitations, including states’ reluctance to cede sovereignty, uneven institutionalization of cyber governance, persistent attribution challenges, and the complex payoffs of multi‐actor strategic environments. He calls for future empirical research on the effectiveness of confidence‐building measures, design of binding international legal instruments for cyber investigations, development of scalable multilateral forums for norm enforcement, and refinement of multi‐player game‐theoretic models to capture evolving state and non‐state interactions. By articulating politically feasible steps for conflict avoidance and escalation management, this paper contributes a comprehensive policy toolkit aimed at preserving international security and the integrity of the global Internet in an increasingly contested cyber domain.",

        "abstractNote": "Ashley Deeks’s article “The Geography of Cyber Conflict: Through a Glass Darkly” provides a rigorous doctrinal analysis of how the longstanding “unwilling or unable” test from the law of neutrality and jus ad bellum can be adapted and applied to high-intensity cyber armed attacks originating from neutral or non-hostile States. Deeks begins by recalling the historical roots of the test in neutrality law, which permits a victim State to use force in self-defense against non-State actors operating from the territory of a territorial State that is either unwilling or unable to suppress the threat. She then introduces cyber-specific nuances through hypothetical case studies, most notably an Israeli scenario in which Hezbollah conducts a debilitating cyber attack on Israeli military networks via servers in Turkey. Unlike kinetic operations, cyber attacks unfold at digital speed, generate complex attribution issues, risk wide collateral effects on civilian infrastructure, and place a premium on the victim State’s technological capacity to stop ongoing attacks. Deeks dissects these distinctive factors, showing that urgency demands rapid yet careful determinations of a territorial State’s technological ability and political will, while concerns over collateral damage heighten the incentive for precise legal thresholds. She further explores the territorial State’s dilemma: if it wishes to avoid extraterritorial self-help measures, it must disclose enough of its defensive cyber capabilities or consent to limited cross-border remediation—actions that implicate sensitive intelligence equities. Deeks juxtaposes this normative inquiry with U.S. interagency practice, revealing a cautious, precautionary approach embodied in classified legal memoranda and policy debates. U.S. decision makers emphasize stringent legal review, adherence to consent principles, reputational considerations, and reciprocal implications for future State practice. This approach, she argues, seeks to avoid the diplomatic fallout and unintended escalations that could arise from ad hoc cyber self-defense measures. While affirming the continued viability of the “unwilling or unable” test in cyberspace, Deeks highlights its reliance on evolving State practice and calls for more empirical research. She urges compilation of actual State invocations of the test, development of clear procedural protocols for timely determinations of territorial State willingness and capacity, and study of lower-threshold cyber operations to refine the applicability of self-defense doctrines. In doing so, Deeks offers a conceptual framework that balances the imperatives of self-defense, technological realities, and sovereign equality, thus contributing to the development of a coherent international legal architecture for managing cyber conflict in the digital age.",

        "abstractNote": "This article addresses the normative lacuna in international law governing countermeasures against low-intensity cyber operations, a category of state and non-state behaviour that falls below the thresholds of armed attack yet inflicts material damage, loss of functionality, or human injury. Grounded in a doctrinal analysis of primary and secondary rules of international law, the study traces the genealogy of ‘countermeasures’ from early reprisals jurisprudence, including the Naulilaa arbitration, through modern codifications in the International Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility (ARSIWA) and the Tallinn Manual. Part I situates countermeasures within the law of international responsibility, distinguishing them as peaceful, proportionate reprisals under Article 50 ARSIWA, requiring a prior internationally wrongful act, an unsatisfied demand for reparation, and strict proportionality to the original breach. Part II examines standards of attribution for low-intensity cyber operations, applying ILC criteria and state practice to hold States and responsible non-state actors to account. Part III explores the scope of proportionality in cyber countermeasures, emphasizing the need to calibrate responses to the scale and effects of the initial wrongful act. Part IV analyzes third-State countermeasures and the unintended impacts of cyber reprisals on uninvolved States and individuals. It concludes that while Article 48 ARSIWA permits collective countermeasures against breaches of obligations owed to the international community, no clear practice supports forcible reprisals by third parties outside collective self-defence or UN Security Council authorizations. The article further highlights how countermeasures may injure third States and individuals—raising extraterritorial human rights and diplomatic protection issues—and explains that liability for incidental harms persists despite the exonerating effect of countermeasures vis-à-vis the primary offender. The author argues for full legal recognition of forcible reprisals under the primary use-of-force regime and for explicit integration of non-state actors within the international responsibility framework. Acknowledging doctrinal limitations amid evolving cyber practices, the study calls for future research to clarify the status of reprisals as lawful uses of force, to develop attribution principles for non-state actors, and to better understand the technical and legal parameters of third-party and individual harms in the interconnected cyber domain.",

        "abstractNote": "This article examines how the foundational principles of the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC) governing the protection of civilians have failed to adapt to the unique characteristics of cyber operations, thereby exposing non-state-affiliated civilian actors to prolonged and uncertain risk of lawful targeting or allegations of war crimes. Drawing upon a doctrinal legal analysis of the Geneva Conventions, Additional Protocol I, customary international law instruments (including the Lieber Code and the 1868 Declaration of St. Petersburg), and the Tallinn Manual’s interpretive guidance, the author distinguishes between state-affiliated civilian actors—who generally understand their risk of direct targeting and collateral damage—and non-state-affiliated civilians whose participation in cyber hostilities often occurs without clear legal status or temporal constraints. The paper details how traditional LOAC protections for civilians lose clarity when applied to cyberspace’s anonymity, attribution difficulties, and delayed effects, such that a cyber operation initiated by a civilian may trigger a legally justified targeting window that persists long after the actor has ceased participation. This temporal uncertainty is compounded by divergent state practices: some states may prioritize direct targeting under LOAC over domestic criminal prosecutions, while civilians face the alternative of possible criminal liability should they self-identify to terminate their lawful targeting status. To address this gap, the author proposes transplanting a renunciation mechanism from the Model Penal Code into a cyber LOAC framework: by formally notifying the attacked state of their cessation of hostile cyber activities, civilians could extinguish the causal link that sustains their status as lawful targets. The framework balances states’ need for certainty with civilians’ right to protection, yet the author acknowledges that adoption may incur adverse side-effects, including domestic prosecution risks and states’ reluctance to bind themselves to a formal renunciation clause. The article concludes by calling for multilateral consensus on defining direct participation in hostilities in cyberspace, standardized attribution and temporal standards, and the integration of renunciation procedures into international LOAC instruments to safeguard civilians while maintaining accountability for cyber hostilities.",

        "abstractNote": "Nicholas Ott’s 2017 article “Conflict in Cyberspace: How International Legal Norms Can Reduce Military Escalation in Cyberspace” examines the transformative role of cyber operations in statecraft and the enduring challenge of regulating offensive military activities in cyberspace under public international law. Recognizing that the United Nations formally acknowledged cyberspace conflict as a serious global concern in 2013, Ott argues that while most states concede the applicability of existing jus ad bellum and jus in bello principles to cyber operations, persistent disputes over core concepts such as “use of force” and “armed attack,” coupled with technical obstacles to reliable attribution, impede treaty-based regulation of military cyberspace activity. Through qualitative policy analysis of UN Group of Governmental Experts reports (2013, 2015), the Tallinn Manual, and regional proposals from the OSCE, ASEAN, and European Parliament, Ott identifies two pathways for risk reduction below the treaty threshold: the codification of legal norms through state practice and the deployment of confidence-building measures (CBMs) to foster shared expectations and crisis communication. He highlights the UN GGE’s focus on critical infrastructure protection over direct military norms, the enduring “attribution problem” caused by anonymizing techniques and hijacked intermediary systems, and the “endpoint security” obstacle in tying digital actions to responsible actors. Ott emphasizes the egalitarian effect of cyberspace’s low technical entry threshold, which empowers non-state actors alongside advanced persistent threats, thereby eroding traditional power asymmetries and complicating interstate norm negotiations. Drawing on case studies such as the Sony hack and the Stuxnet operation, he illustrates how varying levels of sophistication and intent shape state responses and the interpretation of existing legal frameworks. To bridge legal and technical communities, Ott proposes a conceptual framework linking the defining characteristics of cyber operations—such as anonymity, low cost, and boundarylessness—to potential normative instruments. He argues that effective norm development must clarify thresholds for “force” and “armed attack,” integrate pragmatic CBMs tailored to major cyber powers, and enhance attribution transparency through technical cooperation. Ott concludes that divergent conceptions of “cyber sovereignty” among key states and stalled UN negotiations threaten norm evolution, urging empirical evaluation of current CBM initiatives, bilateral and multilateral case studies on norm implementation, and continued technical collaboration. By synthesizing legal doctrine, policy debates, and technical realities, this work lays the groundwork for more robust international regimes aimed at preventing inadvertent or deliberate military escalation in cyberspace.",

        "abstractNote": "In “Enduring US Dominance in Cyberspace in a World of Significant Peer and Near-Peer Competition,” General Keith B. Alexander and Jamil N. Jaffer analyze the strategic, organizational, and policy measures necessary to maintain American superiority in cyberspace as the domain evolves from sporadic conflict to continuous competition. They trace doctrinal developments since the establishment of U.S. Cyber Command in 2009 and China’s Strategic Support Force in 2015, noting both powers’ recognition of cyberspace as a distinct warfighting domain that collapses traditional lines between offense and defense. Drawing on official defense strategy documents, congressional mandates, People’s Liberation Army doctrinal writings, and high-profile cyber incidents—ranging from large-scale intellectual property theft and the NotPetya campaign to election interference—they highlight the United States’ robust capabilities via USCYBERCOM yet identify persistent structural and procedural gaps across government, the private sector, and international partnerships. To address these challenges, the authors propose a three-pillar framework: (1) forging a more defensible national cyber ecosystem through restructured government architectures, enhanced public-private threat information sharing, and deepened allied collaboration; (2) sustaining substantial investment in cyber intelligence collection, advanced offensive and defensive capabilities—including emerging technologies such as cognitive computing and quantum systems—and fostering game-changing innovations; and (3) building a credible and sustainable cyber deterrence posture via clear declaratory policy, improved attribution capacities, strategic signaling, and calibrated response options integrated with broader defense and diplomatic strategies. The paper emphasizes the economic dimension of cyber conflict—highlighted by Chinese theft of intellectual property and cryptocurrency hacks by North Korean actors—and underscores the asymmetric threats posed by Russia’s destructive campaigns and politically motivated cyberinformation operations. Despite the United States’ technical advantages, the authors argue that effective defense hinges on resolving interagency fragmentation, clarifying statutory authorities, and aligning military, intelligence, legal, and economic levers. They identify limitations in static policy frameworks given the domain’s fluidity and call for future inquiry into optimal organizational structures for joint cyber operations, refinement of international legal norms governing state behavior in cyberspace, empirical evaluation of emerging technological deterrents, and the development of metrics for assessing collective defense efficacy among allies. This comprehensive policy-and-doctrinal analysis offers a strategic model for sustaining U.S. and allied dominance in cyberspace and deterring adversarial aggression in this continuously contested domain.",

        "abstractNote": "In Cyber Deterrence Isn t MAD; It s Mosaic, Ben Buchanan critiques the prevalent reliance on the Cold War s Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) paradigm for cyberspace, arguing instead for a nuanced, multi-dimensional deterrence \"mosaic\" tailored to the varied severity of cyber threats and diversity of actors. Recognizing that cyberspace presents challenges unlike nuclear deterrence—chiefly attribution difficulties, actor heterogeneity, and varying threat impact—Buchanan develops a theoretical model with two key axes: specific versus general deterrence, and absolute versus restrictive deterrence. Specific deterrence targets identifiable adversaries through credible, actor-specific consequences, while general deterrence imposes exemplar sanctions intended to influence broader groups. Absolute deterrence seeks to fully prevent a given hostile act, whereas restrictive deterrence aims only to moderate actor behavior or reduce the frequency and intensity of cyber operations. This two-dimensional typology enables policymakers to categorize cyber threats—ranging from sophisticated, state-sponsored intrusions to loosely organized hacktivist collectives—and to assign appropriate deterrence strategies. For high-severity, state-sponsored attacks, Buchanan argues absolute and specific deterrence are more credible when accompanied by clear threat communication and the potential for proportionate retaliation. In contrast, financially motivated criminals or nonstate hacktivists are best addressed through restrictive and general deterrence, given the challenges of attribution and limited targets for reprisal. Buchanan further contends that deterrence alone is insufficient: robust defensive cyber practices—network monitoring, timely patching, and penetration testing—must accompany the mosaic. Defensive measures serve to raise adversary costs, lower operational capabilities, and reinforce restrictive deterrence without risking destabilizing escalation. Unlike Cold War ballistic defenses, cyber defenses are non-destabilizing and broadly acceptable, since escalation to kinetic conflict remains possible, and defensive deployments simply complement deterrence. While the mosaic strategy acknowledges limits—especially in empirically verifying deterrence efficacy and proving that attacks did not occur due to deterrence—it offers a flexible framework for integrating legal, diplomatic, informational, and technical tools. Buchanan highlights that credible threat signaling depends critically on improved attribution mechanisms and emerging international norms. For future research, he recommends empirical case studies across geopolitical contexts to refine the model, development of cooperative international agreements to bolster restrictive deterrence against transnational cybercrime, and exploration of how evolving cyber norms can strengthen collective deterrence. Ultimately, the mosaic approach shifts the paradigm from monolithic strategies to a calibrated, context-dependent blend of punitive and defensive measures, ensuring that states can realistically deter diverse cyber threats while minimizing escalation risks.",

        "abstractNote": "This article critically examines the challenges the anonymity of digital actors poses to the existing international legal regime governing armed conflict, state responsibility, and criminal liability. Srivastava demonstrates that traditional legal frameworks—formulated for physical hostilities and tangible crimes—are inadequate for classifying, attributing, and responding to cyber operations such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, which blur the line between cybercrime and cyberwarfare. Through a doctrinal analysis of treaty provisions, state practice, judicial decisions, and non-binding expert instruments like the Tallinn Manual, the author reveals fundamental definitional gaps, inconsistent state practice, and the absence of opinio juris. Case studies of the 2007 Estonia attacks and the alleged North Korean assault on Sony illustrate these ambiguities in practice. Srivastava critiques the Tallinn Manual for its reliance on kinetic metaphors, analogical extensions of existing law, and its own non-binding status, arguing that it merely restates lex lata and fails to establish clear thresholds for use of force, reliable attribution mechanisms, or standardized guidelines for evidence collection and prosecution. Recognizing these limitations, the paper calls for the negotiation of a dedicated international cyber treaty or set of conventions that would define cyber-related offenses, calibrate thresholds for armed conflict in cyberspace, and prescribe binding attribution, evidence-gathering, and transnational prosecution mechanisms. Drawing lessons from the Outer Space Treaty and the evolution of space law, Srivastava proposes that analogical reasoning play only a supportive role, and that a purpose-built legal regime be inaugurated to provide coherent, universally accepted norms tailored to the distinctive attributes of cyberspace. The article concludes by recommending further empirical research into state cyber doctrines, comparative studies of treaty models, and the development of international enforcement mechanisms, thereby contributing to multidisciplinary cyber conflict scholarship and charting a path toward legal certainty and normative consensus in the digital domain.",

        "abstractNote": "In “The Attribution Rules in ILC’s Articles on State Responsibility: A Preliminary Assessment on Their Application to Cyber Operations,” Zhxiong Huang examines the adequacy and applicability of the International Law Commission’s (ILC) legal attribution rules to complex cyber operations. The article begins by distinguishing between “technical attribution”—the factual process of identifying the source of a cyber operation—and “legal attribution,” the doctrinal criteria under which conduct is imputed to a State. Huang underscores that, while technical attribution is indispensable, international law’s attribution standards ultimately determine state responsibility for wrongful acts. Drawing on ILC draft Articles on State Responsibility, ICJ jurisprudence (notably the Corfu Channel and Bosnian Genocide cases), and instruments including the Tallinn Manual, the author critically evaluates two competing attribution tests: the ILC’s “effective control” standard and the “overall control” test derived from the Nicaragua precedent. Huang argues that applying the overall control test to the decentralized and often covert realm of cyberspace would lead to overbroad state liability by requiring a level of control seldom attainable or provable. In contrast, the effective control standard, which hinges on evidence that a state organ directed or instructed specific cyber operations, remains both practically feasible and normatively appropriate. The article then turns to the contentious question of imputing responsibility for cyber-attacks carried out by non-state actors operating within or from a State’s territory. Huang acknowledges that modern international law recognizes a State’s due diligence obligations—codified in Corfu Channel and elaborated in Tallinn Manual Rule 5—to prevent its territory from being used for attacks that harm other States. However, he insists on carefully distinguishing between state responsibility for omissions under due diligence rules and responsibility for wrongful acts via attribution. While failure to prevent attacks may trigger liability for inaction, it should not replace or dilute the need for legal attribution of the actors to the State itself. Huang critiques proposals to eliminate attribution thresholds in favor of purely territorial or “sanctuary” tests, warning that doing so would undermine jus ad bellum principles, incentivize misattribution, and expose innocent States to unwarranted reprisals. He illustrates the dangers of equating the location of hijacked botnet computers with culpability, citing the 2007 Estonia DDoS attack, which involved compromised machines across dozens of countries. Finally, Huang calls for a balanced approach: retaining the ILC’s effective control standard while promoting enhanced state cooperation, empirical research into attribution processes, and the normative development of due diligence obligations. Such measures would strengthen responsible attribution mechanisms, ensuring that States can lawfully and effectively respond to cyber threats without lowering legal thresholds or eroding the foundational principles of state responsibility in international law.",

Murphy situates his inquiry in the context of competing state-led treaty initiatives, principally from Russia and China, aiming to secure United Nations or International Telecommunications Union regulation of the Internet. Such proposals risk empowering authoritarian states at the expense of core liberal values by imposing binding restrictions on free speech, privacy, and the open flow of information. Through a detailed doctrinal analysis of relevant treaty texts, UN General Assembly debates, ITU resolutions, and key advisory opinions of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), including the Wall Construction and Congo Activities cases, the author highlights how established jus ad bellum and jus in bello interpretations potentially curtail the right of self-defense against non-State cyber threats. Murphy critiques the ICJ’s narrow treatment of Article 51, demonstrating that its state-centric view undermines responses to cyber operations carried out by insurgents or other non-state actors, a problem magnified by attribution challenges intrinsic to digital attacks. He illustrates these issues with state-sponsored malware cases: Stuxnet’s sophisticated assault on Iran’s Natanz uranium-enrichment centrifuges, and the Duqu, Flame, and Gauss operations. These incidents reveal both the strategic potency of cyber tools in eroding adversary capabilities and the legal uncertainties surrounding sovereign responses. Murphy argues that, while binding cyber-war treaties may endanger U.S. strategic autonomy and liberal norms, the U.S. and its allies should nonetheless engage pragmatically in developing “rules of the road.” Drawing on John Hollis’s economic analysis of international legal transaction costs, he proposes informal, nonbinding guidelines or “shiprider”-style arrangements—where states consent to pre-authorized, cross-border defensive cyber actions—to streamline collective responses to terrorist or criminal cyber threats. He contends that such flexible mechanisms could reconcile state sovereignty with the demands of transnational cyber security, enabling rapid self-defense and cooperative deterrence against asymmetric warfare. The article concludes by urging the U.S. to resist authoritatively binding treaty proposals that would favor authoritarian regimes while simultaneously investing in public–private partnerships and norm-building initiatives to strengthen domestic cyber defense capabilities. Murphy underscores the need for empirical research on the adoption of informal cyber norms, the design of nonbinding frameworks for espionage regulation, and the enhancement of attribution mechanisms. Ultimately, the study reframes the international legal process on cyber conflict as an arena of strategic competition, requiring a balanced U.S. approach that both safeguards national interests and contributes to cooperative global governance.",

        "abstractNote": "In “Cyber Neutrality: A Textual Analysis of Traditional Jus in Bello Neutrality Rules through a Purpose-Based Lens,” Major Zachary P. Augustine examines how the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907—particularly Hague V (land warfare) and Hague XIII (naval warfare)—can and should be applied to modern cyber operations in interstate armed conflict. Against a backdrop of rising state-sponsored cyber campaigns (e.g., Stuxnet) and growing investments in offensive cyber capabilities by major powers, the article argues that a purpose-based interpretive framework is needed to preserve neutral state sovereignty and prevent belligerents from exploiting neutral territory in cyberspace. Utilizing a legal-doctrinal methodology grounded in textual analysis, Augustine first reviews the traditional neutrality rules, their scope under the United Nations Charter’s collective security limitations, and the distinction between international and non-international armed conflicts. He then addresses the challenges of attributing cyber operations for state responsibility and neutrality enforcement. The core contribution lies in three detailed case studies: the Russian cyber campaign against Estonia (2007), proxy use during the 2008 Russia–Georgia conflict, and the U.S.–Israeli Stuxnet operation against Iran’s Natanz facility. Augustine demonstrates that—analogous to prohibited wireless telegraphy stations under Article 3 of Hague V—command-and-control servers located in neutral states violate neutrality duties if used to communicate with belligerent forces. Conversely, individual packet routing over neutral infrastructure generally falls within the telegraph exception (Article 8), due to practical limitations in controlling routes and the Internet’s redundant design. The deliberate use of proxies in neutral states, however, intentionally derives military advantage from neutral infrastructure, violating territorial inviolability under Article 1 of Hague V. Augustine further contends that technical attribution to network nodes suffices to justify limited military countermeasures against proxies even when state-level attribution remains elusive, although human attribution challenges may limit deterrence against sophisticated actors. The article concludes that existing neutrality law can be preserved by focusing on functional equivalence between cyber and conventional means, avoiding the need for wholesale treaty revision. Augustine acknowledges attribution and consensus-building constraints but proposes future research into attribution technologies, collective security agreements’ applicability to cyberspace, and normative developments to bolster compliance and enforcement. His purpose-based lens thus offers a pragmatic, multidisciplinary framework for reconciling century-old neutrality norms with emergent cyber realities and safeguarding neutral states in twenty-first-century warfare.",

        "abstractNote": "Nicolas Jupillat’s article “Armed Attacks in Cyberspace: The Unseen Threat to Peace and Security that Redefines the Law and State Responsibility” provides a comprehensive doctrinal analysis of how established principles of international law governing the use of force apply in the cyber domain. Opening with the premise that increasing reliance on computer networks has exposed states to unprecedented security threats, the article reviews high-level U.S. intelligence assessments and executive orders that treat malicious cyber activities as national emergencies, as well as United Nations resolutions and NATO’s Tallinn Manual draft rules, to underscore the urgency of clarifying state responsibility and jus ad bellum in cyberspace. Employing a methodology grounded in authoritative sources—the U.N. Charter, International Court of Justice jurisprudence, International Law Commission Draft Articles on State Responsibility, and the Tallinn Manual—Jupillat examines how the thresholds of “use of force” and “armed attack” should evolve to accommodate cyber operations. Drawing on historical precedents such as the Caroline incident and prominent cyber events like Stuxnet, the analysis affirms that cyber operations causing death, injury, or significant material damage can legally qualify as uses of force, but notes that none to date have been formally recognized as armed attacks under international law. The article identifies three principal challenges in applying self-defense in cyberspace: attribution difficulties, the immaterial nature of many harms, and the empowerment of non-State actors. It argues that while the traditional right of self-defense remains a cornerstone of the U.N. Charter regime, its invocation in cyberspace must contend with the invisible nature of perpetrators and the difficulty of establishing imminence and necessity prior to an attack. To address scenarios where non-State actors exploit asymmetric cyber vulnerabilities, Jupillat proposes lowering the threshold for state responsibility and deterrence of proxy use, while preserving established jus ad bellum norms. In cases of grave and imminent peril against essential state interests—especially when the territorial state is unwilling or unable to act—the author advances the plea of necessity as a supplementary legal mechanism. He traces the doctrine’s origins to the Caroline affair and ILC Draft Articles, highlighting that necessity permits intervention absent traditional state attribution, provided the acting state does not inflict disproportionate harm on the host state’s essential interests. The article cautions that pre-emptive self-defense and necessity claims must be narrowly construed to avoid undermining international cooperation and sovereignty. Recognizing the unpredictable and borderless nature of cyber effects, as well as emerging technologies like AI and biotech, Jupillat concludes that the future of cyber conflict regulation depends on harmonizing domestic laws, strengthening trust-building and multi-stakeholder governance models, and empirically assessing how proposed normative changes influence state practice and crisis stability.",

        "abstractNote": "This article examines Russia s legal obligations under international law to control and prevent cyber-criminal activities emanating from its territory, arguing that Russia s longstanding permissive hacker culture and weak enforcement of domestic cybercrime and intellectual property laws trigger state responsibility for private actors  transnational misconduct. Beginning with an analysis of Russia s constitutional and statutory framework, the author surveys the role of Rospatent, the Civil Code, and the Criminal Code in prohibiting unauthorized computer access, the creation and dissemination of malicious software, and intellectual property infringement. Despite having robust provisions prescribing penalties up to several years  imprisonment or forced labor, enforcement is infrequent and often limited to domestic targets, fostering an environment in which pirating, unlicensed software markets, and high-profile breaches such as the 2013 Target incident go largely unpunished. The author traces the evolution of a hacker culture that conflates technical prowess with national prestige and outlines key cyberattacks allegedly originating in Russia, highlighting attribution challenges due to spoofed IPs, botnets, and anonymizing tools. Through doctrinal analysis of International Court of Justice jurisprudence—including the Tellini arbitration, Corfu Channel, and Iran judgment—the article extracts principles requiring states to take all reasonable measures to prevent, suppress, and penalize wrongful acts by non-state actors. Applying these principles, the author contends that Russia s failure to investigate, extradite, or prosecute hackers upon requests for mutual assistance constitutes a breach of its international obligations. The work further argues for an elevated standard of cooperation for Russia, given evidence of tacit agreements between the state and hacker groups and its disproportionately permissive enforcement record. The article concludes by cautioning against overly intrusive governance measures that could impinge civil liberties and calls for comparative studies of other jurisdictions, empirical tracking of enforcement trends, and the development of refined attribution and multilateral norms to strengthen the global cyber accountability regime.",

        "abstractNote": "This article offers a comprehensive doctrinal analysis of the international law obligations of a State on whose territory a cyber-security incident originates. Contrary to the emergence of any new specialized treaty framework, existing rules of customary international law and general principles of State responsibility fully encompass the duties that such a State must fulfill to prevent and address transboundary cyber harm. The author identifies three principal obligations. First, the State must refrain from conducting or permitting harmful cyber operations emanating from its territory, grounded in the principles of sovereignty and non-intervention. Although judicial authority on cyber incidents is still nascent, the article analogizes established precedents in environmental and health law—such as the Corfu Channel and Pulp Mills decisions—and treaties like the International Health Regulations to demonstrate the existence of a prohibition against cross-border cyber intrusions. Second, the State bears a due diligence obligation to prevent cyber-security incidents likely to harm other States. This flexible, risk-based standard requires continuous monitoring of potential threats, the establishment of adequate preventive and mitigative measures, and an ongoing regulatory framework capable of adapting to evolving technologies and actors, including non-state entities. Notably, the definitions of offenses in Articles 2–6 of the Council of Europe’s Budapest Convention on Cybercrime serve as an opinio iuris indicator, signaling that acts such as unauthorized access, data interception, system disruption, and malware deployment are internationally wrongful when they produce transboundary effects. Third, once an incident occurs, the State has a procedural duty to cooperate with affected States by sharing information, coordinating responses, and facilitating investigations. Drawing upon analogies to environmental notification regimes and the International Health Regulations’ 24-hour reporting requirement, the article contends that customary law obliges States of origin to notify other States of severe or emergency cyber incidents and to consult on remedial measures. However, the author underscores that more coercive cooperation mechanisms—such as extradition and mutual legal assistance—depend on specific treaty commitments, as reflected in Chapter III of the Budapest Convention, rather than customary international law alone. The article further delineates the substantive limits of these obligations, noting that due diligence does not impose uniform notification duties outside emergencies and that private rights, such as intellectual property and freedom of information, must be balanced against public security concerns when implementing preventive or cooperative measures. Finally, the author suggests future research avenues, including empirical studies of State reporting practices after major cyber incidents, comparative analyses of national measures under the Budapest Convention, and normative development of specialized procedural rules through a potential new multilateral treaty. By integrating substantive and procedural facets of State responsibility into a coherent regulatory model, the article advances a nuanced conceptual framework for governing cyber-security incidents under international law, bridging gaps between public-security imperatives and private rights in the evolving domain of cyberspace.",

        "abstractNote": "This article examines the complex challenges posed by cyberspace as an emergent domain of armed conflict under existing international humanitarian law (IHL) and state responsibility regimes. Recognizing the unprecedented potential for cyber-attacks to incapacitate critical civilian infrastructure—such as hospitals and power grids—and thereby inflict harm tantamount to conventional war crimes, the study critically assesses whether the Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocol I (AP I) sufficiently regulate malicious cyber operations or whether novel treaty instruments are required. Through an extensive qualitative literature review and illustrative case studies, the author first explores the principle of distinction in cyberspace, highlighting the inherent difficulty in differentiating military objectives from civilian objects within a dual-use, interconnected Internet environment. The analysis demonstrates that, although the foundational rules of armed conflict extend to cyber means and methods, practical impediments—especially the dual-use nature of networks and tools—undermine adherence to distinction and proportionality requirements. The paper then interrogates the challenges of attribution and responsibility, arguing that anonymity and evidentiary gaps in cyberspace frustrate the legal imputation of state or individual culpability, enabling plausible deniability and asymmetrical power dynamics among technologically advanced and less capable states. Notwithstanding these obstacles, the study affirms that existing treaties and customary norms criminalize cyber-attacks that disable life-sustaining civilian facilities and that such acts constitute war crimes regardless of the means employed. In addressing enforcement deficits, the article underscores the underutilized potential of Article 36 weapons reviews, noting that few states systematically assess how emerging cyber capabilities align with IHL prohibitions. Drawing attention to the Tallinn Manual as a pioneering interpretative guide, the author advocates for more regularized, cooperative legal review mechanisms to anticipate and mitigate the harmful consequences of cyber weapons. The conclusion emphasizes that technological innovation does not absolve human actors or states from ethical and legal accountability: cyberspace’s expanding role in conflict demands that states strengthen commitments to IHL through robust weapons review processes, refined evidentiary standards for attribution, and multilateral transparency in Article 36 reviews. By situating cyber warfare within the established legal framework and proposing pragmatic pathways for enforcement and normative development, the study contributes a multidisciplinary perspective that bridges cyber law, policy, and international humanitarian principles, urging responsible state adaptation to preserve the protection of human life in an era of digital conflict.",

        "abstractNote": "In “Sovereignty and Cyber Attacks: Technology’s Challenge to the Law of State Responsibility,” Peter Margulies examines the fundamental tensions between state sovereignty, costly attribution burdens, and the regulation of cyber operations under international law. Drawing on classical precedents—including the International Court of Justice’s “effective control” test in Nicaragua v. United States, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia’s “overall control” standard in Tadić, and the International Law Commission’s Draft Articles on State Responsibility—Margulies argues that existing law, shaped for kinetic conflict, is ill-suited to address the distinctive “attribution asymmetry” of cyberspace. He shows that while victim states struggle to detect and trace cyber incursions, assisting states retain far greater internal control over private proxies than law currently recognizes, fostering plausible deniability and undermining deterrence. Through a doctrinal analysis of treaty texts, case law, and the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare, the article identifies how the Manual’s cautious alignment with lex lata perpetuates an overly stringent approach to attribution: it demands proof of direct instruction or effective control, excluding mere financing and equipping of non-state actors. To remedy this gap, Margulies proposes a novel “virtual control” standard that shifts the burden to the assisting state once a victim state adduces credible evidence of material support. Under this test, states must either disprove their assistance or show they exercised due diligence to prevent misuse. This rebuttable presumption better reflects information asymmetries—since assisting states possess superior access to evidence—and enhances deterrence by compelling grantors to monitor and regulate beneficiaries. Margulies illustrates the approach through hypothetical case studies involving denial-of-service attacks and malware intrusions, demonstrating how virtual control would clarify when a cyber operation constitutes an armed attack under Article 51 of the UN Charter and justify self-defense. He addresses objections—privacy incursions arising from enhanced monitoring, risks of escalation, and the balance between necessity and proportionality—showing that limits on in bello and ad bellum proportionality, as well as existing grantor auditing practices, mitigate these concerns. The article concludes that although states seeking plausible deniability may resist, the virtual control framework aligns legal responsibility with the realities of cyber conflict and offers a more coherent pathway for the evolution of international norms. By bridging doctrinal lacunae between cyber practice and state responsibility law, Margulies’s proposal advances a multidisciplinary cyber conflict discourse, emphasizing both legal innovation and the safeguarding of sovereignty in the digital era.",

        "abstractNote": "This article examines the evolving contours of state responsibility in the digital domain, where the ubiquitous nature of cyberspace has exposed critical vulnerabilities and created novel challenges for the attribution and redress of wrongful acts. Drawing upon established principles of international law — particularly the International Law Commission’s Draft Articles on State Responsibility — it explores both lex lata and lex ferenda mechanisms to adapt traditional rules to the unique features of cyber operations. Through a hypothetical case study of a cross-border cyberattack by “DigiLand” on the electrical grid of “CyberStan,” the author systematically analyzes the four core elements of state responsibility: breach of an international obligation, attribution of the act to state organs or agents, the existence of damage, and the requirement for reparation. The analysis observes that the stringent evidentiary thresholds for objective state responsibility, which require direct attribution of the hostile cyber act to government organs, are ill suited to the technical complexity and anonymity of cyberspace, where non-state actors often operate with or without implicit governmental support. \n\nTo bridge this gap, the author proposes situating state responsibility within a dual framework that combines the no-harm principle with a due diligence standard. Under this approach, states are obliged to prevent harmful digital activities originating from their territory by enacting robust domestic cybercrime legislation, conducting thorough investigations, prosecuting perpetrators, and cooperating with affected states’ legal processes. Comparative insights are drawn from environmental law, human rights jurisprudence, and diplomatic protection cases, such as the Inter-American Court of Human Rights’ Velásquez Rodríguez decision and the International Court of Justice’s Teheran Hostages judgment, demonstrating how due diligence obligations can be tailored to the cyber context. \n\nThe author further argues that customary international law on digital state responsibility can be cultivated through evolving state practice, governmental expert reports, and judicial decisions, thereby creating a flexible, norm-forming mechanism capable of addressing both state omissions and commissions in cyberspace. A conceptual framework is developed for assessing state due diligence in cyberspace, including criteria for evaluating legislative measures, investigative and prosecutorial effectiveness, and mutual legal assistance. The article acknowledges the limitations of relying on a hypothetical scenario and the nascent stage of digital adjudication, underscoring the need for empirical research on actual state responses to cyber incidents. It calls for further documentation of state practice, refinement of due diligence benchmarks, and the clarification of attribution standards by international dispute settlement bodies. Ultimately, the article contends that by recalibrating traditional state responsibility doctrines to suit the digital age — particularly through the integration of the no-harm principle and due diligence obligations — international law can more effectively hold states accountable for cyber-enabled harms, incentivize preventive measures, and thereby enhance legal stability in an interconnected world.",

        "abstractNote": "This article addresses the critical gap in international cyber law and diplomatic practice exposed by state-sponsored cyber-attacks, as illustrated by the 2014 U.S. indictment of Chinese military officers for economic espionage—a measure rendered ineffective by the absence of an extradition treaty and binding multilateral legal framework. Lawrence L. Muir Jr. argues that existing bilateral negotiations with China and Russia have repeatedly failed because they overlook each state’s pursuit of national self-interest. To overcome this impasse, the author proposes a novel approach—national interest diplomacy—employing triangulation theory from Cold War diplomacy to forge a trilateral treaty between the United States, Russia, and China. The United States would first pursue rapprochement with Russia, leveraging improved bilateral relations to pressure China to either join the treaty or face diplomatic isolation. Drawing on qualitative legal analysis and historical case studies, the paper systematically examines past bilateral failures, demonstrating how misaligned incentives stalled progress, and articulates the strategic advantages and feasibility of this triangulation strategy. The core of the proposed treaty comprises enabling and establishment clauses to create a standing cyber tribunal with clear organizational structure, jurisdiction, and procedural rules governing both civil and criminal matters. The tribunal would define protected digital assets and proscribe prohibited acts across three categories—cybercrime, cyber-espionage, and cyber-warfare—while differentiating between civilian, paramilitary, and military actors. Military cyber-units would receive limited extraterritorial immunity under defined conditions to ensure state accountability, whereas private actors could face civil damages and criminal extradition to deter malicious behavior. To address the perennial challenge of attribution, the treaty would adopt a “clear and convincing evidence” standard, permitting the submission of circumstantial and technical data, and mandate cooperation between states, corporations, and intelligence agencies for evidence-sharing. Key features include delineation of procedural mechanisms for restitution of victims, incentives to deter future attacks, and enforcement through civil litigation and extradition. The paper acknowledges limitations—including attribution difficulties, reliance on corporate and intelligence cooperation, and potential exploitation of immunity provisions—and recommends future research to assess political feasibility, refine substantive and procedural norms through stakeholder consultations, and explore integration with broader trade and security agreements. By aligning national economic and security goals with collective cyber defense and embedding accountability, the proposed trilateral treaty offers a practicable, incentive-based model to transform international cyber relations from impunity to enforceable norms, thereby securing restitution, deterring aggression, and strengthening global cybersecurity governance.",

        "abstractNote": "This article examines the legal characterization of two prominent 2014 cyber incidents—the hack of Sony Pictures and the breach of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM)—through the lens of international law, focusing on jus ad bellum thresholds and state responsibility. Beginning with a review of the increasing ubiquity and sophistication of malware and targeted intrusions, the author situates the Sony and OPM hacks within broader debates over whether such operations can constitute uses of force or armed attacks under both customary international law and the expert jurisprudence of the Tallinn Manual. Employing a doctrinal methodology, the article applies criteria for damage, use of force, intervention, and attribution to determine whether these hacks meet the threshold of an armed attack or a use of force short of armed attack. The Sony hack, which destroyed the functionality of thousands of computers and exfiltrated sensitive corporate data, is found insufficiently grave to constitute an armed attack but likely qualifies as an unlawful intervention infringing U.S. sovereignty and potentially a use of force short of armed attack. By contrast, the OPM breach, involving large-scale theft of personnel records and no physical destruction, is characterized as lawful cyber espionage, albeit one that poses serious risks to privacy and security. The analysis reveals that neither hack triggered the right of self-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter, as there was no physical injury or destruction of sufficient scale. However, in the case of Sony, the United States retains the option of countermeasures under Article 22 of the International Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility, provided attribution to North Korea can be established and any response remains proportionate. The author further highlights limitations inherent in relying on nonbinding Tallinn Manual opinions and the scarcity of binding state practice on cyber countermeasures. The study concludes by calling for empirical research on real-world applications of legal thresholds, development of binding international norms governing cyber countermeasures, and detailed comparative studies of bilateral cooperation in prosecuting state-linked cyber intrusions—citing emerging U.S.-China collaboration on OPM-related prosecutions as a potential model for accountability. This nuanced legal framework clarifies distinctions among unlawful uses of force, espionage, and interventions in cyberspace, offering guidance for state attribution, response, and the evolving international legal order in digital conflict.",

        "abstractNote": "In this article, Herdegen identifies the urgent need for a coherent international legal framework to address the full spectrum of cyber threats—including state‐sponsored attacks, non‐state actor intrusions, and cyber espionage—that exploit the inherent vulnerabilities of globally interconnected and openness‐oriented digital infrastructures. Drawing on a doctrinal public international law methodology, he systematically reviews primary norms such as the International Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility, customary principles of sovereignty and non‐intervention, relevant treaty regimes, and landmark judicial decisions like the Corfu Channel case to extract conceptual bases for state due diligence obligations. He distinguishes between wrongful acts directly attributable to states, which clearly violate existing norms of territorial sovereignty when they cause destructiveness, and the regulatory lacuna governing non‐destructive intrusions and espionage, which presently escape explicit prohibition under customary international law. To bridge these gaps, Herdegen articulates a due diligence regime grounded in multiple conceptual bases: respect for international common goods, prevention of private‐actor transboundary harm, freedom of communication, and shared‐resource responsibility. He argues that due diligence should require risk‐commensurate preventive measures, continuous system vigilance, timely information‐sharing, and warning protocols. The analysis further proposes a nuanced classification of responsible actors—including private individuals, states of origin, and corporate targets—to ensure clear attribution and liability under varying standards of control, favoring an “overall control” threshold for state responsibility over the more stringent “effective control” criterion. Recognizing the constraints on rapidly negotiation and ratification of binding treaties in the cyber domain, the author advocates an institutional model integrating international agreements with soft law instruments, supported by a multi‐stakeholder governance architecture. This institutional design would incorporate state agencies, private sector entities, non‐governmental organizations, and hybrid bodies (e.g., ICANN) to facilitate adaptive and inclusive decision‐making, information exchange, and norm development. Herdegen acknowledges limitations arising from the doctrinal approach—namely, the need for empirical validation of state adherence to due diligence standards, the enforceability of non‐binding instruments, and mechanisms to incentivize private sector participation. He calls for future empirical research to assess state practice in adopting these norms, evaluate the effectiveness of soft law in shaping behavior, and explore incentive structures that align private actors with international security objectives in cyberspace.",

        "abstractNote": "Robert Kolb’s “Reflections on Due Diligence Duties and Cyberspace” provides a comprehensive doctrinal analysis of how traditional international law principles of State due diligence must evolve to address the distinctive challenges posed by cyberattacks and cyberwarfare. Beginning with a historical survey, Kolb traces due diligence from its 19th-century origins in neutrality law, including the Alabama Claims arbitration and Hague Convention XIII, through subsequent jurisprudence in cases such as Baldwin (1841), Prats (1868), the Spanish Zone of Morocco award (1925), and the ICJ’s Genocide Judgment (2007). He demonstrates that due diligence, as a proportional standard of care, hinges on the material means available to a State and that manifest negligence constitutes a breach. Kolb then examines the transposition of these duties to cyberspace, arguing that while the core concept remains relevant, unique technical features—such as anonymizing rerouting mechanisms—often frustrate conventional preventive measures and complicate attribution. He highlights two primary issues: first, a State’s obligation to block malicious cyber traffic is constrained when identifying perpetrators and ensuring effective prevention proves technically uncertain and disproportionate; and second, disparities in States’ technical capacity raise questions about how much investment in cyber-specialist resources international law can reasonably demand. Kolb contends that failure to act must be demonstrably negligent given the speculative efficacy of many cyber countermeasures. He further explores the hybrid nature of cyber countermeasures, exemplified by operations like Stuxnet, which do not constitute physical intrusions and thus occupy a legal gray zone between self-defence and lawful countermeasures. Kolb argues that unilateral “protective measures” undertaken from an aggrieved State’s territory—so long as they lack physical penetration of another State—do not violate sovereignty and may complement reparatory countermeasures. Additionally, he posits that cyberspace’s interlinked structure creates collective interests: all States, as potential conduits for cybercrime or state-linked attacks, share a stake in cooperative responses. Ultimately, Kolb concludes that while due diligence duties are sufficiently flexible to be reimagined for cyberspace, effective prevention and suppression require concrete parameters—technical capabilities, proportionality, attribution feasibility—and robust international cooperation, including new legal instruments attuned to cyberspace’s non-territorial, ubiquitous nature.",

        "abstractNote": "This article examines how foundational principles of public international law—sovereignty, state responsibility, and the jus ad bellum—govern cyber interactions between states and non-state actors in cyberspace, challenging the traditional state-centric orientation of international legal norms. Driven by the rapid evolution of cyber capabilities among individuals, hacker groups, terrorist organizations, and private companies, the authors argue that non-state actors now pose security threats to states on par with those previously limited to inter-state conflicts, necessitating a reappraisal of existing legal frameworks. Drawing upon the Tallinn Manual and the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts’ conclusions, the authors employ a doctrinal methodology, analyzing treaties, arbitral awards, United Nations resolutions, and key state statements to clarify how sovereignty applies to cyber infrastructure and activities within national territory. They document a broad consensus that states retain exclusive sovereign authority over all public and private cyber activities within their borders, including the right to regulate, block, or otherwise control Internet content and service provision in accordance with human rights obligations. The article then explores how cyber operations by non-state actors implicate state responsibility, emphasizing that states may be held liable for cyber acts conducted on their behalf or with their substantial involvement and that injured states may undertake countermeasures under international law. When attribution to a host state is lacking, the authors advocate for calibrated self-defence responses that respect sovereignty yet effectively neutralize cyber threats emanating from abroad. In addressing the jus ad bellum, the authors clarify the distinction between cyber operations that constitute a use of force and those rising to the level of an armed attack. While the United States adopts a position that any unlawful use of force justifies a defensive response, the prevailing view distinguishes especially grave uses of force as armed attacks requiring proportional self-defence measures under Article 51 of the UN Charter. Case analyses such as Stuxnet illustrate the challenge of applying traditional thresholds, and the authors predict gradual movement toward a ‘‘severity of consequences’’ test to determine when cyber operations justify forceful state responses. The article also confronts the ‘‘unwilling or unable’’ dilemma: how a victim state may lawfully undertake cyber or non-cyber countermeasures against non-state attackers operating from another state’s territory when the host state fails to act. Proposing a rights-balancing approach that preserves both sovereignty and self-defence, the authors argue for narrowly tailored, proportionate actions that first seek to prompt the host state to address the threat and, if necessary, resort to limited force consistent with international law. Overall, the work offers a coherent framework integrating cyber-specific applications of sovereignty, state responsibility, and the jus ad bellum into existing legal regimes, providing policymakers and legal advisors with structured analytical tools for assessing the lawfulness of defensive cyber operations, while acknowledging current gaps in state practice and evolving norms that warrant future empirical and doctrinal research.",

        "abstractNote": "In Cyber-Conflict, Cyber-Crime, and Cyber-Espionage, David Weissbrodt offers a comprehensive legal-analytical study of the challenges posed by computer network operations (CNOs) to existing domestic and international legal frameworks. Recognizing that CNOs—ranging from distributed denial-of-service attacks to sophisticated malware such as Stuxnet and Flame—blur traditional distinctions between uses of force, espionage, and criminal activity, Weissbrodt examines how well the United Nations Charter, state responsibility doctrines, jus ad bellum, and domestic criminal statutes can accommodate these novel threats. After illustrating the rise of national cyber commands and legislative efforts in the United States and elsewhere, the author presents three case studies: Estonia’s 2007 DDoS attacks, Stuxnet’s disruption of Iran’s nuclear facilities, and the Flame espionage campaign. For each, he analyzes scale, attribution, intent, and consequences to determine whether the incidents qualify as uses of force or armed attacks under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, warrant self-defense, or fall within criminal or espionage paradigms. Weissbrodt finds that while low-impact attacks better align with existing criminal or intelligence frameworks, high-impact operations causing physical damage may meet the armed attack threshold, enabling lawful countermeasures. The article then critically assesses three principal regulatory approaches: a cyber non-proliferation treaty modeled on WMD accords, a binding international treaty or code of conduct with specific normative rules, and incremental development of customary international law through documented state practice and judicial decisions. He argues that a non-proliferation treaty is impractical owing to challenges of attribution and secretive development, while a treaty banning cyber-attacks faces insurmountable compliance and verification hurdles. Instead, he endorses fostering consistent state practice—supported by transparent reporting of responses to CNOs and engagement by international courts—to evolve binding norms over time. Acknowledging the slow pace of customary law formation, the author calls for systematic documentation of state responses, scholarly collaboration on rule-setting, and confidence-building among nations to clarify the legal status of cyber-operations. Limits include rapid technological change, attribution difficulties, and secretive cyber capability development. Overall, the article provides a multidisciplinary analysis of cyber-conflict governance, identifying paths toward an adaptable legal regime to mitigate cyber threats.",

        "abstractNote": "The article addresses the critical problem of determining when a cyber attack or its threat justifies a state’s right to self-defense, focusing on the potential for malicious code to inflict severe damage on military, economic, and social systems dependent on interconnected networks. It highlights the contested nature of state vulnerability and the prospect of digital assaults causing mass disruption, framing the issue within the broader concern over modern reliance on cyberspace. This research is justified by the urgent need to clarify legal norms and strategic guidelines in an area where doctrinal debate is nascent and policy stakes are high. Its objectives are to identify reasonable interpretations of self-defense rights under jus ad bellum, assess their strategic implications for security and stability, and analyze the political context shaping governmental responses. The central question is how legal, strategic, and political dimensions interact to inform a coherent approach to military self-defense against cyber operations. Methodologically, the study adopts an interdisciplinary framework combining legal doctrinal analysis with a strategic assessment of deterrence dynamics and a political analysis of decisionmaking under uncertainty. It reviews applicable provisions of the UN Charter, examines state practice and scholarly positions, and draws on case studies such as the covert Stuxnet operation to illustrate attribution challenges and political secrecy. Key findings reveal a broad spectrum of plausible legal interpretations of cyber armed attacks, shaped by strategic asymmetries among major powers that influence how states leverage offensive and defensive cyber capabilities. Politically, the opacity of cyber incidents, high levels of required secrecy, and difficulties in proving attribution to external audiences raise the practical threshold for justifying armed responses, making small-scale or isolated cyber intrusions unlikely to provoke military retaliation. The research also finds that most significant cyber threats will occur alongside other hostile activities, meaning that states will frame cyber responses within a broader security context. The principal contribution is an integrated model demonstrating that legal analysis of self-defense claims must be informed by strategic interests and political realities. The article elucidates how legal norms may evolve unevenly, given slow-moving international law and rapidly advancing technology, and it underscores the need for calibrating self-defense thresholds that reflect both doctrine and deterrence objectives. It also illuminates barriers to developing clear state practice due to secrecy and attribution challenges. Limitations include its predominantly American perspective, which may bias assessments of power and influence in shaping international norms, and the inherent difficulty of forecasting political reactions to cyber crises. For future research, the author proposes systematic examination of subsequent state responses to cyber incidents, comparative studies of major power legal positions over time, and development of joint strategic-legal frameworks among allies to establish clearer thresholds for the use of force in cyberspace.",

        "abstractNote": "This article addresses the challenge of regulating state and non-state cyber operations under existing international law, particularly the United Nations Charter, at a time when legislators have declined to create a dedicated treaty regime for cybersecurity. It begins by highlighting the pressing problem: international lawyers perceive cyber operations as a legal vacuum that exposes states and societies to unchecked digital coercion, thus straining global peace and security. This perceived gap compels scholars to stretch established legal frameworks to encompass cyber activities and to fill what they view as dangerous regulatory voids. The article seeks to explain why this body of scholarship matters and to identify its overt and latent purposes. Specifically, it asks how international lawyers frame their contributions to global cyber governance and which argumentative strategies they deploy to subject cyber operations to existing legal instruments. Methodologically, it adopts a doctrinal and conceptual analysis, surveying seminal and recent scholarship on cyber operations and international law, and examines state pronouncements and United Nations Group of Governmental Experts reports to trace prevailing patterns of argumentation. Through this critical review, the author discerns four key interventionist patterns: problem-finding, whereby lawyers characterize the cyber realm as fraught with new threats; administrativist camouflage, in which they present themselves as technical interpreters rather than law-makers when extending the UN Charter to digital operations; consequentialist bending, which tailors the Charter’s substantive thresholds such as “use of force” or “armed attack” to fit cyber incidents; and evidentiary pragmatism, reflecting scholars’ efforts to lower or reassign burdens and standards of proof to secure state responsibility for cyber-enabled harm. The article finds that while these strategies have succeeded in establishing a predominant view that the UN Charter applies to cyber operations, they generate acute difficulties at the evidentiary stage. Attribution, causation, authorship and the cross-border dynamics of cyber incidents resist conclusive proof, exposing a self-inflicted crisis in interventionist scholarship. The contribution of this work lies in revealing the internal contradictions of current legal debates and in arguing that the most profound obstacle to subjecting cyber operations to the UN Charter is not any external state reluctance but the compounded effect of interventionists’ own doctrinal choices. The author acknowledges that his analysis is conceptual and draws primarily on scholarly texts rather than empirical case studies, which limits its direct applicability to adjudicative practice. He also notes that his focus on UN Charter frameworks may understate alternative regulatory approaches under development. Finally, he calls for further research into alternative argumentation patterns that preserve scholars’ managerial ambitions without incurring prohibitive evidentiary burdens, for comparative studies of emerging attribution mechanisms, and for empirical evaluation of how states and international institutions actually apply international law to cyber incidents.",

        "abstractNote": "Leaven and Dodge’s article critically examines the strategic and legal rationale behind the United States’ decision to establish the United States Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) in lieu of immediately acceding to a binding international treaty governing cyber warfare. The authors open by identifying a critical regulatory gap: conventional arms control treaties—crafted for observable and conventional weapons systems—are ill-suited to address the low-cost, rapid, and often anonymous nature of cyber operations. Drawing on a doctrinal methodology enriched by comparative legal analysis, Leaven and Dodge review historical arms control frameworks, notably chemical weapons conventions and European monetary union experiences, to illustrate both analogies in treaty design and the fundamental divergences presented by cyberspace. Primary sources, including Department of Defense policy directives and public statements from senior U.S. defense officials, inform their assessment of whether treaty-based constraints would serve national interests or unduly restrict operational flexibility. They argue that without robust technical attribution mechanisms and enforceable signaling protocols, any treaty would be ineffective—failing to deter cyber aggression, risking inadvertent retaliation against innocent third parties, and potentially embroiling the United States in peripheral conflicts. Case studies of Russian cyber operations against Estonia in 2007 and declassified U.S. logic-bomb activities in 1982 demonstrate attribution challenges that undermine deterrence and complicate enforcement. Against this backdrop, the authors posit that USCYBERCOM’s creation constitutes a pragmatic interim strategy: by investing in domestic offensive and defensive cyber capabilities, the United States can maintain strategic freedom of action while technological advances and normative developments in attribution mature. They caution that prematurely entering a treaty could constrain U.S. responses, citing risks of treaty overbreadth—mandating responses to trivial incidents—and underbreadth—omitting actionable threats—thus potentially impeding both national security and global cyber-infrastructure stability. Leaven and Dodge further analogize the U.S. decision to Britain’s delayed adoption of the Eurodollar, suggesting that abstention allows for observation of treaty imperfections and refinement before commitment. The article concludes that, given the unique complexity and anonymity of cyber-enabled conflict, national capacity-building via USCYBERCOM and parallel efforts to advance attribution technologies and modular, adaptable treaty architectures offer a more effective pathway than immediate treaty ratification. They call for future research into the integration of technical attribution systems into legal frameworks and the design of flexible international instruments capable of evolving with cyberspace dynamics.",

        "abstractNote": "States have embraced cyber operations as integral components of both peacetime coercion and armed conflict, yet international law remains unsettled about when hostile activities in cyberspace amount to acts of war or permissible countermeasures. This ambiguity undermines policymakers’ ability to deter adversaries, risking unintended escalation or impunity for malicious state-sponsored cyber campaigns. Dr. Lotrionte’s article addresses this critical gap by asking how existing international legal norms governing the use of force and state responsibility apply to state-sponsored hostile cyber operations that fall below the level of armed conflict. Through a doctrinal international law methodology, she reviews treaties such as the UN Charter, state practice, official speeches, and authoritative interpretations including the Tallinn Manual 2.0 and the International Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility. The article systematically examines the definitions of war and armed conflict, the applicability of jus ad bellum principles to cyber operations, and the legal thresholds for self-defense, countermeasures, necessity, and proportionality in the cyber domain. It finds broad consensus among states that existing rules apply to cyber operations, yet significant disagreement persists over key issues: the definition of an armed attack in cyberspace, the scope and lawfulness of cyber countermeasures, and the conditions under which necessity or sovereignty defenses justify responses. State practice and expert opinions diverge on whether countermeasures may involve limited uses of force, the requirement of prior notification, and the role of reversibility. These findings underscore a normative gray zone that revisionist states exploit to shift international rules in their favor. The contribution of this work lies in its comprehensive mapping of legal consequences for hostile cyber activity short of war and its articulation of a conceptual framework that links specific categories of cyber operations to corresponding legal responses under existing international norms. By clarifying the elements of a wrongful act, the requirements for lawful countermeasures, and the defenses of necessity and self-defense, the article provides practitioners and policymakers with a structured analysis for assessing state behavior in cyberspace. The author acknowledges limitations arising from the evolving nature of customary practice, the absence of binding cyber-specific treaties, and the article’s focus on state-attributable operations to the exclusion of independent non-state actors. She also notes the challenge of interpreting principles drafted for traditional kinetic conflict in the context of rapid technological change. For future research, the article calls for detailed case studies of state practice to solidify customary norms, comparative analyses of sovereignty and jurisdictional claims in cyberspace, empirical assessments of deterrence effectiveness, and the development of cyber-specific legal instruments or confidence-building measures to reduce strategic ambiguity and strengthen norm compliance.",

        "abstractNote": "The rapid proliferation of malicious cyber activities has outpaced the development of a coherent legal framework, creating a critical need to assess how international law regulates state and non-state conduct in cyberspace and to identify gaps that leave governments, enterprises, and critical infrastructure vulnerable. This research aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the legal regulation of cyberspace, examining the applicability of existing public international law, including State responsibility and international humanitarian law, to various categories of malicious cyber acts such as cyber terrorism, cyber vandalism, and cyber warfare. It addresses the question of how traditional legal concepts can be adapted or supplemented to govern a man-made domain that transcends national boundaries and produces real-world effects. Employing a doctrinal and conceptual methodology, the authors analyze treaties, conventions, customary rules, and scholarly literature, drawing on sources such as the 1907 Hague Regulations, the Geneva Conventions with Protocols, the Tallinn Manual 2.0, and the ILC Draft Articles on State Responsibility. They also incorporate an interdisciplinary perspective by referencing technical definitions and the architecture of cyberspace to inform legal analysis. The study finds that current legal constructs—particularly those concerning attributability, sovereign control, and the civilian–combatant distinction—are ill-suited to the fluid and decentralized nature of cyber operations. Attribution mechanisms based on territoriality or effective control prove inadequate when attacks originate from distributed networks and private actors, creating challenges for both detection and redress. The authors also demonstrate that national regulation alone cannot address cyberspace regulation effectively due to sovereignty limitations, suggesting instead that a coordinated combination of international, regional, and domestic measures, supported by technical experts, is necessary. As a contribution, the paper delineates a foundational framework that integrates existing legal norms with tailored rules for cyberspace, proposes research agendas on cybersecurity in outer space, and highlights the need for multi-actor governance models that include private sector and non-governmental expertise. Limitations of the analysis include its primarily theoretical orientation and the absence of empirical enforcement data, underscoring uncertainties about how proposed norms would operate in practice. The authors recommend future research to develop specific legal regimes for cyber operations in aviation and space, to refine criteria for attributability and state responsibility, and to explore mechanisms for multi-stakeholder rule-making that can adapt dynamically to evolving technologies and threats.",

        "abstractNote": "The rise of cyberspace as a contested operational domain has exposed the limitations of existing international legal frameworks in preventing and managing military escalation, underscoring the urgency of clarifying norms and confidence-building measures to mitigate risks of armed conflict in this borderless environment. This essay addresses the contested applicability of public international law—including jus ad bellum and the law of armed conflict—to cyber operations, investigates why states have been reticent to negotiate binding treaties governing military cyber activities, and explores how norm development and confidence-building measures (CBMs) can bridge the gap between technical challenges and legal obligations. Drawing on a normative legal analysis of United Nations Group of Governmental Experts (UN GGE) reports, the Tallinn Manual, state submissions, and scholarly discourse, the author formulates the research question: under what conditions can international legal norms and CBMs effectively reduce military escalation in cyberspace? Through a structured, policy-oriented review that outlines key characteristics of cyberspace—such as attribution difficulties, low barriers to entry for diverse actors, erosion of power asymmetries, and the technical sophistication spectrum from unsophisticated hacks to advanced persistent threats—the essay methodically examines the technical and legal dimensions of offensive and defensive operations. The analysis reveals that while states agree in principle that existing law applies to cyber conflict, the scope of its application remains highly contested, attribution challenges persist at the endpoint level, and current UN GGE deliberations focus disproportionately on critical infrastructure protection and crime cooperation rather than armed conflict. Moreover, CBMs have largely targeted law enforcement cooperation against organized cyber-crime, leaving military applications inadequately addressed. The author finds that the stagnation of norm discussions at the UN level, coupled with divergent state interpretations of what constitutes a use of force or armed attack in cyberspace, undermines the harmonization needed for deterrence and crisis stability. In response, the paper contributes an integrative framework for assessing norm viability by identifying three essential conditions: first, political will among major powers to define thresholds for the use of force; second, technical alliances to improve shared attribution capabilities; and third, institutionalized CBMs tailored to military actors, such as incident-notification protocols and joint exercises. These proposals aim to facilitate dialogue and confidence, thereby reducing incentives for escalation. Acknowledging its scope limitation to norms surrounding armed attack and use of force, the essay cautions that further empirical validation is required and that evolving technology may outpace normative development. The author suggests future research directions including comparative case studies of state practice in cyber incidents, empirical assessment of CBM efficacy, and the negotiation of supplemental protocols or treaty mechanisms to codify agreed thresholds and responsibilities. By connecting legal analysis with technical constraints and strategic imperatives, this work advances the policy debate on establishing robust, actionable norms to govern state behavior in the cyber domain.",

        "abstractNote": "States are increasingly employing non-state actors as proxies to project power in cyberspace, a trend that has heightened geopolitical tensions and raised significant questions about attribution and accountability under international law. Despite the prevalence of such state-sponsored cyber activities, existing international policy frameworks and landmark documents, including the 2013 and 2015 United Nations Group of Governmental Experts (UNGGE) reports, reference the prohibition of proxy-driven cyber operations without offering clear definitions or guidance, complicating efforts by policymakers and legal practitioners to assess state responsibility and ethical parameters. Motivated by this definitional gap and the risk that ambiguous terminology poses for norms development and the enforcement of due diligence obligations, this article seeks to clarify what constitutes a cyber proxy, determine the thresholds at which a non-state actor’s activities entail state responsibility, and provide a structured framework to inform both scholarly inquiry and practical decision making. Employing a qualitative, conceptual methodology grounded in legal analysis and informed by the counterterrorism literature on state–agent relationships, the author systematically reviews historical usages of proxies from classical texts to contemporary ICT-enabled operations and analyzes the logical distinctions embedded in international legal standards such as state responsibility and obligations under jus ad bellum. Key data sources include the UNGGE consensus reports, speeches by senior government legal advisors, and documented instances of cyber proxy operations across regions, from East Asia to Eastern Europe. The analysis identifies a spectrum of proxy relationships defined by varying levels of state direction, support, and plausible deniability, revealing that states often navigate a continuum from loose tacit backing to full operational control. These findings underscore that existing international law, though broadly applicable to state-sponsored cyber acts, lacks granularity in addressing the nuanced detachment levels that proxy usage entails, thereby impeding consistent norm enforcement. The article’s primary contribution is a two-fold conceptual framework: first, a typology of proxy definitions that distinguishes proxies from allies and mercenaries based on criteria such as agency authorization and functional autonomy; second, an analytical model that aligns degrees of state complicity with corresponding legal responsibilities and due diligence expectations. This framework offers a roadmap for political decision-makers to assess the legality of state-proxy interactions and for researchers to pursue case-based evaluations. The author acknowledges limitations in the absence of empirical measurement of proxy behavior and the evolving nature of ICT tools, which may shift the spectrum of interaction beyond current conceptual boundaries. For future research, the article proposes comparative case studies of documented proxy incidents to test and refine the framework, exploration of translation challenges in non-English legal texts affecting norm diffusion, and development of quantitative indicators to assess state control levels, thereby enhancing predictive capacity for international policy and legal scholarship.",

        "abstractNote": "States today face a persistent threat from cyber operations that fall below the armed attack threshold but nonetheless inflict significant harm, creating a legal and strategic dilemma as traditional self-defense measures are ill-suited to address such ‘‘below the threshold’’ intrusions. Michael N. Schmitt’s study arises from this problem, arguing that countermeasures under the law of state responsibility offer a tailored and lawful response option that bridges the gap between ineffective retorsion and overly provocative use of force. The research aims to clarify when and how states may employ cyber countermeasures in response to internationally wrongful cyber acts, asking what legal conditions, requirements, and restrictions govern their use. Employing a doctrinal legal methodology, the article draws on sources including the UN Charter, ICJ jurisprudence, the Articles on State Responsibility, the Tallinn Manual, and illustrative state practice involving cyber intrusions by China, North Korea, and non-state actors such as the Syrian Electronic Army. The analysis in Part II identifies the conditions precedent for countermeasures: a prior wrongful breach of an international obligation and attribution of the act to a state. Part III dissects requirements of purpose, temporality, proportionality, evidentiary standards, and the permissible scope, illustrating that countermeasures must aim to induce compliance, be proportionate to the breach, and avoid affecting third-party rights. The study finds that countermeasures provide a viable, non-forceful option to address harmful cyber activities while limiting escalation, yet they are constrained by strict attribution rules, an inability to be undertaken by private actors or collectively on behalf of another state, and a prohibition on forceful measures. These findings reveal both the promise and the limitations of countermeasures: though they expand states’ response toolkit and reinforce norms against unwarranted cyber force, they leave gaps when dealing with non-state actors or operations straddling the force threshold. The principal contribution is a comprehensive framework that adapts the law of countermeasures to cyberspace, clarifying legal standards and illustrating their operation with concrete examples. Acknowledged limitations include unresolved ambiguity over the armed attack versus use of force distinction in cyber contexts and restricted applicability when attribution to a state is unclear. Schmitt suggests future research should further develop rules of engagement and procedural guidelines for state responses, address the challenge of collective countermeasures, and refine legal thresholds for cyber uses of force. By doing so, policymakers and legal scholars can build on this work to enhance international stability and strengthen norms governing state behavior in cyberspace.",

        "abstractNote": "Jennifer Maddocks’s article “Outsourcing of Governmental Functions in Contemporary Conflict: Rethinking the Issue of Attribution” examines the evolving legal framework for attributing the acts of private military, security, and cyber actors to sponsoring states under international law, with particular focus on the International Law Commission’s Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARSIWA). Against the background of increased privatization and outsourcing across military and cyber domains—including private military and security companies (PMSCs) and private cyber operators—the article interrogates the criteria for when outsourced functions, traditionally exercised by states, give rise to state responsibility. Drawing on ARSIWA Article 5 and the associated commentary, Maddocks delineates the core elements of governmental authority, differentiating inherently public functions (such as offensive combat and law enforcement) from ancillary support roles. She then applies the \"private person\" test and broader contextual factors—such as location of operations, systematic or recurrent excesses of authority, and the identity of beneficiaries—to ascertain when private actor behavior constitutes an exercise of state power. The study further explores the legal empowerment requirement under ARSIWA Article 8, articulating that any form of positive authorization—whether by statute, regulation, contract, or other legal instrument—is sufficient to render private acts attributable to the state, even in the absence of explicit oversight or control. Maddocks demonstrates how states might seek to evade responsibility by employing proxies or cyber contractors, yet underscores that under a broad interpretation of ARSIWA, including the nonbinding but influential Tallinn Manual 2.0 scenarios for cyber operations (e.g., defense of government computer networks, offensive cyber operations, and cyber support to military campaigns), such conduct remains attributable when fulfilling government functions. Through case examples—ranging from contractor abuses at Abu Ghraib to the North Korean–linked WannaCry ransomware attack—the article illustrates the practical stakes of attribution in closing accountability gaps and deterring illegitimate outsourcing of coercive activities. Maddocks ultimately argues for a more inclusive approach to attribution that aligns with the inherently public character of problematic functions and deters states from outsourcing responsibilities to avoid liability. She acknowledges the limitations of a purely doctrinal methodology and calls for empirical research into state practice regarding cyber proxies, as well as clearer benchmarks for assessing effective state control and supervision in outsourced arrangements. Her analysis contributes to cyber law and policy discourse by clarifying how existing international legal principles can be applied to emerging challenges in cyber conflict, ensuring that states cannot evade responsibility for harmful actions undertaken on their behalf by private actors.",

        "abstractNote": "The essay addresses the growing problem of how states exploit ambiguity in international law to conduct cyber operations that fall short of overt armed conflict yet yield significant strategic benefits, illustrating the issue with Russia’s hacks of the U.S. Democratic National Committee and its covert involvement in Ukraine. It explains that these so-called grey zone activities exploit poorly demarcated or disputed legal norms—such as state sovereignty, prohibited intervention, jus ad bellum, and jus in bello—to avoid clear attribution and to frustrate proportionate responses, thereby gaining an asymmetric advantage over rule-of-law states. Motivated by the need to demystify these ambiguities and to encourage legal clarity, the author aims to identify critical grey zones in the international law of cyberspace and to propose means for states to narrow them, framing the key research question as how international law can be applied or interpreted more precisely to reduce strategic exploitation. Relying on a doctrinal methodology, the essay synthesizes the expert opinions of two multinational groups responsible for the Tallinn Manual and Tallinn Manual 2.0, examines state practice including United Nations Group of Governmental Experts reports, and analyzes legal texts such as the U.N. Charter, Articles on State Responsibility, and Geneva Conventions. The findings reveal persistent disagreements among experts over thresholds for determining what constitutes a cyber attack—whether disabling digital infrastructure requires physical damage or mere functional impairment—and whether data itself qualifies as a protected object, as well as uncertainty surrounding the concepts of sovereignty, intervention, use of force, and lawful countermeasures. These divergences underscore the need for interpretive consensus and more granular state practice. The essay’s contribution lies in cataloguing these grey zones, highlighting how legal uncertainty invites escalation, undermines deterrence, and incentivizes asymmetric lawfare, and proposing that states should clarify norms through expressions of opinio juris and transparent practice, thereby strengthening stability and deterrence in cyberspace. Acknowledging its limitations as a primarily normative analysis based on nonpublic state practice and expert opinion rather than empirical field data, the author concedes that the evolving nature of cyber operations and classified responses complicate norm crystallization. For future research, the author suggests systematic collection of state declarations and legal justifications for cyber operations, deeper examination of subsequent practice under the Vienna Convention’s interpretive rules, and further exploration of multilateral and bilateral mechanisms to clarify contested legal thresholds and develop new customary norms.",

        "abstractNote": "States face a growing challenge in addressing state-sponsored cyber attacks that target critical infrastructure yet elude attribution, undermining confidence and incentivizing further aggression. The proliferation of sophisticated espionage campaigns like Axiom, which infiltrated tens of thousands of computers globally and focused on economic and political targets, highlights the urgency of a binding international instrument that limits destructive cyber operations. Recognizing that any effective cyber treaty must overcome the persistent attribution problem, this study examines how established verification measures from nuclear arms control could adapt to a cyber context. It aims to identify viable verification techniques, determine their applicability to cyber weapons, and propose a comprehensive regime capable of building interstate confidence while preserving states’ intelligence capabilities. Employing a comparative legal and policy analysis, the author canvasses a broad range of nuclear treaties—focusing on national technical means, on-site inspections, data exchanges, consultative bodies, and “whoops” clauses—and evaluates their parallels in cyberspace. Drawing on examples of intrusion detection, network monitoring, session reconstruction, log inspection, and traffic analysis, the study finds that these cyber investigations can mirror the functions of national technical means and on-site verification in nuclear accords. Limited exchanges of technical data about the most destructive cyber weapons—particularly those targeting industrial control environments and critical infrastructure—could foster transparency without neutralizing a state’s entire cyber arsenal. In addition, confidential treaty bodies akin to the SALT Standing Consultative Committee could clarify ambiguities, resolve disputes privately, and maintain classified negotiations free from public pressures. A carefully drafted “whoops” clause would accommodate inadvertent malware spread—exemplified by Stuxnet’s unintended global dispersion—by exempting minor breaches from triggering treaty withdrawal. The paper’s principal contribution is the design of an integrated verification framework that combines network monitoring, cyber forensics, selective data sharing, classified consultative mechanisms, and a calibrated fault-tolerance clause. This model addresses key deterrence dynamics by leveraging the threat of reciprocal cyber retaliation to reinforce compliance. The analysis acknowledges limitations inherent in translating traditional arms control measures to digital domains, including states’ reluctance to divulge sensitive weapon characteristics, the rapid evolution of malware, and the absence of a uniform attribution standard. It also notes political hurdles in securing commitments amidst mutual distrust. The author suggests that further research should refine the technical specifications for data exchange protocols, explore the legal parameters of cyber treaty obligations under jus ad bellum and jus in bello, and assess the operational viability of confidential consultative committees. Expanding empirical studies on state behavior and cyber deterrence dynamics will be essential to tailor verification provisions to the unique challenges posed by cyberspace.",

        "abstractNote": "The rapid evolution of cyberspace as a domain of state and nonstate activity has outpaced existing mechanisms for promoting transparency and preventing unintended escalation, creating significant risk of misperception and miscalculation among international actors. Confidence-building measures, long used in politico-military contexts to reduce risks of armed conflict, must be adapted to the complexity of cyber interactions, where hostile actions often occur below the threshold of armed conflict yet cumulatively threaten national security. This report addresses the urgent need to reconceptualize confidence-building for cyberspace by proposing a multistakeholder approach that integrates states, international organizations, and independent security researchers. Grounded in the recognition that traditional top-down legal and political instruments alone cannot foster the stability required, the study aims to identify practical, implementable measures that build mutual trust, enhance transparency, and reduce the likelihood of inadvertent escalation. It asks how new regimes can be designed to engage diverse actors, establish clear rules of behavior, and embed disputed cyber activities within recognized legal and policy frameworks. Employing a qualitative policy analysis methodology, the authors draw on insights from a NATO-sponsored workshop that convened experts from government, academia, industry, and civil society, supplemented by a review of existing confidence-building constructs and best community practices in cyberspace. This approach illuminates both enduring principles from traditional CBMs and the novel demands of cyberspace governance. The study finds that effective cyber CBMs must encompass four complementary regimes: a platform for politically protected activities by independent researchers, community-based best practices, multilateral attribution and adjudication mechanisms, and state-supported engagement processes. Key operational components include criteria for platform membership, rules of behavior co-developed with states and organizations, and avenues for participating entities to influence international legal and policy dialogues. These measures promise to expand transparency, foster cooperation, and create buffers against unintended escalation by lowering the cost of participation and incentivizing the formation of new aligned organizations. The report contributes a conceptual framework that shifts the CBM paradigm from state-centric exchanges of data to a dynamic, bottom-up architecture that leverages multi- and bi-lateral support to embed norms of behavior in cyber operations. By outlining feasibility conditions—namely sufficient organizational willingness to join and state readiness to provide recognition and protection—it offers pragmatic guidelines for implementation. The authors acknowledge limitations, including uncertainty over the number and readiness of qualified organizations, potential reluctance of states to grant political protection, and the nascent nature of multistakeholder governance in cyber policy. They call for empirical research to map existing independent security groups, pilot programs to test platform mechanisms, and comparative studies of state responses to shared CBM initiatives. Future work should evaluate the impact of these measures on incident reporting rates, misperception mitigation, and the evolution of international cyber norms, thereby refining the proposed framework and enhancing global cyber stability.",

        "abstractNote": "This article by Christopher Whyte investigates how states integrate cyber operations into influence campaigns, conceptualized as cyber-enabled influence operations (CEIO). Utilizing the novel Counter-Society Influence Operations (CSIO) dataset, which codes over 200 episodes of interference between 2000 and 2020, the author disaggregates distinct forms of cyber activity that underpin influence operations and evaluates their effects on campaign success, attribution risk, and alignment with domestic political factions. Quantitative analysis reveals that most CEIO episodes rely heavily on low-intensity preparatory intrusions—such as reconnaissance, malware infections, and botnet formation—that typically cease within three months of campaign onset. These restrained cyber actions serve to seed influence networks and evade detection, reshaping understandings of how cyber operations function in influence warfare. Conversely, severe cyber interventions such as denial-of-service attacks, data corruption, and website defacements are rare and counterproductive. Whyte finds a clear negative correlation between escalatory cyber activity and influence campaign success, alongside a positive association with attribution to belligerent actors and greater congruence with fringe domestic factions. This counterintuitive dynamic, termed the  subversion aversion paradox,  emerges when belligerent states, facing diminished prospects for covert subversion, resort to performative, high-visibility cyber measures that harden societal divisions and secure future operational advantages. Drawing on subversion theory, the article argues that visible cyber interference can legitimize extremist victim narratives and entrench  othering  effects, thereby creating longer-term windows for manipulation. The research contributes two principal insights to the study of cyber conflict and international relations: first, it highlights the predominance of low-intensity preparatory cyber actions in CEIO, challenging prevailing scholarship that emphasizes direct cyber attacks for influence generation; second, it conceptualizes the subversion aversion paradox by linking domestic political contexts to strategic shifts in cyber deployment. The author acknowledges limitations, including reliance on publicly available attribution data and the inability of statistical associations to establish causal process tracing. He calls for in-depth case studies of underexplored CEIO episodes—such as those involving the Belarusian Cyber Partisans, Brexit-era UK elections, and Chinese or Iranian operations—to validate and refine the paradox and dissect decision-making pathways from covert intrusion to overt cyber escalation. Future research should also pursue comparative analyses across diverse geopolitical contexts to elucidate how regimes navigate trade-offs between operational stealth and performative signaling in digital-age influence warfare.",
