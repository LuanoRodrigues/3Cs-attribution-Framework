# Systematic Review of frameworks_and_models: Frameworks, Models, Evidence, and Methods

## Abstract
<!-- section-id: abstract -->
This systematic review evaluates frameworks, models, methods, and evidence patterns in frameworks_and_models. The protocol used 2 reviewer(s), explicit eligibility criteria, staged screening/coding, and PRISMA flow tracking. Records identified: 42; screened: 0; included: 0.

## Introduction
<!-- section-id: introduction -->
This paper addresses methodological and substantive variation in the selected corpus, with emphasis on evidence standards and model operationalization.

## Methods: Protocol and Registration
<!-- section-id: methods_protocol -->
Protocol version: 1. Protocol locked: no. Checklist framework: PRISMA 2020.

## Methods: Eligibility Criteria
<!-- section-id: methods_eligibility -->
Inclusion criteria:
- Directly addresses at least one research question.
- Contains explicit framework/model/method details.
- Provides analyzable evidence.

Exclusion criteria:
- Out of scope for the research questions.
- No substantive evidence or methodological detail.
- Duplicate or insufficiently documented source.

## Methods: Information Sources and Search Strategy
<!-- section-id: methods_information_sources -->
Primary source was the Zotero-derived corpus 'frameworks_and_models'. Data were drawn from OCR-parsed and coded dataset artifacts under /home/pantera/projects/TEIA/tmp/systematic_review.

## Methods: Selection Process and Inter-Rater Reliability
<!-- section-id: methods_selection_process -->
Reviewer count: 2. General IRR formula: IRR = Agreeing Ratings / Total Ratings. Two-rater IRR formula: IRR = (TA / (TR * R)) * 100. Agreeing ratings: 0. Total ratings: 0. General IRR: n/a.

## Methods: Data Collection Process
<!-- section-id: methods_data_collection -->
Data extraction and coding were run from structured batch payloads and direct-quote units, with evidence-unit level metadata preserved.

## Methods: Risk of Bias / Limitations in Evidence
<!-- section-id: methods_risk_of_bias -->
Risk considerations include attribution uncertainty, variable source quality, and possible reporting bias in underlying publications.

## Results: PRISMA Flow
<!-- section-id: results_prisma -->
Records identified: 42. Duplicates removed: 0. Records screened: 0. Records excluded: 0. Reports assessed for eligibility: 0. Studies included in review: 0.

## Results: Synthesis of Findings
<!-- section-id: results_synthesis -->
Coded items: 0. Evidence units: 0. Coding mode: open.

## Discussion
<!-- section-id: discussion -->
Findings indicate concentration in selected model families and uneven methodological depth across sources; unresolved conflicts should be adjudicated before final claims.

## Other Information (Funding, COI, Data Availability)
<!-- section-id: other_information -->
Funding and conflict of interest statements should be completed explicitly. Data and artifacts are available in the systematic_review run directory.
