      "title": "A chinese perspective on public cyber attribution",
      "abstract": "A Chinese Perspective on Public Cyber Attribution examines how public attribution of cyber incidents has transformed from a technical endeavor into a central tool of Sino-American geopolitical competition. The study first conceptualizes public attribution in Chinese terms by distinguishing su yuan (technical source tracing) from gui yin (political responsibility determination), then applies a qualitative, comparative approach to analyze divergences in attribution practices between China and the United States since 2013. Drawing on open-source policy documents, published reports by states and cybersecurity firms, media accounts, and academic analyses, the authors trace major attribution events including the Mandiant APT1 disclosure and subsequent US indictments of Chinese military officers. They find that the United States has progressively instrumentalized public attribution as a policy lever—leveraging government, private-sector, and media attributions to shape global perceptions, advance naming and shaming campaigns, and justify legal and diplomatic countermeasures. By contrast, China maintains a high evidentiary threshold for public accusations and generally abstains from reciprocal naming, citing concerns over politicization and procedural dislocation. The resulting asymmetry deepens strategic distrust, as Chinese policymakers view many non-governmental attributions as biased, commercially motivated, and occasionally unsound, while US actors perceive Beijing’s reticence as a lack of reciprocal accountability. The paper also highlights how media and private-sector attributions citing government sources can bind official policy responses to public narratives, constraining space for bilateral dialogue. To mitigate these dynamics, the authors propose four policy recommendations: (1) Both governments should reassess the strategic utility and unintended bilateral consequences of public attribution, prioritizing direct government-to-government communication over unilateral announcements. (2) When public attribution is necessary, it should adhere to mutually recognized evidentiary standards and allow a pre-publication cooling-off period for diplomatic consultation, thereby reducing politicization and strategic escalation. (3) Parties should work within the United Nations to establish a multilateral attribution regime—modeled on the IAEA—that would professionalize attribution processes, enhance legitimacy, and deter malicious state-sponsored cyber activity. (4) Regular high-level and track-two exchanges on attribution methodologies and legal frameworks could help bridge perceptional gaps and build shared norms. The study concludes by noting its reliance on publicly available sources and its focus on the China-US dyad, urging future research to expand comparative analysis to other great powers and empirically evaluate proposed multilateral regimes. Overall, the paper offers a novel conceptual framework integrating Chinese and Western attribution paradigms and practical pathways to reduce cyber tension through institutionalized cooperation."

      "title": "Adapting the current national defence doctrine to cyber domain",
      "abstract": "This study by Tuukkanen (2011) explores the strategic necessity and practical challenges of integrating cyberspace as an operational domain within Finland’s national defence doctrine, traditionally structured around land, sea, air, and space. Drawing on doctrinal analysis of existing Finnish defence legislation, policy documents, military field manuals, and international strategic reports, the author frames cyberspace as the emerging fifth domain, whose unique characteristics demand doctrinal adaptation, legal reform, and cross‐sectoral collaboration. The analysis begins by reviewing global and regional developments, including NATO’s recognition of cyberspace as an operational domain, the U.S. Department of Defense’s Cyber Strategy, and comparative frameworks from OECD and EU studies. The paper then articulates a set of bilateral US–Russia definitions for core cyber terms—cyberspace, cyber conflict, cyber war, and cyber defence—to establish a common conceptual foundation. Finland’s current defence doctrine—emphasizing sovereignty, readiness, and territoriality—is assessed for compatibility with cyber operations. While these tenets are conceptually transferable, significant gaps are identified in legal mandates, command structures, interagency coordination, and public–private partnerships essential for national cyber security. The absence of a cohesive national cyber security strategy emerges as the principal barrier to doctrinal elaboration, undermining clarity in the roles and authorities of military and civilian actors in cyber incident response. To address these deficiencies, Tuukkanen proposes a provisional Finnish Cyber Defence Doctrine structured around five core areas: (1) conceptualizing cyber war in alignment with broader national security objectives, (2) enhancing prevention through intelligence sharing, risk assessment, and evidence‐based policy development, (3) delineating wartime cyber operations by codifying legal authorities and escalation management protocols, (4) leveraging cyber capabilities in peacetime to support foreign policy and international cooperation, particularly within EU and NATO frameworks, and (5) defining the domestic role of the Finnish Defence Forces in critical infrastructure protection and national resilience. The framework advocates enacting legislation that grants explicit cyber defence mandates to armed forces and civilian agencies, establishing agile command structures for rapid decision‐making, and fostering public–private partnerships for threat intelligence exchange and vulnerability management. The study also highlights the need for interoperable sensor networks and automated monitoring systems to achieve real‐time situational awareness and tailored readiness levels across cyber actors. Acknowledging limitations due to reliance on public documents without empirical operational testing, the author calls for further research on technological evolution, industrial base support for cyber capabilities, and specialized personnel training. The paper concludes that, once Finland’s national cyber security strategy is finalized, detailed doctrinal work should focus on evaluating the effectiveness of proposed legal and organizational reforms, exploring the military’s role in cyber research and procurement, and establishing robust education and exercise programs to cultivate a deep bench of cyber defence expertise."

      "title": "Autonomous cyber capabilities under international law",
      "abstract": "This article examines the constitutional and statutory frameworks governing the use of cyber weapons by the United States and proposes a comprehensive legislative blueprint to enhance democratic oversight, delineate executive and congressional responsibilities, and mitigate the risk of inadvertent escalation in future cyber conflicts. It opens with an analysis of classic Supreme Court decisions—Bas v. Tingy, Little v. Barreme, and Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co.—that define Congress’s exclusive authority to initiate hostilities, the President’s tactical command once hostilities are underway, and the requirement that executive action remain within congressional authorization. The authors trace the evolution of congressional war-powers legislation, from the early republic’s statutes to the Vietnam-era War Powers Resolution, highlighting persistent ambiguities about the President’s unilateral authority to employ military force short of formal war and the challenges posed by cyber operations that may be rapid, opaque, and globally distributed. Through doctrinal and historical methodology, including case-law review, analysis of the War Powers Resolution and the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative, executive directives, and correspondence between congressional committees and the Director of National Intelligence, the article identifies gaps in the current governance regime. Key findings reveal that the executive branch’s predominant role in cyber preparedness, combined with congressional under-engagement, has led to secrecy, turf battles, and blurred lines of authority that increase the likelihood of misperception, legal overreach, and uncontrolled escalation. To address these deficits, the authors articulate seventeen detailed recommendations: (1) requiring presidential written findings, in advance if practicable or within 48 hours post-operation, to justify significant cyber operations; (2) mandating immediate reporting of any significant offensive or defensive cyber use to designated congressional committees; (3) prohibiting classification or secrecy from withholding critical information; (4) delivering reports to full committees rather than select members; (5) banning automated offensive cyber responses in favor of human-directed decisions; (6) creating interagency structures to coordinate private-sector assistance and prevent risky commercial counterattacks; (7) reviewing and amending privacy and surveillance statutes to balance civil liberties with security needs; (8) appointing privacy and civil-liberties officers within the National Security Council’s cybersecurity directorate; (9) promoting public disclosure of cyber-warfare policies to enhance deterrence and public debate; and (10) forbidding outsourcing of cyber-weapon operations to private contractors, ensuring accountability by trained government personnel. The article acknowledges challenges in defining “significant use” and anticipating classified program contours, warns of potential enforcement difficulties, executive resistance, and judicial review, and calls for further research on interbranch consultation mechanisms and comparative legislative models among allies. By situating cyber conflict governance within the broader constitutional war-powers discourse and offering concrete legislative prescriptions, the study contributes a multidisciplinary perspective on bridging cyber policy, international law, and constitutional authority in the digital age."

      "title": "Coercion in Cyberspace - Taking Stock of the Debate",
      "abstract": "In “Coercion in Cyberspace – Taking Stock of the Debate,” Mohamed S. Helal offers a comprehensive analysis of how States define and apply the principle of non-intervention in the digital domain, focusing on the contested concept of coercion. Drawing on national and regional position papers submitted to the UN Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) and the Group of Governmental Experts (GGE), Helal maps the varied definitions and thresholds of coercion that States invoke when assessing whether cyber operations constitute unlawful intervention. He begins by situating the prohibition on intervention within its customary and conventional foundations, as reflected in judicial decisions such as Nicaragua v. United States, regional instruments like the Organization of American States Charter, and UN General Assembly declarations (e.g., the 1970 Friendly Relations Declaration). Building on this groundwork, Helal surveys State practice in cyberspace, highlighting how information and communication technologies have been deployed both as instruments of armed force and as tools of non-forcible interference—ranging from disinformation campaigns and election meddling to industrial espionage and ransomware attacks.\n\nA central contribution of the article is its identification of divergent State positions on the threshold of coercion—the degree of harm or threat necessary to trigger the prohibition on intervention. Some States adopt a restrictive view, equating coercion with operations that cause physical damage or loss of life; others emphasize functional harms, such as significant disruptions to critical infrastructure or manipulation of political processes. Helal critiques these varied thresholds as tentative proposals for developing customary international law, rather than authoritative restatements of settled norms. He argues that the historical evolution of the non-intervention principle, from the drafters of the 1933 Montevideo Convention through mid-20th-century UN debates, reflects a consistent analogy between non-forcible intervention and armed coercion. Through this lens, the prohibition on intervention and the ban on the threat or use of force form a “pack” of complementary rules designed to safeguard both the territorial integrity and political independence of States.\n\nHelal’s novel proposal is the adoption of a “unified threshold of coercion” that would apply to all forms of intervention—forcible and non-forcible alike. This unified threshold, he contends, better aligns with the original policy purpose of non-intervention, which is to prevent any statecraft instrument that yields pressure comparable to military force. Such a threshold would bring coherence to distinctions between economic, political, and cyber coercion, acknowledging that non-forcible acts (e.g., economic sanctions, diplomatic pressure, cyber-enabled disinformation) can inflict harms equal to or greater than kinetic attacks. While emphasizing that the prohibition on intervention remains broader than the ban on the use of force—encompassing any intrusion on a State’s autonomous sphere—Helal situates the latter as a lex specialis within this larger lex generalis. By tracing the interrelated evolution of these norms and synthesizing State opinio juris, he provides a conceptual foundation for future treaty negotiations and interpretive guidance. In conclusion, Helal calls for further research and sustained State practice to refine the definition and operationalize the threshold of coercion in cyberspace, thereby advancing a coherent framework for governing cyber conflict under international law."

      "title": "Countering cyberattacks: gaps in international law and prospects for overcoming them",
      "abstract": "This article by Rahman and Das provides a comprehensive doctrinal analysis of the international legal frameworks regulating state conduct in cyberspace, identifies critical gaps that hinder effective countermeasures, and proposes a novel tiered framework for legitimate state cyber countermeasures. The authors pursue three core research questions: how cyberattacks and cyber warfare are classified under international law and national legislations; what legal frameworks and methods states and international institutions employ to counter cyber threats; and how international law and institutions might evolve to meet dynamic digital challenges. Employing formal, comparative, inductive, deductive, and forecasting methodologies, the study systematically examines international conventions, national statutes, judicial precedents, and doctrinal sources—including the UN Charter, Tallinn Manual, bilateral agreements, and leading scholarly works—to map the existing countermeasure regime. The analysis begins by unpacking the attribution conundrum in cyberspace, exploring the challenges of ascribing responsibility to state and non-state actors given anonymity, transnational infrastructures, and sophisticated obfuscation tactics. It highlights the accountability dilemma and the absence of standardized verification measures for cyber weapons. Next, the authors examine the principle of due diligence as a benchmark for state conduct, clarifying obligations to prevent malicious cyber operations originating within a state’s territory. They then assess the calibration of proportionality in cyber countermeasures, probing how traditional proportionality tests translate into the cyber context amid asymmetric capabilities and diffuse collateral harms. The study identifies obstacles to global collaboration—divergent national practices and the lack of binding norms—and scrutinizes the legal boundaries of anticipatory self-defence in cyberspace. The interplay between cyber countermeasures and human rights is addressed, emphasizing potential infringements on privacy, freedom of expression, and infrastructure protections in both peacetime and armed conflict. Through a critical survey of existing instruments, the article outlines urgent issues: the need for clear thresholds and use-of-force criteria, codification of cyber weapons definitions, and development of disarmament or limitation mechanisms for offensive cyber capabilities. In response, Rahman and Das propose a progressive, tiered countermeasure framework grounded in due diligence, lawful decision-making procedures, and proportionality calibrated to the severity of harm. They recommend multilateral norm-building processes, integration of human rights safeguards into cybersecurity regimes, and institutional innovations—such as an international convention or dedicated agency—to translate emerging cyber norms into binding rules. Acknowledging limitations posed by the rapid evolution of cyber operations and uneven state practice, the authors call for empirical validation of their model instruments, operationalized disarmament protocols, refinement of attribution technologies within legal thresholds, and enhanced state cooperation. This multidisciplinary approach advances both theoretical and practical underpinnings of cyber law, offering a roadmap to strengthen coherence and effectiveness of state responses to cyberattacks in an increasingly contested digital environment."
