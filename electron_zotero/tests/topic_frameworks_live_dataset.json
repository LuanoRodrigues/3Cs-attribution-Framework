      "title": "A Framework for Thinking About Cyber  Conflict and Cyber Deterrence with Possible  Declaratory Policies for These Domains",
      "abstract": "This workshop chapter, drawn from the National Academies’ proceedings on deterring cyberattacks, sets out how states can shape adversary behaviour in cyberspace through calibrated policy, not just technology. It treats deterrence as one tool within a wider defence posture that spans pre-attack, during-attack, and post-attack actions. Before an attack, governments can raise costs and lower expected payoffs by hardening networks, distributing and masking facilities, adding redundancy, and using deception. During an attack, the focus shifts to damage limitation and the civic equivalent of civil defence: public warning, local protective actions, and selective disconnection of services where feasible. After an attack, rapid reconstitution and learning are prioritised to close observed gaps. The analysis distinguishes state adversaries, which can marshal resources, target intelligence, and campaign discipline, from sub-state actors and proxies whose fluid structures and low costs present persistent pressure below clear thresholds. Because attribution is often delayed, the author argues for policy instruments that do not rely solely on immediate blame assignment. A set of policy declarations sketches decision rights and obligations, including conflict-termination procedures to help control escalation and a claimed right for states to assure themselves that others are not preparing cyberattacks. That assurance begins at home: early warning indicators will often sit inside national networks, raising privacy and legitimacy questions that require clear process and oversight. The chapter frames response options across deterrence by denial and deterrence by punishment. Denial rests on resilience engineering and disciplined operations; punishment requires credible signalling, legal authority, and alliance support. Options include sanctions, law-enforcement action, public attribution, and proportionate cyber or non-cyber responses with reversible effects. The piece stresses the role of rules of engagement and command-and-control to ensure that restraint, once chosen, survives contact with operational pressures. Because most critical services are privately owned, public–private coordination is a constant: information-sharing, exercises, and incentives that internalise security externalities are presented as necessary complements to national doctrine. Internationally, incident hotlines, shared terminology, and confidence-building measures can lower misperception risk and set expectations on civilian targeting. The chapter closes by noting three open problems for policy and research: measuring deterrent effect in a noisy environment; handling ideologically motivated actors and criminal proxies that do not weigh costs in standard ways; and governing privacy-sensitive monitoring needed for early warning. The core claim is clear: effective cyber deterrence emerges from a joined-up strategy that couples resilience with tailored cost-imposition, backed by clear political guidance and communicable thresholds for action."

      "title": "Act and actor attribution in cyberspace: a proposed analytic framework",
      "abstract": "In “Act and Actor Attribution in Cyberspace: A Proposed Analytic Framework,” Mejia identifies attribution—determining who is responsible for a hostile cyber act (actor attribution) and assessing the severity of that act (act attribution)—as the essential first step for states responding to cyber hostility. He contrasts the clear state-on-state aggression of Pearl Harbor with ambiguous 21st-century cyberattacks on U.S. banks to illustrate how uncertainty in either dimension impedes coherent policy, legal, or military responses. Drawing on the UN Charter’s Articles 2(4) and 51 and customary interpretations of Additional Protocol I’s Article 52(2), Mejia reviews how traditional jus ad bellum and jus in bello principles of distinction, necessity, and proportionality apply in cyberspace despite challenges posed by dual-use infrastructure and “knock-on” effects. He explains that cyber infrastructure and prepositioned malicious code are dual-use objects that may qualify as military objectives if they effectively contribute to hostile operations and offers a two-part test—legitimate military objective and definite military advantage—to determine targetability. The author emphasizes that while technical indicators (e.g., IP tracing, malware signatures) are necessary for attribution, they are insufficient without legal expertise to interpret evidence and frame appropriate state responses under international law. Mejia then proposes a structured analytic framework that integrates legal, policy, and strategic considerations into a diagnostic tool: it delineates processes for assessing act severity (from espionage to armed attack), establishes attribution confidence thresholds, and maps response options—diplomatic, law enforcement, intelligence, or military—to combinations of severity and attribution confidence. By clarifying which agency should lead and what type of response (economic sanctions, prosecutions, counterstrikes) is legally justified, the framework promotes consistent decision making and reinforces deterrence by signaling clear consequences tied to act severity. Recognizing limitations—subjectivity inherent in attribution judgments, evolving customary international law, and sophisticated techniques adversaries use to mask identities—Mejia calls for closer integration of legal experts and technical practitioners, investment in advanced forensic capabilities, refinement of severity thresholds in multistate contexts, and empirical validation through war-gaming and crisis simulations. He argues that improving attribution accuracy and structuring responses through his analytic framework will strengthen deterrence, uphold the rule of law in cyberspace, and guide policymakers and military planners toward proportionate and lawful responses to cyber aggression."

      "title": "Deconstructing cyber attribution: a proposed framework and lexicon",
      "abstract": "In “Deconstructing Cyber Attribution: A Proposed Framework and Lexicon,” Andrew Grotto addresses the fragmented and contested terrain of cyber attribution in international security by proposing a clear, two-dimensional framework and shared terminology to inform scholarly debate and policy development. The article distinguishes between analytic attribution—falsifiable judgments about an attacker’s identity based on technical forensics and all-source intelligence—and strategic attribution—decisions about how and to whom analytic findings are disclosed. Grotto further subdivides strategic attribution into private, selective, and public modes, each guided by differing political, economic, and operational incentives. Analytic attribution rests on evidentiary standards calibrated to the action it enables, from informal community norms for threat-actor labeling to “beyond reasonable doubt” for criminal indictments. Strategic attribution choices, in contrast, align with actors’ goals: private attribution limits dissemination, selective attribution informs chosen third parties such as incident responders or allies, and public attribution signals intent to domestic and international audiences, potentially supporting deterrence or punitive measures.\n\nThrough a series of fictional vignettes involving hypothetical states (Americious, Ukaria, Rosaria), a victim corporation (Acme Widget), and a security vendor (CyberDefenders), Grotto illustrates how diverse actors navigate data sources, evidentiary thresholds, and disclosure strategies. Example scenarios show an intelligence service’s classified analytic findings used strategically in diplomatic and legal actions; a corporation’s calculus over cooperating with law enforcement and pursuing civil lawsuits; and a private firm’s marketing and risk-management considerations when naming a criminal syndicate publicly. These examples reveal how victim consent over incident data can enable or constrain third-party attribution and how each mode of disclosure carries distinct costs and benefits—from legal requirements and market repercussions to reprisals by adversaries.\n\nGrotto emphasizes that strategic attribution need not be public to be effective: selective signaling can achieve credible deterrence among target audiences without broad disclosure. He underscores the absence of uniform international evidentiary standards for cyber attributions and highlights how the claimant’s reputation and geopolitical context shape persuasiveness. The framework clarifies why public attributions involve layered actions—criminal indictments, sanctions, civil suits, technical alerts—each bound by different evidentiary norms, and why private or selective disclosure may sometimes better serve policy objectives.\n\nThe article concludes that a richer conceptual vocabulary empowers policymakers, practitioners, and scholars to align attribution strategies with desired outcomes, from improved defensive collaboration to calibrated deterrence. Grotto calls for empirical research into selective attribution practices, consensus building on evidentiary standards under international law, and greater understanding of how victim preferences influence the broader attribution ecosystem. By parsing attribution into analytic and strategic dimensions, Grotto’s framework provides a practical reference for designing more coherent, effective attribution policies in cyberspace."

      "title": "Bridging the Gap: Strengthening Canada's Legal Framework Against Cyber Espionage",
      "abstract": "This paper critically examines Canada’s legal framework to confront the escalating threat of cyber espionage, situating its analysis within a comparative study of Canadian and United States law and international legal norms. In its introductory sections, the author articulates the definition, objectives, and principal actors in cyber espionage—drawing upon judicial definitions such as Qu v Canada and scholarly conceptions by Herb Lin and Russell Buchan—to distinguish espionage from cyber warfare. The paper then maps the international legal landscape, surveying pertinent treaties and customary norms that shape states’ authority to respond to covert cyber intrusions. It transitions to a comprehensive review of Canada’s domestic statutes, including the CSIS Act, the Security of Information Act, and the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, as well as landmark Federal Court decisions like China Mobile Communications Group Co Ltd v Canada and Yihdego v Canada, to evaluate current enforcement capabilities. Parallel examination of the U.S. cybersecurity framework and the Economic Espionage Act reveals divergent approaches, underscoring gaps in Canada’s capacity for prosecution and deterrence. Building on this comparative analysis, the author argues that Canada requires a multi-tiered legislative overhaul: adoption of clearer statutory definitions, establishment of a centralized cyber espionage incident database, ratification of targeted bilateral and multilateral treaties, and integration of mandatory cyber security protocols for critical infrastructure. The recommendations emphasize enhanced international cooperation, streamlined domestic procedures for evidence sharing, and calibrated penalties that reflect the severity of state-sponsored espionage. Concluding with a call for holistic legal innovation, the paper contributes to the discourse on state responsibility in cyberspace and offers a roadmap for strengthening national security through legal reform."

      "title": "Attribution and knowledge creation assemblages in cybersecurity politics",
      "abstract": "This article investigates the centrality of attribution in cybersecurity politics by reframing it as a contingent, politically charged knowledge creation process rather than a purely technical exercise. Drawing on a post-positivist, critical security studies perspective and assemblage theory, the authors propose that attribution judgments—public declarations about who is responsible for cyber intrusions—emerge through dynamic, heterogeneous “knowledge creation assemblages” that coalesce technical data, organizational practices, and pre-existing political narratives. Through qualitative document analysis of publicly available technical reports, government statements, and secondary literature on the 2014–15 Office of Personnel Management (OPM) intrusions, the study traces the phased evolution of attribution across incident creation, incident response, and public attribution. In the incident creation phase, initial uncertainties about compromise paths are funneled through established network forensic practices and threat actor profiles, privileging actor-centric methods that rely on known adversary signatures. During the incident response phase, private cybersecurity firms and public agencies entangle, jointly interpreting telemetry and intelligence feeds; their shared assumptions about likely perpetrators reinforce dominant narratives and channel analytic focus toward familiar state rivals. In the public attribution phase, governmental statements and commercial threat reports converge to stabilize a “truth” that is then disseminated and contested within scholarly and international policy communities. The authors identify three interrelated lenses through which these assemblages operate: (1) assumptions about threat actors, which privilege existing enemy images and occlude novel or non-state actors; (2) the entanglement of public and private knowledge producers, who mutually reinforce analytic frameworks and politico-economic interests; and (3) variable practices of self-reflection and uncertainty management, which determine how much ambiguity is acknowledged or suppressed at each stage. Applying these lenses to the OPM case reveals that reliance on established threat profiles produced feedback loops—between proprietary telemetry and official analytics—that entrenched attributions to strategic state rivals; meanwhile, discrepancies between private-sector reports and academic analyses hinted at alternative actors and unresolved uncertainties. The study contributes to cybersecurity politics by demonstrating that attribution verdicts are neither objective nor neutral but are temporarily stabilized through networks of co-functioning human, technical, and institutional elements. The authors call for greater transparency and reflexivity in attribution assemblages, advocating for the inclusion of independent academic data collectors and alternative forensic artefacts to diversify threat images and challenge prevailing knowledge structures. This intervention seeks to open the attribution discourse to alternative perspectives, thereby informing more nuanced cyber policy and lawmaking in international security."

      "title": "A chinese perspective on public cyber attribution",
      "abstract": "A Chinese Perspective on Public Cyber Attribution examines how public attribution of cyber incidents has transformed from a technical endeavor into a central tool of Sino-American geopolitical competition. The study first conceptualizes public attribution in Chinese terms by distinguishing su yuan (technical source tracing) from gui yin (political responsibility determination), then applies a qualitative, comparative approach to analyze divergences in attribution practices between China and the United States since 2013. Drawing on open-source policy documents, published reports by states and cybersecurity firms, media accounts, and academic analyses, the authors trace major attribution events including the Mandiant APT1 disclosure and subsequent US indictments of Chinese military officers. They find that the United States has progressively instrumentalized public attribution as a policy lever—leveraging government, private-sector, and media attributions to shape global perceptions, advance naming and shaming campaigns, and justify legal and diplomatic countermeasures. By contrast, China maintains a high evidentiary threshold for public accusations and generally abstains from reciprocal naming, citing concerns over politicization and procedural dislocation. The resulting asymmetry deepens strategic distrust, as Chinese policymakers view many non-governmental attributions as biased, commercially motivated, and occasionally unsound, while US actors perceive Beijing’s reticence as a lack of reciprocal accountability. The paper also highlights how media and private-sector attributions citing government sources can bind official policy responses to public narratives, constraining space for bilateral dialogue. To mitigate these dynamics, the authors propose four policy recommendations: (1) Both governments should reassess the strategic utility and unintended bilateral consequences of public attribution, prioritizing direct government-to-government communication over unilateral announcements. (2) When public attribution is necessary, it should adhere to mutually recognized evidentiary standards and allow a pre-publication cooling-off period for diplomatic consultation, thereby reducing politicization and strategic escalation. (3) Parties should work within the United Nations to establish a multilateral attribution regime—modeled on the IAEA—that would professionalize attribution processes, enhance legitimacy, and deter malicious state-sponsored cyber activity. (4) Regular high-level and track-two exchanges on attribution methodologies and legal frameworks could help bridge perceptional gaps and build shared norms. The study concludes by noting its reliance on publicly available sources and its focus on the China-US dyad, urging future research to expand comparative analysis to other great powers and empirically evaluate proposed multilateral regimes. Overall, the paper offers a novel conceptual framework integrating Chinese and Western attribution paradigms and practical pathways to reduce cyber tension through institutionalized cooperation."

      "title": "The Organization of the United States Government and Private Sector for Achieving Cyber Deterrence",
      "abstract": "In this draft post-workshop paper, Paul Rosenzweig examines the persistent organizational deficits within the United States government and private sector that hinder effective cyber deterrence policy formulation and implementation. Drawing on a revealing case study of the ad hoc takedown of a CIA–Saudi “honeypot” website by military cyber units, Rosenzweig illustrates how critical decisions are often made without coherent structures or comprehensive policy considerations, producing collateral consequences and missed strategic opportunities. He argues that the U.S. approach has been characterized by episodic, reactive efforts—most notably Presidential Decision Directive 63 (1998) and subsequent commissions—that have failed to establish sustained leadership, clear authority, and integrated expertise across national security, cybersecurity, policy, and law. Furthermore, civilian and military cyber defense and resilience initiatives remain fragmented, with defensive “denial” measures receiving more attention than coordinated offensive “punishment” capabilities or non-cyber response options. To address these challenges, Rosenzweig proposes developing a systematic taxonomy of deterrence functions—cyber defense, cyber resilience, cyber systems assurance, cyber attack, and non-cyber response—each requiring tailored organizational mechanisms and strategic coordination. He reviews existing executive branch structures, legislative and judicial roles, and private sector involvement, identifying gaps in policy decision-making, implementation authority, and accountability. Highlighting the need for a centralized Cyber Advisory Corporation (CAC), Rosenzweig outlines its possible functions—information sharing, incident reporting, threat assessment, and intrusion detection—and stresses the importance of a robust governance charter, transparent oversight, and balanced public–private collaboration. He also underscores the underappreciated risks posed by COTS hardware and software, advocating expanded government review of foreign influence in supply chains and diversification strategies—akin to “herd immunity”—to mitigate systemic vulnerabilities. Concluding that form must follow function, Rosenzweig calls for coherent lines of authority, deliberate hierarchical structures to safeguard the inherently decentralized cyber domain, and meaningful public–private partnerships. Only through such integrated organizational reforms can the U.S. develop and implement stable, effective cyber deterrence policies capable of preserving the integrity and utility of cyberspace."

      "title": "When intelligence agencies publicly attribute offensive cyber operations: illustrative examples from the United States",
      "abstract": "This article investigates a novel attribution pathway in state-level cyber conflict: the public attribution of offensive cyber operations by national intelligence agencies. Traditionally, intelligence services operate covertly, framing attribution as a closed, behind-the-scenes process confined to policymakers and private cybersecurity firms, given the operational risks of revealing sources and methods. Yet recent U.S. episodes—the SolarWinds supply-chain compromise of 2020 and the Democratic National Committee breach of 2016—demonstrate that agencies such as the FBI, DNI, NSA, and CISA have assumed a public-facing attribution role, issuing formal statements that precede executive announcements. The study poses two central research questions: (1) Are intelligence agencies emerging as principal agents of public attribution in the cyber domain? and (2) What intrinsic features enable them to perform this function effectively? To answer these questions, the author triangulates a theoretical review of intelligence adaptation in the information age, a comparative survey of global public attribution practices, and qualitative case analyses. The article first contextualizes the evolving remit of intelligence agencies—steeped in decades-long covert traditions—within today’s data-intensive and AI-augmented operational environment. It then maps existing attribution channels, highlighting the underexplored option of agency-led public attribution. Empirical evidence shows that while several countries have sporadically leveraged their intelligence services to publicly attribute attacks, the United States leads in both frequency and systematicity. The subsequent analysis identifies three salient features that underpin the efficacy of intelligence-led public attribution: (1) the ability to calibrate disclosures beneath adversarial escalation thresholds, providing a nuanced deterrent signal; (2) the perception of apolitical professionalism and institutional credibility, which resonates across domestic and international audiences; and (3) robust partnerships with private cybersecurity firms and allied intelligence agencies, enabling comprehensive evidence synthesis and amplifying trust capital. Using the SolarWinds and DNC cases as illustrative studies, the article unpacks how interagency coordination, joint statements, and timing strategies shaped U.S. policy responses, strengthened electoral norms, and deterred further malicious activity. The findings illuminate a conceptual framework positioning intelligence agencies as complementary, not competing, actors alongside private entities and executive branches in the attribution ecosystem. The paper concludes by discussing policy implications for attribution strategies, potential risks of public disclosures, and directions for future research—namely, cross-national comparative studies, quantitative assessments of attribution impact on escalation dynamics, and the interplay between public attribution practices and evolving international cyber law norms."
