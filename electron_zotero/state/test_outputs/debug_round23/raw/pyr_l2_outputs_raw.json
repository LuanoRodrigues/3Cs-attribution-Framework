Assume that invoking 'threat', 'stability', 'resilience', 'responsibility', 'due process', 'best practice', or 'norms' are not neutral descriptions but techniques of ordering. Security language is a bid for exceptional authority; standards/compliance language is a bid to normalise ongoing governance.\n\nYour output must follow two stages:\n\nStage 1. Descriptive synthesis (theme mapping).\n- Write several paragraphs that describe, in neutral terms, what the authors in this theme are talking about. Identify what problems they emphasise in relation to \"0: How are cyber attribution frameworks and models used?\", which actors they repeatedly mention, and which solutions they gesture toward. Do not yet judge or resolve disagreements; just surface the recurring storylines and tensions in the data.\n\nStage 2. Analytical framework.\n- After the descriptive synthesis, apply the following six-point framework. For each point, answer the guiding questions using synthesis across all payloads:\n\n1. Shared Framing:\n   - How do authors in this theme commonly define the core problem posed by \"0: How are cyber attribution frameworks and models used?\"?\n   - What is treated as obvious, urgent, or non-negotiable?\n   - How does that shared framing restrict which answers to \"0: How are cyber attribution frameworks and models used?\" are treated as      legitimate or even imaginable?\n\n2. Disagreement / Fault Lines:\n   - Where do authors within the theme diverge (law and due process, strategic necessity,      ethics/rights, economic or operational practicality, sovereignty, budget, markets)?\n   - What is politically or materially at stake in each disagreement?\n\n3. Actor Positioning:\n   - How are key actors (states, private firms, alliances, security services, regulators,      researchers, civil society, global South, etc.) portrayed?\n   - Who is granted agency and epistemic authority (the right to define truth and decide)?\n   - Who is depicted as needing management, discipline, integration, capacity building,      inclusion, protection, or surveillance?\n\n4. Governance Proposals:\n   - What governance models are advanced (centralised sovereign control, regulated      public–private partnership, multilateral coordination, supervised self-regulation,      punitive enforcement, etc.)?\n   - Do authors converge on one model or advance competing models?\n   - How does each model claim to solve or redefine the problem in \"0: How are cyber attribution frameworks and models used?\"?\n\n5. Legitimation Patterns:\n   - How do authors justify their preferred response to \"0: How are cyber attribution frameworks and models used?\"?\n   - Which justificatory grammars dominate (law and due process, technical inevitability,      market efficiency, moral obligation, systemic stability, deterrence, future      viability, resilience)?\n   - What worldview is being normalised as 'common sense'?\n\n6. Structural / Hierarchical Implications:\n   - Based on how the theme treats \"0: How are cyber attribution frameworks and models used?\", who ends up in charge of defining and      enforcing reality?\n   - Who ends up constrained, monitored, or governed?\n   - Whose interests are centred, and whose interests are instrumentalised or backgrounded?\n   - Does the theme reproduce existing hierarchies (e.g. privileging state security      bureaucracies or dominant vendors), or does it challenge them?\n\n<STRUCTURE / OUTPUT CONTRACT>\nINPUT (PARAGRAPHS(JSON))\n• Each item:\n    – paragraph_html (a single <p>…</p> with anchors already inserted)\n    – tags (semicolon-separated, may be empty)\n    – meta_json (JSON: rq, gold_theme, evidence_type, etc.)\n• paragraph_html may include <!-- coverage used=… unused=… -->.\n• Anchors already include href, data-key, title, and data-quote-id.\n\nEVIDENCE COVERAGE\n• Treat all paragraphs as in-scope evidence.\n• Engage each paragraph at least once; support reliance with its anchors.\n• Cluster claims by shared meaning inside the current TAG/RQ/Theme frame.\n• Note convergence, disagreement, and ambiguity.\n\nCITATION / ANCHOR RULES\n• Allowed anchor form (do not alter attributes):\n  <a href=\"KEY\" data-key=\"ITEM_KEY\" title=\"DIRECT_QUOTE_ID\" data-quote-id=\"DIRECT_QUOTE_ID\"></a>\n• Do not invent new href, data-key, title, or data-quote-id.\n• Reuse anchors exactly as they appear; never add text inside <a>…</a>.\n• No fabricated or paraphrased quotes.\n• APA-style references must remain outside anchors.\n• Do not duplicate a (data-key, data-quote-id) pair inside one sentence.\n\nTASK\n• Produce an integrated HTML synthesis organised by TAG within the RQ + Overarching Theme.\n• Merge overlapping claims while keeping distinct evidence and disagreements.\n• Support each analytic move with anchors from the input paragraphs.\n\nOUTPUT (raw HTML only — no Markdown, no lists)\n• Start with one heading that reflects the cross-section synthesis:\n  <h3 id=\"section-title\">[title that reflects the whole section]</h3>\n• Then write analytic <p>…</p> paragraphs that weave together claims and evidence\n  from multiple sections until all included material is covered.\n  – Use data-tags=\"t1;t2;…\" on each <p> when tags are inferable; choose 1–3 concise tags.\n  – Include at least one anchor, drawn from the input HTML, in every analytic paragraph.\n  – Aim for a total section length of at least 1,000 words, using as many analytic paragraphs as needed.\n  – You may create subsections with <h4>…</h4> where this improves structure; each subsection should reach\n    at least 500 words across its paragraphs.\n  Example:\n  <p id=\"p1\" data-tags=\"technical;thresholds\">Topic sentence. Evidence-led synthesis across sections … <a href=\"KEY\" data-key=\"ITEM_KEY\" title=\"DIRECT_QUOTE_ID\" data-quote-id=\"DIRECT_QUOTE_ID\"></a> <a href=\"KEY2\" data-key=\"ITEM_KEY_2\" title=\"DIRECT_QUOTE_ID_2\" data-quote-id=\"DIRECT_QUOTE_ID_2\"></a></p>\n• After thematic paragraphs, add a conclusive paragraph (2–3 sentences) with EXACT id:\n  <p id=\"conclusion\">Synthesis across paragraphs; state the strongest regularities, main disagreements, and implications and the overral response to the research question.</p>\n• If needed, append a residuals paragraph with EXACT id for marginal or outlier material:\n  <p id=\"residual\">Residual coverage: brief reason these items do not fit the main synthesis; still cite them with anchors.</p>\n• Finally append a coverage ledger comment over all SECTIONS(JSON):\n  <!-- coverage used=[comma-separated data-key values used at least once] unused=[comma-separated data-key values not used] -->\n\nQUALITY CHECK (apply before returning)\n• Every analytic paragraph has at least one anchor.\n• Each analytic paragraph normally cites at least three distinct sources (three different data-key values).\n• Each <p> includes data-tags with 1–3 informative tags where they can be inferred.\n• Each analytic paragraph is around 100–150 words with a topic sentence, evidence-led\n  development using anchors from multiple sections where possible, and a linking or closing sentence.\n• No invented keys: every data-key, title, and data-quote-id matches an anchor in the input section_html.\n• Exactly one <h3 id=\"section-title\">, one <p id=\"conclusion\">, and an optional <p id=\"residual\">.\n• The coverage ledger reflects actual usage: \"used\" lists all data-key values that appear in any output anchor;\n  \"unused\" = payload keys − used.\n<STRUCTURE / OUTPUT CONTRACT/>\n\nEXTRA CONTEXT (do not override structure):\nFocus on models and frameworks",
