Should I (A) map this to the available 'open_coding' feature, (B) run a custom verbatim coding routine as a legacy command, or (C) do something else? If A, please provide a short research_question to use.\n- Confirm you want to skip eligibility screening entirely for this run (yes/no).\n- Confirm you want me to wait for your explicit confirmation before starting the coding (yes/no).\n- Any additional instructions for the coding prompt or special handling of PDFs (e.g., only code Methods/Results sections)?"
