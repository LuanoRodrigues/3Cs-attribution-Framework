  "ai_abstract": "<p>This literature review synthesizes 7 coded studies from a focused corpus of 7 cyber-attribution framework sources.</p><p>The analysis identifies four recurring dimensions: evidence bases, attribution methods, evidentiary/legal thresholds, and response-oriented policy framing.</p><p>Across the corpus, frameworks converge on multi-source inference and uncertainty-aware reasoning, but diverge in threshold-setting, operational detail, and implementation constraints.</p><p>The review contributes a structured synthesis of design choices and limitations relevant to attribution confidence and decision support in state-level cyber incidents.</p>",
  "ai_introduction": "<p>Cyber attribution frameworks sit at the intersection of technical forensics, legal reasoning, and policy decision-making, yet these layers are often treated separately in practice.</p><p>Using a frozen corpus of 7 framework-focused sources, this review examines how existing models define evidence, express confidence, and connect attribution judgments to response options.</p><p>Rather than cataloging studies in isolation, the review synthesizes convergences, tensions, and unresolved design tradeoffs that shape operational attribution workflows.</p><p>The result is a comparative map of framework assumptions that can support methodological selection, interpretation of confidence claims, and future model refinement.</p>",
  "ai_conclusion": "<p>The corpus indicates broad agreement that cyber attribution cannot rely on a single evidence channel and instead requires layered reasoning across technical, contextual, and legal signals.</p><p>Frameworks are strongest when they articulate explicit evidentiary thresholds and uncertainty handling, but many remain under-specified on calibration and implementation governance.</p><p>For applied use, attribution models should be treated as decision-support systems with transparent assumptions, not deterministic truth engines.</p><p>Future work should prioritize benchmarkable validation protocols and clearer mappings from confidence levels to proportionate response pathways.</p>",
  "ai_limitations": "<p>This review is limited by corpus size (7 sources), which constrains generalizability and increases sensitivity to influential individual texts.</p><p>Evidence extraction was based on existing coded outputs, so any upstream coding omissions or interpretation bias may propagate into synthesis.</p><p>Several sources provide strong conceptual framing but uneven implementation detail, limiting direct comparability of operational performance claims.</p><p>The review therefore supports structured interpretation and design guidance, but not definitive causal claims about framework effectiveness.</p>",
