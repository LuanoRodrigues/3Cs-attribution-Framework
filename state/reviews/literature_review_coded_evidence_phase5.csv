EV-0189,HYLZCIPX,A Framework for Making Effective Responses to Cyberattacks,2018,frameworks,method,5,attribution_challenges|evidentiary_standards,0|1,"Is there evidence to support that a different state or non-state actor perpetrated the attack (other than the one assessed as most likely to have conducted the attack)? If so, how strong is this evidence?","Analysts should evaluate alternative attribution hypotheses and grade the strength of evidence supporting each hypothesis (RQ0, RQ1).","This directs analysts to seek and rate competing evidence streams, highlighting the need for evidentiary standards and comparison. It does not specify evidence types or scoring methods.",code_pdf_page,8839843fdc
EV-0190,HYLZCIPX,A Framework for Making Effective Responses to Cyberattacks,2018,frameworks,method,5,evidentiary_standards|decision_support,1|2,"If there is not enough evidence to make a high confidence attribution, will additional assessment provide the necessary evidence to increase the attribution confidence level? How much time do analysts estimate this will take?","Analysts should determine whether further analysis can raise attribution confidence and estimate required time to acquire that evidence (RQ1, RQ2).","This emphasizes temporal considerations and the tradeoff between timeliness and evidentiary sufficiency. It implies a methodological need for time-to-confidence estimates, which the text does not operationalize.",code_pdf_page,8839843fdc
EV-0191,HYLZCIPX,A Framework for Making Effective Responses to Cyberattacks,2018,frameworks,method,5,decision_support|deterrence_effectiveness|escalation_risk,1|2,How likely is the suspected adversary to conduct another cyberattack if the U.S. delays its response in order to increase its attribution confidence?,"Analysts must estimate the probability of a repeat attack during any attribution delay to weigh deterrence versus escalation risks (RQ1, RQ2).","This frames a specific probabilistic assessment required for decision-making, linking evidence-gathering delays to operational risk. The text does not prescribe how to estimate such likelihoods.",code_pdf_page,8839843fdc
EV-0192,HYLZCIPX,A Framework for Making Effective Responses to Cyberattacks,2018,frameworks,method,5,operationalization|decision_support,1|2,What is the scale of the cyberattack that the U.S. sustained? Does the scale support responding before high attribution confidence is obtained or does the scale suggest waiting until analysts have enough evidence to assess the perpetrator with high confidence?,"Analysts should evaluate attack scale and use that assessment to decide whether immediate response before high attribution confidence is justified (RQ1, RQ2).",This links an observable (attack scale) to a decision rule about timing of response—an explicit operationalization step. The guidance lacks quantitative thresholds for 'scale' or for when scale justifies pre-confidence response.,code_pdf_page,8839843fdc
EV-0193,HYLZCIPX,A Framework for Making Effective Responses to Cyberattacks,2018,frameworks,method,5,relationship|decision_support,1|2,What is the U.S.'s geo-political relationship with the state or non-state actor suspected of conducting the attack?,"Analysts should assess the geopolitical relationship with the suspected actor as an input to response decisions (RQ1, RQ2).",This recognizes relationship as a key model parameter affecting escalation/deterrence tradeoffs; it presumes analysts can classify relationships but does not give classification criteria.,code_pdf_page,8839843fdc
EV-0194,HYLZCIPX,A Framework for Making Effective Responses to Cyberattacks,2018,frameworks,recommendation,5,deterrence_effectiveness|escalation_risk,2|1,what type of response will be the most effective to deter the adversary from conducting additional cyberattacks without disproportionately risking escalation?,"Analysts should select responses that maximize deterrence effectiveness while minimizing disproportionate escalation risk, informed by relationship and perpetrator history (RQ2).",This is a normative decision criterion grounding the framework's objective: balancing deterrence and escalation risk. It does not provide an optimization method or metrics for 'effective' deterrence.,code_pdf_page,8839843fdc
EV-0195,HYLZCIPX,A Framework for Making Effective Responses to Cyberattacks,2018,frameworks,limitation,5,attribution_challenges,2,Answering the questions derived from the framework above will depend on the suspected perpetrator and the unique circumstances of each cyberattack.,"The ability to answer framework-derived attribution questions depends on who is suspected and the specific circumstances of each cyberattack, affecting how the framework is applied (RQ2).",This frames operationalization as conditional rather than one-size-fits-all; it implies the framework requires case-specific inputs. It limits generalizability and signals the need to encode perpetrator- and context-specific parameters when applying models.,code_pdf_page,8839843fdc
EV-0196,HYLZCIPX,A Framework for Making Effective Responses to Cyberattacks,2018,frameworks,method,5,attribution_challenges,1|2,"Obtaining answers will also involve coordination amongst multiple agencies and stakeholders, similar to the INSA TTX's finding to evaluate the procedures for incident response and recovery among all relevant stakeholders.","Effective attribution and answering framework questions requires coordination across multiple agencies and stakeholders, implying a multi-actor method component (RQ1,RQ2).",This identifies interagency coordination as an operational requirement for attribution workflows; it suggests methodologies must include processes for information sharing and procedural evaluation. It does not specify which coordination mechanisms or data-sharing standards to use.,code_pdf_page,8839843fdc
EV-0197,HYLZCIPX,A Framework for Making Effective Responses to Cyberattacks,2018,frameworks,limitation,4,attribution_challenges,1|2,"In addition, political dynamics will almost certainly complicate cyberattack responses , both internally and externally.","Political dynamics are likely to complicate cyberattack response and attribution efforts, creating operational and strategic constraints (RQ1,RQ2).","This flags political context as a non-technical constraint on attribution and response decisions, important for modeling escalation risk and evidence use. It is a high-level claim without empirical substantiation in this excerpt.",code_pdf_page,8839843fdc
EV-0198,HYLZCIPX,A Framework for Making Effective Responses to Cyberattacks,2018,frameworks,recommendation,5,attribution_challenges,1|2,"Thus, it would benefit USG policymakers and corporate decision makers to become familiar with the framework and practice answering the questions derived from it before an attack occurs.","Policymakers and corporate decision makers should familiarize themselves with the attribution framework and rehearse answering its questions prior to an attack to improve response (RQ1,RQ2).",This is a normative recommendation to institutionalize framework training and exercises; useful for operationalizing frameworks into decision-making routines. It does not specify training formats or evaluation metrics.,code_pdf_page,8839843fdc
EV-0199,HYLZCIPX,A Framework for Making Effective Responses to Cyberattacks,2018,frameworks,recommendation,5,confidence_language|attribution_challenges,1|2,"analysts should create cyberattack scenarios that vary the levels of attribution confidence/time, scale, and relationship.","Analysts are advised to design cyberattack scenarios that systematically vary attribution confidence/time, scale, and relational factors to test the framework's application (RQ1,RQ2).","This prescribes a concrete methodological exercise to operationalize framework variables (confidence, temporal aspects, scale, relationship). It directly informs methods for validating models and decision processes, though it omits scenario construction standards.",code_pdf_page,8839843fdc
EV-0200,HYLZCIPX,A Framework for Making Effective Responses to Cyberattacks,2018,frameworks,claim,4,attribution_challenges|confidence_language,1|2,Varying these factors will familiarize decision makers with how to balance the competing risks of insufficient deterrence and the potential for escalation.,"Varying scenario factors trains decision makers to balance trade-offs between insufficient deterrence and escalation risk when responding to attacks, informing operational decision rules (RQ1,RQ2).","This links scenario-based exercises to decision quality under trade-offs (deterrence vs escalation), highlighting the need for analytic outputs that support trade-off analysis. It presumes exercises translate to improved real-world judgment without evidence here.",code_pdf_page,8839843fdc
EV-0201,HYLZCIPX,A Framework for Making Effective Responses to Cyberattacks,2018,frameworks,recommendation,4,attribution_challenges,1|2,Presenting these scenarios to policymakers and corporate decision makers before a cyberattack occurs will foster a more thorough analysis,"Delivering scenario exercises to policymakers and corporate leaders pre-incident promotes more thorough pre-attack analysis of response risks and options (RQ1,RQ2).",This supports embedding scenario briefings into preparedness activities to improve analytic rigor in attribution-informed decision-making. It is a procedural recommendation but lacks metrics to evaluate 'more thorough.',code_pdf_page,8839843fdc
